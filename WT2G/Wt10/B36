McGee and Yoemin Yoon	</p>	<p>	This article reviews some recent antidumping and countervailing	duty investigations that involved various segments of the computer	industry.  Part I provides an overview of	the antidumping laws.  Part II discusses administration of the	antidumping laws.  Part III reviews recent antidumping investigations	involving segments of the computer industry.  Part IV points out some	of the harmful effect of the antidumping laws.  Part V presents	some philosophical issues.  Part VI offers conclusions and	recommendations. The authors conclude that the antidumping laws	violate property and contract rights, are harmful to the computer	industry in particular and to trade in general, and should be	repealed, the sooner the better.	</p><p>	<b>Trade Policy in the Computer Industry</b>	</p>		<p>	<li><a href="Computer-Trade-Policy.html">HTML</a> Format, 132 Kb		file, 37 pages of text plus 15 pages of footnotes.	</p>		<p>	<li>Adobe <a href="Computer-Trade-Policy.pdf">Acrobat</a> Format,	 228 Kb file, 37 pages of text plus 15 pages of footnotes.	 </p></ul><hr><p><li><a name="KJP"><b>A Discussion of Protectionist Trade Policies in	the USA, Japan, and Korea</b></p><ul>	<p>	by Robert W. McGee and Yoemin Yoon	</p>		<p>		Hardly a day goes by that the national press does not have at	least one article about trade relations with Japan.  The articles	generally take a somber tone, and discuss things like trade	imbalances, protectionism, Japanese unwillingness to compromise, and	the possibility that the United States (or Japan) might retaliate for	something the Japanese (or United States) either did or failed	to do. Japan has accused the United States of reneging on its	pledge to lower tariffs on electronics and other goods, and has	threatened to retaliate by narrowly targeting U.S. exports of	computer components  A U.S. trade official said that the U.S.	was targeting items that are made almost exclusively in Japan so that	other countries would not be adversely affected by the U.S.	policy.	</p>		<p>	<b>A Discussion of Protectionist Trade Policies in the USA, Japan,		and Korea</b>	</p>		<p>	<li><a href="Korea-Japan-Protectionism.html">HTML</a> Format	</p>		<p>	<li>Adobe <a href="Korea-Japan-Protectionism.pdf">Acrobat</a> Format,	 81 Kb File (27 pages, including footnotes).	 </p></ul><hr><p><a name="WRB"><li><b>Who Really Benefits from Liability Litigation?</b></p><ul>	<p>	by Robert W. McGee	</p>		<p>	From the mounds of evidence that have accumulated over the past	few decades, it is clear that the plaintiff bar is the major	beneficiary of the present tort system -- as well as its creator. 	They benefit at the expense of the rest of us -- consumers as well as	producers.  The plaintiff bar has been able to accumulate the	best legislators that money can buy to hold back the floodgates	of reform. And they have the audacity to say that they are doing it	to protect the little guy.  In fact, they are feathering their	own nests, and it is time that they stopped.  A fair system	would compensate victims for their wrongs without treating them	like lottery winners, and would not punish producers of goods	and services when they have done no wrong. It's time to restore	justice and fairness to the tort system in America.	</p>		<p>	<b>Who Really Benefits from Liability Litigation?</b>	</p>		<p>	<li><a href="Liability-Litigation.html">HTML</a> Format	</p>		<p>	<li>Adobe <a href="Liability-Litigation.pdf">Acrobat</a> Format,		33 K File (10 pages, including footnotes).	</p></ul><hr><p><li><a name="EC"><b>A Solution to the Education Crisis</b></a></p><ul>	<p>	by Robert W.

In the USA,	states provide a free public school education to students for	the first twelve years, and subsidize tuition at state universities	thereafter.  As a result, public education has become a near monopoly	because privately provided education finds it difficult to compete on	price.  Where private education exists, it can compete only because	of nonprice advantages.	</p>		<p>	Dr. McGee's essay points toward a solution for the crisis in	education in America.	</p>		<P>	<B>A Solution to the Education Crisis</B> 	in <A HREF="Education-Crisis.html"> HTML</A> Format	</P></ul><hr><p><LI> <A NAME="DUMP"><B>Antidumping Laws in the 21st Century</B></A></p><UL><P>This paper reviews the evolution of antidumping laws, the negative effects theyhave had on trade, and the recent changes in these laws that resulted from theUruguay Round.

In its broadest sense,the freedom of association also includes the right to transact or nottransact.  Basically stated, the freedom of association means that acts(including transactions) between consenting adults should be legal andunrestricted. But it means more than that, because such a right alsoincludes the possibility of not acting with adults who do not consent.</P><p>This essay explores the myth and the reality of this concept as implementedunder U.

This approach was givenadded credibility when the Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1990,which made the concept an official part of environmental regulatorypolicy.</P><P>by Robert W.

Free trade gives consumers more choices. It gives them lower prices.  It creates more jobs than it destroys.  It is apositive-sum game.  An underlying assumption of most utilitarian-based tradearguments is that governments have some inherent right to regulate trade.</P>	<P>This article looks at trade policy from a different perspective.</P><P>by Robert W.

Part I of this article explores thearguments that could be used to support the view that tax evasion is asin, or is unethical.   Part II presents arguments to support the positionthat there is nothing sinful or ethically wrong with tax evasion.  Thearticle concludes that the arguments offered to support the view thattax evasion is sinful or unethical do not hold up under analysis, andsuggests that it is the tax collectors who might be guilty of sin, sincethey participate in the taking of property without the owner's consent.</P><P>by Robert W.

Although numerousstudies have concluded that raising the minimum wage destroys jobs,politicians hesitate to speak out against an increase for fear of beinglabeled insensitive or “against the working man.”  The matter isfurther complicated by the fact that many polls reveal that a majorityof people are in favor of raising the minimum wage at any given time,so politicians who come out against an increase in the minimum wage areseen as going against the will of the majority.</P><P>by Robert W.

But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes moreconverts than reason.&quot; </CITE>  <DD><BR>  <DD>Unfortunately, sufficient time has still not passed to make the problemobvious enough to implement the solution. </DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>What is the solution?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>The solution is for production compensation to be based solely onthe market value of error-free production. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>What are the advantages to the individual?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>It restores to the individual control over their life and destinyby allowing them to have an income based solely on their ability, imagination,education, experience and drive. Not based on any external and nonrelevantfactors such as ethnic origin, mental or physical handicaps, race, religion,etc. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Are there other reasons this should be done, other than economic reasons?  <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Yes. It is the only moral and rational way to compensate people forproduction, whether it is for the creation of tangible products or intangibleproducts, (ideas or innovation).   <DD><BR>  <DD>Conversely, it is immoral in any time scale-and certainly irrationalin the long term if not the short term-to do otherwise. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>You seem to indicate that mental or physical handicaps are not relevant.How do you justify this?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Of course they are relevant to getting the job done in less time thansomeone without such handicaps, yet they may not be relevant to completionof an error-free task. Also, virtually any individual--and especially handicappedpeople-can learn and do many things that may not be apparent to the nonhandicappedperson.   <DD><BR>  <DL>    <DD>Further, innovation and true productivity depends on thinking,     <DD>and sometimes the simple thought is better. A clever way around    <DD>a physical handicap may in itself be a valuable product.   </DL>  <DD><BR>  <DD><BR>  <DD>Lastly, and perhaps more importantly, the self-esteem generated bybeing able to do something productive and to earn some money is the mostvaluable of all. </DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>But what of the individual who has no experience, such as someonejust leaving school?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>The concept provides a place for every individual to start based ontheir experience, and to have a job and to learn, and at least some income.It is a characteristic of human beings that when they have unrestrictedopportunities to learn and to do things, they will learn very rapidly.   <DD><BR>  <DD>When a person sees that their income is limited only by their educationand experience, it provides a powerful incentive to learn.   <DD><BR>  <DD>Further, it is in the interest of the company that each individuallearn as rapidly as possible and become as productive as possible, as thisis a prescription for the success of the company as well as the individual.In this system, the fate of individual and company are based on the sameconcept, something not realized in the old system of <I>Being There</I></DL>. <HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>It is obvious that with this concept the individual can earn moreper unit of time, but how does the company then benefit from the increasein productivity?   <DD><BR>  ,hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>The company benefits because the agreement with each individual providesfor the sharing between individual and company of the benefits of productivityincreases on a mutually profitable and agreed basis. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>But in reality, isn't it difficult to make big increases in productivityjust by working harder or faster?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Yes, this is very true. And this is where the concept of innovationbecomes the operative factor for both company and individual.   <DD><BR>  <DD>Without innovation there is nothing. There is no initial product,no process for creating the product or the service, and no product or processimprovements. </DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>What about differences in productivity for the same or similar tasks?Doesn't this represent a production scheduling and control problem?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>This problem already exists but is generally masked by productioncontrol and scheduling systems that cater to the slowest worker in the class.This makes the entire process less efficient.   <DD><BR>  <DD>What happens when individuals set their own pace is that it is intheir individual self-interest to coordinate their activities with peoplein their production &quot;chain.&quot; By doing this, they maximize theirown production and income. Further, each time they do this &quot;maximization&quot;they may create a process innovation with market value, either for themselvesor as part of a collaborative effort in which others share in the resultinginnovation royalty. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>You mentioned &quot;innovation royalty.&quot; How does this work?  <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>An innovation is in itself a product, and has a value in the marketplace. It is logical, rational and moral to pay the innovator based on thevalue of their innovation in the market place. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>How would this be handled?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>The innovator or innovators are paid a percentage of the amount savedor earned by the innovation. As an example, the royalty might be 5% of themarket value. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>But that could be a very large amount of money. Suppose the innovationsaved or earned &#163;2 million in a year. The innovator would then be paid&#163;100,000. Isn't that too much?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>A better suggestion might be that it is too little. It must be enoughto recover any costs to an innovator and leave them with enough left overto make them want to do it again.   <DD><BR>  <DD>For those who think it might be too much, if the payment was &#163;100,000and the company was left with &#163;1.9 million, that is a rather good returnon their investment. </DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Who determines the amount or percentage of an innovation royalty?  <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>It must be mutually agreed between the innovator(s) and the entitythat will use the innovation and earn money from it in the market place.  <DD><BR>  <DD>However, it must be remembered that the innovation is the propertyof the innovator(s). Just as it is immoral to use someone's car or othertangible property without their permission, so it is immoral to use theirintangible property without their permission.   <DD><BR>  <DD>It might appear to be rational in the short term to use innovationswithout the property of the owner, but in the long term it is both irrationaland immoral. Irrational because it either prevents people from innovating,or from disclosing their innovations. When this happens, both parties arelosers. With a proper system of innovation royalties, both parties are winners.</DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>You say that an innovation is the property of the individual who thoughtof it. What about the company for which the individual works?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>If there were a truly voluntary preservice agreement saying that innovationswere to be shared by individual and company this would be moral, but notvery rational for either party. It puts up a stumbling block to innovation,and it is better to leave it that the individual will disclose it firstto the company.   <DD><BR>  <DD>Common sense says that it would be better if individual and companyreached a mutually profitable agreement for the use of the innovation. Moralitysays that if they do not reach such an agreement, then the innovation remainsthe property of the innovator to do with as they wish, and that no one mayuse it without the express and explicit permission of the innovator.   <DD><BR>  <DD>Put yourself in either position and you will see that in the longterm this is the only situation that makes any sense. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>You used innovators in the plural sense. How do you handle the caseof multiple innovators for a single product?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>The innovators must agree among themselves as to the percentage dueto each. This is easily done by simply and arbitrarily setting a value forone part of the innovation. Such as 100. Then look at another part and sayits value is half, or 50. Another part might be 250. Add up the numbersand divide the total by the value for each innovator to arrive at theirpercentage figure.   <DD><BR>  <DD>This same concept can be used when there is a modification to theoriginal product and a new innovator or innovators must be compensated.</DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]<HR NOSHADE></CENTER><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>For how long must royalties be paid?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>This is up the innovator, but in principle they should be paid foras long as the innovation creates income in the market place.   <DD><BR>  <DD>It makes sense for both parties--innovator and company--that royaltiesshould continue for as long as the innovation earns money. From the standpointof the company, besides being moral, this insures the continued interestof the innovator in the earning power of the innovation.   <DD><BR>  <DD>It also provides the innovator with income which may allow the innovatorthe financial freedom to do what they apparently do best: Innovate.   <DD><BR>  <DD>If the company has treated the innovator well, then they have everyreason to expect the innovator will disclose new innovations to the company,offering them the right of first acceptance on new ideas. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>How long does the innovator own the innovation?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>In perpetuity. A thought, and the resulting idea and innovation alwaysbelongs to the thinker and innovator. The use of it may be &quot;licensed&quot;or allowed by the innovator, but ownership itself is perpetual and can neverbe transferred. The is inherent the universal and absolute definition ofprimary property. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>In this system people appear more like independent contractors ratherthan employees. Do you mean they don't receive a regular salary?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>No, they do not. They are paid according to what they produce, whichmeans their income would normally vary from period to period. By workingfaster and better (innovating) they can earn more and more money in thesame or less time. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>But what about job security?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>The present system of compensation based on Being There obscures thefact that--in reality and in the long term--the ability of each individualis the best job security.   <DD><BR>  <DD>However, strangely almost, this system offers a form a security thatthe old system does not offer. Let's suppose the individual has a problem,either short or long term. They do not produce as fast as &quot;average,&quot;or they are actually very slow. Yet when they finish the job it is finishedand there are no errors.   <DD><BR>  <DD>In principle, and certainly when the company is aware of this &quot;problem,&quot;they do not care how long it takes to do a job. Why? Because they pay onlyfor the market value of the job, which means their profit is assured atall times.   <DD><BR>  <DD>This factor explains why such a system is of great benefit to handicappedpeople, school leavers, and anyone without experience or above average abilities.</DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Before I ask you about handicapped people and school leavers, whatabout the problem of production control or production scheduling. Doesn'tthe disparity in working speeds create such a problem?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>We have already covered that above. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Okay, what about handicapped people, school leavers, and others withoutexperience? How does this system help them?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>As long as the company knows the production rate for various tasksand their associated products, individual rates become non-critical in theoverall picture. Each individual can work and learn at their own rate. Asthey do so, their productivity will generally increase. There is also thepossibility of doing other things, perhaps things--different tasks or jobs--forwhich they are better suited.   <DD><BR>  <DD>A company operating on this basis would lose nothing and have muchto gain by having people do whatever they are best at. There is no reasonwhy a person should not try new things. If it takes them many times theaverage time to do something the first time, the company does not lose,nor should the individual. Tackling a new job, a person might see a betterway to do it, then both are winners. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Can't companies exploit inexperienced or handicapped workers?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Companies do that now. However, in this system there would be lesschance of that. It is never exploitation to pay the person the market valueof a job. Any job that is worth doing, is worth determining the market valueof that job. And to pay someone less than value does no good for eitherparty, besides the fact it is immoral for the company to do such a thing.  <DD><BR>  <DD>As the usage of a system such as this proliferates, companies thatindulged in such behavior would receive a low &quot;credit rating&quot;in the market place, and customers and the &quot;super stars&quot; of productionor innovation would not want to deal with them. This is the moral marketin action.   <DD><BR>  <DD>On the other side, companies which treated inexperienced and handicappedpeople well would tend to attract the top producers and innovators who wouldfeel they have less hassle and greater chance of being treated well at sucha company. </DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Will such companies offer the usual health, education, pension andother benefits that old style companies offer?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>That would be up to the individual company, although as individualsregain control of their lives and destiny, they might want to expand thatto include handling such matters for themselves.   <DD><BR>  <DD>In reality, a person can devise and operate their own pension planand end up with considerably more money than companies normally offer inpension plans. This would be further augmented by the increased earningpower of individuals.   <DD><BR>  <DD>As an example, with an average performing investment even in today'schaotic market conditions, a person can end up with more than &#163;500,000in assets by investing as little as &#163;10 a week during a normal workinglife.   <DD><BR>  <DD>To attract top performers companies might create conditions favorableto the formation of investment clubs and insurance groups so that individualscould secure the best possible results in the market. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>What about holidays and vacations?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>This would be an individual thing between producer and company. Beingpaid based solely on error-free task completion, with advance notice andagreement there is no reason why an individual can not take off any timethey wish. Whether it is a matter of a few hours or months.   <DD><BR>  <DD>As individuals became more and more innovative--as would naturallyhappen--they would spend less and less time doing tangible, routine tasksand gain more control of their time. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Wouldn't such a compensation system mean that a person would not dosomething unless it was a defined task with a value attached to it?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Not really. Just as many people today do things today on speculationor risk, doing it as an investment in the future. Perhaps expecting theywill learn something from it, or by doing it they will be formally askedto do things for which they will be compensated. In fact, in this systemthere would probably be more of that because there would be more freedomto do such things, and more chance that by doing so the individual wouldderive benefit. </DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>How do you start such a compensation system?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>It is really no different than now, and would probably start basedon current compensation. This would be a natural starting, as there is infact some connection, however tenuous, between current compensation andits market value. Further, this relieves some of the trauma associated withgoing to compensation based on task completion. A person should receiveessentially the same compensation as before at a minimum, with the opportunityfor much more.   <DD><BR>  <DD>You can determine how long it would take a person with a certain amountof experience to do a task and how much such a person would normally earn.Then do the logical and pay them for errorfree completion of the task.   <DD><BR>  <DD>At the same time, also make an agreement as to how the results ofproductivity increases (other than by direct and obvious innovation) willbe shared. And, much more importantly, how innovation will be handled. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>You keep saying &quot;error-free&quot; task completion. What doesthis mean?   <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Just that. If an error is made the choice is either for the creatorto fix the error themselves, or to pay to have it done. Of course they mayalso do the task over again without the error. In this case, any wastedmaterials (unless the materials were provided by the producer) must be reimbursedalong with the cost of wasted services such as electricity, gas, use ofmachine tools, etc. which were for the account of the company. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Why this emphasis on errorfree task completion and the need for errorrectification and reimbursement of wasted materials and other resources?  <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>First, it is the only moral thing to do. Why should someone otherthan the errormaker pay for an error? Why should the company or fellow workerspay for it? Why should the consumer or customer pay for it?   <DD><BR>  <DD>Secondly, it gives individuals a proprietary interest in their workand their ability to do it correctly. It puts a premium on experience andability and--more importantly--is a basic method of learning. Volitionalbeings learn by making mistakes. As my teacher once said, &quot;Show mea person who has never made a mistake, and I will show you a person whohas never done anything.&quot;   <DD><BR>  <DD>The ideal thing of course is to do some advance thinking and not makea mistake, but this is often much easier to say than to do. However, themore a person does, the more mistakes they make, the more they learn, andthe more competent they become. </DL><HR><DL>  <DT><B>Question</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Would people then be responsible for their own training and education?  <DD><BR>  <hr>  <DT><B>Answer</B>   <DT><BR>  <DD>Yes. Who else should be? Who should have more of an interest in thesuccess of an individual than that individual?   <DD><BR>  <DD>This is not to say that companies should not or would not provideeducation and training. They could offer it is an incentive to associatewith that company, or offer it on a profit-making basis.   <DD><BR>  <DD>But when an individual's earning ability is directly related to anddependent only on their education, experience, imagination, ability, anddrive it is only natural that the individual would have a strong desirefor education. Self education. </DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE>&copy;1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation <BR><BR><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I> </CENTER><P><HR NOSHADE><B>Contact Information:</B><BR>E-Mail: administrator@Freedom-Server.co.uk<BR><HR>The URL of this page is: <BR><P><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Productivity.html&gt; <HRNOSHADE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

However, what interested me more was a comment in a storyon the event, saying that &quot;...it isn't clear whether such practiceswould be illegal, but publishers and booksellers say they are highly unethical.&quot;<BR><BR>I was wondering how unethical something must be in order to be &quot;highly&quot;unethical. More importantly, I was wondering if there are degrees of unethicalbehavior. Could it be said that something was 37% unethical? And, is this&quot;too unethical,&quot; or would it be okay if something were 49% unethical?That is still less than half, although I am not sure what it less than halfof. If you burned down 49% of your neighbor's house would you be considered&quot;49% unethical&quot;? Would Hitler be considered to be &quot;only,&quot;say, &quot;37.637% unethical&quot; because he was only responsible for thedeath of 50 million people, and his armies came into contact with some 60%more people than that? <BR><BR>According to the definitions I use, there are two cases only: 0% and 100%.Something is 100% ethical, or it is unethical. If is 0.0003% unethical,it is unethical. Such as if I destroy only one small tile on my neighbor'sroof. <BR><BR>Then there is the problem of which branch of ethics we are discussing. Ihave noticed that there seem to many different branches. I assume, althoughthe author did not clarify the matter, he was talking about &quot;publishingethics.&quot; Although he could have been talking about &quot;marketingethics, sales ethics, distribution ethics,&quot; etc. If you have read manyof my essays, you will know that there is only <B>one</B> definition ofethics, and that it applies to all volitional endeavors. <BR><BR>Finally, there as the mention of &quot;legality.&quot; Which means, didit conform all of the myriad of immoral decrees issued by one or more politicalstates based on coercion. As I have stated elsewhere, &quot;legality&quot;and morality are mutually exclusive concepts. <BR><BR>If you disagree with any of my statements, read some more essays and think.<BR><BR><HR><H4><A NAME="ABCD"></A>Clinton to brand tobacco a &quot;drug.&quot;</H4>According to a recent press article, someone named &quot;Clinton&quot; isproposing to &quot;brand&quot; tobacco as a &quot;drug.&quot; <BR><BR>Clinton, as an individual, can of course &quot;brand&quot; tobacco as anythinghe wishes, but since he is not--to my knowledge--a qualified physiologist,his opinion on this subject should be viewed with suspicion. As long ashe does not try to impose his ideas on anyone else, he has done nothingimmorgal. <BR><BR>However, in his function as the Ruler of the political entity known as &quot;UnitedStates of America,&quot; if he tries to impose his ideas on anyone elseusing his control of the police monopoly, then of course the action is immoral,resulting in property interference. I leave it to the reader to decide forthemselves how to name this act. <BR><BR>The use of tobacco has been demonstrated to be harmful to the human body,and thus irrational. It is not however immoral unless the act of using itis imposed by one individual on another. Then it is both irrational andimmoral, yet the decision of whether or not to use it must be a personal,freely-made decision by each individual. <BR><BR>In this case there appears to be another factor. For, as the article indicated,a major reason for this action and the proposed associated use of the policepowers of the political state to impose his personal decision on other individuals,is because he has been told--and apparently believes--that this will &quot;...sendhis popularity soaring.&quot; What this seems to mean is that it will buyvotes for him to continue as head of his local political r&eacute;gime.If this is true, then there is another factor which should be examined besideshis qualifications as a physiologist. <BR><BR>That is the nature of the transaction. What is being offered, and what isbeing purchased. The reason for this is that all interactions between volitionalbeings are property transaction. Some involve the exchange of intangibleproperty, others of tangible property. <BR><BR>Even helping a little old lady across the street is a property transaction.The person doing it provides--sells--the act of helping the lady safelyacross the street. In this case the seller voluntarily offers to providethe service, with the implication that the amount and type of payment--ifany--is a decision of the &quot;buyer.&quot; Most rational sellers wouldexpect no more payment than a verbal statement of &quot;thanks,&quot; andperhaps a smile. But this <B>is</B> in fact a payment, just as surely asif the lady had handed the person a $5 note. The former is an intangiblepayment, the latter a tangible one. It is the failure to recognize thisand understand what is happening--and why--that is a major part of the causeof our societal problems. <BR><BR>Now it becomes clear that there is a property transaction in The Ruler'saction. He &quot;offers&quot; an action--an offer that can not be refused--toclassify tobacco as a drug, with his payment to be votes to allow him tocontinue as head his local political r&eacute;gime. So that he does notjoin the ranks of the unemployed, and can continue to enjoy the &quot;perqs&quot;of his position of employment. When his subjects or victims perform suchan act &quot;privately,&quot; it has various descriptions that attract theattention of those operating the various police monopolies, often with undesirableeffects on such individuals. <BR><BR>However, Mr. Clinton should be congratulated on acknowledging that he, personally,is taking this action rather than ascribing it anonymously to &quot;Washington,&quot;&quot;the administration,&quot; &quot;the US,&quot; or other normal subterfugesused in politics to protect the guilty. He thus continues to ensure hisplace in history as a VIP--a <B>V</B>ery <B>I</B>nsignificant <B>P</B>erson.<BR><BR><HR><H4><A NAME="EFGH"></A>Is it too early to tell if Chirac is a &quot;statesman&quot;?</H4>According to a recent press article, Chirac, the Ruler of France, is nowthe envy of less competent people at ruling such as Mr. William Clintonwho--to endear himself to his subjects and appear to be a &quot;nice guy&quot;(a requirement for being a ruler in a &quot;democratic&quot; r&eacute;gime)--prefers to associate himself with the &quot;common people&quot; by havingeveryone call him just plain &quot;Bill.&quot; I somehow doubt that evenMr. Chirac's close associates call him &quot;Jack.,&quot; let alone lesserindividuals. I don't remember anyone referring to G&eacute;n&eacute;ralde Gaulle as &quot;Charlie.&quot; The fact that this is true already arguesfor his descension to the rank of &quot;statesman.&quot; <BR><BR>There should be no doubt that Chirac is certainly in a position to havethe supreme dishonor of having the negative accolade of &quot;statesman&quot;applied to him. He, like Louis XV, clearly believes that &quot;the state--that'sme.&quot; He does not appear to need--or even to want--the approval of TheRuling Family Council. Of &quot;advisors&quot; who might only confuse himwith their own ideas of how to interfere in the property of others. Notonly his own direct subjects, but even those of his fellow Rulers. He appearsto want to make it absolutely clear that he and he alone is clearly responsiblefor any and all immoral acts of the French politcal state thus staking animmediate claim to descension to the top negative importance levels in history.<BR><BR><HR><H4><A NAME="FGHI"></A>Judge strikes down Oregon's &quot;Assisted SuicideLaw&quot;</H4>A recent report says the Federal Judge Michael Hogan has struck down the&quot;Assisted Suicide Law&quot; of the political entity known as &quot;Oregon.&quot;An action such as this would not normally be remarkable. What distinguishesthis action is the associated comment that &quot;Certain fundamental rightsmay not be dispensed with by a majority vote.&quot; Such as statement, inassociation with the action is mind-numbing. There are so many thoughtscreated that it is hard to sort them out. <BR><BR>One idea is that I thought I distinctly remembered that the United Stateswas based on the concept that the &quot;majority&quot; of the &quot;people&quot;made the political laws. That one reason why the United States was establishedwas to avoid the situation of one individual making an arbitrary decisionthat effection the lives of all subjects of the particular r&eacute;gime.The fact that Judge Hogan said it violated a part of the U. S. Constitutionis of no significance, since the &quot;people,&quot; the majority he dismissedwith a whim, are the ultimate law of the land. <BR><BR>Another thought is the Judge's ignorance of the concept of funamental rights.One of which is the sanctity of property and the sovereign right of eachvolitional being to make their own decisions regarding the conduct of theirlife as long as it does not involve interference in the property of another.I realize that the U. S. Constitution itself does this, but following theconstitution rather than what is moral is no different than a Goreing orHimmler following Hitler. <BR><BR>Yet it is still the tragi-comedy of Judge Hogan dispensing with the willor the majority--a concept that established the mechanism within which heworks--that is the most outrageous. It bears out the statement of GeorgeOrwell, when he said &quot;Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictorybeliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them.&quot;<BR><BR>What Judge Hogan has said is that &quot;...now that you have set up thesystem, I will run at as I please. You have now lost total control of themechanism and it is <B>me</B> who is the supreme one around here, not you.&quot;This is no different than Louis XIV saying, &quot;The state--that's me.&quot;Many people worry about a future in which we build computers who will thenturn around and become out master, and have no more need for human beings.With a system that permits--and even encourages--actions such as that ofJudge Hogan. <BR><BR>This again illustrates why political judges rate a -10 on a scale of ten,being even more dangerous and insignificant in history than are Chief'sof State. KIng George III would be green with envy, as he would not haveimagined such political power. Even Ghengis Khan, for different reasons,would also be green with envy. With the stroke of a pen the lives of millionsof people are decided. What would he do with his unemployed &quot;hordes&quot;?<BR><BR><HR><H4><A NAME="LUT"></A>Boredom rules among Luton's rebel youth</H4>During July Luton experienced nights of rioting, with youths battling police.Their complaints apparently having to do with the fact they have no jobs,and the political state is not listening to them, aware of their needs,and doing nothing about it. <BR><BR>Children spoke of their frustration, say &quot;There's nothing for us todo here.&quot; A 40 year old father of five said, &quot;This is one of theworst places you would want to live.&quot; <BR><BR>Sadly, and as most people who read the newspapers know, this situation isnot restricted to any one country, but is a pervasive factor in many societies.The fact that the cause should be obvious, and the solution simple has notbeen recognized. Anyone who looks rationally at history and understandshuman nature should be able to come up with the cause and solution. Yet,at the same time, I know that once this information is presented, almosteveryone will say &quot;No, that's too simple. That can't be it.&quot; Nevertheless,it is worth a try... <BR><BR>The problem is attributable to: <OL>  <LI>In coercion-based societies, it is inevitable that people increasinglylose control of individual life and destiny;   <LI>As this happens, they take irrational action to correct this situation;  <LI>Our system of production compensation (payment for work) is basedon an irrational concept, making jobs unavailable for a large segment ofthe population. </OL>Let's take these in order. The first is a natural consequence of a societalstructure in which people are increasingly deprived of their right and <B>need</B>to make decisions regarding the conduct of their own individual lives. Avolitional being needs this for two reasons: <BR><OL>  <LI>It is the dominant way of learning. To try things, make the occasionalmistake, and to learn what works and what does not work;   <LI>It is necessary for the building of competence and self-esteem. </OL>As individuals increasingly loss control of their individual life, and thereforethe ability to build an increasingly better life for themselves and otherindividuals who may rely on them for these factors, they become depressed,irritated, and frustrated. With the increasing sense of loss of controlin being able to sustain and increase a quality life, an individual eventuallyreaches the point at which they become willing to take any actions necessaryto try to alleviate this feeling and vent their frustrations, and to tryto &quot;right the wrongs&quot; in their life. Eventually, concepts of rationalityand morality fall by the wayside, with the person feeling they no longerhave anything to lose. <BR><BR>On the other hand, people who feel that they have control over their individuallives, and that the quality of life tomorrow will be at least as good astoday, and perhaps better, such people are unlikely to take any &quot;anti-social&quot;acts that will have a negative impact on this situation. <BR><BR>The fact that the youths (and many other people) find themselves unemployed,and with little prospect of improving their lives, can also be attributedto the current, defective concept of production compensation. A system Icall <I>Being There</I>, in which people are compensated almost solely onthe basis of their presence in the workplace. Under this system, peoplewho take longer than a certain &quot;average,&quot; prescribed time to dothings, can not find work. Even while there is no shortage of things tobe done. Of course the existence of the so-called &quot;minimum wage&quot;laws only exacerbates this situation. When I was a child I had no problemin finding a job, since employers could pay me a wage that reflected myvalue in the marketplace. Which is the answer to the problem of findingjobs. Along the way, it vastly increases productivity, innovation, and quality.<BR><BR>The basic reason a person is not acceptable for a certain job is that itis believed they will not create value in the marketplace with an acceptablerelationship to their cost. A human worker is no different in principlethan an inanimate material or commodity. Something which must be &quot;purchased&quot;at a price such that it can be &quot;sold&quot; at a profit. <BR><BR>Therefore, the principle is: <UL><CITE>Production compensation must be based <B>solely</B> on the marketvalue of error-free production. <BR></CITE></UL>A further discussion of why this is so, how to implement such a system,and the results thereof, appear in the <I>Productivity Galore</I>&copy;essays available in the near future. They have existed for years, but willnot be published here for a few weeks at least. You can gain an overviewof the concept by readin the <A HREF="Productivity.html">Productivity FAQ</A>Document. <BR><BR><HR><H4><A NAME="BRIBE"></A>U. S. Federal Prosecutors bribe Oklahoma bombingsuspect.</H4>Press reports say that a former army buddy of the prime suspect in the bombingof the Federal Building in Oklahoma has agreed to cooperate with federalprosecutors to avoid being charged as a principle participant. Mr. MichaelFortier has agreed to testify against Mr. Timothy McVeigh in exchanged forthe prospect of a much lighter sentence. <BR><BR>This is referred to as &quot;plea bargaining&quot; in criminal circles.Yet a close examination of the event reveals it is what would be calleda &quot;bribe&quot; if it were done by someone other than an agent of apolitical r&eacute;gime. The transaction is a &quot;payment for servicesrendered,&quot; which is the operative definition of &quot;bribe.&quot;It only acquires it's sinister image when it is an action the politicalr&eacute;gime does not like. Or, when a non-member of such a r&eacute;gimepays a member of the r&eacute;gime for a &quot;service rendered,&quot; thenit becomes a bribe, and the non-r&eacute;gime person becomes a &quot;criminal.&quot;But, since political r&eacute;gimes make the rules, when <B>they</B> bribesomeone, then--voil&agrave;!--it is no longer illegal and not a crime. <BR><BR>Why must the rules change? In the absence of fraud or coercion, and in amutually agreed transaction, payment for a service is always moral. However,once political states and their associated agents get involved in a transaction,rules always changed. People who were criminals become victims, and peoplewho were victims become criminals. Such inconsistencies make the world difficultto understand... <BR><BR><HR><H4><A NAME="MPD"></A>Mad Cow Disease &amp; Mad Poliician Disease</H4>Who should be disposed of--the cows or the politicians--the ruling familycouncil. Who is the most dangerous to mankind? <BR><BR>People in the UK tribal areas are now concerned with something which ispopularly called &quot;Mad Cow Disease,&quot; medically known as &quot;bovinespongiform encephalopathy&quot; (BSE). They are concerned because of a possibleconnection with a human disease known as &quot;Creutsfeldt-Jakob Disease(CJD). In humans it is currently incurable. <BR><BR>The problem is that there is a possibility--as yet not verified--that BSEmay be communicated to humans and appear as CJD as a result of eating cow'smeat. There have been about 6-8 cases of CJD in the UK which alarmists aretrumpeting as being caused by eating cow's meat that <I>could</I> have beeninfected with BSE. <BR><BR>How many people have died in this century as a result of the acts of politicians?In the two World Wars there were probably 70-80 million who died. Who knowshow many died in China during the rule of &quot;Chairman&quot; Mao? Certainlyten's of millions when you consider those who died of famine as a resultof being sent to the countryside for &quot;re-education&quot; and thosewho &quot;routinely&quot; died of famine and other politically-induced diseases.<BR><BR>People in the UK are worrying about the <B>possibility</B> that 6-8 peoplewho have died of CJD <B>may</B> have been infected by eating cow's meat,while we know that several hundred did die as a result of the war in theFalklands. Perhaps the politicians in the UK were not the direct cause ofthe war, but if not, the one's in the Argentine tribal areas surely were.<BR><BR>As always in the political environment--as opposed to rational and durablesocietal mechanism--there must be winners and losers. And, as always, oneof the losers are the victims of tax theft, who must compensate farmersfor the cattle who will be butchered. An action which the National FarmersUnion sanctions. <BR><BR>The National Farmers Union sanctions this because the beef industry in theUK has been in decline in recent years, and there are already excess cattle.When the farmers are compensated for the butchering of their cattle, thiswill then allow them to go out of business without declaring bankruptcy.The result will be a shortage of beef, since the market WILL recover somewhat,and beef prices will then be higher than before. Thus we create anotherset of losers, those who wish to continue eating beef. <BR><BR>The winners? Well, there are only <I>apparent</I> winners in the short term,the politicians. They will be seen to have again saved mankind. What isnot seen is that they are the ones who created the problem in the beginning.And of course in the long term it is all of mankind which loses, includingthe politicians, as the specie heads inexorably into demise. Caused by &quot;MadPolitician Disease.&quot; Aided by their victims, who don't even seem torealize there is something wrong, let alone the cause of the problem. <BR><BR>It is time for people to realize the true source of all of man's miserieson this planet. <BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE><BR>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation <BR><BR><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I> <BR></CENTER><P><HR><B>Contact Information:</B><BR>E-Mail: administrator@Freedom-Server.co.uk<BR><HR>The URL of this page is: <BR><P><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Press-Articles.html&gt; <BR><HR NOSHADE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Then, onceelected and having descended* to political office, the main objective isto be re-elected. To ensure achieving this objective, they will do virtuallyanything, as illustrated in this section. <BR><UL>* Descending to political office <B>is</B> the correct direction, sincevirtually all political activites are immoral. (See the <A HREF="Glossary.html">Glossaryof Terms</A> for definitions). <BR><BR>A politician can only be said to have &quot;ascended&quot; to a positionwhen they are no longer in a position to control the property and livesof others without the consent of the victim(s). <BR></UL>Trading people, places, and things for votes. Their main objective is toremain in power--in control of other people's lives and money. The exhilarationof people kowtowing to you, and the knowledge that others are looking enviouslyat this process. The endless &quot;photo opportunities&quot; to enhanceone's position of power. The arriving, waiting, and departing limousines.The helicopters to make sure one is not caught in the traffic lesser mortalsare subject to, and which the politicians are unable to solve. (A dilutedand imparied form of socialist-capitalism is able to build more cars thanpoliticians can provide roads for.) <BR><BR>It is not so much the &quot;sleaze&quot; of politics that is significant,but rather the emptiness of the concept of one person or group of personscontrolling the lives and destiny of others through the mechanism of coercion.Even in the so-called &quot;democratic&quot; societies in which people supposedlygive their consent to this coercive process. Mainly, I believe, because&quot;it has always been this way,&quot; and because there seems not otherway for volitional societies to operate, which is of course not true. <BR><BR>Such coercive systems violate a basic law of nature regarding the behaviorof volitional beings which states that all concepts of happiness pursuedby <B>moral</B> means are equally valid. A corollary might be that any attemptby one individual to interfere in this process and the life of another personis of course immoral, and it should be obvious that it is counter-productiveand leads to disorder in a society. <BR><BR>Do you want someone else's idea of happiness substituted for yours? Do youwant their idea of happiness imposed on you? Is it realistic that groupsof people should have the same idea or concept imposed upon them? Forgettingfor the moment that such a thing is in any case immoral. <BR><BR>The word &quot;sleaze&quot; is often used to indicate corruption. But itshould be remembered that corruption can not exist unless one party to arelationship has an accepted and &quot;authorized&quot; (legal, in politicalsocieties) ability to control the lives and properties of others withouttheir permission. Without this access to the monopoly on police powers whicha political state encompasses the concept of corruption loses all its meaning.<BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><H3><CENTER>Sleaze for 1966, the Month of March</CENTER></H3><HR NOSHADE><TABLE border> <TR> <TH>Information Source</TH> <TH>PoliticalAction or Event</TH> <TH>Translation/Reality/Comment</TH> </TR> <TR> <TD><B>SundayTimes (London)</B><BR>1996, March 3<BR>&quot;Clinton declares emergency over anti-Cuba protest&quot;<BR>p. 1-18 </TD> <TD> <BR><BR>The &quot;Commander in Chief&quot; and Chief Draft Dodger has declared a&quot;National Emergency&quot; over Cuba's shooting down of two US privateaircraft. <BR><BR>He is also proposing a new law regarding property expropriated by Castroafter his rebellion against the previous Ruler, Battista.

Barone</h4></center><hr><p>Stephen G. Barone is a practicing psychologist and writerwho teaches at the University of Wisconsin, Platteville</p><hr noshade><p>	One of the latest fads in schools is a so-called "peace curriculum."It is wrought of the notion that peace is engendered by a certain kindof attitude: that if we teach teenagers and young adults to think andtalk more about peace, or if we condition them to have a sort ofknee-jerk aversion towards anything military, then the world willconsequently be a more irenic place. This concerns me as a psychologistand educator, because history provides scant evidence that war can beavoided by having either peace or antimilitarism as goals untothemselves. Neville Chamberlain's overtures toward Nazi Germany priorto World War II provide one of the most salient counter-examples tothis nostrum.<p>	This is not to suggest that a careful study of what conditionsprecede peace within or among nations is not the legitimate province ofa high school or college curriculum. But if we really want to teachwhat distinguishes peaceful societies from aggressive ones, or tolerantones from those hell-bent on "cleansing" themselves of racial,religious, and ethnic diversity, then I prescribe we consider theempirical case: that what the most stable and domestically peacefulnations have in common is a viable economy with a commensurate"commercial class" of citizens.<p>	Happily, in free societies, individuals are able to choose identitiesthat center upon human action as opposed to an unchangeable history.Eventually, we come to think of ourselves primarily as psychologists,carpenters, or grocers instead of Germans, Catholics, or Serbs. Thepsychological freedom this gives one is no small thing, especially ifthe person is born into what he rightly or wrongly perceives to be apersecuted caste. It allows him to see himself as the best electricianin town instead of, for instance, ruminating about being a persecutedMoslem and declaring a jihad forthwith.<p>	This tendency for individuals to develop utile self-conceptsalso separates them from stereotypes in the eyes of others. Forexample, there are relatively few Americans whose prejudices wouldcause them actively to avoid, let alone persecute, the best accountantin town because she is Hispanic, the best mechanic because he is black,or the best grocer because he is Korean. Rational self-interestengenders tolerance: the fact that we tend to value and identify withothers for their respective skills or professions. As a result, weoverlook the inconsequential differences among us, such as race, creed,or ethnicity.<p>	On a larger scale, commercialism amidst freedom requires findingcommon and reciprocal needs across the various racial, religious, andethnic constituents that exist both inside and outside of aheterogeneous society. Thereby, it is a more potent psychosocialinhibitor against civil war, military adventure, or institutionalizedpersecution than is any church, government, or army. Businesses aredestroyed during domestic upheaval; import/exporters loathe whateverrestricts trade among nations; and merchants crave as many customers asthey can get. Hence, they resist anything that might result in civilrevolt, international war, or whatever might arbitrarily exclude onegroup of people from doing business with another.<p>	But when economic activity is outlawed or severely retarded bygovernment intrusion, people are largely deprived of the opportunity to"become," so their senses of identity remain doggedly tethered to rigidand irrational lines of caste, ethnicity, religion, or tribalism. Andherein lies the danger, because as scarcity always fills the void wherea vital economy would otherwise operate, political and social unrestfesters, ready to be exploited by those who seek dominance over theirfellows. In the absence of property rights, each group will lay claimto the paucity of resources by reference to their ostensive historicalpredominance over the other, or even appeal to supernaturalentitlements. Under such conditions, aspiring despots saw and nurturednear-maniacal levels of loyalty and cohesiveness among theirhomogeneous constituencies by scapegoating the blame for bad timesacross strictly secular lines: tribe against tribe, religion againstreligion, nation against nation.<p>	This is precisely what is happening in places like Somalia andthe old Soviet republics. Governmental inhibitions have retarded freeenterprise and its requisite division of labor, allowing people theluxuries of prejudice, hate, and bigotry amidst the deprivations ofhunger, disease, and pestilence. Conversely, the United States andCanada do not share the world's longest undefended border because theirpeoples practice pacific thoughts about one another. Instead, thehistorical peace between both countries is born of stark commercialinterests. Likewise, Germany's Mexican production of Volkswagens forsale in the United States, or Japan's American production of Hondas forsale at home, does more to guarantee peace among nations than can allthe good vibes in the galaxy.<p>	In the absence of commerce, the various constituents of a diversesociety revert to their most primitive senses of self. Unable to bebutchers, carpenters, or storekeepers, they identify with groups madeof rigid caste and mere happenstance. They are Catholic instead ofMuslim, Serb instead of Croat, or black instead of white, eachpredisposed to blaming the other for any lack of prosperity. When suchmayhem is unleashed it cannot be squelched by armies or "peace-keepingforces." A nation that relies primarily on a militia to control humancongress is the very one that is most likely to erupt into civil war atthe first lapse in martial order<p>	Global harmony is not the by-product of kind thoughts, friendliness,and promises to share with one another; it is the direct product ofhuman industry and prosperity. Peace tends to break out when peoplemind their own business. But this presupposes they have business tomind. Factions in places like Somalia, Haiti, and the Balkans willnever consider peaceful co-existence until they have something more tolose than gain by continued war and hatred.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Teaching-Peace.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

That was my reaction to a seriesof articles recent written by national columnist Charley Reese.  Overthe years, Reese has made reputation as a strong defender of individualrights against a growing Leviathan, the federal government.  So it wasall the more perplexing when I read some of his claims aboutfree-market capitalism:<ul>  <p>  <li>"Two people can't eat the same bean. That's the essence of        economics."	</p> <p> <li>"The historically visible trend [in capitalist societies]        is always for the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer."        </p>  <p>  <li> "Only the youngest, the strongest can put stock in pure capitalism."  </p></ul><p>	Statements like these were demolished years ago in LeonardRead's classic little book, Cliches of Socialism, which was recentlyupdated by Mark Spangler under the new title, Cliches of Politics(Foundation for Economic Education, 1994). Unfortunately, some clichésdie slowly.<p>	Let me respond to each one of these commonly held criticisms ofthe free market.<h4>Voluntary Exchange Is Win-Win</h4><p>	First, is the free market similar to a sporting event, where oneteam wins and the other loses? Not at all. In every voluntarytransaction, both the buyer and seller gain.  Here's a simple proof:Suppose I sell an apple to a student for $1. The student buys the applebecause he would rather have the apple than the dollar bill. Thus, bypurchasing the apple, he improves his situation. On the other hand, Isell the apple because I'd rather have the dollar bill than the apple.I too am better off.<p>	In "Das Capital," Karl Marx popularized the view that all exchangesunder free enterprise capitalism involved an equality of values andtherefore one person's gain must be another person's loss.  But now wesee that just the opposite is true: All transactions in a voluntaryexchange involve an inequality of values. In fact, without aninequality of values, no voluntary exchange would ever occur.<p>	Because of an inequality of values, both the buyer and seller gain inevery transaction. The only exception to this law is when fraud ordeception is involved.  When that happens, one party gains at theother's expense. But in a voluntary exchange, where full and honestinformation is revealed, everyone benefits.<h4>The Essence of capitalism</h4><p>	Reese says that the essence of capitalism is contained in thestatement, "Two people can't eat the same bean."  Not so fast, Charley.A free market is not just an "either-or" proposition. Capitalism isalso a highly cooperative system. If there are two people and only onebean, the free market provides a better alternative: plant the bean andharvest enough beans to feed both people! That's the true essence ofcapitalism.<p>	Granted, natural resources are limited. But the beauty of freeenterprise is its ability to multiply these resources into goods andservices that people can use to increase their standard of living. Whatreally matters is not so much the amount of resources in their naturalstate but the supply of economically usable natural resources, whichare limited only to the extent of our know-how and physical ability totransform these inputs into usable wealth. In that sense, there isvirtually no limit to further advances in our standard of living. Inreality, nature isn't scarce, only the productive capacity of labor tochange nature into real wealth is.<h4>Capitalism Can Improve Everyone's Standard of Living</h4><p>	Finally, Charley Reese is wrong in suggesting that capitalismbreeds inequality, that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Under the free market, the rich get richer and the poor get richer too.Historically, citizens of capitalistic nations have enjoyed higher realwages and steady advances in the quantity, quality and variety of goodsand services. Only government, the politics of coercion, causes adecline in the standard of living.<p>	Moreover, the free market does not only benefit the young andthe strong, as Charley Reese suggests, but the weak, the poor, and thediscriminated.  Contrary to popular belief, capitalism is not adog-eat-dog jungle where only the fittest survive.  As the classicaleconomist David Ricardo demonstrated, the market is characterized bycomparative advantage, not just absolute advantage in the division oflabor. Therefore, opportunities abound for people of all abilities,talents, religions and races. The less fortunate may not earn a highwage, but they can and do benefit from the blessings of atechnologically advanced capitalistic society.  Today practicallyeveryone, rich and poor, enjoys the benefits of electrical power, thetelephone, the automobile, television and radio, books and newspapers,and a myriad other goods and services. Such everyday products wereavailable only to the wealthy less than a century ago.<p>	A free society is by no means perfect. People make mistakes,employers sometimes take advantage of workers, sometimes workersshortchange their employers, and salesmen may deceive the public. Butthe strength of the market is that bad business, deceptive practices,and shoddy merchandise are constantly being overwhelmed by goodbusiness, accurate information, and quality products. On net balance,there is no substitute for the free-enterprise system.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Sorry-not-Capitalism.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Caudill and Melody Hill</h4></center><hr><p>Professor Caudill teaches economics at Auburn Universityand Ms. Hill is an undergraduate student.</p><hr noshade><p>	On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed ExecutiveOrder 9066, approving the en masse relocation of Japanese andJapanese-American citizens from the West Coast into the interior of thecountry. The order was signed amid the hysteria following the Japaneseattack on Pearl Harbor.  The reason given at the time for theevacuation was concern about espionage, or so-called "fifth-column,"activities of Japanese and Japanese-Americans on the Coast.  Butaccording to the government's own intelligence service, this concernover espionage was misplaced.  That is, concern for national securitywas not the true reason for interning Japanese and Japanese-Americansduring World War II. Instead, this internment was motivated by nothingother than interest-group politics.	<p><a name="1r"><a name="2r"></p><p>	When war erupted in Europe, FDR placed J. Edgar Hoover's FBIin charge of the nation's internal security. Before the attack onPearl, the FBI and Naval Intelligence maintained lists of aliensuspects. Though the lists contained 250 to 300 suspects, only 40 or 50were considered real threats.<a href="#1">[1]</a>  Within two days ofthe attack on Pearl, all of the suspects and many others were detained.The FBI contended that these measures adequately controlled any threatof espionage, and that the relocation of Japanese andJapanese-Americans was unnecessary.<a href="#2">[2]</a>  As additionalevidence that security was not the reason for the internment, note thatno mass detainment of people of Japanese ancestry occurred in Hawaii,which is closer to Japan and home to many Japanese andJapanese-Americans. In Hawaii, only suspect Japanese individuals wereincarcerated.  If espionage was not the reason for the evacuation inCalifornia, what was the reason?  The answer: special interest groupsseeking protection from the competition of Japanese andJapanese-Americans residing on the West Coast.  Labor unions andfarmers wanted the Japanese out of California and off the land longbefore the attack on Pearl.  World War II and the bombing of PearlHarbor provided a handy opportunity for these groups to complete a taskthat they started several years earlier.<h4>The Historical Backdrop to Japanese Internment</h4><p>	The story of the internment is really the story of immigrationin California. A pattern was repeated, first with Chinese immigrantsand later, Japanese immigrants. The state of California, throughvarious laws, initially made it difficult for immigrants to enter thestate and then, if they managed to enter, unattractive to remain.  Themain difference between the Japanese and the Chinese in  California wasthe strong Japanese desire to own land.  This difference led to specialland-use legislation aimed at the Japanese.<p><a name="3r"><a name="4r"></p><p>	Between 1850 and 1882, over 280,000 Chinese entered California.<ahref="#3">[3]</a>  The influx of Chinese occurred because the enormousgrowth in the California economy required a cheap labor source and theChinese provided a solution. The Chinese were welcomed at first, but by1869 the railroad opened up California to the eastern half of theUnited States, and a recession was beginning.  Organized labor arguedthat the Chinese were no longer needed and lobbied for an end toChinese immigration.  As early as 1875, California enacted legislationhalting Chinese immigration into California (though this statute waslater declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court).  Californiaand organized labor then turned to Washington for help.  Their effortswere rewarded when, on May 6, 1882, the first Chinese Exclusion Actwent into effect.  This act eliminated the immigration of Chineselaborers for a period of 10 years; it also barred the Chinese frombecoming naturalized citizens.  The agitation leading up to the ChineseExclusion Act made it clear to many that something drastic regardingChinese immigration was about to occur, and even before passage of theAct, labor recruiters began visiting Japan to find replacements for thelost Chinese.<a href="#4">[4]</a>	<p>	The first large numbers of Japanese laborers who came to theU.S. territory were contract laborers.  In 1884 and 1885 severalhundred contract workers landed in Hawaii, which at the time was aprotectorate of the United States.  Californians were concerned thatthe Japanese might leave Hawaii for California.  Consequently onFebruary 26, 1885, the U.S. Congress enacted a bill to "prohibit theimportation and migration of foreigners and aliens under contract oragreement to perform labor in the United States, its territories, andthe District of Columbia."<p>	California on its own took steps making Japanese immigrationdifficult. The Congressional Act of August 3, 1882, imposed a head taxof fifty cents on all immigrants.  Soon afterward labor union leadersturned their attention to the "Japanese problem."  In 1905 the AsiaticExclusion League was formed. Initially this group consisted mostly ofunion leaders and workers, but support eventually was widespread:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="5r">	</p>	<p>	"On the second Sunday in May, 1905, delegates from sixty-seven	local and nearby labor organizations met to form what became	the Asiatic Exclusion League.  From the day of the League's formation	on May 14, 1905, until after the end of World War II, there was	in California, an organized anti-Japanese movement that would	eventually draw support from all segments of the state's population.	In the beginning, the organized movement was an extension of	San Francisco labor unions. The most prominent labor leaders	attending the initial meeting of the league were Patrick Henry	McCarthy, head of the Building Trades Council of San Francisco,	and Andrew Furuseth and Walter MacArthur, both of the Sailor's	Union. A satellite of McCarthy, Olaf Tveitmore, was named its	president. All four of these men were immigrants from Europe."	<a href="#5">[5]</a>	</p></ul><h4>Immigration Restrictions</h4><p>	In an effort to reduce tensions, Japan attempted to voluntarilyrestrict immigration to the United States.  In 1900 the Japanesegovernment stopped issuing passports for laborers headed for the UnitedStates, but continued to allow immigration to Hawaii. In Californiathere was again concern that Japanese would enter through Hawaii. Consequently, the Asiatic Exclusion League prompted the legislatures ofother Pacific Coast states to adopt resolutions restricting Japaneseimmigration from Hawaii.  In light of this agitation, the Japanesegovernment started to limit immigration to Hawaii, and in April 1905Japan temporarily suspended all immigration.<p>	Other legislation was designed to make life in Californiaunattractive to Japanese-Americans.  In April 1905 the union-dominatedSan Francisco Board of Education submitted a plan to the board ofsupervisors to segregate Japanese public-school children. On October11, 1906, with part of the city still in ruins from the earthquake, theboard of education passed the segregation order.  The move outragedJapan, and the U.S. government attempted to intervene.  A compromisewas reached and the problem was resolved with the passage of theImmigration Act of 1907.  The Act listed 20 different classes ofworkers, collectively called contract labor, who were prevented fromimmigrating.  The provisions of this legislation succeeded in keepingJapanese laborers from entering the United States through a thirdcountry or territory.	<p>	The next political issue was direct immigration.  Restrictionson direct immigration of Japanese were achieved through the"Gentleman's Agreement" of 1908.  Japan agreed to limit immigration to"relatives," "former residents," and "settled agriculturalists."  Theterm "settled agriculturalists" is defined to mean "a person who hadinvested capital in the enterprise, and whose share in its proceeds, ifit is carried on in partnership, will be in proportion to the amount ofhis investment."	<p>	The Gentleman's Agreement achieved an immediate decline inimmigration. Soon, departures exceeded arrivals.  This changed in 1913when large numbers of "picture brides" immigrated.  The number ofJapanese entering the country slowed to a trickle.  Efforts now focusedon legislation making life in California unattractive toJapanese-Americans.  A large part of this effort was aimed atland-ownership restrictions.	<p>	During the 1909 legislative session in California, at least 17anti-Japanese bills were introduced, and the 1913 session was floodedby more than 30 anti-Japanese measures.  Most proposals dealt with theholding of agricultural land.  Out of this session emerged theHeney-Webb Alien Land Law of 1913, tying land ownership to citizenship.This statute also provided that aliens ineligible for citizenship couldlease land for no more than three years.  State Attorney General Webb,co-sponsor, was not shy about its intent, stating,</p>	</ul>	<p>	<a name="6r">	</p>	<p>	"It is unimportant and foreign to the question, whether a particular	race is inferior. The single and simple question is, is the	race desirable… It [the law] seeks to limit their presence by	curtailing their privileges which they may enjoy here: for they	will not come in large numbers and long abide with us if they may not	acquire land.  And it [the Act] seeks to limit the numbers who	will come by limiting the opportunities for their activity when	they arrive."<a href="#6">[6]</a>	</p></ul><p>	The 1913 Act prohibited aliens from acquiring, possessing, enjoying,transmitting, and inheriting real property.  Japanese-Americans beganto put land titles in the names of their U.S.-born children who werecitizens and thus entitled to hold property.  In 1919, state senator J.M. Inman introduced an alien-land law designed to plug this loophole.The heart of the new act was that it was now illegal for an alien toprovide funds to purchase land if the title was held in the name ofanother person and if the intent was to avoid the law.  The act alsoprohibited leasing any land to persons ineligible for citizenship. Themeasure was placed on the ballot in the general election of 1920 in theform of an initiative.  On November 2, 1920, the measure passed by avote of 668,483 to 222,086.	<p>	Still, white Californians were unsatisfied.. They hoped to putan end to all Japanese immigration (as they had done earlier with theChinese) That goal was achieved when on May 15, 1924, a bill thatbecame known as the Japanese Exclusion Act of 1924 passed the House ofRepresentatives.	<p><a name="7r"></p><p>	Despite this anti-Japanese legislation, the growth of the Japaneseinvolvement in agriculture during this period was impressive.  By 1940Japanese farmers produced at least 90 percent of snap beans, celery,peppers, and strawberries.  Japanese farmers also produced 50 to 90percent of artichokes, celery, cucumbers, fall peas, spinach, andtomatoes for canning, and 25 to 50 percent of the asparagus, cabbage,cantaloupes, carrots, lettuce, onions, and watermelons.<a href="#7">[7]</a><h4>Agitation Increases</h4><p>	It is not surprising that when the attack on Pearl Harbor heightenedagitation against the Japanese-Americans, the Caucasian farmers ofCalifornia were eager for internment as well as for the land held bythe Japanese.  Austin Anson, the managing secretary of theGrower-Shipper Vegetable Assoclation, a farm organization, is quoted assaying:</p>	<ul>	<p>	<a name="8r">	</p>	<p>	"We're charged with wanting to get rid of the Japs for selfish	reasons. We might as well be honest.  We do.  It's a question	of whether the white man lives on the Pacific Coast or the brown men.	They came to this valley to work, and they stayed to take over.	 They offer higher land prices and higher rents than the white	man can pay for land. They undersell the white man in the markets. 	They can do this because they raise their own labor.  They work	their women and children while the white farmer has to pay wages for	his help.  If all the Japs were removed tomorrow, we'd never	miss them in two weeks, because the white farmers can take over	and produce everything the Jap grows. And we don't want them	back when the war ends, either."<a href="#8">[8]</a>	</p></ul><p>	The fact that Japanese farmers were not welcomed back after thewar contradicts the security arguments given for the evacuation.Security concerns certainly did not exist after the war.  It is quiteclear that some viewed the situation in California immediatelyfollowing the attack on Pearl Harbor as a unique opportunity to get ridof competitors.  In May 1942, O. L. Scott, another member of theGrower-Shipper Vegetable Association wrote to Congressman Anderson:	<p><a name="9r"></p><p>	"If it were not for the "white-skinned Japs" in this countrythere wouldn't be any Japanese question.  What can you suggest I do andthousands of Californians be led to do, that may make it possible toget rid of all Japs, sending them back to Japan either before or afterthe war is won.  I am convinced that if it is not done or at least theaction completed before the war is over, it will be impossible to getrid of them... The Japanese cannot be assimilated as the white race[and] we must do everything we can to stop them now as we have a goldenopportunity now and may never have it again."<a href="#9">[9]</a>	<p>	As a consequence of the evacuation, farms owned by Japanese-Americanswere sold for a few cents on the dollar to Caucasian farmers. Oneestimate of the value of Japanese farmland in 1940 was over $72million.  After the war, internees were paid only a small fraction ofthe value of their losses.  Attempting to remedy this situation, thegovernment passed a bill in 1988 that did two things. First, thegovernment apologized to Japanese-Americans for the internment, alsoadmitting that the relocation was not justified for security reasons. Second, the bill provided that each of the 60,000 internees or theirdescendants be paid a lump sum of $20,000.  Perhaps these funds shouldhave come not from the taxpayers of this country at large, but from thefarmers who benefited directly from the land and crops taken from theJapanese-Americans in 1942.</p><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>	See Roger Daniels, The Decision to Relocate	the Japanese-Americans (Philadelphia: Lippincott, Co., 1975).		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>See also Roger Daniels, The Decision to Relocate	the Japanese-Americans.		<a href="#2r">Return</a><p><a name="3"><li>See Frank Chuman, The Bamboo People: The Law and	Japanese-Americans (Del Mar, Calif.: Publisher's Inc., 1976).		<a href="#3r">Return</a><p><a name="4"><li>See also Frank Chuman, The Bamboo People	<a href="#4r">Return</a><p><a name="5"><li>See Roger Daniels, The Politics of Prejudice	(London: Cambridge University Press, 1961)		<a href="#5r">Return</a><p><a name="6"><li>See also Frank Chuman, The Bamboo People	<a href="#6r">Return</a><p><a name="7"><li>See Theodore Salutos, "The Immigrant in Pacific	Coast Agriculture, 1880-1940," Agricultural History 49 (January	1975), p. 192.		<a href="#7r">Return</a><p><a name="8"><li>See Morton Grodzins, Americans Betrayed (Chicago:	University of Chicago Press, 1949).		<a href="#8r">Return</a><p><a name="9"><li>See also Morton Grodzins, Americans Betrayed, p.	20.		<a href="#9r">Return</a></ol><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Japanese-Internment.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Therefore, a company must have thecommitment of the minds of all of its employees to survive...   We knowthat the intelligence of a few technocrats--even very bright ones-hasbecome totally inadequate to face these challenges."</p><ul><ul><ul>Konsuke Matsushita<a href="#1">[1]</a></ul></ul></ul><p>	Imagine a history class in the year 2095--perhaps some kind of"virtual class." The instructor is comparing two basic kinds oforganizations prevalent 100 years earlier. One involved hundreds ofmillions of people; the other usually involved hundreds of thousands atmost. One had no specific purpose; the other had a specific mission.One had no official "management"; the other had a president, profitcenters, and lots of managers. One had no bank accounts, no owners, nolegal identity--it was called a "society." The other had all of thesethings--it was called a corporation.	<p>	Despite these major differences, the two shared some similarities.Both were made up of people who wanted to live and work together inharmony to accomplish their individual goals. In both, the people hadto coordinate their actions to accomplish their goals.	<p>	Experts constantly debated how to improve these two types oforganizations. For society, the twentieth century produced twoalternative models: the hierarchical, authority-driven command model,and the decentralized, self-organizing free enterprise model. By 1995,the command model had failed miserably in every society that tried it.For the corporation, the command model dominated management thinkingfor most of the century. But by 1995, the command model had failed inbusiness too. By the end of the century, corporations organizedaccording to the command model were recognized as suffering from manyof the same problems as command-based societies. But where wouldbusiness leaders look for a new paradigm?	<p>	We believe history will show that a growing number of executiveslooked to the free market system for new management in-sights.Centrally planned economies collapsed because they failed to use theknowledge that is dispersed in the heads of many individuals and oftenhard to communicate to the central planners. Centrally planned businessfirms face a similar fate, for similar reasons. Just as socialism lostthe allegiance of most of its citizens, so too have"command-and-control" management principles lost the allegiance of manyexecutives. Companies both at home and abroad are searching for a newmanagement paradigm to replace the old view based on hierarchy,top-down planning, and the giving of orders.<p>	Over the years, a growing number of businesses have shifted toorganizational forms and management methods based on the principles ofa free society and market economy. This emerging management approach,which we call "Market-Based Management," promises to outperform oldermanagement paradigms for the same reasons that free economies haveout-performed planned economies: it makes better use of the knowledgethat is dispersed among many people in the organization.<h4>The Old Paradigm: Scientific Management and Central Planning</h4><p><a name="2r"></p><p>	For years, American business was dominated by a central-planningparadigm credited to Frederick Taylor.<a href="#2">[2]</a>  Taylorargued that management is a science that can be taught. In search ofhigher productivity, Taylor advocated systematic study to improve uponthe best prevailing production practices of his day. Aided bytime-and-motion studies, managers would ascertain the best way toperform each task, select the best people for each task, and teach themthe one best way. Taylor laudably sought to increase businessproductivity so that both wages and profits would rise. Thus, he soughtto replace labor-management confrontation with a harmony of interestsfounded on greater productivity. 	<p>	In Taylor's view, managerial direction was key to enhancingproductivity, because manual laborers were generally incapable ofunderstanding the best way of doing their jobs. In a discussion ofhandling pig iron, for example, Taylor noted,<p><a name="3r"></p><p>	This work is so crude and elementary in its nature that thewriter firmly believes that it would be possible to train anintelligent gorilla so as to become a more efficient pig-iron handlerthan any man can be. Yet it will be shown that the science of handlingpig iron is so great and amounts to so much that it is impossible forthe man who is best suited to this type of work to understand theprinciples of this science, or even to work in accordance with thoseprinciples without the aid of a man better educated than he is.<a href="#3">[3]</a><p><a name="4r"></p><p>	This situation was not unique to pig-iron handling; "in almost allof the mechanic arts the science which underlies each work-man's act isso great and amounts to so much that the workman who is best suitedactually to do the work is incapable (either through lack of educationor through insufficient mental capacity) of understanding thisscience."<a href="#4">[4]</a> Taylor's methods generated significantproductivity increases when applied to uneducated workers doingrepetitive tasks. But followers tried to develop his ideas into auniversal approach to be used in contexts quite different from the onesTaylor originally studied. A school of thought, "ScientificManagement," emphasized that management's job is to give orders, whilelabor should follow these orders. This worldview has shapedlabor-management relations for most of the twentieth century.<p><a name="5r"></p><p>	Advocates of Scientific Socialism also cited Scientific Managementin support of their grand vision for society. In the Soviet Union, bothLenin and Trotsky admired Scientific Management and thought it was oneof the important features of capitalism that socialists should imitate.In their view, centralized planning of the entire economy was just alogical extension of centralized planning within the factory.<ahref="#5">[5]</a><p><a name="6r"></p><p>	In democratic countries, advocates of greater government planningalso seized on Scientific Management in support of their views. RexfordTugwell, a prominent adviser to Franklin D. Roosevelt, declared thatthe greatest economic event of the nineteenth century occurred whenTaylor first timed some shovelers in a steel plant so that he couldinstruct them how to do their job more efficiently. Tugwell and manyother New Deal intellectuals believed that Scientific Management"would, in the hands of the state, provide the tools for the renovationof the economy at the practical organizational level, for the overallrationalization so long awaited to repair the damage done by anunplanned business order."<a href="#6">[6]</a><p><a name="7r"></p><p>	In 1932, H.S. Person, managing director of the Taylor Societyin New York, endorsed the employment of Scientific Management to plansociety as efficiently as industrialists planned factories. Taylorism,he believed, ushered in a "surplus economy" of material abundance. TheGreat Depression occurred because industrialized nations had not yetadopted the appropriate social-management techniques. Policymakersneeded to enunciate a social objective of "production for measureddemand at the least social cost" and institute conscious organizationto accomplish the objectives.<a href="#7">[7]</a>	<p><a name="8r"></p><p>	Though motivated by humanitarian concern, Scientific Managementpossessed a major blind spot: it ignored the importance of dispersedand tacit knowledge. In an organization of any significant size,authoritarian managers can be little more effective than centraleconomic planners, because they lack the requisite knowledge. Muchrelevant knowledge is dispersed in the heads of many people in theorganization, and much of it cannot be communicated to a central pointfor processing. Firms built on the central-planning model suffer fromthe same "fatal conceit" that afflicts centrally planned economies.<a href="#8">[8]</a><h4>The Reckoning</h4><p>	Given the commonalities between Scientific Management and centralplanning, it is no surprise that authoritarian firms encounteredtrouble when challenged by rivals using management methods moreconsistent with the principles of a free society:</p><p><a name="9r"></p><ul><p><li>In the automobile industry, American companies found themselves     out-competed by Japanese companies during the 1970s and early 1980s.     The principal reason was that quality improvement methods pioneered     by Japanese firms required them to reorganize the workplace in ways     that let workers and work teams use their local knowledge to improve     production processes.<a href="#9">[9]</a></p><p><li>In the steel industry, large integrated steel mills lost enormous     ground in the 1980s to "mini-mills" like Nucor Corporation, based     in Charlotte, North Carolina. Nucor rewards its teams of plant     workers with weekly performance-based bonuses, and workers apply     their own tacit knowledge to get more output from production machinery     than even the machinery's manufacturer thought was possible.</p><p><a name="10r"></p><p><li>In the oil industry, Wichita-based Koch Industries grew into a     $24 billion company while many major oil companies experienced     massive layoffs. The firm's chairman and CEO, Charles Koch, leads a     company-wide effort to apply the insights of Ludwig von Mises,     Friedrich Hayek, and other free-market scholars to all aspects of the     firm's business.<a href="#10">[10]</a></p></ul><p><a name="11r"></p><p>	For 50 years, management researchers have criticized ScientificManagement, proposing alternatives under such varied names as "humanrelations," "Theory Y." "Theory Z." and even "Liberation Management."<ahref="#11">[11]</a> Market-Based Management proposes a new, alternativemodel thoroughly grounded in the principles of a free market and freesociety. To some extent, market-based management is consistent withearlier critiques, but it also adds a new, systemic approach thatallows managers to identify the concepts and tools most consistent withmarket principles.<h4>Elements of Market-Based Management</h4><p>	Several key elements account for the superior quality of life ina free society, and analogous elements exist inside organizations. Theaccompanying table identifies significant elements contributing to thehealth of both market economies and organizations.<h4>Comparative Advantage and the Firm's Mission System</h4><p>	In 1776, Adam Smith argued that the fundamental factor explainingeconomic prosperity is an advanced division of labor.<center><h4>Six Key Systems in Market Economies and Organizations</h4><table border>	<tr>		<th>Market Economy</th>		<th>Organization</th>	</tr>		<tr>		<td>Specialization through comparative advantage</td>		<td>Mission System</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td>Rules of Just Conduct</td>		<td>Value and Culture</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td>Property Rights</td>		<td>Rules &amp; Responsibilities</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td>Price System</td>		<td>Internal Markets</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td>Market Incentives</td>		<td>Compensation &amp; Motivation</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td>Free Flow of Ideas</td>		<td>Generation &amp; Use of Knowledge</td>	</tr></table></center><p><a name="12r"></p><p>	Many economists have elaborated this theme into the theory ofcomparative advantage, which demonstrates how each individual canexpand the wealth of society by specializing in activities in which hecan create the most value at the lowest sacrifice of alternativeproducts or services. F.A. Hayek added another dimension by emphasizingthe division of knowledge: every individual is an expert on something,and overall prosperity depends crucially on each person's ability tomake the decisions that he alone has the best knowledge to make.<a href="#12">[12]</a><p>	The organizational equivalent of specialization by comparativeadvantage is the "mission system." This system includes strategicplanning-an understanding of how the firm's core competencies allow itto create value, and at what cost. But the mission system also includesa dissemination of this understanding to every individual in theorganization, such that every person knows how his actions advance themission of the organization. Like specialization in a market economy,the mission system creates situations allowing individuals tosimultaneously serve society while serving themselves.	<p>	Koch Industries is one company working to implement a strong missionsystem. Various business units develop their own missions that arebroadly consistent with the overall corporate mission. Individualemployees are also expected to develop personal missions linking theirown knowledge, skills, and aspirations with the mission of theirbusiness. In this sense, the mission is less an inspirational devicethan a compass guiding thousands of employees' independent decisions.The compass metaphor is especially apt, because the mission does notdirect people to do specific things; rather, it helps them orient theiractivities to those of everyone else in the organization.<h4>Rules of Just Conduct, Values, and Culture</h4><p><a name="13r"></p><p>	Investment, production, and exchange do not occur in a vacuum. Asociety's "rules of just conduct" that define acceptable andunacceptable behavior exercise a powerful influence on economicactivity.<a href="#13">[13]</a>  Where plunder is practiced and lyinggoes unpunished, people have strong incentives to refrain fromproductive activity and long-term commitments. On the other hand, if asociety's formal and informal rules are grounded in respect for theindividual, they unleash tremendous creative forces. Values thatpromote prosperity--in societies and in organizations--include respectfor personal dignity and property, intellectual honesty, humility,openness to new ideas, and the freedom to question establishedpractices.<p><a name="14r"></p><p>	These values may sound like "mother-hood and apple pie," but the realchallenge is implementing them in practice. A Brazilian-based companycalled Semco provides some examples of management's respect forspontaneous order. The company abolished time clocks and official workhours in its plants. Instead, groups of employees set their own workhours, based on their own preferences. When group members need to be inthe plant at the same time, they all show up, even though no managertells them to do so. Work groups are measured on the amount theyproduce, rather than the hours they work. The company's principalowner, Ricardo Semler, argues that adults manage to coordinate theiractivities outside the workplace without managerial supervision, sospontaneous coordination of work hours and other matters in theworkplace should be no big surprise.<a href="#14">[14]</a><h4>Property Rights, Roles, and Responsibilities</h4><p>	In a free market, property rights play a key role in both mobilizingknowledge and providing incentives. Private property divides controlover resources into distinct spheres, within which individuals can usetheir own knowledge and judgment. Those who find better ways of usingtheir property to serve consumers tend to earn profits, gain controlover resources, and hence make more significant decisions as timepasses. Those with poor judgment tend to lose control of their propertyand, hence, lose the ability to make decisions about the use ofresources.	<p>	Companies too can employ these principles in thinking aboutroles, responsibilities, and authorities. In many companies, a person'sability to make decisions depends on his position on a hierarchicalorganizational chart, length of service, corporate politics, or pureluck. In a market-based firm, one’s ability to hire, fire, spend money,and manage assets depends on a past track record, much as a homeowner’sability to borrow money depends on a credit record.  Tamko RoofingProducts, based in Joplin, Missouri, puts these principles intopractice when it decides who can spend how much money. The company hasnever used budgets to plan how much will be spent or what it will bespent on. As Ethelmae Humphreys, the company's CEO, puts it, "If weneed to spend money, we spend it. If we don't, we don't."  Managers andemployees throughout the organization have spending authorities thatallow them to exercise wide discretion about corporate purchases. Assuccessful people take on new responsibilities, they may well receivenew levels of spending authority needed to do the job.<h4>The Price System and Internal Markets</h4><p>	The term "market-based management" often conjures up the imageof employees charging other employees prices for products and servicesinside the firm. And indeed, an internal price system is one criticalelement of market-based management.	<p>	Private property rights give individuals the opportunity to exercisetheir own judgment, and the price system helps ensure that oneindividual's independent decisions are coordinated with those made bymillions of other people. The informational benefits of prices inmarkets are well known, but the benefits of pricing inside the firm areoften less fully appreciated. In reality, many parts of large businessfirms operate much like bureaucracies: top management providesresources for services like accounting, public affairs, and informationservices, and these departments are then sent forth to do good for thecompany. Since the internal customers for these services pay no prices,the results are predictable: shortages, queuing, and growing overheadas top management shovels more money into enterprises that areeffectively giving away their services.	<p><a name="15r"></p><p>	A wide variety of companies have decided to change this systemby making internal customers pay prices for the "overhead" servicesthey formerly consumed for free. Companies using internal prices forcorporate services include Bell Atlantic, Koch Industries, ClarkEquipment, Weyerhaeuser, and Pump Systems. These companies range fromsmall to large, and they span a wide range of industries. Companiesadopting internal pricing cite several benefits, including reducedoverhead expenses, closer relationships between internal customers andsuppliers, and continuous "rightsizing" as voluntary transactionsreveal which corporate services can be better acquired on the outsidemarket.<a href="#15">[15]</a><h4>Market Incentives and Motivation</h4>	Entrepreneurs earn profits by thinking up new ways to create value forothers. No one orders them to be creative; they simply find that theycan make themselves better off by making their customers better off aswell.	<p>	In business, though, employees frequently get raises and promotionsfor following orders, building political skills, attaining a specificrank, or simply hanging around for a long time. Some of this occursbecause of union contracts, but such incentives are also widespread inmanagerial compensation schemes. As one corporate executive noted,"There must be better reasons for giving raises than the fact that theearth went all the way around the sun again."<p>	Nucor Corporation has found a better way. At Nucor, substantialemployee bonuses, paid weekly, are tied to production results thatspecific teams of employees can directly affect. Higher output leads tohigher bonuses, and bonuses can easily exceed a worker's base pay. As aresult, workers show up for work early to ask the previous shift howthe equipment is running. They take extra care in maintenance anddiscourage each other from taking unnecessary sick days. In short, theincentives of Nucor's work teams are so well aligned with the corporatemission that little "management" of employees is required.<a href="#16">[16]</a><h4>Free Flow Ideas and the Use of Knowledge</h4><p>	Freedom of action and freedom of exchange are critical elementsof a market economy, and so is freedom of speech. Prices summarize agreat deal of information, but because real-world markets aredisequilibrium markets, prices do not summarize everythingentrepreneurs and customers need to know. As a result, individuals needthe freedom to exchange ideas, debate new suggestions, and advertisetheir products and services to potential customers.<p>Most corporations today espouse these ideals, but many would do wellto ask themselves questions like the following.</p><ul> <p> <li>Do operating units supply detailed operating data to headquarters?  <p><li>Are employees directed because they lack access to information they    need to make business decisions?    <p>  <li>Are accounting systems designed for management control instead of    furnishing information to operating personnel?    <p>  <li>Do performance evaluations include only the views of the boss,    instead of information from all of an employee's major "customers"?</ul><p>	An organization that can answer "yes" to these questions isfundamentally channeling information to the decisionmakers at the topof a pyramid, instead of letting employees make decisions based on theirown local knowledge.<h4>Concluding Comments</h4><p>	The failure of command-based societies provided one of the mostpowerful lessons of the twentieth century. The downfall of Sovietcentral planning confirmed the flaws in the command paradigm. Thestriking differences in living standards between West and East Germany,or mainland China and Hong Kong, should persuade any skeptic thatsocialism's failure was not due to unique aspects of Russian history orculture. Instead, the blame rests with fundamental flaws in the commandapproach--an approach that bears striking similarities to the dominantcorporate management paradigm of the twentieth century.<p>	Human experience has shown that market economies produce prosperitythrough the interaction of specialization, rules of just conduct,private property, the price system, incentives, and open communication.Given the size of many business organizations, it seems logical toadapt free market principles to improve management practice.<p>	The idea of market-based management is part prediction and partprescription. The prediction is that firms will become moremarket-based to compete in the global econ-omy. The prescription isthat firms can shorten their learning process by applying lessonsalready learned in free societies. </p><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>Konsuke Matsushita, "The Secret is Shared,"	Manufacturing Economics (February 1988), p.15		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>Frederick W.

Do we needmore money as production expands?  That would seem logical. But is it?<p>	What individuals really want is not more money, but more purchasingpower. Money itself isn't wealth.  Look at Germany in 1923. The Germanshad plenty of paper money then--billions and billions of Marks. Butwith all that money, they had little or no purchasing power. Ahousewife considered herself lucky if she could find a baker willing totake a wheelbarrow full of paper money for one loaf of bread. It is thepurchasing power of money, not the money itself, that counts.<h4>Money Has Two Basic Functions</h4><ol><p><li> as purchasing power. A money whose purchasing power can be reliedon is the most efficient means for individuals to obtain the manyvaried goods and services they want. Each of us always wants to holda certain amount of money for future purchases.</p><p><li> as a means for comparing the market values of various goods andservices. Because billions of German Marks were being printed in1923, the purchasing power of a single Mark dropped practically tozero. Germans no longer wanted to hold Marks. Rather, they used everyruse they could devise to exchange their useless Marks promptly forsomething tangible. Also, as the Mark declined in value, comparisonswith various goods and services became increasingly unreliable. Bythe end of 1923, German Marks were completely useless for either ofmoney's two basic functions.</p></ol><p>	Money is the medium of exchange people offer in the expectationof obtaining various goods, services, and leisure time. All very welland good. But when there are more people and when more goods andservices are being produced, won't more dollars be needed if the extrapeople are to buy the additional goods and services? Won't more dollarshave to be created to cover all this additional spending and keeppeople producing and prosperous?<p>	No! The answer, as the German case shows, isn't more dollars.The answer is more purchasing power. And here the market provides theanswer.<p>	Suppose the population has increased but the quantity of moneyor credit has not been artificially expanded. Then more would-be buyerswill be competing to buy the goods and services available. The sameamount of money will have to stretch farther. Would-be producer/sellerswill have to sell at what would-be buyers can afford to pay--or elseforgo sales. If would-be producer/sellers do not anticipateartificially induced increases in the quantity of money, they will notkeep asking higher and higher prices, as sellers often do nowadays;they will be willing to drop their asking prices, especially if theyfeel confident the cost of replenishing their stocks too will not goup, and may even go down. The tendency, therefore, will be for dollarprices to go down and the purchasing power of the dollar, and hence thepurchasing power of individuals, to rise.<p>	Suppose production has been expanded, but the quantity of moneyor credit has not been artificially increased. As would-be sellers willbe offering more goods and services than before, but there is no moremoney, the same amount of money will have to stretch farther. Would-beproducer/sellers will have to sell at what would-be buyers can affordto pay--or else forgo sales. If would-be producer/sellers do notanticipate artificially induced increases in the quantity of money,they will not keep asking higher and higher prices, as producer/sellersoften do nowadays. They will then be willing to drop their askingprices, especially if they feel confident that they can reproduce theirstocks at, or below, their previous costs. The tendency, therefore,will be for dollar prices to go down and the purchasing power of thedollar, and hence the purchasing power of individuals, to rise. Becausetheir dollars will buy more, both consumers and producer/sellers willtend to be better off.<p>	If the quantity of money is not artificially increased, everywould-be buyer will take care to spend his or her hard-earned moneyonly on what is most important. Of course, people will disagree as towhat is "most important"--but that is another matter. And even!would-be seller will take care to sell only when he expects the sale toprove worthwhile under the circumstances. Goods services, and moneywill then gravitate, as the market directs, toward those persons whosedemands are the strongest and most intense. This will tend to producethe greatest possible satisfaction.<h4>Government Interference with Money</h4><p>	Not only can the market cope with the demands of an increasedpopulation and the appearance on the market of increased stocks ofgoods and services, but also government interference with this processis disruptive. In the first place, creating new money itself does notassure economic well being. In the second place, artificial monetaryexpansion can lead, as it has many times in the past, to economicdisaster.<p>	Governments have never been at a loss for excuses to inflate(increase the quantity of money) or to expand credit. They argue that:more people need more money; more money must be created to buy theincreased quantities of goods and services produced; many people needhelp because they can't afford adequate food, clothing, shelter, andmedical care; quarterly or year-end debt settlements createextraordinary demands for cash; exporters need to be subsidized toencourage exports and improve the balance of trade; businessmen needmore money to finance transactions or to expand, and interest rates arehigher than they are willing to pay; the government must counteractbank credit contraction to forestall a recession or depression, so thequantity of money to lend must be increased. And so on. However,government doesn't like to tax to pay for these programs; it muchprefers to create new money and credit. And that paves the way todisaster.<p>	Some of the effects of monetary expansion are seen. But manyare unseen. Monetary expansion helps some people, the firstbeneficiaries of the new money; these people are "seen." The monetaryexpansion hurts others, those who receive none of the new money andthose who receive it only later after they have been penalized byhaving to pay inflated prices for things they purchased; these peopleare "unseen." Monetary expansion also misdirects production. Itsubsidizes some producers who are "seen," while discouraging others,those who must pay for the subsidies or are hurt by the competition ofsubsidized competitors; these producers are "unseen." Moreover,production encouraged by artificial monetary increases is determined bypoliticians, and thus the wants of consumers are neglected. Artificialmonetary expansion leads also to international complications and thedisruption of the international market, international prices, and thebalance of trade.<h4>How the Market Copes</h4><p>	Over the centuries, both the population and production have multipliedmany times over. The market has become worldwide. Individuals,operating in and through the market, have generally coped with thesechanges without direct government intervention. As the demand for moneyincreased, prices were pushed down by competition, and the purchasingpower of gold rose. When gold increased in value, opportunities forprofit in gold mining appeared and adventurers all over the worldsearched for gold. The Spaniards stole gold from the Incas of Peru.Prospectors discovered rich gold fields in Australia, South Africa, andAlaska. And substantial gold fields were found in Russia also. Theexploitation of these gold discoveries expanded the quantity ofmonetary gold without artificial government intervention. The marketalso found other ways to cope with the rising demand for money due topopulation and production increases. Prices fluctuated. When morepeople were asking for more goods and services, with essentially thesame number of dollars to spend, each dollar became more valuable; as aresult people had more purchasing power if not more dollars. A singledollar bought more than before; living costs went down, and livingstandards went up. People were better off even if they didn't have moredollars. If governments had not inflated in recent decades, priceadjustments would undoubtedly have been made by using fractions of themonetary unit. After all, the dollar is infinitely divisible. Forinstance, if our government had not promoted inflation and creditexpansion, we might be buying a daily paper with a 1/4 cent token(instead of 25 cents or 50 cents), a loaf of bread for pennies (insteadof $1.00 or more), or an automobile for $500-$1,000 (instead of $10,000or $20,000).<p>	In addition to allowing prices to fluctuate, the market copedwith the rising demand of trade for money in other ways. Traderseconomized the use of the precious metals. They developed banking andstarted using various paper documents in transactions gold and silvercertificates (receipts representing warehoused gold or silver), bonds,bills of lading, checks, checking accounts, and various forms ofsecurities. These new techniques enabled businessmen to pay forpurchases without actually shipping gold or silver. Bank clearinghouses made interbank transfers of funds cheaper and faster. Electronicbank deposits and transfers, and credit cards continue this economizingtrend. And no one can foresee what new market economies will beforthcoming.<p>	Fiat money (printing press money) and fractional reserve banking arenot listed here because both owe their continued use to governmentprotection of some kind. If government had not entered the field ofmoney and banking, private banks would have had to fulfill theirobligations as do all other private businesses. Without governmentprotection, a bank that issued more promises to pay than it couldfulfill would be forced to mend its ways or go into bankruptcy. A bankthat issues more banknotes (promises to pay upon demand) than it canredeem is courting disaster. And no bank whose assets and reservesconstitute only a fraction of its obligations can expect to survive forany extended period of time without some form of government protection.<p>	If government had not intervened, the market would have been able tocope with population and production increases through the pricingstructure and various other techniques traders would have devised. Thepressure of new buyers appearing on the market and the pressure ofproducers offering more goods and services, without any artificialincrease in the number of dollars, would have enhanced the purchasingpower of every dollar. Prices would have tended to go down and livingstandards would have risen, even though monetary incomes stayedessentially the same. Instead of expecting continual inflation andrising prices, people would have looked at their economic situationfrom a different perspective. They would have compared their presentand past living standards and considered how much better off they werethan in the past because their living costs had declined. It didn'tcost as much to feed the family as it used to. A new automobile thisyear cost less than it did ten years ago. And so on.<p>	If prices are free to fluctuate, and if traders on the market are notprevented from economizing when it seems advisable, any amount of moneywill be sufficient to fulfill money's two basic functions as purchasingpower and as a means for comparing relative market values. As a matterof fact, when monetary inflation is resorted to in the attempt tocompensate for changes, the monetary unit loses both its purchasingpower and its use as a standard for comparing values. The consequencesof a government-induced inflation--in the attempt to keep pace withchanges in population and production--will always be much moredisastrous than any short-run benefits it brings to its relatively fewearly beneficiaries.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Purchasing-Power.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

But while this line of thought hasbeen fruitful of much insight, it risks engrossment in technical arcanaof libertarian theory--anarchy, public finance via lotteries, and soon--and quite forgetting that freedom’s real enemy is not governmentitself but the frailties of human nature that result in itsillegitimate use. Some of these weaknesses have received careful study.Envy, for example, is the subject of a brilliant treatise by HelmutSchoeck.<a href="#1">[1]</a>  But one of freedom's worst foes is, quite simply, fear.	<p>	Fear of what, specifically? Fear of failure, fear of responsibility,and above all fear of uncertainty, insecurity, and financial loss andsuffering brought on by competition, technological change, and theinescapable fact that "time and chance happeneth to them all"(Ecclesiastes 9:1.1). Fear, in short, of life and its mishaps.	<p>	These fears lead to demands for govern-ment to protect the fearfulfrom what they fear. Indeed, much of today's colossal governmentintervention into the free market can be traced, ultimately, in wholeor in part, to fear on the part of some group, or to politicians'appeal to that fear: antitrust laws, to fear of larger or moreefficient firms; regulation of railroad freight rates, to largerailroads' fear of being underbid by their competition; agriculturalsubsidies, acreage restrictions, and price controls, to fear ofcommodity price fluctuations; protectionism, to fear of foreigncompetition; Social Security, to fear of destitution in old age;Medicare, to the elderly's fear of unaffordable health care;unemployment compensation, to fear of hardship occasioned by job loss;minimum wages, to fear of being paid a lower wage (and, sotto voce,labor unions' fear of competition from cheaper labor); graduated incometaxes and inheritance taxes, to fear of large incomes andconcentrations of wealth; deposit insurance, to fear of losing savingsin a bank crash; and so on almost <i>ad infinitum</i>.<h4>The High Cost of Fear</h4>	<p>	All this indulgence of fear has not only severelycrimped our liberty but also inflicted serious economic penalties.Thomas Hopkins, of the Rochester Institute of Technology, has estimatedthe 1992 cost of regulations at $564 billion, counting such things asprotectionist trade barriers (e.g., sugar quotas) and paperworkrequirements.<a href="#2">[2]</a> The huge borrowings needed to financethe federal government gobbled up 62.8 percent of funds raised in ourcredit markets in 1991 and 51.8 percent in 1992.<a href="#3">[3]</a>One would think that, confronted with such huge costs of fear and itsindulgence, most of us would find the case for stoicism and freedomself-evident and overwhelming. Unfortunately, thanks to certain hardfacts of life, it is not so simple as that. 	<p>	Freedom is not a free gift. There is no such thing as somethingfor nothing. Like everything else in life, freedom has a price:responsibility, insecurity, and the possibility of failure, ofunforeseen calamity, of suffering, of paying for the mistakes libertyleaves one free to make.	<p>	To most people these burdens are insupportable, or at least onerous.We are physical beings vulnerable to suffering and aware of ourmortality and therefore all of us are, or have been, or will be, afraidfor our prospects in the material world. Hence human beings areinherently vulnerable to the temptation to indulge fear rather than beashamed of it and strive to override it. And hence we will always facea powerful temptation to enlist government to interfere in the workingsof a free economy to protect ourselves or others from suffering--and toregard such interference as humane and necessary.	<p>	Enthusiasm for liberty tends to vary with the position of the economyin the business cycle. During a boom, with broadening opportunity andrising incomes and living standards, paeans to freedom and freeenterprise abound--witness the business advocates of the nineteenthcentury, the twenties, and the eighties. When prosperity withers, sodoes allegiance to the free market; every economic downturn brings notonly vulnerability to setbacks and actual suffering but also demandsthat the government "do something": "stimulate" the economy, pass ajobs bill, drive down interest rates, protect industries from foreigncompetition, forbid plant closings, provide unemployment compensation,furnish national health care, and on and on.<h4>The Challenge of Freedom</h4><p>	All this raises a hard question: does freedom demand too much ofus? Is it unfeasible for fearful, mortal beings? Fyodor Dostoevskyfeared so. In the famous "Grand Inquisitor" chapter of Dostoevsky's <i>TheBrothers Karamazov</i>, the Grand Inquisitor grimly predicted that Christ'sgift of freedom would be spurned by a humanity fearful for its materialwell-being, and that humanity would trade freedom for guaranteedsustenance:		<p>	Judge Thyself who was right--Thou or he [Satan] whoquestioned Thee then? Remember the first question. Its meaning wasthis: "...nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and ahuman society than freedom. But seest Thou these stones...? Turn theminto bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a flock of sheep,grateful and obedient. though forever trembling, lest Thou withdraw Thyhand and deny them Thy bread."  But Thou wouldst not deprive man offreedom...Thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone. But dostThou know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of theearth will rise up against Thee and will strive with Thee and overcomeThee?...In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet, and say tous: "Make us your slaves, but feed us." They will understand at last,that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together.<ahref="#4">[4]</a>	<p>	The economic collapse of the Soviet empire and the privationsof the Communist bloc's people have demonstrated that on the economics,at least, the Grand Inquisitor was wrong: bread for all isinconceivable without freedom. And during the eighteenth and nineteenthcenturies, Americans and Britons, contrary to the Grand Inquisitor'sassertions, were perfectly willing to risk bread in exchange forfreedom and a chance of perhaps more bread in the future, and so werethe immigrants who came here. That is, they had sufficiently strongcharacters to accept the chances of life, and to function, and functionwell, in a climate of considerable uncertainty offering no guaranteedeconomic payoff for their actions.	<p>	It emerges that freedom is perfectly feasible--but only given acertain sturdiness of character. The burdens of physical and financialinsecurity and personal responsibility being higher in a free economythan in a mixed or socialist one, it stands to reason that thepsychological demands of freedom are in many ways far heavier thanthose of servitude. One need not be sturdy or brave to collectentitlements and be shepherded by regulators and social workers througha life made artificially tidy by miles of red tape. But one does haveto be brave to take one's chances in a free labor market, assumeresponsibility for one's own well-being, make one's own provision forold age and ill-health. And one has to be something of a hero toventure out into the unknown as an entrepreneur, staking one's all onan idea. A sturdy character is required to make freedom work--and tokeep people loyal to freedom in the face of risk and adversity, andbrave enough to face them without appealing to the state for succor.	<p>	It follows as well that if and when wide-spread sturdiness ofcharacter ever gives way to widespread fearfulness, freedom will be introuble, and the Grand Inquisitor will have the grim last laugh.Indeed, amid the current demand for universal health care, one mayalmost hear the Grand Inquisitor whispering to today's "democraticdespots" on the Potomac:  "In the end they will lay their freedom atour feet, and say to us: 'Make us your slaves, but protect us.' Theywill understand at last that freedom and health care for all areinconceivable together."	<p>	Growth of government since the onset of the Great Depression in1929 may be taken as an indicator of an alarming decline of courage inour national life. a decreasing willingness on Americans' part to taketheir chances in a free market and to allow market forces free play.	<p>	In the same period. as many observers have noted, American lifebecame increasingly secularized. This does not mean that most Americansbecame atheists or agnostics. Rather, religion's grip on many peoplesimply weakened; attaining earthly happiness and prosperity became ahigher priority than leading a life pleasing to God. God was not somuch deliberately dismissed as forgotten in the rush to attain anabundant and pleasant lifestyle. In intellectual circles whichunfortunately are also the opinion leaders of American life, atheismand agnosticism did become not only respectable but widespread--notonly on the socialist, secular humanist Left but also on thelibertarian Right, with the rise to fame of the atheist-egoist AynRand.	<p>	These are not merely parallel and unrelated developments. AsAldous Huxley observed, a teleological chain runs from metaphysics allthe way to economics and politics:  "It is in the light of our beliefsabout the ultimate nature of reality that we formulate our conceptionsof right and wrong; and it is in the light of our conceptions of rightand wrong that we frame our conduct, not only in the relations ofprivate life, but also in the sphere of politics and economics. So farfrom being irrelevant, our metaphysical beliefs are the finallydetermining factor in all our actions."<a href="#5">[5]</a>		<p>	Thus one set of metaphysical beliefs will yield oneset of political and economic beliefs, behaviors, and institutions. andanother metaphysic will generate a quite different politics andeconomics. The contrast between the limited government and free economyof early America under the Founding Fathers, most of whom wereChristians or at least theists and who lived in a thoroughly Christianculture<a href="#6">[6]</a> and the total state and rigidly plannedeconomy of the atheist. materialist Soviet Union confirms Huxley'sstatement. A being dignified by possession of an immortal soul has anunalienable right to be free; a mere piece of matter conditioned anddetermined by forces and relations of production does not. 	<p>	Metaphysics affects economics and politics through. among otherchannels. the prevailing attitude of the population. Faith is apowerful wellspring of courage. Faith in God leads to faith inexistence and life themselves. If the world is the work of a benevolentpersonal God, and one is God's child, then it follows that existence isfundamentally good and that the world is one's home in which it ispossible to live, prosper, and work out one's salvation. This bedrockmetaphysical confidence enables one to function: to decide, choose,act--indeed, to run risks. To a person with such psychologicalunderpinnings, the hazards and burdens of the free market aretolerable. With faith in the essential goodness of life and in theultimate outcome, such setbacks as occur can be taken calmly.	<p>	Put another way, religion deflects fear upward, replacing fearof existence with fear of the Lord. In liberating people from fear ofliving, religion makes them fit for freedom.<h4>Religious Decline Breeds Fear</h4><p>	The corollary is that a decline of religion. marked by a loss offaith. yields a decline of courage. Without God, the universe becomesinexplicable and alien. and therefore frightening--and one has no oneto turn to for strength, succor, consolation. Nor does one havemetaphysical grounds for seeing life as fundamentally good or forhaving faith in the future. One's fear of life rises. This in turnyields a weakening allegiance to the free market and a greater demandfor state succor.	<p>	The consequences of religion's decline ramify harmfully inother directions as well. A declining attachment to God goes hand inhand with greater attachment to the things of this world, whichproduces, understandably enough, a greater fear of losing them. Thistoo diminishes willingness to run the risks freedom entails, and moreappeals to government for protection.	<p>	The rising fearfulness attendant on loss of religion results inmore government intervention into a free economy indirectly as well asdirectly. The problems of sin and fear are intertwined. When people areafraid they are more likely to be ruthless in pursuit of theirinterests, partly, perhaps, to create a zone of security and power inan uncertain and frightening world; scruples become unaffordableluxuries, and without belief in a divine Judge, they become impotent tocurb wrong behavior. Hence a frightened, secularized population is morelikely to engage in fraud, breach of contract, rapacious looting ofcorporations (via exorbitant salaries, bonuses, and stock options), andso on. Observers will perceive this conduct as "greed," "selfishcapitalism" and "market failure."  Blind to the underlying cause, theywill proclaim that the market is incapable of policing itself, and sothey will demand more government control.	<p>	Friends of freedom have undoubtedly done well to master anddisseminate economic arguments for free markets and limited government.In economics, liberty's advocates have done the most work, and theachievements of Ludwig von Mises Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman,Henry Hazlitt, Israel Kirzner, and others have been enormous. Grantedtheir premises. their arguments for the market are overwhelming.	<p>	But we delude ourselves if we think that. having demonstratedlogically that the free market is the optimum economic system and thatinterference is dysfunctional, we have routed the enemy. One of thedrawbacks of the assumption of human rationality popular amongclassical liberals and libertarians is that it ill equips its believersfor coping with irrationality. It produces the dangerously optimisticcorollary belief, as the British historian Correlli Barnett wrote,"that once something has been demonstrated to be absurd orself-destructive it is as good as written off. However, while you mayrightly tell a drunkard that drink will kill him if he does not give itup, how do you stop him drinking?"<a href="#7">[7]</a>	<p>	Since the true and perennial enemy of freedom dwells in a partof human nature that is largely irrational, it is no more thansuperficially amenable to rational persuasion. Few people frightened ofinsecurity and hardship are really interested in, or moved by, economicarguments about how freedom and acceptance of risk produce widgets.They do not want abundant widgets, they want their fear to go away. Inthe eyes of the fearful person, the danger is real, and his fear isrational. After all, pain hurts. And anyone promising relief from painor the threat of pain will receive his unwavering support--witness theincredible loyalty of the American electorate to Franklin Roosevelt,the enduring Democratic strength among poor and blue-collar voters, andBill Clinton's support in the 1992 election from those worried abouthealth care.<h4>The Necessity of Soulcraft</h4><p>	Hence to secure the foundations of a free society we must cultivatethe character of the people who live in it. Because fear of sufferingand dread of insecurity are inherent in human nature, and because timeand chance happen to us all, we are always vulnerable to the temptationto seek state succor, and the battle against fear and for freedom mustbe waged anew in every generation. There is no permanent victory.Economic arguments are not enough. Philosophical arguments are notenough. Proofs that yielding to envy, desire for unearned gain, andfear is economically counterproductive are not enough. The onlyeffective antidotes to evil and irrationality are soulcraft andcharacter formation.	<p>	And the greater the erosion of character, the more attentionlovers of liberty must give to it. The first great economist offreedom, Adam Smith, consciously grounded his economic thought in moralcharacter.8 But many later economists of freedom--the thinkers of theManchester School, Carl Menger, Eugen von Bohm-Bawerk, Ludwig vonMises--coming to maturity and formulating their theories and theireconomic defenses of the free economy in societies and culturesgrounded in Christianity, when the underpinnings of soulcraft werestill in place and when civilized people with sturdy characters were sonumerous as to invite being taken for granted, rarely concernedthemselves with the interplay of character and economics. For the mostpart, they did not have to; it was not an issue. Today, with soaringcrime and violence, endemic illegitimacy and divorce, and rampantpursuit of "victim" status, we can almost take fear of living forgranted, and with it widespread repudiation of the free market anddemands for government help. In a disintegrating post-Christian societyfriends of freedom can no longer count on family, church, school, andsociety instilling the metaphysical and other core beliefs underlying asuccessful free economy.	<p>	Unfortunately, no one has ever explained how a free economy canwork in the context of a decadent national character--if indeed it can.Economists, including free market economists, continue to spin theoriesand build models as if the problem did not exist.	<p>	A religious revival would aid the cause of freedom, but religioncannot be preached simply because it supports free societies and freemarkets. Such a pragmatic approach is too cynical to work and would beworse than no effort at all; atheists and statists would see through itimmediately, and the resultant firestorm of disdain would set back thecauses of both freedom and religion.	<p>	Nevertheless, if a return to religion is not feasible unlessand until people are genuinely ready to hear it for the right reasons,friends of freedom should meanwhile grasp every opportunity to preachand reward the virtues that make for a sturdy character, and, betterstill, to provide that most powerful of teachers: a good example. Inthe end, a society--and an economy--is no better than the people in it.And in the end, if character formation and soulcraft are neglected, allthe other work of freedom, however useful, will be in vain.</p><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><a name="1"><li>  Helmut Schoeck, Envy: A Theory of Social Behavior, tr.	Michael Glenny and Betty Ross (New York: Harcourt, Brace &	World, Inc. 1969; Indianapolis, Liberty Fund, 1987)<a name="2"><li>   "Cost of Regulation Isn't Easy to Figure But	Estimates Exist," Wall Street Journal, September 23, 1992. p.	A10.<a name="3"><li>   Federal Reserve Bulletin May 1993, p.

Rockwell, Jr.</h4></center><hr><p>Mr. Rockwell is president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn,Alabama (U.S.A.)  A much longer version of this article will appear in TheIntercollegiate Review.</p><hr noshade><p>	Traditionalists and economic libertarians have more in common inthe culture war than they might think, for capitalism helps create andsustain a conservative culture. The enemy, for all of the genuineRight, is government intervention.<p>	Today, our economy is a mixture of state planning and impairedmarkets that no nineteenth-century observer would have recognized asfree. Barely half of all new wealth survives the tax police. No part ofthe economy, from a grocery store in rural New Hampshire to a cardealership in urban California, is exempt from the toils of a hundredagencies. For all business, our planning apparatus is distinguishedfrom the Soviets' only in degree.<p>	Our labor markets are crippled by anti-discrimination laws,which punish old standards of merit and reward political power. And thewelfare state grows no matter which party is in power, furthersubsidizing the slothful and inept at the expense of the dwindling bandof the productive and energetic.<p>	"Of the many species of liberty which compose the freedom we enjoy,"Michael Oakeshott wrote in The Political Economy of Freedom, "we havelong recognized the importance of two: the freedom of association, andthe freedom enjoyed in the right to own private property." It is thesetwo areas where we have lost the most, with a heavy cultural as well aseconomic cost.<h4>The Welfare State</h4><p>	Under the welfare state, the beneficiaries need not work. Infact, they cannot work if they want to keep getting the checks. Thusthe condition that welfare is supposed to alleviate--poverty,illegitimacy, etc.--is also the condition required for a continued flowof benefits. The welfare state subsidizes, and thus increases, the veryproblems it is supposed to solve.<p>	What's more, welfare takes from earners and gives to non-earners.Thus it not only encourages a something-for-nothing attitude, it alsolegitimatizes the idea that it is moral to take other people's propertywithout their consent--a lesson the government should not be teaching.<p>	The rigorous rules of the market--roughly akin to the New Testamentadmonition that he who doesn't work shouldn't eat--are circumvented inthe welfare state. Add to this an effort to erase the just stigma ofwelfare, and the work ethic is overthrown.<p>	In the market economy, there is a hierarchy of success. But welfareincreases the income and the status of the failures in society. It thusdevalues the older signs of achievement and reduces the market classstructure--especially at the lower end--to a jumble.<p>	Older forms of welfare were provided privately, usually throughreligious institutions that were well aware of its potentiallycorrupting effects. Work was required from those who could do it, andthe "undeserving poor" were treated appropriately. Most important, therules of social advancement were the same for all.<p>	Of course, the old order's free market was not footloose andfancy=free. It produced not what today's libertarians call "freedom,"but a rigid environment of work and saving, and of punishments forthose who failed to do both, as witness the discipline of the companytowns of the laissez-falre era.<p>	Capitalism is as conspicuous for what it requires as for whatit allows. As F. A. Hayek argued in <i>The Constitution of Liberty</i>,"liberty not only means that the individual has both the opportunityand the burden of choice; it also means that he must bear theconsequences of his actions and will receive praise or blame for them.Liberty and responsibility are inseparable."<h4>Group Privilege</h4>	The welfare state "produces the habit of complaining," said Ludwig vonMises, and in response, it long ago moved beyond redistribution ofproperty. If certain groups have failed to get what they think of astheir due, they are able to get themselves designated official victims.This is a culturally corrupting effect in itself, as if failure isalways someone else's fault. The welfare state then forces society totreat these groups as if they had earned what they demanded, especiallythrough anti-discrimination law.<p>	As Oakeshott said, "the freedom which separates a man from slavery isnothing but a freedom to choose and to move among autonomous,independent organizations, firms, purchasers of labor, and this impliesprivate property in resources other than personal capacity."<p>	Yet today, from business to housing to schools to clubs, thefree association that Oakeshott regarded as the difference betweenslavery and liberty is all but gone.<h4>The Family and the Free Market</h4><p>	Not everyone can make his own way in society. Children, of course,require the help of parents, and the elderly require the help of theyoung. These, and many other needs, are met in the family. But themixed economy has displaced private provision with welfare,dramatically weakening the family. For example, Social Security andMedicare have relieved children of the obligation to care for theirelderly parents, as Allan Carlson has shown.<p>	In the present system, the elderly feel betrayed and ignored byeveryone but the government, while grown children can disregard theirobligations with little earthly penalty. There is less respect for oldpeople, which--combined with a culture that glorifiesimmaturity--disrupts the natural hierarchy of age. Largely because ofstate intervention, each generation has become more isolated,self-indulgent, and irresponsible. One only has to contemplate the'"baby boomers."<p>	In a free market, on the other hand, the family thrives. As G.K. Chesterton noted, the family "is at once necessary and voluntary,"and thus needs nothing from government other than the rule of law.<p>	As Mises wrote in Socialism, however, leftist proposals "to transformthe relations between the sexes have long gone hand in hand with plansfor the socialization of the means of production." To Mises,traditional marriage was reinforced by the institutions of capitalism,especially free contract, and because of the contractual nature ofmarriage, he thought that divorce should be allowed in only the mostnarrow circumstances.<p>	It is interventionist government, said Mises, that undermines"age-old moral precepts," and the battle for those precepts is the"great fight" of our age.<p>	The greatest shock in recent decades to the traditional familyhas been the move of married women into the workforce. This puts aheavy strain on marriage (divorce rates have climbed) and especially onchildren, for day care workers can have nothing like a mother's love orinterest in the child.<p>	Why did married women enter the workforce? For the vast majority, itwas to maintain a decent standard of living amidst inflation, which, bydramatically lowering real incomes, destroyed the one-salary family.And such inflation is no natural phenomenon, but the result of centralbanking.<h4>Time and the Market</h4><p>	The most important cultural effect of the mixed economy has beento change the way we think of time. We all want to have our desires metsooner rather than later, but gaining wealth takes time, and successfulpeople are able to put off immediate gratification for future reward.<p>	As might be expected, nineteenth-century America was a disciplinedsociety of people who knew how to wait and save. As T. Alexander Smithnotes in <i>Time and Public Policy</i>, "the culture which the olderbourgeoisie dominated and the values it forged within the social orderwere particularly favorable to lengthy time horizons." Moreover, "thisculture was family centered." As Joseph Schumpeter noted, the"capitalist order entrusts the long-run interests of society to theupper strata of the bourgeoisie."<p>	But interventionism has shortened societal time horizons, andinflation and easy credit are the villains. As Smith says,"credit-created inflation, if it persists for a sufficient period,shortens time horizons, as customs, values, and opinions begin to catchup with the growth of the money supply."<p>	In the nineteenth century, personal and installment loans wereextremely rare. Debt of this sort was considered a sign of vice. Creditbased on the real savings of the American people went to theentrepreneurs who built the country. But a central bank that pushesdown interest rates produces easy credit. It also creates the illusionof low time preference without the reality (a large pool of savings),encouraging business borrowing that cannot be sustained through time,and even bringing about the business cycle.<p>	Other aspects of the mixed economy shorten the social rate oftime preference as well. Welfare subsidizes immediate satisfaction anddiscourages saving. Unemployment insurance discourages saving forpossible job loss, lessens the fear of unemployment and therefore theincentive to work hard, and underwrites indolence for longer and longerperiods, thereby raising the unemployment rate.<p>	Social Security discourages people from saving for their retirement.The inheritance tax discourages saving for future generations. Incomeand property taxes penalize the accumulation of wealth. Taxes onbusinesses reduce their capital and thus their ability to sustainlong-term projects.<p>	As interventionism has rewarded short-term thinking, the behavior andvalues of high time preference has become the cultural norm. The sexualmores, manners, clothes, and music of the underclass, once seen as theevidence of immorality and failure, now attract the favorable attentionof middle-class youth. Instead of the bourgeoisie fulfilling theirnatural leadership role, the lower classes have begun to set the tone.<p>	Edward C. Banfield, in <i>The Unheavenly City</i>, persuasivelyanalyzes classes almost solely in terms of time preference. Theupper-class person "looks forward to the future of his children,grandchildren, great-grandchildren (the family ‘line'), and isconcerned also for the future of such abstract entities" as thecommunity or nation. He is able and willing to sacrifice "presentsatisfaction" so that he, his children, his community, etc., can "enjoygreater satisfactions at some future time."<p>	Middle-and working-class people are progressively less futureoriented, while the lower-class person "lives from moment to moment."Governed by impulse, he is "radically improvident: whatever he cannotconsume immediately he considers valueless. His bodily needs(especially for sex) and his taste for ‘action' take precedence overeverything else"--especially the "routine of work."<p>	And it is the welfare state that skews the time horizons of theupper, middle, and working classes toward the lower class's, asocietally disastrous effect.<h4>Materialism and Greed</h4><p>	Sometimes the word materialist is used as a synonym for capitalist.Yet capitalism, as a system of organizing resources, tends to encouragenot a materialist ethic, but the prudence, thrift, and hard work thatWilhelm Roepke identified (see below). The less free the economy,however, the more materialistic everyone must be. Under Communism,women had to stand in line all day to feed their families and beconstantly on the lookout for the most basic items. The demand formaterial possessions tended to displace other values.<p>	The welfare state also directs man's interest to the least importantmaterial activities. Unlike the free market, as Alexander Shand notesin Free Market Morality, the welfare state "removes from the individualmuch of the responsibility for matters that would be a great concern tohim--his family's health care, old age, and education--and leaves himwith responsibility for choice only in comparative trivialities orluxuries.</p><hr><center>		   <h4> Roepke on Capitalism and Culture</h4></center><ul>	<p>	Wilhelm Roepke gave us the definitive litany of capitalist	institutions in A Humane Economy: "individual effort and	responsibility, absolute norms and values, independence based	on ownership, prudence and daring, calculating and saving,	responsibility for planning one's own life, proper coherence with	community, family feeling, a sense of tradition and the	succession of generations combined with an open-minded view	of the present and the future, proper tension between the	individual and community, firm moral discipline, respect for	the value of money, the courage to grapple on one's own with	life and its uncertainties, a sense of the natural order of things,	and a firm scale of values.	</p></ul><hr><p>	As for greed, capitalism can reward it. So can socialism, and socan the mixed economy. The temptation is unrelated to the degree ofmaterial opportunity. Whether one is striving for a grass hut in aprimitive village or a vacation penthouse in Florida, it is corruptingif done at the expense of family and other deeper responsibilities.</p><h4>Dynamism and Technology</h4><p>	It has often been objected that capitalism's dynamic nature, itstendency to produce technological advances, undermines what T. S. Eliotcalled the permanent things. Yet this concern is misplaced.<p>	Old values do not require old technology. The permanent thingsdo not refer to particular kinds of consumer goods or modes ofproduction. The complex of moral standards and priorities that make upthe good culture cannot be reduced to technical categories. Societalvirtue has nothing to do with whether goods are delivered in trucks orhorse-drawn carts. It is the social commitment to traditional socialinstitutions and patterns of living that matter.<ul>	<p>	It is unfortunate that the phrase democratic capitalism has	become widely accepted.  Capitalism means an economy based	on private property; modern democracy means the violation	and redistribution of private property through political	means.	</p></ul><p>	In previous eras, liberty and democracy were not thought to besynonymous or even necessarily related. The confusion that they are hasled to a subtle assault on property and its resultant social hierarchy.It is thus unfortunate that the phrase democratic capitalism hasachieved such status. Capitalism means an economy based on privateproperty; modern democracy means the violation and redistribution ofprivate property through political means.<p>	The term democratic capitalism is therefore confused, unless itis meant to describe the kind of mixed economy that passes for a freemarket in the U.S., and is therefore deliberately misleading. In fact,the re-establishment of the market economy will require a curtailing ofdemocracy as presently understood.<h4>A Theory of Intervention</h4><p>	Mises argues that any intervention in the economy must lead to others.Interference in the market, which substitutes political power for theprice system, causes more problems. The state then uses these problemsas an excuse for further interventions, which in turn lead to otherinterventions. The same is true of the cultural consequences of themixed economy. For example, the government will point to the failingfamily as justification for more government control even though thefailure is a result of previous interventions. Or the government willannounce that because everyone is engaging in short-term thinking, itmust direct investment toward what it claims is the long term. Thestate, in other words, uses and thrives off the short-term thinking ititself creates.<h4>The Culture War</h4><p>	Anyone who prefers a society of families instead of easy divorce, ofchildren instead of depopulation, of prudence instead of waste, of highculture instead of underclass values, of independence instead of groupprivilege, of saving instead of immediate gratification, ofself-discipline instead of decadence--must favor the free market overthe mixed economy.<p>	Why, then, haven't capitalism and cultural conservatism been happilylinked? Unfortunately, the defense of capitalism sometimes has beenassociated with egalitarianism, anti-clericalism, and general culturalLeftism.<p>	Although they reject government power, market liberals rejectthe authority of family, church, and community, and thus advocatecultural values not only wrong in themselves, but antithetical to thoseencouraged by the free market.<p>	If we are to return to the values of the old republic, culturaltraditionalists must lead the capitalist fight. Because economicinterventionism destroys the culture, that is exactly wheretraditionalists belong.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Society-Free-Market.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Clites</h4></center><hr><p>Roger Clites teaches at Tusculum College in Tennessee (U.S.A.)</p><hr noshade><p>	Those of us who advocate the free market are regularly frustrated inattempts to discuss economic issues with people afflicted with theanti-capitalistic mentality. In many such situations about all we cando is try to part on amicable terms. After all, it's all but impossibleto reason away prejudice.	<p>	However, occasionally I do encounter a mind that is not completelyclosed. In that case I usually can get my ideas heard and considered ifI establish an identity of interests. That is, I try to show mychallenger that we are seeking the same goal, and differ only as to themeans of attaining it.	<p>	In the case of the person who challenges, "I'll bet you are oneof those people who think that we should not have the Federal ReserveSystem" a helpful response might be, "My desire is to have such thingsas a currency that retains its value so that savings, life insurancepolicies and other investments do not lose their value cover time." Ifthe challenger pauses before replying, I might add: "And I'd like tosee an economy without frequent severe downturns." Sometimes this willlead him to respond with an open mind. It won't always do so but mosttimes it will achieve a much more favorable response than does a simplestatement to the effect that yes, we should do away with the FederalReserve System.	<p>	The same type of response can be used in many other economicdiscussions. I once received a telephone call from a woman whodescribed the working conditions of Mexicans who were employed inplants just south of the Rio Grande. I told her that I assumed she wasconcerned about the welfare of those Mexicans from the way shedescribed the situation in which they lived and worked. She assured methat she was. I replied that the Mexicans must see their currentarrangement as their best alternative. This seemed to baffle the womanso she digressed onto other semi-related matters.	<p>	After two or three minutes, she began talking about Mexicans "takingjobs from Americans." I reminded her that initially she had expressedher concern about the living standards of the Mexicans. But now itseemed that she was willing to sacrifice the best alternative of thosepeople whom she considered to be exploited for the interests of somebetter-off Americans. She replied that this "wasn't fair." When I askedhow this was unfair she said that I kept talking about alternatives andthe Mexicans were taking away the Americans' best alternatives. Isuggested that perhaps trying to compete with the low-paid Mexicanworkers was not the better alternative for Americans. I was somewhatsurprised, but pleased, when she replied that she would "have to thinkabout that" before she hung up.<h4>Friendly Persuasion</h4><p>	Sometimes it may not be possible to open the mind of a challenger butif a discussion is taking place where others are present it may bepossible to persuade some of those others of the validity of one'spoint.	<p>	I once attended a meeting in which a young man was insistingthat people should not have to do a certain dirty, dangerous job . Ofcourse he overlooked the fact that the lives of other people could notattain their present levels of comfort if that job were not done. Infact, the job happened to be essential to our overall way of life.	<p>	I asked him why people accepted that kind of work. He respondedthat it was all they could get. I suggested that perhaps it could bedescribed as "the best they can get." He literally shouted, "What's thedifference?" I pointed out that he was proposing to take from thosepeople their best choice. Unable to cope with this reasoning he beganto babble about "people in three-piece suits." At this point Icommented to those nearby that I guessed that the man recognized thecorrectness of my point since he felt compelled to "shoot themessenger." Another man spoke up and said that previously he would haveprobably agreed with the young man but that now he saw that to prohibitthe work in question would hurt those who did it as well as theconsumers who would be denied the service being supplied. Several otherpeople nodded their heads in agreement and the young man bolted fromthe room muttering a curse!	<p>	Before we judge that fellow too harshly we should explore whatled him to his way of thinking. In many cases people who disdain acertain type of work project their own judgment about it onto those whoengage in it. A few years ago a sociologist entered into a study of menwho collected residential trash. One of his basic assumptions was thatthey hated their work. He soon learned, much to his amazement, thatthey found it quite interesting. For example, one trash collector toldthe sociologist that he knew many things about the people whose trashhe collected. To illustrate this he pointed out that the people wholived in one corner house held a "big booze party" every Saturdaynight, as indicated by the quantity of liquor bottles in their trashimmediately thereafter. He knew similar, though less colorful, thingsabout everyone on his route.<h4>Different Standards</h4><p>	Failure to realize that other people may have different standards andvalue judgments than they have often leads some people to becomeneedlessly concerned about the condition of other people. This is oftendue to lack of experience in their own lives. Perhaps I am fortunatethat I have worked in a steel mill, on house construction, and in wheatfields in order to finance my academic training. Someone who has hadhis or her education financed solely by parents, scholarships, andother such sources may have had the best alternative for preparing forhis or her own life taken away by people with perfectly goodintentions.	<p>	I once heard a psychology professor say, "People do what they want todo." It may be the lesser of two or more evils but they choose to dowhat they prefer, given their alternatives. If it can be gotten acrossto well-meaning people that they are harming, not helping, those whoare less fortunate a few of those well-intended people may begin tounderstand the superiority of voluntary action over coercion.<HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Free-Market-Defense.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Alas, his economic program could also failif Congress approves the wrong sort of healthcare reform. The resultcould be a simultaneous medical failure and fiscal disaster.	<p>	Unfortunately, the administration is moving in the wrong directionwith a tax- and regulation-heavy reform proposal. One of the reasonsthat it is more likely to hurt than help is the fact that itsproponents seem as interested in punishing supposed villains as inimproving the lives of patients. Doctors and insurance companies havelong been popular targets of populist wrath; so, too, have beenpharmaceutical companies. For instance, during the 1992 presidentialcampaign President Clinton promised to "stop drug price gouging." Hiswife's task force had little more regard for the drugmakers,complaining of their "sins of the past," including charging thousandsof dollars a year for some drug therapies. Worried one industrylobbyist, "administration officials have made a political calculationthat they need to go to war with us."	<p>	Task-force members responded to analysts who spoke of market-orientedhealthcare reforms by arguing that the marketplace would not limitprices "of singlesource drugs for which there is no therapeuticequivalent," as if the purpose of patents was something other thanallowing inventors to earn a generous reward for their labors. But thePresident apparently shied away from formal price controls because ofopposition from even liberal Democratic legislators. Still, his programwould hit the industry with measures very much like price controls:Medicare would demand a 17 percent (up from 15 percent in the initialdraft) rebate on prescribed drugs, the Secretary of Health and HumanServices could further bargain down prices and refuse to allow thepurchase of drugs deemed to be overpriced, an "Advisory Committee onBreakthrough Drugs" would collect confidential industry information andassess the "reasonableness" of drug prices, and the overall healthcareplan would press people into managedcare insurance plans that wouldlimit access to pharmaceuticals.<p>	Congressmen, too, have been pressing for Controls overprescriptions and prices.  For instance, Senator David Pryor (D-Ark.),chairman of the Special Committee on Aging and a close friend ofPresident Clinton, has long used his committee to demand limits onpharmaceutical prices. He testified before the President's Task Forceon Health Care Reform, complaining that "manufacturers can essentiallyset the launch price, without the health care system having any idea ofwhether the price is 'fair' or even 'reasonable'." Yes, continuedresearch and development is important, he acknowledged, but "that doesnot mean--as a matter of public policy--that the manufacturer should beable to charge whatever the market will bear." Indeed, he argues, thecompanies will gain an unwarranted windfall from the Clinton program'sinclusion of pharmaceuticals, which, in his view, alone warrantsregulating the industry.<p>	Other Congressional critics of the drug industry includeRepresentatives Sonny Montgomery (D-Miss.) and Pete Stark (DCal.), andSenators Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) and Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.). Forinstance, Representative Montgomery has proposed limiting the prices ofdrugs purchased by Veterans hospitals. Representative Stark, supportedby the American Association of Retired Personsl has suggested creatinga U.S. equivalent of the Canadian Patented Medicine Prices Review Boardto slow drug price increases. Senator Dorgan wants to cutpharmaceutical tax credits and create a Prescription Drug Policy ReviewCommission. Senator Kennedy hopes to force drugmakers to provide theirproducts for lower prices to entities funded under the Public HealthService Act.<p>	Even some doctors contend that pharmaceutical prices are toohigh. Columbia University's Paul Meier, a consultant to the Food andDrug Administration. says that ''There's a limit to how much we shouldplay the market." As he explains. ''of someone who finds a pill thatwould save babies from some dreadful fate says, 'I'm charging anoutrageous amount but it's worth it,' I would say that's morallycorrupt." How to set a ''fair" price? Dr. Peter Arno of New York City'sMontefiore Medical Center proposes establishing prices based on thoseof comparable products or drugs in other nations.	<p>	In short, the average American could be forgiven for thinkingthat the drugmakers deserve to be damned. Yet all the attention beinggiven to pharmaceuticals seems odd, given their relatively small rolein the healthcare crisis. Prescription drugs account for roughly eightpercent of total health-care expenditures, half that of three decadesago and far lower than in most European countries. The average consumerdoesn't know that, however, because the government covers a smallershare of drug costs in America, meaning that consumers pay more of theexpense directly and therefore complain more vociferously to theirelected officials. In fact, this goes a long way to explaining whyPresident Clinton and many Congressmen are so busy attempting todevelop well-publicized ''solutions'' to the nonproblems in this area.<h4>A Successful Industry</h4><p>	Before the government "reforms" pharmaceuticals, it needs to recognizethat drugmakers constitute one of America's most successful economicindustries: U.S. firms developed roughly half of the drugs marketedworldwide during the 1970s and 1980s. According to the GeneralAccounting Office, pharmaceutical companies are only one of the 11high-tech industries that it studied which did not lose groundinternationally during the 1980s, but rather ''maintained their strongposition over the decade.'' Between 1973 and 1986, American firmsaccounted for ten times as many drug patents as Germany and Japan, 16times as many as Great Britain, and 20 times as many as France.Research and development spending has grown fifteen-fold from 1970, tomore than $9 billion. R & D also rose significantly as a percentage ofrevenues during the 1980s--at a time when companies are being accusedof price-gouging.	<p>	Moreover, while drugs may be expensive, the lack of drugs isalso expensive. That is. drugs often replace higher-priced medicaloperations and treatments. <i>Actigall</i> dissolves gallstones, for instance,and thereby saves an estimated $2 billion annually precisely because350,000 patients use it. Surgery for ulcers usually runs more thanS25,000, while taking medication may run just $1,000 annually; theresulting savings totals at least $3 billion, even more including theeconomic gain of workers not incapacitated by surgery. Medicine forarthritis and osteoporosis permits some elderly patients to avoidinstitutionalization. Patients who spend $300 a year on drugs to treatangina can thereby avoid coronary bypass surgery running S40.000 or$50,000. The beta-blocker <i>Timolol</i> reduces the number of second heartattacks by 16 percent and saves about $2 billion every year. TheBattelle Institute estimates that for just eight leading diseasesbetween 1968 and 1989 drugs saved 671,000 lives and $83.8 billion.	<p>	Thus, a drug's price tells us nothing about its value. ExplainsDr. Herbert Gladen at the Baltimore VA Medical Center, ''higherpriceddrugs may actually be more costeffective if they have greater efficacy,wider therapeutic range and are less costly to prepare and administer."Indeed. because even expensive prescription drugs are socost-effective, limitations on their use actually increase totalmedical expenses. A 1988 Louisiana State University study, forinstance, warned that if Medicaid, the joint federal-state program forlower-income people, restricted drug coverage, overall costs werelikely to rise between 4.1 and 15.5 percent. Just such an attempt byNew Hampshire to limit the number of prescriptions for Medicaidrecipients caused an upsurge in doctors' visits, hospitalizations, andnursing home admissions. The legislature dropped the ill-consideredregulations within a year.<h4>Are Drug Prices too High?</h4><p>	Are drug prices nevertheless too high? Senator Pryor, for instance,complains that pharmaceutical prices rose far more swiftly than thegeneral inflation rate during the 1980s. Drug prices are higher herethan in other nations, he contends, and new drugs are extraordinarilyexpensive. "While these new drugs helped to reduce hospital stays, andin many cases avoided more costly medical interventions," heacknowledges, "there was no indication that the prices for these drugshad any relationship to their costs of production and development, orwere priced reasonably."	<p>	However, one should always be skeptical of the partisan use ofstatistics, since, when tortured, they will confess to anything. WarnsRobert Goldberg of the Gordon Public Policy Center, the Bureau of LaborStatistics has failed to incorporate such changes as the greateravailability of generics into its figures, meaning that the reporteddrug-price index may be inflated by as much as 50 percent. In any case,for most of the 1960s and 1970s drug-price increases remained below theoverall inflation rate, as well as the cost of medical care. Asinflation waned in the 1980s drug prices followed the overall trendsbut fell less quickly.	<p>	Moreover, by the mid-[980s generic substitutes for brand-namedrugs were entering the market more quickly as a result of legislationpassed in 1984 speeding the FDA approval process. While this stepreduced the cost of older medications, it had the opposite effect onnew releases. Firms found the effective life span of their brandnameproducts to be shorter, forcing them to focus more on the introductionof new products, which typically cost the most, and charge more whenthe drug was released in order to recoup development costs.	<p>	Moreover, the price hikes of the 1980s are not carrying over into the1990s as competition has intensified. "The market for drugs has changeddramatically since 1981, particularly in the last three years," reportsRobert Goldberg. According to the Boston Consulting Group,industry-wide average discounts had quadrupled to 16 percent in 1992over 1987. New drug prices in 1991 and 1992 were 14 percent lower thancomparable products in the past. Some of the cuts were drastic--36percent for new heart drugs, for instance. HMOs, hospitals, and drugmailorder firms were also gaining an increasing share of drug sales andsimultaneously winning discounts of up to 30 percent from list prices.And the pressure for price-cutting will increase as larger number ofdrugs lose their patent protection. Observes Dr. Goldberg, "by 2000,200 drugs with $22 billion in sales will be off patent."	<p>	In any case, politicians today are likely to do no better thanthose who tried over the past several thousand years to set"reasonable" prices for any number of goods and services. Pricesrespond to supply and demand, not moral fervor. There is no objectivestandard by which Senator Pryor or anyone else can call one pricereasonable and another unreasonable. Nor is there anything about themarket that gives participants the power to "price-gouge."	<p>	After all, the market is competitive--there are some 22 majordrug firms, and no company has more than a 7.2 percent share. (Theindustry was even more fragmented in 1962, before more stringentfederal regulatory standards, passed in the aftermath ofthalidomide-induced birth defects, drove smaller companies out ofbusiness. The new FDA "regulations created pronounced economies ofscale for drug innovation, which steadily increased over time," reportsauthor Terree Wasley.) The only way a firtn can gain "monopoly" poweris by developing a good product protected by a patent. Patents,however. are required to induce firms to spend money on research anddevelopment. After all, the average cost of developing a drug runs$359-million. according to the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA).<h4>High Costs of Federal Approval</h4><p>	Much of this expense is due to the federal drug approval process.Companies must convince the FDA that prospective products are not onlysafe but effective; separate applications, which typically run 100,000pages long, are required for different treatments by the sa ne drug.Since 1962 both the total cost of bringing drugs to market, and thelength of time devoted to testing and review, effectively cutting aproduct's patent protection, have more than doubled. In 1984 Congresspassed a measure extending drug patent lives, but that step onlyameliorated, rather than solved, the problem.	<p>	The costs of a process that averages 12 years would be highenough for any industry. But, notes Michael Ward, staff economist atthe Federal Trade Commission, "the very nature of the lengthy drugdevelopment process makes the pharmaceutical industry susceptible toharm from unnecessarily stringent regulations."	<p>	Most importantly, the risks involved are enormous. Pharmaceuticalcompanies find many more dry holes than gushers: 70 percent of newdrugs that reach the market are estimated to lose money. Most never getbeyond the research stage. There are typically 30,000 to 45,000 medicalarticles on drug therapies a year. Government patent grants for drugsusually range between 2,000 and 4,200 a year; companies list about halfthat number as investigational new drugs with the FDA. Another halffall out by Phase Three of the testing process and companies end upfiling applications for barely 80 to 250. The FDA then approves between20 and 60. Concludes Ward, "In all, firms will market about one out ofa hundred of the products for which they have developed patents."	<p>	Studies suggest that the 1962 amendments have had little impacton the introduction of ineffective drugs--companies don't like dudsbecause they don't make money if their products don't work--but havereduced the rate of introduction of new drugs by twothirds and thespeed with which they enter the market by one-half. The United Stateshas also lost some of its edge over other industrialized states, whichpermit the sale of safe and effective drugs still prohibited byWashington. Because patients suffer when they receive no medicine aswell as when they receive bad medicine, on net the tightened federalcontrols have made more Americans sicker and allowed others to die.	<p>	Even so, some critics argue that the drug companies are makingtoo much money. A widely cited OTA study contended that "returns to thepharmaceutical industry as a whole over the 12-year period from 1976 to1987 were higher by 2 to 3 percentage points per year than returns tononpharmaceutical firms, after adjusting for differences in risk."Average industry profits ranged between 13 and 14 percent during the1980s.	<p>	This rate of return hardly seems unreasonable given the veryhigh risks of both failure and regulation, which Robert Goldbergbelieves the OTA has underestimated. In any case, this level of returnis probably not sustainable, given the increasing competition withinthe industry and cost consciousness of consumers. In particular, OTA'sfuture estimates overlook how dramatically generic products have beeneroding brand-name drug prices over the last decade.	<p>	Moreover, Dr. Steve Wiggins, an economics professor at Texas A& M University, suggests that "a common misstep by industry critics isto rely on accounting data to measure industry returns" when suchfigures are "unreliable because accounting conventions require theexpensing of research and development." Wiggins contends that comparedto the cost of capital, drug company returns look far from impressive.He compares the industIy's capital costs, which ran from 15.1 to 17.2percent between 1980 to 1990, with an estimated return of between 13.5and 16 percent, which, he says, indicates "competitive returns."<h4>Research and Development</h4><p>	It is also important to recognize that the industry's profitswere largely channeled into research. Last year the drugmakers spentmore on R &amp;& D, $12.6 billion, than they earned in profit, $10 billion.Industry R &amp; D grew by a 15 percent compound annual rate in the 1980s.As a percentage of sales industry, R &amp;& D approaches 17 percent, nearlytwice that for the rest of the health-care industry and treble that forthe electronics industry. Even the OTA acknowledged that its "findingson returns to pharmaceutical R &amp; D and to the industry as a wholeexplain why R &amp; D expenditures have risen so fast throughout the 1980s.Investors followed the promise of high returns on future innovations."But ignored by the OTA is the fact that a lot of this money, as much asone-third, according to Dr. Goldberg, is going into biotechnology,which is riskier than traditional drug research.<p>	What does all this money produce? The Boston Consulting Grouppoints to a score of new drugs expected to be approved later thisdecade to combat AIDS, allergies, Alzheimer's, asthma, arthritis,cancer, depression, diabetes, glaucoma, herpes, hypertension, obesity,strokes, and many more diseases. With these conditions costing untoldlives and an estimated $400 billion a year, it seems foolish tobegrudge the pharmaceutical industry a healthy return on itsinvestment. Critics should be celebrating the industry's success ratherthan carping about an allegedly "excessive" percentage or two ofprofits.<p>	Unfortunately, new federal restrictions would simultaneouslyraise the industry's cost of capital and reduce its rate of return,forcing firms both to cut R &amp; D and distort their research efforts.Companies would skew their efforts to products that would more easilywin regulators' approval for price increases and also shift money tounregulated investments, such as marketing that would involve less riskand a better return.<p>	The form of price controls wouldn't matter. All would hurtpatients--not by denying them access to current therapies, since thosedrugs are already on the market, but by discouraging new treatmentsfrom appearing. The cost to patients of losing new medicines could bestaggering. Between 1975 and 1989 American firms developed half of the66 top drugs introduced in the marketplace. French enterprises, incontrast, created just three. The most important difference between thetwo nations is government policy. Observes P.E. Barral, "In France, thecalibre of pharmaceutical research is seen as having deteriorated,because severe price control has encouraged French companies to givepriority to small therapeutic improvements which are useful in pricenegotiations. Such systems tend to stifle originality and induce riskaversion." At the same time, drugs accounted for 16.7 percent of Frenchhealth expenditures, twice America's level. Moreover, per capitaspending on drugs is almost three times as high in France.<p>	Health-care reform should involve a search for answers, not villains.In the case of pharmaceuticals, the system is working: A highlycompetitive industry is leading the world in the discovery andmarketing of new treatments and cures. Although drugmakers have anincentive to invest heavily in R &amp; D, pharmaceuticals account for alower proportion of total medical expenditures than in socializedsystems. while at the same time helping to hold down overall medicalexpenses. If the administration and Congress nevertheless put ideologybefore prudence and tighten controls over the drug industry, they riskkilling the golden goose that has provided so many benefits for so manypatients.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Pharmaceutical-Industry.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Cleveland and Brian  H. Stephenson</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Cleveland is an associate professor of  finance at BirminghamSouthern College,  Birmingham, Alabama (U.S.A.)  Mr.  Stephenson is astudent there</p><hr noshade><p>	Despite being motivated by apparent concern for the poor,  governmentefforts to redistribute income have failed. Decades  of U . S. welfareprograms have failed to rescue both the urban  and the rural poor. Theonly way to maximize economic well-being  for all is to rely uponindividual choice and responsibility,  not income redistribution.	<p>	In order to transfer income to some citizens, government must first take income from others. The more government attempts to redistribute wealth, the less wealth it finds to redistribute. Ultimately, such action consumes capital, depletes wealth, and  ends inwidespread hardship and increasing despair.<a name="1r"></a>	<p>	The Soviet and British experiences with redistributionist  philosophyserve as excellent examples in demonstrating that  redistribution onlyproduces a greater need for redistribution.  For example. the Englishwelfare state has led to an  unemployment rate of over 10 percent.<a href="#1">[1]</a> It is interesting to  note that both the rate and theamount of transfer payments  have quadrupled since World War II. Thus,as more money is diverted to support more unemployed citizens, moremust be  taken from the remaining producers in the economy. At the margin, the incentive to work continues to fall and the economy spirals downward. 	<p>	Some people immediately challenge this proposition. They  suggestthat eliminating popular social assistance programs  would lead to thedemise of all concern for the poor.  Proponents ofgovernment-subsidized housing, welfare, and health care point outthe economic value of our poor. and are quick to  remind us thatAmerica’s great prosperity sprang from the  depths of our slums. Theyargue that it was the poor. the  uneducated, and the unskilled thatcame together and  transformed this country into an industrial giant.	<p>	Making a comparison of today's poor with earlier immigrants isfrivolous because our forebears were different from todays  poor. Thepeople who came to America in decades past made  sacrifices to build alife for themselves in a free country.  They abandoned theirpossessions and embraced the hope of a new  land, a new life, and abetter home. On the other hand today’s poor are often discouraged andunwilling to seek  opportunities. Most early Americans embracedopportunity with  hope, but today's poor possess no such general zeal.If we wish  to redevelop a spirit of hope among today’s poor, we must reject the plea for government-induced equality, and instead  replicatethe circumstances faced by those who carved out a  living forthemselves and their families in earlier  generations.	<p>	That earlier reality offered little public assistance. It was market-driven, and those who failed relied largely on the  compassionand private charity of their neighbors to help them  in times of need.	<p>	Our forefathers possessed a sense of responsibility far greater than that generally displayed today because they knew no one  wouldsubsidize their complacency. They carefully considered  the choicesthey made, and lived with the knowledge that they  had ultimateresponsibility for the consequences of their  actions. Too many peopletoday have no such understanding. They  live with the assurance thatregardless of their actions,  government will force society to lookafter them. This  mentality separates them from early Americans.Perhaps a modern  example can clarify the issues.<h4>Eric's Story</h4>	<p>	Eric is a young black acquaintance struggling to improve his life. He is determined to better his situation in spite of his disadvantaged environment and childhood. Eric worked to pay his  waythrough an expensive Catholic prep school, and is currently  puttinghimself through college. His path has not been  unscathed and therehave been times when it would have been  easier for him to quit. Forexample, last summer Eric was in an  automobile accident that almosttook his eyesight and his life.  During his stay in the hospital, heaccumulated medical bills  of nearly $10,000. Regrettably, he had nomedical insurance.	<p>	It would have been easy for a person of lesser character to  give upand seek relief through government programs, but Eric  did not choosethat route. Instead, he chose to focus on his  goals, left college fora semester to pay off his medical  bills, and then returned to schooldebt-free and ready to make a  better life for himself. Eric’s story issignificant in that it  shows his determination to endure hardship inorder to reach  his goals. In the process of endurance, Eric'scharacter is  being developed and his prospects for future success arebeing  enhanced.	<p>	Eric personifies how individual responsibility is a far better foundation for the promotion of economic well-being for two  reasons.First, Eric had to recognize that no one made or  influenced him todrive. fall asleep at the wheel of his car,  and run into a telephonepole, nor did anyone force him to go  without medical insurance. Thesewere decisions that Eric made  freely, privately, and with theknowledge of their potential  consequences. Secondly, had Eric acceptedgovernment assistance    to remain in school, he would not      larnedfrom his  mistakes. People learn the most from their errors when they persevere through the hardship of the consequences that result  fromthem.	<p>	In addition to these issues, there is the question of equity. The government does not “own” $10,000 to pay for Eric's medical  bills.To obtain that money it must take it from someone else.  Given thenature of government as collective force, this action  is tantamount totheft. No one wins from a long-term system of  public theft.	<p>	History has demonstrated that government cannot successfully alleviate poverty. In fact, government redistribution actually  leadsto impoverishment because it promotes the disregard for  propertyrights.<p>	There is nothing wrong with empathizing with the pain and  sufferingthat people endure, or with showing mercy to those  who are suffering.Private charity must be responsible so that  it does not promoteirresponsible behavior. However a problem arises when handouts arepresumed to be a right or entitlement. When government force is used tofund charitable activities, the result is a system of public theftwhich  exacerbates profligacy in society. If we truly wish to help thepoor and unfortunate we must recognize the importance of  individualresponsibility, not government redistribution, as  the foundation forstimulating economic well-being and character  development.</p><hr>	<h4>End Note</h4>	<ol><p><a name="1"></a><li>Robert J.

He also made major contributions to thecritique of Keynesian economics and the foundations of morality.This article first appeared in the Fall 1976 edition of ModernAge, pp. 395-401.</p><hr noshade><p>	H. L. Mencken was fond of saying that most of the problems men agonizeover are inherently insoluble. A haphazard search among his books hasfailed to turn up a supporting quotation, and perhaps my memorymisleads me. He may merely have said "some," not "most" problems. Inthe latter case, at any rate, I agree with him. I would include atleast two whole categories of problems among the insoluble ones. First,all problems commonly classed as metaphysical, ontological orcosmological—such as "How can we tell the really real from theapparently real?" or "What was the First Cause?," or "What is mankindhere for?," or "What is the purpose of the universe?" And so on. Thesecond category contains all the really basic political problems.<p>	There are differences, of course, in what is meant by ''insolubility"as applied to each of these sets of problems. The metaphysical problemsare forever insoluble because man's limited five senses, narrowexperience, and finite mind cannot possibly encompass eternity,"ultimate" reality, or infinity. The basic political problems on theother hand, are insoluble because . . . well, for one thing, because weare not even sure what we mean by a "solution."<p>	Suppose we address ourselves to this problem first. What is a"solution"? It is easy to cite an illustration. A man's car fails tostart on a cold morning. He finds that his battery is dead, or that hisspark plugs are fouled, or that a wire is disconnected, or that thecarburetor is flooded, or that he has run out of gas. Once this basic"cause" is discovered, he probably knows how to fix it or have itfixed. Or. again, the man feels some distress; and his doctoridentifies it as diabetes and prescribes insulin. Once a doctor hascorrectly diagnosed a disease with a known palliative or cure, he has"solved" his problem.<p>	In the physical sciences, then, the problems commonly arise becausesomething is working unsatisfactorily, and if we have identified A asthe cause and M as the solution, we know we have found the cause andthe cure if we can in that and similar cases make things worksatisfactorily once again.<p>	But when we turn to the social sciences, and particularly topolitics, this kind of certainty or confidence is no longer to befound. Let's take a typical broad problem: what should the state doabout the poor and the needy? Historically the answers have run fromnothing to everything. The nothing answer has run typically like this:"It is not the function of the state to try to help the needy orprovide relief. The proper function of the state is simply to preventforce, them and fraud, and maintain internal and external peace."<p>	Such an answer immediately confronts obstacles of several sorts. Thefirst concerns its humanity or even its practicality. Suppose, forexample, that a child has been hit by an automobile and is foundbleeding and unconscious in the street. Are we to hope that whoeverfinds him proves to be a good Samaritan? And also well enough off tohave the child driven to a hospital and to guarantee to pay the bill ifthe parents are not found or are unable to do so?<p>	"All right," the answer may come, "let the state at least provide foremergency help of this sort." But how far shall we carry this answer?How far shall we extend the definition of "emergency" help? Should thestate pay every hospital bill of everybody who claims he cannot pay?Should it put everybody on relief who claims he cannot find a job? Howhigh should the relief be? At just what level will it seriouslyundermine the incentives to find or hold jobs? At just what level willit undermine the incentives to work and save of the taxpayers who areasked to support the idle? At just what level will it bankrupt thestate? <h4>Government and the Needy</h4><p>	There are people who are untroubled by these questions. They want to"guarantee everybody a decent job," or a minimum income, or evenequality of income, regardless of all individual differences of effort,ability, or contribution, regardless of the effect on incentives,regardless of any other social consequence. So, in fact, not onlyhistorically but today, the answers to the questions "What shallgovernment do about the needy?" still run from nothing to practicallyeverything.<p>	Most people who have given serious thought to the problem haveproposed or accepted some compromise. A typical compromise proposal isthat we should assure the needy or the unemployed an "adequate" reliefpayment for a "reasonable" time, but not enough to "undermine theirincentives" to find jobs or improve themselves, and not enough toundermine the incentives of the working and productive taxpayers whoare being asked to shoulder the bill.<p>	There are inherent difficulties in this compromise. It is somethingof a self-contradiction. If the relief recipient himself considers hisdole "adequate," this is almost equivalent to saying that he has noincentive to take a job or otherwise expend effort to increase it. Atall events, the compromise lacks any precision. On the one hand, even ahigh standard dole may fail to meet the urgent needs of some families.On the other hand, almost any dole of any amount may tend to underminesome people's incentive to a certain extent. As a result of suchdifficulties, it is hard to get any two people to agree on what shouldbe the amount of a proposal or actual dole, or on who should beeligible for it, or how long or under what conditions it shouldcontinue to be paid. So there are hundreds of different answers tothese questions.<p>	I do not use this last figure rhetorically but literally. Itcan be illustrated even within our own country. If we take thefederally financed program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children,we find that the average monthly payment per recipient in August, 1975,for example, was different for each of the fifty states, ranging from$14.41 in Mississippi to $105.39 in Alaska. In the "general assistance"program we find a similar range of variation for the same month--from$11.94 per recipient in Mississippi to $144.95 in the District ofColumbia. And when we turn to state unemployment insurance systems,even though these also are federally aided, we find not only a similarwide range in weekly benefits, but in the proportion that the benefitsbear to the recipient's previous wages, and in the number of weeks ineach year for which such benefits are payable.<p>	When we come to comparing not only different states in our owncountry but different countries, we encounter an enormously greaterrange of differences in both the amounts and formulas used forcalculating relief or so-called unemployment insurance payments. GreatBritain, for example, pays its unemployed three-quarters of theirprevious salaries (which makes its recent prolonged unemployment ratenot surprising). In many countries, on the other hand, nothing whateveris paid for unemployment insurance or even relief--not primarily becausenational sentiment does not favor it, but because the funds do notexist.<p>	If we turn from relief to, say, education, we find a similarwide range of opinion and practice among national governmentsconcerning how much education to make compulsory or how much the stateshould pay for. It ranges from governments that provide no education atall, through those that provide free public schools, or free highschools, or subsidized college and university education. The prescribedage ranges for compulsory education are similarly wide.<p>	There is one generalization we can make that applies both torelief and education, and, in fact, to any other intervention of thestate, once the principle has been granted that it should be allowed toundertake that function at all. The intervention will tend to beindefinitely expanded. The individual amount of relief will tend togrow, the period of payment to be lengthened, the eligibilityrequirements to be relaxed, the number of recipients to be enlarged,and additional forms of relief to be piled on to those already offered.The like will tend to apply to the length and coverage of stateeducation. Public expenditures will always tend to grow. Because of thepoliticians fear of increasing taxation correspondingly, deficits willbe increasingly tolerated and rationalized, and inflation will appearand tend to accelerate.</h4>The Limits of the State</h4><p>	In the last hundred years the historic tendency nearly everywhere hasbeen a constant increase in government intervention in the economy, aconstant increase in government paternalism and in government power.Each new power that any government has acquired has almost inevitablybeen used by it to obtain still further powers . It is hardly to bewondered at that a small but perceptibly growing number of politicalthinkers are beginning in desperation to go beyond even their previousbelief that the role of the state should be limited to trying merely toprevent force and fraud, and have begun to advocate a completeabolition of the state.<p>	It is hard not to feel some sympathy with them. It is pleasant,indeed, to draw up attractive pictures of what an ideal anarchisticsociety would be like. But all these dreams would be shattered by thealmost certain outcome. If there were no established government, thecountry would be taken over by the criminals and gangsters. Eventuallyone gang would subdue or wipe out its rivals, and that gang wouldbecome the new de facto government. It would systematically exacttribute from all the rest of us, only this would again in time becalled taxes. In brief, it is impossible to maintain a peaceful anarchyunless some authority is set up to enforce it.<p>	This points, indeed, to the probable origin of the state. Weneed look no further back than the middle of the last century when the"vigilance committees" were formed in our own wild West. One of thesefor example, was organized in San Francisco in 1851, and promptlyarrested, tried, and hanged a goodly number of desperadoes. If this andsimilar committees had not been formed in California and elsewhere thedesperadoes themselves would no doubt in time have become the de factogovernment.<p>	But we need not speculate afresh at this time concerning the probableorigin of government. That has already been done quite satisfactorilyand by no one better than by David Hume in his essay ' Of the Origin ofGovernment" in the mid-eighteenth century. His conjectures are at onceso simple and plausible that they warrant direct quotation: 	<ul>	<p>	It is probable that the first ascendant of one man over multitudes	began during a state of war, where the superiority of courage	and of genius discovers itself most visibly, where unanimity	and concert are most requisite, and where the pernicious effects of	disorder are most sensibly felt. The long continuance of that	state, an incident common among savage tribes, inured the people to	submission; and if the chieftain possessed as much equity as prudence	and valor, he became, even during peace, the arbiter of all	differences, and could gradually, by a mixture of force and consent,	establish his authority. The benefit sensibly felt from his influence	made it cherished by the people, at least by the peaceable and	well-disposed among them; and if his son enjoyed the same good	qualities, government advanced the sooner to maturity and perfection;	but was still in a feeble state till the farther progress of	improvement procured the magistrate a revenue, and enabled him	to bestow rewards on the several instruments of his administration,	and to inflict punishments on the refractory and disobedient.	Before that period, each exertion of his influence must have	been particular, and founded on the peculiar circumstances of	the case. After it, submission was no longer a matter of choice	in the bulk of the community, but was rigorously exacted by the	authority of the supreme magistrate.	</p></ul>	<p>	There may have been somewhere, as a few eighteenth-centuryphilosophers dreamed, a group of peaceful men who got together oneevening after work and drew up a Social Contract to form the state. Butnobody has been able to find an actual record of it. Practically allthe governments whose origins are historically established were theresult of conquest--of one tribe by another one city by another, onepeople by another. Of course there have been constitutionalconventions, but they merely changed the working rules of governmentsalready in being.<p>	But however the state may have originated historically, we confront afundamental dilemma: No small group of men, and certainly no singleman, can be completely trusted with the power to rule, yet somebodymust be trusted with that power. And if we cannot peacefully agree onwho is to be granted that power, and how much, somebody is going toseize it by force, and impose whatever coercion he finds expedient. Sosome limited power must be voluntarily granted to somebody to rule. Butthis one practical conclusion merely presents us with a score offurther problems. What limits should we set on this power? How can wehold the selected rulers within these limits? Who is to do theselecting? By what process? For how long a term?<p>	Concerning most of these problems we have been able to arrive,at best, at only makeshift and temporary agreement. In addition, inpolitics we confront, so to speak, a double layer of problems. Supposeone of us is able to devise an ideal form of government. Suppose he hasfound exactly where to draw the limits around the powers that ought tobe granted to a government. How does he convince a majority of hisfellow citizens that his answers are right? And what dependable devicesdoes he propose to hold government powers within the limits he hasprescribed?<p>	In the West there is some semblance of political agreement becausemost of us accepted some time ago a magic password--democracy. If itwere not the best of all conceivable forms of government, then, as thecomfortable joke went, it was at any rate the "least worst." Yet wenever quite arrived at any agreement even about the meaning of theword. Does it mean merely government by majority consent, or must therebe majority "participation"? And which majority? Of the wholepopulation? Of adults? Of male adults: Of "eligible" voters? And whatshould be the requirements for voting eligibility—of age, property,literacy, language? Hardly any two governments set exactly the samestandards.<p>	And does democracy mean presidential government or a parliamentaryform? Here, again, in practice, we find endless variety. I implied, awhile back, that democracy has become almost a religion; yet perhapsthis statement should be put in the past tense. Even a superficialobserver can begin to detect a declining faith in it. Almost everywherewe look--in Latin America, Africa Asia, Eastern Europ--we find a similarpattern or cycle repeating itself: full democracy--the welfarestate--inflationism--a trend toward socialism or Communism--and then amilitary dictatorship either to preserve or reverse the trend. Even inrecent months we have seen the great subcontinent of India changedalmost overnight, and without a shot being fired, from an apparentdemocracy to one-woman rule....<p>	Americans have come a long way since 1917, when they went towar, under Woodrow Wilson's slogan, "to make the world safe fordemocracy." Yet if many in the West have been losing their faith, andbeginning to wonder how to make the world safe from democracy, theyhave found no definite alternative. There are today more than 130separate nations. Some of them have parliamentary governments, somepresidential; some of them are extreme democracies, some absolutedictatorships. But no government is precisely like the other. In fact,few of them are precisely like they were a little while ago or will bein a little while from now.<p>	It is not merely that nations are constantly changing theparticular persons or parties in power; they seem to be chronicallydissatisfied with the very nature of their governments. Thumb throughan annual like <i>The Statesman's Year-Book</i> at haphazard. You willfind Costa Rica: "The constitution," promulgated on 7 Dec. 1871, hasbeen modified very frequently, last in 1949." Or Nicaragua: It had anew constitution in 1963. "On 31 August 1971 the Congress voted infavor of dissolution of the Constitution. A 100 member ConstituentAssembly started its discussions on a new Constitution in May 1972." OrGuatemala: "Following the revolution of June 1954 the Constitution of1945 was replaced in August 1954 by a 'Political Statute.' On 1 March1956 a new Constitution came into force. This Constitution was in 1963replaced by a Fundamental Charter of Government. A new constitution waspromulgated on 15 September 1965 with effect from 6 May 1966."	<p>	We seem to have made very little advance since the sixteenth century,when the Reverend Richard Hooker was writing "He that goeth about topersuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as they oughtto be, shall never want [for] attentive and favorable hearers."<p>	So where are we left? Generations of mankind, and great philosophers,have wrestled with these basic political problems, and said somepenetrating things about them--Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes,Locke, Montesquieu, Hume, Rousseau, Burke, Bentham, the Mills, Spencer,Dicey, Acton .... But have they come up with anything that the majorityof our contemporaries are willing to accept as definitive? And cantheir successors ever hope to do so? Is it possible to lay down inpolitics any propositions to which we can confidently add: Q.E.D.? Canwe prove anything? In brief, is such a thing as political sciencepossible?<p>	Raising this question reminds me that at least one of the greatphilosophers mentioned above, Hume, published an essay in 1752 with thevery title: "That Politics May be Reduced to a Science." That aphilosopher remembered chiefly for his skepticism would venture toraise such a hope seems especially encouraging. Yet a modern readerwill find the argument of Hume's essay vague and disappointing,consisting of a few generalizations, drawn partly from a priori groundsand partly from history, that strike one as plausible but hardly asproved.<p>	And yet--there may be examples in one or two other social disciplinesto give us reasons for hope. By the reasoning and research of scholars,and more particularly by thousands of judicial decisions, jurisprudenceor legal philosophy, has been raised to the level of a near-science. Wefind there an increasing area of accepted and established principle,and neither the enormous diversity in theory or practice that we findin the wider area of politics.<p><a name="1r"><a name="2r"><a name="3r"><a name="4r"></p><p>	Still more promising is what has been achieved in economics.Since the eighteenth century a series of great thinkers including Hume,Adam Smith, Ricardo, Bentham,  Menger, Bohm-Bawerk, and Ludwig vonMises have succeeded in creating a genuine social science. As describedby Mises: "Economics is the youngest of all sciences .... It opened tohuman science a domain previously inaccessible and never thought of."<ahref="#1">[1]</a> It "deals with a regularity in the concatenation andsequence of phenomena that is valid in the whole field of humanaction."<a href="#2">[2]</a> Economics, in fact, is merely a branch,though the hitherto best elaborated branch, of 'praxeology"—the scienceof human action. "In all its branches this science is a priori, notempirical. Like logic and mathematics, it is not derived fromexperience; it is prior to experience. It is, as it were, the logic ofaction and deed."<a href="#3">[3]</a> "It is a science that aims at theascertainment of universally valid laws of human conduct."<ahref="#4">[4]</a><p>	True, this is not the description of economics that we commonlyget. It is--or at least once was--almost peculiar to Mises. But itcorrectly describes, I think, the nature of modern economics, which wasnot put on a truly scientific basis until the appearance of theso-called Austrian school of thinkers. It is very important to keep inmind, of course, what kind of science economics is.  It has its ownmethodology. It is a mistake to try to turn it into an imitation of thephysical sciences. It is an absurdity to assume, for example, that wecan use it to predict the general economic future, and say what thecourse of profits or employment or GNP is going to be in the next sixmonths or the next year—though hundreds of professional forecasterspretend that they can do just that. There are too many thousands ofimponderable factors to be taken into account. All such predictionsmust forever remain mere guess work.<p>	But predictions of a certain kind always with the proviso"other things remaining equal"--can confidently be made. We know, forinstance, that if the government attempts to fix the price of anycommodity or service below what the unhampered market would produce,then—"other things remaining equal"—it will inevitably bring about ashortage of that commodity or service. We know that if a governmentissues more money faster than more goods are produced, it will bringabout inflation and raise prices. We know that if a government makesits own irredeemable paper money legal tender, while gold or silvercoin remain outstanding, people will pay off their debts in theirredeemable paper money and hold on to their coins: "Bad money drivesgood money out of circulation." And we can make hundreds of otherpredictions of the same kind. We know that any government interventionin the market must in the long run produce results unforeseen by itsadvocates, and usually less satisfactory even in their judgment thanthe situation they were trying to improve. And we know this not becausethat was the result of a previous similar intervention, but inevitablyfrom the inherent nature of the action.<p>	Any hopes for the future, however, based on the analogy of whatwe have achieved in economics, cannot excuse us from recognizing thepresent, still wretched state of the theory of politics. Can we someday get beyond such basic dilemmas as the one we formulatedearlier--that no small group of men, and no single man, can becompletely trusted with the power to Ale, yet that someone must betrusted with at least some power to rule? Can we eventually build up aseries of interconnected propositions, a solid edifice of theory, thatwill be entitled one day to be recognized as a science? Perhaps. Butright now that day seems far, far distant.</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol>	<p><a name="1"><li>Human Action, p. 1.	<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li> Theory and History, p. 203.	<a href="#2r">Return</a><p><a name="3"><li>Epistemological Problems of Economics, pp. 12-13.	<a href="#3r">Return</a><p><a name="4"><li>Ibid., p. 68.	<a href="#4r">Return</a></ol><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Politics-is-Insoluble.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

In a recent interview in Reason magazine, Professor Friedmanhappily proclaims that most economists agree on certain fundamentals."You won't find much difference of opinion on the proposition thatraising the minimum wage will cost jobs. You won't find much differenceof opinion on the desirability of free trade."	<p>	I wish Professor Friedman were right, but unfortunately, I'mafraid the profession is moving further away from consensus toward anAge of Confusion. Judging from recent conflicting studies, theyapparently can't even agree on the evils of the minimum wage andprotectionism.	<p>	<a name="1r"><a name="2r">Will increasing the minimum wagecost jobs? Economic theory asserts that if you raise the cost of labor,the demand for workers will decrease. Yet in a recent study of theminimum wage at fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,economists David Card and Alan Krueger claim just the opposite.Surprisingly, they conclude, "We find that the increase in the minimumwage increased employment."<a href="#1">[1]</a> Both teach at PrincetonUniversity, and Professor Card was recently honored with the John BatesClark Award for the most outstanding economist under the age of 40. Thearticle has created a furor, however, with counter-studies questioningthe reliability of the Card-Krueger data, which was based entirely ontelephone interviews with restaurant managers. A similar study based onactual payroll records contradicts the Card-Krueger conclusions.<ahref="#2">[2]</a> Nevertheless, the Clinton administration's supportfor an increase in the minimum wage is based in part on thecontroversial Card-Krueger study.	<p>	<a name="3r">Academic economists are also taking pot shots atanother sacred cow, the virtue of free trade. A recent work by PaulBairoch, professor of economic history at the University of Geneva,claims that protectionism is not at all bad and in fact has generallyhad a positive impact on economic growth. After surveying therelationship between tariff rates and GDP data for industrial nationssince 1846, he asserts that many industrial nations often sufferedrecessions when free trade was adopted and recovery when protectionismwas imposed. Great Britain is the only major exception, he notes.<ahref="#3">[3]</a><h4>The Flaw in Empirical Studies</h4><p>	The problem with these historical studies is not just the data,but the whole issue of linking one set of data with another. In logic,it's known as the <i>post hoc ergo propter hoc</i> fallacy. Just because oneobservation occurs at the same time as another doesn't necessarily meanone causes the other. It is sheer folly to isolate one factor among thecomplex mix of factors playing a role in economic activity. Correlationdoes not mean causation.	<p>	For example, several years ago, in the midst of a recession,the state of Utah raised taxes. Since then, the economy has boomed. Didthe tax increase cause the recovery in the Utah economy? In fact, itwas outside forces that stimulated economic growth--in particular, ahuge transfer of people and wealth from California to Utah and otherWestern states. Earthquakes, bad weather, crime, taxes, and a host ofother problems caused Californians to flee the state. California's losswas Utah's gain. In other words, Utah recovered in spite of, notbecause of, the tax increase. No doubt Utah's economy would have grownfaster had it not raised taxes.	<p>	The debate over deficit spending is another example of the <i>posthoc</i> fallacy. Sound economic theory states that deficit spending by thefederal government raises interest rates and crowds out privateinvestment, thereby retarding growth. Yet apologists for the deficit,including some supply-siders, use the 1980s to repudiate this view.During the 1980s the deficits ballooned but interest rates fell.Therefore, they argued, deficits don't matter.	<p>	They miss the point. Crowding out still took place. The economycould have grown significantly faster in the 1980s if governmentspending had been cut sharply, eliminating the deficit and even runninga surplus. Interest rates could have fallen much more than they did,thereby stimulating more growth.<h4>The Battle Enjoined</h4><p>	Back to the minimum wage issue. Even if we accept as valid thedata from Messrs. Card and Krueger, how is it possible for employmentto rise following an increase in the minimum wage? One possibleexplanation—and I emphasize the word "possible" because there could bea variety of explanations is that New Jersey raised its minimum wage inearly 1992, just when it was emerging from a recession. A sufficientlystrong recovery in the New Jersey economy could easily mask theill-effects of an 18 percent jump in the minimum wage.	<p>	Similarly, in Professor Bairoch's defense of protectionism, thefact that Great Britain is a glaring exception to his thesisdemonstrates the complexity of the issues involved. Interestingly, hechooses the period 1870-92 in the United States as his best example:the U.S. increased its protectionism while enjoying one of the mostrapid periods of growth in its history. Yet he forgets that 1870-92followed after a devastating civil war, where no growth occurred at alland over 600,000 soldiers lost their lives. During the post-warenvironment, the federal government shifted from an inflationarygreenback period to a gold standard, interest rates fell sharply, thepopulation grew rapidly, transportation exploded, and manufacturingoutput increased dramatically. How can Professor Bairoch tie tarifflegislation to the vast changes in economic activity during thisperiod, especially given the relatively small role of foreign trade inU. S. output?<h4>Beware of False Relationships</h4><p>	<a name="4r">The above challenges to free-market fundamentalsdemonstrate a serious flaw in the way some economists conduct theirresearch. As I have shown, trying to prove or disprove a theory throughempirical observation is highly problematic. It was Ludwig von Miseswho first raised this fundamental methodological issue. ''The truth isthat the experience of a complex phenomenon . . . can always beinterpreted on the ground of various antithetic theories."<ahref="#4">[4]</a> 	<p>	Laboratory experiments are proper in the physical sciences, butthey are practically impossible to duplicate in economics. Historycannot prove a theory, only deductive logic can.</p><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>David Card and Alan B.

Reed</h4></center><hr><p>Lawrence W. Reed, economist and author, is President ofThe Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a free marketresearch and educational organization headquartered inMidland, Michigan (U. S. A.)</p><hr noshade><p>	Imagine playing a game baseball, cards, "Monopoly" or whatever--inwhich there was only one rule: anything goes.<p>		You could discard the "instruction book" from the start andmake things up as you go. If it "works," do it. If it "feels good," whynot? If opposing players have a disagreement (an obviousinevitability)--well, you can just figure that out later.	<p>	What kind of a game would this be? Chaotic. frustrating,unpredictable, impossible. Sooner or later, the whole thing woulddegenerate into a mad free-for-all. Somebody would have to knock headstogether and bring order to the mess.	<p>	Simple games would be intolerable played this way, but for manydeadly serious things humans engage in--from driving on the highways towaging war--the consequences of throwing away the instruction book canbe almost too frightful to imagine.	<p>	The business of government is one of those deadly serious things andlike a game run amok, it's showing signs that the players don't caremuch for the rules any more, if they even know them at all.	<p>	Don't think for a moment that by use of the term "players" I'mpointing fingers at politicians and somehow absolving everyone else ofresponsibility. In a sense, all of us are players; it's just that someare more actively so than others and of those who are active some aremore destructively so than the rest. At the very least, every citizenhas a stake in the outcome.	<p>	The most profound political and philosophical trend of our timeis a serious erosion of any consensus about what government is supposedto do and what it's not supposed to do. The "instruction books" on thismatter are America's founding documents, namely the Declaration ofIndependence and the original Constitution with its Bill of Rights. Inthe spirit of those great works, most Americans once shared a commonview of the proper role of government—the protection of life andproperty.	<p>	Jefferson himself phrased it with typical eloquence: "<i>...Stillone thing more, fellow citizens wise and frugal government, which shallrestrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise,free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, andshall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This isthe sum of good government</i>."	<p>	Today, there is no common view of the proper role of governmentor, if there is one, it is light-years from Jefferson's. Far too manypeople think that government exists to do anything for anybody any timethey ask for it, from day care for their children to handouts forartists.	<p>	Former Texas Congressman Ron Paul used to blow the whistle whenever abill was proposed that violated the spirit or the letter of theConstitution. How were his appeals received by the great majority ofother members of Congress? "Like water off a duck's back," Paul oncetold me.	<p>	In a series of lectures to high school classes one day last October,1 asked the students (most of whom were seniors) what they thought theresponsibilities of government were. I heard "Provide jobs" far moreoften than I heard "Guarantee our freedoms." (In fact, I think the onlytime I heard the latter was when I said it myself.)	<p>	An organization called the Communitarian Network made news recentlywhen it called for government to make organ donations mandatory, sothat each citizen's body after death could be "harvested" for thebenefit of sick people. A good cause, for sure, but is it really a dutyof government to take your kidneys?	<p>	Americans once understood and appreciated the concept of individualrights and entertained very little of this nonsense. But there is noconsensus today even on what a right is, let alone which ones we asfree citizens should be free to exercise.<p>	When the Reagan administration proposed abolishing subsidies toAmtrak, the nationalized passenger rail service, I was struck by adissenter who phrased her objection on national television this way: "Idon't know how those people in Washington expect us to get around outhere. We have a right to this service."<p>	When Congress voted to stop funding the printing of <i>Playboy</i> magazinein Braille, the American Council of the Blind filed suit in federalcourt, charging that the Congressional action constituted censorshipand the <i>denial of a basic right</i>.<p>	The lofty notion that individuals possess certain rights--definable,inalienable, and sacred--has been cheapened and mongrelized beyondanything our Founders would recognize. When those gifted individualsasserted rights to "freedom of speech" or "freedom of the press" or"freedom of assembly," they did not mean to say that one has a right tobe given a microphone, a printing press, a lecture hall, or a <i>Playboy</i>magazine at someone else's expense.<p>	Indeed, the Founders' concept of rights did not require theinitiation of force against others, or the elevation of any "want" to alawful lien on the life or property of any other citizen. Eachindividual was deemed a unique and sovereign being, requiring only thatothers either deal with him voluntarily or not at all. It was thisnotion of rights that became an important theme of America's foundingdocuments. It is the only notion of rights that does not degenerateinto a strife-ridden mob in which every person has his hands in everyother person's pockets.	<p>	Millions of Americans today believe that as long as the causeis "good," it's a duty of government. They look upon government as afountain of happiness and material goods. They have forgotten GeorgeWashington's warning, "Government is not reason; it is not eloquence.It is force. And like fire, it can either be a dangerous servant or afearful master."	<p>	Wisdom like that prompted Washington and our other Founders towrite a Constitution which contained a Bill of Rights, separation ofpowers, checks and balances, and dozens of "thou shalt nots" directedat government itself. They knew, unlike many Americans today, that agovernment without rules or boundaries, that does anything for anybody,that confuses rights with wants, will yield intolerable tyranny. 	<p>	We have tossed away the instruction book and until we find it and giveit life and meaning in our public lives, we will drift from oneintractable crisis to the next. Something more important than anyhandout from the State namely, our liberty--hangs in the balance.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/FILE.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Machan</h4></center><hr><p>Tibor R. Machan is Professor of Philosophy at AuburnUniversity, Alabama. His book The Virtue of Libertyis being published this month [1994, April] by The Foundation forEconomic Education.</p><hr noshade><p>	When the founders of the American republic declared that "Wehold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,"they were not naive, as many of their critics have asserted throughoutthe ensuing years. They had no notion that men were identical to eachother, that there were no significant differences among men. And theywere not sexists, either, even if in their time some of what matteredpolitically had not been applied to women. (The division of labor thatrested on gender had been much more relevant in those days!)<p>	What the founders were saying is that for purposes of understandingtheir actions of breaking off from Britain, all human beings must beviewed as having the same rights--to Life, Liberty. and the Pursuit ofHappiness. In short, we are all equal as human beings. We are all equalin facing the task of living our lives, of choosing what to do. and inseeking to better our lot. And no one must upset this equality No onemust violate anvone's rights. That is the equality the founders had inmind. It is also the equality with which the American politicaltradition is most closely identified. Furthermore, it is the equalitythat no other nation, despite all the rhetoric to the contrary, hasever managed to deliver within their legal systems.<p>	But ''equality'' is one of those terms, like "democracy" or "freedom"or "rights," that tempts many people to play fast and loose with itsmeaning. So, for example, we hear all sorts of claims about how Americafails to treat people as equals, or how there is no economic or socialor gender equality in this society. As if this had something to do withwhat the founders set out to establish. It does not. They did notpretend that people have to be equal in all respects--they knew betterthan to attempt the impossible or, for that matter, to see this asdesirable. The kind of equality that critics of America's basicpolitical ideal have in mind is not only sillv but quite unattractive.<p>	A recent development in our culture puts this point quite starkly.Some time ago one of the TV magazine programs ran a story about a younggirl whose hearing could be restored through complicated surgery. Thegirl had no hearing at all but after surgery she could hear, plain andsimple. Surely prior to surgery she was unequal, as compared to thosewho could hear, regarding the task of hearing what there was to heararound her.<p>	But when this surgical procedure was brought to light. a numberof other deaf people protested. They found it offensive to suggest thatthere is something wrong with them. They found it insulting that it wassuggested that they were not equal to those who could hear. And theyprotested the actions of the little girl's parents who opted to havethe operation perforrned, since this would amount to some kind ofbelittling of them.<p>	By now this line about the hearing-impaired has spawned articles andbooks across the country, and those who had the perfectly sensible viewthat being deaf is something of a disability seem to be baffled by itall. Their bafflement is understandable--it is akin to what happenswhen some radical environmentalists indict the rest of the world forliking technology, for welcoming modern medicine or agriculture.Something very fundamental--something "we hold to be self-evident"—isbeing challenged and most people who are concentrating on solving theproblem faced bv the disabled simply haven't given lt any thought thatthere might be doubters about the value of what they are doing.<p>	But, of course, there are. In a free society, it is possible tomake an issue of nearly anything--including whether being deaf is adisability. Next it will be argued, by some, that being blind orone-legged is not a disability but merely a different form of living.And there is some remote rationale behind such claims. One can imaginea world in which there are human beings who lack sight or hearing. Thatseems no different from the actual world in which human beings have nocapacity to take to the air, as birds do. If we had human beings whocould just take off and fly, those who could not would then be calleddisabled for lacking this capacity.<p>	Yet, we are essentially the sort of being that can hear and see. Sowhen some of us cannot, that is a disability, just as if a whale lackedfins or a bird broke a wing. Indeed, the sort of egalitarianism thosewho protest the remedying of hearing impairment advocate calls intoquestion the idea of injury or harm. If I broke your arm, would I beinjuring you or just changing you from someone with a certain sort oflimb to someone with another ' If y our eyes got poked out by someone.would this be assault or mere alteration?<p>	Egalitarians who advocate leaving things be because they areall of equal value fail to appreciate the notion of "essentially" or"by its nature." If a fish swims, that is natural to it, but if all ahuman being could do is swim, that would be a disability. All of theimprovements we make in not just our lives but the lives of otherbeings--as when we take injured birds and repair their wings--dependson this idea. The attempt of some people, for purposes of some kind ofwarped political agenda, to place the matter in doubt is sad. It wouldbe wiser to seek remedies for disabilities than to pretend that they donot exist.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Social-Equality.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Beito</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Beito is a research fellow at The Institute forHumane Studies at George Mason University, Fairfax,Virginia. (U.S.A.)</p><hr noshade><h4>Medical Care Before the Welfare State, 1900-1930</h4><p>	On the face of it, a historical study of fraternal societies seems tobe a subject fit only for connoisseurs of the arcane. Few Americansthese days come into contact with such groups. When many of us hear theword lodge, we think of it as a place where television characters fromour youth, such as Ralph Kramden (of the Loyal Order of Raccoons) andFred Flintstone (of the Loyal Order of Water Buffalos). escaped fromtheir more sensible wives to engage in childish hijinks--paradingaround with silly hats and mouthing pretentious rituals.<p>	There was a time, however, when fraternal societies could notbe so easily dismissed. Before the rise of the welfare state, they wererivaled only by churches as organizational providers of social welfare.By conservative estimates eighteen million American men and women weremembers in 1920—at least three out of every ten adult males. Whilefraternal societies differed in ethnicity, class, and gender, mostshared a common set of characteristics. In general, this included adecentralized lodge system, some sort of ritual, and the payment ofcash benefits in times of sickness and death.<p>	By the turn of the century, an increasing number of societiesbegan to add treatment by a doctor to their menu of services. Thisarrangement was known as lodge practice. It involved a simple contractunder which a physician provided care in exchange for an annual salarydetermined by the size of lodge membership. To qualify a prospectivelodge doctor had to win an election by the members. Generally lodgepractice plans did not extend beyond basic primary care and minorsurgery, although a few provided hospitalization.<p>	Lodge practice became particularly extensive in urban and industrialcenters. In 1915, for example, Dr. S. S. Goldwater, Health Commissionerof New York City, went so far as to assert that in many communities ithad become "the chosen or established method of dealing with sicknessamong the relatively poor." In the Lower East Side of New York City, henoted. 500 physicians catered to Jewish societies alone. Among blacksin New Orleans there were over 600 fraternal societies with lodgepractice during the 1920s.<p>	Nationally, the two leading providers of lodge practice amongnative whites were the Foresters and the Fraternal Order of Eagles. By1910, both organizations had over 2,000 doctors under contract to lookafter the medical needs of about 600,000 members. Yet, aside from thecommon thread of lodge practice the Foresters and Eagles were actuallyquite unalike as fraternal societies.<h4>The Foresters</h4>	<p>	The Foresters traced their origins directly to theAncient Order of Foresters, a British organization. The ritual drewinspiration from Robin Hood and his legendary adventures in SherwoodForest. In keeping with the medieval motif, the lodges were called"courts" and the supreme leader a "chief ranger." Both women and mencould join (although in separate courts) and the only tests formembership were belief in a supreme being and good moral character.		<p>	Foresters were quintessential internationalists. Inan age of self-conscious Anglo-Saxon exclusivity, they were notableamong fraternal societies for seeking converts not only in Europe butalso in Asia. The chief ranger for over two decades was a Dr.Oronhyatekha, a Canadian Mohawk. Equally remarkable for the time, hisancestry was not a cause of embarrassment for the members; in fact,they wore it as a badge of distinction. One member boasted that "Thereis not a Forester in the wide world but knows that this full-bloodedIndian chief is the one man to whom the Order should be thankful forits wonderful growth."	<h4>The Eagles</h4><p>	While the Foresters eschewed nationalism, their leading rivalfor lodge practice, the Fraternal Order of Eagles was almost acaricature of apple-pie Americanism. The Eagles opened their firstlodge in Seattle, Washington, in 1898. The members embraced afun-loving and informal style quite unlike more solemnco-fraternalists, such as the Free Masons. The aeries (as Eagles calledtheir lodges), with their well-stocked bars, often served double dutyas local community centers. This freewheeling behavior earned theEagles an unsavory reputation in some quarters. In 1910, McClure'sMagazine characterized the group as "a great national organization ofsporting men, bartenders, politicians, thieves, and professionalcriminals." The Eagles later refurbished this unwholesome imagesomewhat by launching a highly visible, and ultimately successfulcampaign for the proclamation of Mother's Day.		Less than ten years after the Eagles had been founded, theybecame noted (notorious in medical society circles) for engaging inlodge practice. For one dollar a year a member and immediate familycould receive basic medical services (including minor surgery). Thisfee did not pay for treatment for obstetrics, venereal disease, and"any sickness or injury caused or brought about be the use ofintoxicating liquors, opiates or In any immoral conduct."<h4>Ladies Friends of Faith</h4><p>	Unfortunately primary data from individual societies with lodgepractice is in very short supply. Nevertheless. some records survivewhich can shed light on the subject. Particularly helpful is aminute-book from the Ladies Friends of Faith Benevolent Association,covering the period from August 1914 through September 1916. It was ablack female society of about 170 members which operated in New Orleansduring the early twentieth century.<p>	The Ladies Friends of Faith was not exceptional, at least within thebroad context of New Orleans. It was only one of numerous suchsocieties which offered lodge practice to blacks in the city. Amongthese were local affiliates of two prominent national organizations,the Eastern Star and the Household of Ruth. Much more common, however,were home-grown societies such as the Female Union Band, Young Men ofInseparable Friends, Francs Amis, Holy Ghost, and the United Sons andDaughters. A simple reading of 134 organizational names from a listassembled in 1937 indicates that no less than 40 catered primarily tofemales.<p>	In terms of organizational structure and benefits, the Ladies Friendsof Faith also fit the general local pattern. The rank-and-file voted inannual elections to choose a "society" druggist, doctor, and undertakerwho provided services at a low flat rate. Those taken sick collectedtwo dollars a week if they saw the lodge doctor and three dollars ifthey did not. To guard against false claims for cash benefits and toprovide companionship, a visiting committee sat at bedside with therecipient. Those members derelict in these duties had to pay aone-dollar fine.<p>	In this two-year period, the minute-book evidences great activity.One hundred and thirteen individuals (slightly over half themembership) collected sick benefits. Of these, 70 used the lodge doctorat least once; several a dozen times or more. Almost all theseapplicants obtained cash payments and medical service (including freemedicine) without eliciting complaints from the other members.	<p>	This does not mean that the deliberation process of the LadiesFriends of Faith was without controversy. Most notably there was apersistent need to grapple with appeals from individuals who had fallenin arrears. At nearly every meeting, the society heard at least oneplea from a member unable to pay because of unemployment or poorhealth. One of the most desperate of these concerned a woman who was"out of Doors, and had no money." In such cases, the society wasgenerally ready to extend help. It allowed 24 members extra time to payoff their debts while it passed the hat for ten others. Not once didthe Ladies Friends of Faith reject any of these appeals outright. Suchliberality did not translate into open season on the lodge's treasury,however. Those delinquents who failed to explain their "unfinancial"status were readily dropped from the rolls.<p>	Regardless of religious, ethnic, or political orientation, allfraternal societies, to the extent they relied on lodge practice, faceda similar set of obstacles. Without a doubt, the most serious was theorganized opposition of doctors. By the first decade of the twentiethcentury, the spread of what became known to critics as the <i>lodgepractice evil</i> elicited almost universal condemnation among medicalsocieties.<p>	At its core, this opposition represented fear for the future survivalof the dominant fee-for-service remuneration. Writing in the <i>WisconsinJournal of Medicine</i>, Dr. W. F. Zierath of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, put thematter succinctly when he chided certain fellow members of theprofession for bowing so readily to "the keen business instinct of thelaity" who have "discovered in contract practice a scheme to obtainmedical services for practically nothing...they are organizingsocieties by the score with that feature as the excuse for theirexistence." Once doctors allowed themselves to be placed on a fixedpayment system, he warned, loss of both income and independence wouldsoon follow. The profession would then become tainted and demoralizedby every doctor's cutthroat and undignified scramble to sell to thelowest bidder. Another opponent predicted that lodge practice, if notstopped, would depress fees to levels "comparable to those of thebootblack and peanut vendor."<p>	Lodge elections were depicted as carnivals of corruption inwhich victory went to those doctors best able to ingratiate themselveswith key players in the leadership through extravagant promises oroutright bribery. Even when outright corruption did not occur thecritics portrayed the election campaign as dominated by unseemlywire-pulling and backslapping. According to Dr. Zierath, success of acandidate depended upon "the handshaking, the button-holing, thetreating to cigars and drinks in public houses."<p>	According to these critics, however, lodge practice was not only badfor doctors, but it also harmed the patient. While they conceded thatthe fees were low, they warned that the service given in return wasshabby. Along these lines, a leading professional journal condemnedlodge practice as a vain attempt by the patient to get "something fornothing."<h4>Who Benefited?</h4><p>	Lodge practice, in my view, merits a far more favorable assessmentthan it received either from contemporary critics or more recenthistorians. At first blush, such a contention would seem impossible todefend. Most of the surviving sources on which the historian must relyhave already in a ringing verdict of guilty. This research problem isnot fatal, however. . Ironically, the strident manifestos published inthe medical journals contain a wealth of information which can cast apositive light on lodge practice. With great profit, these professionalcritiques can be supplemented and compared to the still extant defenseswritten by doctors and leaders of fraternal societies.<p>	The most important beneficiary of lodge practice was, of course, thepatient of modest means. He or she was able to obtain the care of adoctor for about two dollars a year--roughly equivalent to a day's wagefor a laborer. If translated into 1994 dollars, this annual fee wouldbe equivalent to about 14 dollars, the hourly wage of some constructionworkers today!<p>	The remuneration paid to the lodge doctor was a far cry fromthe higher fee schedules favored by the profession. A local medicalsociety in Pennsylvania was typical in setting for its members thefollowing <i>minimum fees</i>: one dollar per physical examination, surgicaldressing, and housecall (daytime) and two dollars (nighttime). Suchprices, at least for continual service, would have been out of reachfor many poor Americans.<p>	Why were the lodges able to charge such low fees? The answer tothis question lies with several organizational strengths peculiar tothe fraternal structure itself. The fact that lodges could enticedoctors with a large and stable market left them well positioned, asone opponent put it, to purchase medical services at wholesale and sellat retail.<p>	Also exerting downward pressure on fees were lodge elections.While the election process was not without flaws, there is also ampleevidence from both supporters and opponents that, on balance, it servedmembers well. It gave patients an opportunity once a year to comparenotes on the medical records of both the challenger and incumbent. JohnC. McManemin, the Past Worthy President of the Eagles, maintained thatas "the members have the right of franchise in electing the lodgephysician, so have they in deposing him, and it therefore results thatunless the physician so selected, attends to the duties devolving uponhim he is quickly brought to account." From a very differentperspective, a leading opponent of lodge practice complained thatduring campaigns "colleagues and rival applicants are roundly 'knocked'and their mistakes and capabilities held up to public ridicule andcensure."<h4>Quality of Service</h4><p>	Closer inspection of the medical journals also gives some causeto be skeptical of blanket claims that lodges heedlessly sacrificedquality to elect the candidate bidding the lowest fee. The contrary, infact, occurred in a campaign described by lodge-practice adversary Dr.George S. Mathews of Rhode Island:<ul>	<p>	...in one lodge two members in good standing in the State Medical	Society openly in lodge meeting underbid [each other]. One	volunteered his services at $2 a head. The other dropped his price to	$1.75. The first bidder then acceded to this price with medicines	furnished. This occasioned a drop in bidder No. 2 in his price	to include medicine and minor surgery. To the vast credit of	the lodge neither bid was accepted but a non-bidder was given the job	at $2.	</p>	</ul><p>	Even the detractors, while generally disdainful of the quality of careprovided, acknowledged that fraternal societies attracted some doctorsof ability and high training. In Dr. Goldwater's opinion, for example,there were "many competent medical men and between the slip-shodservice of the poor kind of dispensary, and the painstaking care of theconscientious lodge doctor, the choice easily lies with the latter." Itis worthy of note that the hack often inspired less contempt than thephysician with a lucrative private practice who took a lodge contracton the side. One leading critic excoriated such individuals as"inordinately selfish and avaricious men who have no neighbors in theprofession, for they are not Samaritans by practice."<h4>Proprietary Medical Schools</h4><p>	Also misleading were efforts to dismiss the abilities of lodge doctorsby citing their low level of medical education. For many opposed to thesystem, it was merely sufficient to note that these doctors graduateddisproportionately from the ranks of the proprietary medical schools.While as a description of reality this was probably accurate, it failsas an indictment. To understand why, a bit of background aboutproprietary education might be helpful.	<p>	These schools had two salient features. First, they were ownedby doctors in regular practice and second, unlike the endoweduniversity, they subsisted entirely on tuition. The owners earnedincome both from tuition received in exchange for delivering lecturesand from sometimes lucrative referrals tendered by grateful graduates.The students often came from modest backgrounds and thus lacked boththe contacts and financial pull enjoyed by many of their counterpartsin the universities. The alumni of these proprietary schools would haveample incentives to be attracted to lodge practice. For a recentgraduate especially, a contract with a fraternal societal might be theonly means available to obtain the necessary financing and communitycontacts needed to build up a practice.	<p>	To call these doctors quacks, however, as many critics did, would bea misnomer at least in the strict meaning of the term. Like every otheraspiring doctor, they needed to receive state certification topractice. By no means was this pro forma. Since the 1880s and 1890s,the requirements had become increasingly stringent and failure rateswere high. In short, the lodge doctor may not always have beentop-of-the-line but he or she had at least rudimentary training.	<p>	As the purchaser of these services, the fraternal society alsohad incentives to maintain the quality of care. An incompetent orarbitrary doctor could prove fatal to actuarial soundness. Moreover, iffraternal advertisements are any indication, prospective members wereleery of organizations with high mortality rates. The publicity for theForesters repeatedly contrasted the death rate of its members (6 per1,000) with that of the same age group in the general population (9 per1,000). It credited this low mortality to "Sherlock-Holmes-likeacuteness in the detection of bad risks" exhibited by the doctorsattached to its courts. This boast was more than hyperbole. In thefirst decade of the twentieth century, the doctors of the Forestersannually rejected between ten and twenty percent of all initiates.	<p>	Additionally to ensure quality of care lodges often imposed specificsanctions, in the form of fines, for doctors who neglected theirduties. Among the possible infractions were failure to report atmeetings, fraudulent approval of sick claims, and refusal to respond toa patient's housecall. For the latter violation, for example, both theEagles and Foresters authorized a lodge to hire a substitute from theopen market and then deduct the charges from the salary of thedelinquent lodge doctor.	<p>	An important consequence of lodge practice for the patient wasto facilitate habits of assertiveness. The members who used theseservices anticipated by several decades the active patient now verymuch in vogue. Many physicians, obviously unaccustomed to suchtreatment, denounced the willingness of members to quibble about feesand diagnosis. One doctor blamed excessive and unnecessary housecallsfor engendering fears in the doctor "that he will lose his position ifhe fails to answer every call regardless of circumstances and hisknowledge of the fact that he is being imposed on constantly by memberswho abuse their privileges."		<p>	For the patient, if not always the doctor, lodge practice hadthe additional virtue of affording accessible preventive care. Again,one need look no further for evidence than the repeated accusations inthe professional journals that doctors were being pestered with trivialailments. According to Dr. Zierath, the patient called on the lodgedoctor at all hours of the night "to see cases repeatedly where aphysician would not be called, were the regular fee to apply. One ofthe children in a family has abdominal pain, and the anxious motherpromptly conjectures that it is appendicitis" when it was nothing more"than too much indulgence in mince pie. But it looks stylish to havethe doctor's rig standing in front of house and excites the curiosityand envy of the neighbors, therefore the 'free' doctor is summoned."	<p>	For fraternal societies, by contrast, the ability to readily call onthe doctor for any complaint was a major selling point. Lodge practice,wrote a leader of the Eagles, "accords perfectly with the modern theoryof the prevention of disease... Many of the poorer members, under othercircumstances might delay in calling a doctor until the disease madeconsiderable headway."	<p>	Lodge practice opened up rare opportunities for many working-classAmericans to compare and experiment and empowered them with thenecessary economic clout to break tree from the confining view thathealth care was merely a generic good. It gave patients the wherewithalto use medical services more as a varied menu of choices, eachadjustable to suit the particular need at hand.	<p>	The discernment of lodge patients was exemplified by their selectivepatronization of medical services. They may have readily turned totheir lodge doctor for prevention, for example, but many lookedelsewhere for a cure. On this note, an exhaustive study of blacks inNew Orleans, who were members of fraternal societies during the 1930s,found that while 56 percent relied exclusively on the doctor hired bytheir lodge, the rest also hired private physicians in some cases. Amember of one of these societies expressed a typical view when hecommented, "Well, 1 think there is nothing better than a society forwhen you're sick they give you the best possible attention, but if Iwere real sick I'd prefer calling a doctor not connected with asociety, so that I could get the best of attention. Society doctors aretoo busy to handle extreme illnesses." 	<h4>Decline of Lodge Practice</h4><p>	Even before the Depression, lodge practice had begun to fallinto a state of decline. The pressure exerted by the leaders oforganized medicine hastened the demise. By the 1910s, doctors hadlaunched an all-out war against lodge practice. Throughout the country,medical associations imposed a range of sanctions against lodgedoctors, including expulsion from the association and denial ofhospital facilities. In certain instances, campaigns were organized todeny patient care, even in emergencies, to members of offending lodges.Most commentary from both sides of this conflict indicates that thesesanctions were highly effective. In any case, by the end of the 1930s,the once vibrant health care alternative of lodge practice, which lessthan two decades before had inspired trepidation throughout the medicalestablishment, had virtually disappeared.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Lodge-Doctor-Medicine.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Parks</h4></center><hr><p>Lawrence M. Parks is President of SystematicAsset Management Corporation, a registeredinvestment advisors</p><hr noshade>	<p>	In his speech to the Economic Club of New York last year, FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan used the word "inflation" no less than50 times. In the Chairman's speeches and in Congressional testimony, hehas said of inflation: It is going away. It is not coming back. It isnot a problem. It is diminished. It is nonrecurring. It is subdued .There's no re-emergence . We've learned our lesson.	<p>	So if inflation has ceased to be a problem, why does it occupyMr. Greenspan's thoughts so much? Perhaps inflation is more of an issuethan he is letting on.	<p>	Why should inflation just be a measure of the prices of somearbitrary basket of items in the consumer goods market? Why exclude theprice level of the capital and real estate markets? After all, moneyisn't always spent on goods and services; some of it is invested instocks and bonds and real estate. By any yardstick, stocks and bondshave gone way up in price in the last several years.	<p>	Further, the government has enacted laws and regulations thateffectively persuade prudent people to put or keep money in the capitalmarkets, thereby decreasing money that might otherwise be spent in theconsumer goods market. For example, about $800 billion in IRA accountsby law must be invested only in stocks and bonds. Large amounts arealso tied up in Keoghs, Pension Plans, 401-K's and other quasi-savingsplans that must be similarly invested.	<p>	Perhaps if people had free use of these monies, some might be used toimprove homes, buy cars and other consumer items, which would certainlyspike the price level of the consumer goods market and the nominalinflation rate. Clearly, there is vast deferred inflation. Some daypeople will spend that money, and that's when nominal inflation willpop.	<p>	Similarly, because of inflation over the last two decades, ifpeople sell appreciated property, capital gains taxes will many timesresult in a loss of capital. The result is that money is kept in thecapital markets for tax purposes, and is kept out of the consumer goodsmarket. Thus, people have been misled about the purchasing power oftheir savings which retain value provided they are never spent in theconsumer goods market. Again, there is vast pent up purchasing powerpostponed by government and, as a result, a tidal wave of latentinflation.	<p>	The most widely reported measure of price increase is the ConsumerPrice Index (CPI). But the CPI is an untrustworthy measure of priceinflation. First, the Consumer Price Index fails to account forproducts and services that have been inflated out of existence. Forexample, when I was a child, our family physician made house calls for$2. (What would a doctor's house call cost today, assuming a doctorwould make one?) There were ushers in movie theaters, and evenmiddle-class folk employed domestic help. First-class postage was threecents, and the post office made four deliveries each day: two regularsand two specials.	<p>	For the most part, these and many other services no longer exist orhave deteriorated greatly. Hence, if the measuring rod is notconsistent, then CPI comparisons over time cannot be useful.	<p>	Another major failing of the CPI is that the government mustfudge every time there is an improvement in a good or service. Forproducts where innovation is frequent, such as consumer electronics,there is no meaningful way to compare price changes from year to year.Consider, also, the case of a more expensive automobile that issubstantially smaller and lighter than its same make and modelpredecessor. Because the new automobile is "improved," the governmentreduces the price increase for CPI purposes. How can this methodologybe objective?	<p>	On top of that, the CPI "market basket" was last reformulatedin 1982-1984 and, for budgetary reasons, is not due to be revised until1996, if then. When I told one of the senior government economistsabout this article and that it was my contention that inflation wassubstantially understated, he said: "We would concur with that."	<p>	Third, the CPI fails to report products and services whose prices arereduced by government subsidies. Continuing inflation many times causescertain goods and services to become so expensive that they eitherdisappear or their manufacture is arbitraged to foreign countries.Where there are politically connected constituencies and where theproduction of products or services cannot be transferred out of thecountry, government many times subsidizes them, thereby reducing theprice to consumers and keeping the CPI artificially lower than it wouldotherwise be.	<p>	For example, in some industries, government subsidizes researchand development. Even after considerable machinations and subsidiesfrom the state, New York's Blue/Cross Blue/Shield rates were recentlyincreased 25 percent. Depending upon whom one listens to, a subway ridein New York City costs anywhere from $3.50 to $6.00, but the public ischarged only $1.25. The rest is subsidized from taxes, whose increasesare not in the CPI. Clearly, if the true cost of a subway ride wasincorporated into the price, the CPI in New York City would be higherthan it is.	<p>	Because of its historical link to gold, many foreigners stillconsider the dollar "as good as gold," even though the link isirrevocably broken. As foreign governments, such as Russia, debasetheir own currencies, rather than switch into gold, foreigners manytimes switch into the next best thing (in their minds): United Statesdollars. According to "Grant's Interest Rate Observer," perhaps as muchas 60 percent of the $363 billion in American currency is nowcirculating in foreign lands.	<p>	The drain of dollars from the United States to foreign lands isprice deflationary in the United States. But if by accident some ofthese errant countries should get their monetary houses in order, thendollars will flow back to the United States. Again, there issubstantial pent-up purchasing power that will someday be spent and,then, latent inflation will become obvious.<h4>Prices Should Be Falling</h4><p>	As industrial processes and productivity improve, prices shoulddecrease. In fact, the increasing productivity of the 1980s contributedto the lower rate of price inflation. Decreasing prices improveeverybody's living standard. That is the benefit of an advancedeconomy: higher production of better products available to more peopleat lower prices. If prices do not decrease because of inflation, thenthe benefits of productivity increases are not shared. Bygerrymandering the CPI and pursuing "price stability," the governmentobfuscates this fact.<p>	During the past three years, by purchasing Treasury securities,the Federal Reserve has monetized government debt at a high rate, andthe most basic measurement of money supply, M1, has increased 37percent and currency has increased 27 percent. That this has not beenreflected in price inflation is due only to the flawed definition ofprice inflation and the fact that vast amounts have diverted to foreigncountries. Inflation is a worldwide phenomenon and has been understatedall over the planet. Perhaps long-term interest rates haven't droppedthat much for good reason.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Money-and-Inflation.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Martino</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Joseph P. Martino is a senior researchscientist at the University of Dayton ResearchInstitute. He was a guest lecturer last yearat the Institute for Technological Research in Sao Paolo.</p><hr noshade><p>	Every morning, outside my apartment building, I see a woman sweepingthe sidewalk. She wields her broom briskly, marshaling the scraps ofpaper and dead leaves into an orderly pile. She then sweeps them into along-handled dustpan made from a cut-down salad-oil can with abroomhandle nailed to it.<p>	Downtown, S&atilde;o Paolo is a clean city. It's kept that way, notonly by people like the woman outside my apartment, but by an army ofmunicipal workers, men and women, clad in safety-orange coveralls. Likethe woman in front of my apartment, they wield brooms and long-handleddustpans. Their only concession to a greater volume of work is thebarrel-shaped pushcarts into which they dump the refuse.<p>	Street cleaning is not the only labor intensive activity I see.At a gas station, I count six pumps and four attendants in cleanuniforms. Another attendant, in a different uniform, puts air in tires.I am told that there are only one or two self-service gas stations inall of S&atilde;o Paolo.<p>	On the university campus where my office is located, there arenumerous well-tended gardens. The campus seems to be covered withflowering shrubs and trees. This beautiful landscape is tended by ahost of workers who trim, cut, and plant by hand. The newly plantedtrees are watered regularly by a man who stands by them, holding ahose.<p>	The contrast with my own campus in the United States is instructive.Planting a tree on my home campus means bringing in a truck-mountedauger which digs a hole in minutes, following which a tree is droppedinto the hole by another truck with a crane. Trimming the hedge infront of my building is done with a chain-saw. Leaves are cleaned offthe sidewalk with a gasoline-powered blower carried by one of thegrounds workers.<p>	One of my colleagues in S&atilde;o Paolo, an economist whoseoffice is just down the hall from the one I use, tells me thatBrazilian institutions can afford to use so much labor because wagesare so low.<p>	Although no one I meet in Brazil makes the argument, there arethose among my colleagues in the United States who would praise theBrazilian arrangement. "It provides jobs for poor people. If youmechanized, they'd be out of work."<p>	Nevertheless, what is true in any other country is true in Brazil aswell. You cannot eat what you do not grow. You cannot wear what you donot weave. You cannot live in what you do not build.<p>	Money is simply an improvement on barter. The man who earns hiswages trimming hedges does not need to find a farmer with a shaggyhedge in order to obtain food. He can trim a hedge at a university, anduse his money wages to buy food, clothing, or shelter. The key point isthat his money wages represent the value to his employer of his laborservices. They represent what he has put into the economy. His wagesallow him to take an equivalent value out of the economy, in whateverform he prefers.<p>	Low wages mean the worker can take only a little out of the economy.He cannot live very well on that. His wages are low, however, becausehe has put so little into the economy. In short, his productivity islow.<p>	It will not do to say that a Brazilian university cannot affordto buy a leaf-blower or a chain-saw. That misses the point. Hiringadditional workers is cheaper than equipping a few workers withproductivity-enhancing tools like chain-saws and blowers. Why is itcheaper? Because productivity in the rest of the Brazilian economy islow as well.<p>	Why does my home university equip its workers with chain-sawsand blowers? Why is it concerned with increasing their productivity?Why doesn't it simply hire more workers to use pruning shears andleaf-rakes?<p>	Because it must compete with other employers for the servicesof workers. If a worker with certain skills can earn a high wage at thelocal auto plant, my university must match that wage to attract aworker with the same skills. Once forced to pay a competitive wage, myuniversity must increase the worker's productivity by equipping himwith chain-saws, blowers and other tools. In short, forced to match thegoing wage my university must invest in capital equipment so itsemployees can match the productivity of equivalent workers in the restof the economy. That is, high industrial productivity is the driverwhich forces all other U.S. employers to increase their workers'productivity, by threatening to draw them away.<p>	Likewise, in Brazil all other employers compete with industryto attract workers. Since productivity is so low in the rest of theeconomy, the university whose campus I am visiting does not need toprovide much in the way of productivity-enhancing tools. Since otherBrazilian workers do not put much value into the economy, they cannottake much out either, and employers such as the university, thepetroleum company, and the streets department of the city, can pay lowwages and still attract workers. Total output can be increased morecheaply by hiring more workers than by investing in capital equipment.<p>	Why is productivity so low in Brazilian industry? A visit to acombination sugar mill and alcohol distillery helps explain why. Mycompanion, also from the university, has been trying to convince themill managers to install new equipment which would save energy, cutexpenses, and increase profits. The savings would repay the cost of thenew machinery in less than three years.<p>	Our host, the chief engineer of the mill, explains the situation insimple terms. The cost of the machinery would exceed the mill'savailable cash. The managers would have to borrow the money. Thecurrent real interest rate is 40 percent per year, over and above theinflation rate of approximately I percent per day. The interest on theloan would more than eat up the savings from the new machinery. Part ofthe mill's current profits would have to be used to meet interestpayments, and they would never pay off the principal of the loan. Mycompanion admits ruefully that the interest rate on his credit card is48 percent per month.<p>	Why are real interest rates so high? A U.S.-trained facultymember from the business school of the university explains the problemto me. The external and internal debt of the Brazilian government isabsorbing nearly all the capital the nation can raise, just to payinterest and avoid default on the loans. This enormous drain on theeconomy prevents all industry, not just one sugar mill, frommodernizing and increasing the productivity of Brazilian workers.<p>	How did the Brazilian debt become so high? During the "oil shocks" ofthe 1970s, the Brazilian government made the same mistake many otherpeople made. They assumed the price of oil would remain high. Theyborrowed heavily against their anticipated oil revenues. They intendedto use the money to force economic growth. Unfortunately, for the mostpart they spent it on uneconomic industries, following the then-popular"development economics" doctrine of "import replacement." Worse yet,they spent much of it on showcase projects like roads in the Amazonwhich have since been abandoned, on the showplace city of Brasilia, andsimilar extravagances.<p>	Now the chickens have come home to roost. The oil cartel failedas all cartels do eventually. The price of oil is down. Since theborrowed money was not invested productively, there is no income streamfrom it to meet interest and repay the loans. The present Braziliangovernment, in order to maintain its credit rating, is makingrepayments from current savings. The high inflation rate is in effect atax on savings, allowing the government to siphon of the nation'ssavings. Virtually none of Brazil's current savings are available toinvest in industry.<p>	By attempting to force economic growth with borrowed money, theBrazilian government ended up destroying the possibility of economicgrowth.<p>	That is why Brazilian industry has such low productivity. Thatis why it isn't drawing workers away from low-paying jobs. And that iswhy the woman outside my apartment building sweeps every morning with abadly worn broom and a homemade dustpan.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Govt-Created-Poverty.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Siegan</h4></center><hr><p>Bernard H. Siegan is Distinguished Professorof Law at the University of San Diego Law Schooland has advised several Eastern European nationson constitutional matters.</p><hr noshade><p>	As the nations and republics emerging from Communism write newconstitutions, ominous signs appear that these constitutions willreject the basis for the recent revolutions. Instead of confining it,the constitution writers appear to be establishing a huge economic rolefor government.	<p>	A major, if not the major, reason for the fall of Communism iseconomics. Compared to the capitalist states, the Communist countrieswere economic disasters, far behind in individual income and materialcomforts and conveniences. Thus, as was apparent to any traveler, lifefor the average citizen was considerably better in capitalist WestGermany, Taiwan, and South Korea than in Communist East Germany, China,and North Korea.	<p>	Yet most Communist leaders were no less interested than capitalistleaders in providing a better life for their constituents. They imposedevery conceivable law toward that end and were ever ready to adopt newregulations "in the public interest." As a result, the Communistnations had an abundance of laws, but as it turned out, never of food,clothing and shelter. The problem was that Communism identified thepublic good with ever greater government authority.	<p>	By contrast, the market-oriented countries achieved much moregood for the people by following an opposite principle, equating thepublic interest with individual freedom. Capitalist countries such asthe United States rely on individual ingenuity and productivity toimprove and advance human society. History confirms that free minds,hearts, and bodies account for the greatest societal achievements.	<p>	Unfortunately, lawmakers in the former Communist countries maybe ignoring this great lesson. Consider, for example, therecommendations of the Ukrainian Parliament's ConstitutionalCommission. In the June 1992 draft, it proposes constitutionallymandating a lavish program of entitlements and benefits including:Rest, leisure, paid vacations, "fair" and "satisfactory" wages, andother welfare benefits for workers, minimum living standards, equal payfor the same amount of work in accordance with its quality andquantity, free medical service, safe environment and foodstuffs, freeeducation, and a reduced work period for mothers with young children,minors, people with limited ability to work, and those engaged inphysically demanding labor or working in harmful environments.	<p>	The proposed constitution would thus impose serious regulatoryand monetary restraints on the private sector as well as on thepolitical process. These controls are not consistent with aspirationsfor freedom and abundance.	<p>	They rely on the erroneous idea that people are dependent ongovernment benevolence for their well-being. To prosper and provideabundantly the material necessities of life, Ukraine must encourageprivate ownership and investment. A constitution that strongly protectseconomic liberties will attract both domestic and foreign investment.Studies show that the most prosperous nations are those that stronglyprotect private property and enterprise.	<p>	If the Ukraine economy is poor, how will it provide for the host ofentitlements and conditions the constitutional draft seeks to bestow?If the entitlements are satisfied, how much will be left to pay for thearmed services, police and fire protection, and installation andmaintenance of streets, sewers, and water mains? A nation must limitthe tax burden lest it destroy the economy.	<p>	To be sure, the proposed Ukraine Constitution does provide protectionfor ownership and investment, but in language hardly comforting towould-be owners or entrepreneurs. The right of property supposedly issecured, but it "must not contradict the interests of society as awhole or of individual citizens." This exception is big enough toconsume the protection.	<p>	The former Communist nations should look to the U. S. Constitution astheir model . Its protections are negative in character. They areintended to prevent the enactment of laws that stifle opportunity andself-improvement. The U.S. Constitution does not impose affirmativeeconomic obligations on the government. Liberty, in the U.S.constitutional sense, means being immune from government coercion.	<p>	The benefits flow to both the individual and the society, asJames Madison, the principal architect of the United StatesConstitution, once stated: "I own myself to a very free system ofcommerce, and hold it as a truth that if industry and labor are left totheir own course, they will generally be directed to those objectswhich are the most productive, and this in a more certain and directmanner than the wisdom of the most enlightened legislature could pointout."	<p>	A constitution that protects both liberties and entitlements isincoherent and very difficult to interpret. It seeks to accomplish twodiametrically opposite goals: reducing and enlarging government.Moreover, guaranties of entitlements in a constitution that authorizesjudicial enforcement of its provisions will jeopardize the judiciary'sprotection of liberty. (The former Communist states are according theirhigh courts the power to enforce their constitutions.)	<p>	To enforce the entitlements, the judiciary might well mandateimposition of additional taxation and spending, and neither the peoplenor the legislature would be able to control this power. Taxing thepeople and spending the receipts are peculiarly legislative powers,stemming from the idea that only the people, acting on their own orthrough their representatives, are entitled to decide how they willutilize their own resources. (in the United States, the principle of"no taxation without representation" is among the most sacred.)	<p>	Similarly, a court may implement constitutional provisions thatrequire a clean environment, adequate medical service, or fair wages byimposing personal monetary requirements on owners and entrepreneurs,contrary to their contract and property rights. Thus, constitutionalefforts to provide government benevolence would give the judiciarydictatorial control over important public and private decisions.	<p>	For some people in nations emerging from Communism, life is notcomfortable these days. The fault lies not with capitalism but with thedifficulty of converting a backward economy to a modern one. Mostgovernment-owned industries in these nations cannot competesuccessfully in world markets. They produce goods and utilizeproduction methods that are antiquated. They lose much money and musteither be closed or sold to private investors. Unfortunately, eitheralternative creates unemployment. But there is no other way for anation to convert to a viable economy which in time will produce a highstandard of living.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Freedom-and-Constitutions.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Lee</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Lee is Bernard B. and Eugenia A. Ramsey Professor ofEconomics and Private Enterprise at the University of Georgia.</p><hr noshade><p>	Only the most ideologically blinded continue to argue that socialismcan out-perform capitalism in the production of wealth. Yet theassertion that government programs are required to reduce the incomeinequality generated by capitalism is widely accepted as revealedtruth. Market competition motivates productive activity by threateningwith poverty those who use resources unwisely, and carrying out thisthreat without mercy. So, it is argued, in the absence of compassionategovernment transfer programs, a large percentage of the populationwould be left behind, impoverished, without hope, and made all the moremiserable by the audacious wealth of their more successful neighbors.	<h4>The Benefits of Failure</h4>	<p>	There is just enough truth in this view to obscure the fact thatit grossly distorts reality. Market competition can be harsh. But theparticular failures dispensed by market competition provide theinformation and motivation that are indispensable to the generaleconomic success of any economy. When failures in the marketplace areviewed in isolation from the success they make possible, they arecommonly depicted as unfair. In fact, in the marketplace failure andfairness go hand in hand. When people suffer failure in the marketplacethey are making a necessary contribution to the general productivity ofthe economy--a contribution that enhances the opportunities of all toproduce wealth, in an economic system that distributes that wealth farmore widely and equally than most people realize. Each person would, ofcourse, prefer to be protected against failure while continuing tobenefit from the contribution that the failures of others make toeconomic progress. The fundamental fairness of the market lies in thefact that it gives no one a free ride on the contribution of others. Inthe unfettered marketplace everyone has to contribute to the generalprosperity by accepting the failures as well as the successes that comehis way.	<p>	Yet, because the failures that result from market competitionare commonly seen as unfair, arguments calling for government to helpthe poor find sympathetic ears. Government action to help the poor isseen as the only way to overcome the perceived unfairness of themarketplace. Invariably what people have in mind when consideringgovernment help for the poor are government programs that supposedlytransfer income from the rich to the poor. Seldom do those who favorsuch transfer programs question whether they actually reduce incomeinequality.	<p>	While most people recognize realistically that income is distributedin the marketplace in response to competition between people interestedprimarily in private advantage, they somehow believe that income isdistributed in the political process in response to broad social goalssuch as reducing income inequality. The unstated assumption is thatwhen people shift from market activity to political activity theyexperience a moral metamorphosis, overcoming considerations of privateinterest in order to advance the public interest. Yet, there is noconvincing evidence that people in their roles as politicians,bureaucrats, members of special interests, and voters are any lessdriven by self-interest than they are as investors, workers, andconsumers in the private sector.<h4>A Major Unsupported Assumption</h4><p>	Once the importance of political competition is recognized, animportant, but seldom considered, question presents itself: Why shouldwe expect the income distribution resulting from political competitionto be any more equal than the income distribution resulting from marketcompetition? Unless one is prepared to argue that (I) the skillsnecessary for successful political competition are different from thosenecessary for successful market competition and (2) the poor possessrelatively more of the politically relevant skills than the nonpoor,then there is no reason to believe that government transfer programswill help the poor.	<p>	The evidence fails to support the hope that the poor can competesuccessfully against the nonpoor for political largess. Little of theincome distributed by government is from the rich to the poor. Studiesof the distribution of after-tax/after-transfer income over the lastseveral decades find little, if any, change in the equality of thatdistribution. Based on these studies, economist Robert Haveman of theInstitute for Research on Poverty of the University of Wisconsin hasconcluded, "In spite of massive increases in federal government taxesand spending, we were about as unequal in 1988 as we were in 1950."	<p>	There are government programs, of course, that transfer incometo the poor. But programs that transfer income to the poor receivepolitical support through a process of legislative logrolling thatdisproportionately favors programs that transfer income to the nonpoor.The poor end up receiving no greater share of existing wealthtransferred by political competition than they do of new wealth createdby market competition.	<p>	There is no debate over the fact that transfer programs reduceeconomic growth by discouraging productivity and encouragingdependency. By reducing the overall size of the pie without increasingthe share of that pie going to the poor, government transfer programshave reduced the absolute income of the poor. The inescapableconclusion is that government transfer programs have made the poorworse off.<p>	Free market capitalism excels at producing wealth and at distributingit widely. Even those left behind by market competition benefit fromthe productivity of the marketplace. It is far better to be poor inCalifornia than in Calcutta. There are those, however, who disparagethe market economy on the grounds that market competition unfairlydistributes income. This view has been used effectively to justifytransferring more of the nation's income through governmental programs.The result has been unfortunate for the poor. Substituting negative-sumpolitical competition for positive-sum market competition reduces thesize of the economic pie without increasing the share of that pie goingto the poor.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Government-Redistribution.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Sirico, CSP</h4></center><hr><p>Paulist Father Robert A . Sirico is president of theActon Institute for the Study of Religion and Libertyin Grand Rapids, Michigan.</p><hr noshade><p>	Young women interviewing for jobs in the past year may have noticedpotential employers looking carefully at their ring fingers. No, it'snot an example of sexual harassment. Rather, employers are growing moreskeptical of hiring (and promoting) young married women ofchild-bearing age.	<p>	Employers have long taken sex into account when hiring workers.The turnover rate for women is higher than for men, since a woman ismore likely to leave her job to have a baby, or move when her spouse istransferred. Thus, companies were already less likely to hire andpromote women.	<p>	But the Family and Medical Leave Act, which went into effect inJuly 1993, has <b>increased</b> the costs of hiring women. The law requirescompanies with more than 50 employees to grant full-time workersemployed for one year 12 weeks of unpaid leave in any 12-month period.Employees can take this leave for birth or adoption of a child, orserious personal or family illness. And companies are legally bound togive workers their jobs back—or an equivalent position— when theyreturn. Employers know that women of child-bearing age are most likelyto take advantage of this government-mandated benefit. Thus, the"benefit" is another reason for firms to choose another candidate for ajob.	<p>	Consider what Tama Starr, president of the ArtKraft Strauss company,told <i>The New York Times</i>: "If you are an employer, you will look at ayoung woman and say, 'Can we really entrust her to do crucialresponsibilities that no one else can do because she's going to takethree months of?'" Starr's answer to the economically logical, ifpolitically incorrect, question: "You protect women so they can nurturebabies and that's very nice, but you keep them at the lower end of thepay scale." Put bluntly, it is a lot easier to find temporary help toreplace a clerical worker than a professional.	<p>	Some women have already felt the negative effects of the legislation.A spokesman for "Nine to Five," the National Association of WorkingWomen, complained that their Long Island branch recently received 22phone calls from pregnant women who believed they had been fired byemployers seeking to get them out of the way before the law tookeffect. Sex discrimination is illegal, of course, but it is not alwaysirrational. Employers are usually going to follow market dictates,since that's why they are in business. To root out rational sexdiscrimination would require the government to police virtually everyemployment decision in the country.	<p>	Obviously, for fear of lawsuits if nothing else, companiescannot simply stop hiring women. But business can try to hire women whoseem least likely to take advantage of the new law. These days, anacknowledged lesbian would be a better bet than a blushing new bride.Similarly, a single woman over 35 is a more attractive candidate for ajob or promotion since statistically she is less likely to marry andhave children than her younger counterparts.	<p>	Thus, pro-family groups should have led the fight againstfamily-leave legislation. Unfortunately, however, many believed theliberals' claim that family leave really was good for the family. Isn'tit "pro-family" for employers to give women 12 weeks off to have kids?Not when the government mandates it, creating a powerful incentive forwomen with professional aspirations to remain not only childless butalso single.	<p>	Government intervention in the name of the family didn't beginwith this legislation and, unfortunately, won't end with it. The nextstep, demanded by many family-leave advocates, will be to requirecompanies to give employees paid leave--something that woulddramatically increase the disincentive to hiring women. And if theinconvenience of children is keeping women from being company workerspoliticians are likely to push for increased subsidies for andregulation of day care if not federally run centers.	<p>	Moreover, the Family and Medical Leave Act must be consideredin the context of other laws that restrict the labor market. LaborSecretary Robert Reich, for example, wants to raise the minimum wageand index it to the rate of inflation. If an employer can't afford topay up, he will have to let workers go. And if Congress passes theadministration's health-care plan, businesses will have additionalheavy expenses to bear.	<p>	Poor economic conditions, largely resulting from misguided federalfiscal and monetary policies, in conjunction with ever-higher rates oftaxation, have forced many mothers to work even when they would preferto remain home with their children. The government's first priority,then, should be to help relieve the financial pressure on women towork. At the same times it should drop measures that artificiallyinflate the costs of hiring mothers. Officials should allow women tonegotiate their own contracts, making the choice of salary levels andbenefits that best meet their own needs and that of their families.	<p>	Many politicians have paid lip service to reversing the breakdown ofthe family. Federally mandated family leave was one of their answers.But the family is a natural product of a free society and needs nospecial privileges from government to thrive. American families wouldbe better off if government undid the damage it has previously caused,instead of "helping" by passing ever more counterproductive measureslike family leave.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Family-Leave.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Baird</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Baird, a contributing editor of The Freeman, isProfessor of Economics and Director of The Smith Center forPrivate Enterprise Studies, California State University,Hayward.</p><hr noshade><p>	On June 15, 1993, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 239-190 toamend the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) to prohibit employersfrom hiring permanent replacement workers in economic strikes.President Clinton promised to sign such legislation.<p>	Republican senators have promised a filibuster, so the Senateleadership has postponed voting on the issue. When and if they round upthe necessary sixty votes they will schedule the vote. A filibusterstopped identical legislation in the 102nd Congress, and there is afair chance that it can do so again.<p>	The proposed legislation applies only to economic strikes, which areunion-initiated work stoppages over terms and conditions of employment.It is already illegal for employers to hire permanent replacementworkers in unfair labor practice strikes, which are union-initiatedwork stoppages over illegal actions by employers such as firing aworker for advocating unionism.<h4>The Nature of the Right to Strike</h4><p>	Unionists portray this issue as one of simple justice. They claim thatthe right to strike, which is guaranteed in the NLRA, is nullified bythe ability of employers to hire permanent replacement workers. Butwhat is the right to strike?<p>	Let's get back to basics. The employment relationship is one ofcontract between employees and employers. Contracts are formed byparties each of whom perceives that he will thereby gain. They arebased on mutual consent. The typical employment contract is anagreement that the employee will perform specified labor services forthe employer in exchange for a specified compensation package. Unless acontract specifies the contrary, employees do not have property rightsto their jobs.<p>	Since each worker owns his own labor services, he clearly has afundamental (i.e., independent of government) right to withhold thoseservices if he doesn't like the compensation package offered by anemployer. It follows that like-minded employees have a fundamentalright to withhold their labor services together, at the same time.However, there is no fundamental right for any worker, or group ofworkers, to prevent other workers from accepting the terms that theyhave refused to accept. To argue the contrary is to assert thatstrikers own the jobs that they refuse to do. Congress may legislatesuch a privilege, but that is different from a fundamental right. Inthe realm of rights rather than privilege, workers don't own jobs. Theyown their labor services.<p>	All workers, even nonunion workers own their labor services. Asowners they have a fundamental right to accept any terms of employmentthey wish, even if some other workers have rejected those terms.<p>	Unionists use the epithet "scab" to refer to workers who are willingto accept terms that union workers have rejected. A scab, unioniststhereby suggest, is less than human and therefore has no rights thatanyone need worry about. However, calling a replacement worker a scabis not a logical argument. To make their case, those who support theproposed striker replacement legislation have to come up with somejustification for subordinating the rights of union-free workers to theinterests of union workers.<p>	Moreover, existing law is well balanced between unions andmanagement. The terms and conditions of employment that a strikingunion seeks have long-run cost implications for its target employer. Ifemployers were prohibited from hiring permanent replacement workers,they could not impose any long-run costs on striking unions. As theU.S. Supreme Court has acknowledged, existing law allows each side tothreaten to impose long-run costs. The hiring of permanent replacementworkers, according to the Court, is one of the employers' "economicweapons in reserve" that they may legitimately employ in the collectivebargaining process.<p>	Finally, the ability of employers to hire permanent replacementworkers provides a market-reality check to both sides in a labordispute. If an employer is able easily to hire replacements at termsthat a union has rejected (current law forbids employers to offerbetter terms), the union knows its terms are unrealistic. But if theemployer cannot do so, it knows that the union's terms are notunrealistic. If employers were permitted to hire only temporaryreplacement workers, as the proposed legislation specifies, thismarket-reality check would vanish. Workers are often reluctant toaccept temporary job offers even at high pay.<p>	Although only 11.5 percent of private sector workers are unionized,the proposed legislation creates privileges for union workers at theexpense of rights of union-free workers. Is that consistent with theAmerican principle that all people have equal rights and are entitledto equal protection of the laws?</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Strikers-are-Scabs.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Indeed, many a university has become awasteland, morally and otherwise.	<p>	An exception to the rule lies about a thousand miles south of the RioGrande. It's Universidad Francisco Marroquin, founded in 1972 in rentedspace in the capital city of Guatemala. Clues to its philosophy areseen in the name of one of its newest buildings, the Ludwig von MisesLibrary, so designated in foot-high polished brass lettering over itsentrance, and in the fact that members of the UFM faculty have beenpublished on the editorial page of The Wall Street Journal as much asthose of any American university.	<p>	Another clue is seen in its honorary degree awards to individuals ofthe persuasion of Leonard Read, Henry Hazlitt, Friedrich Hayek, MiltonFriedman, Benjamin Rogge, Peter Bauer, W. H. Hutt, Alberto BenegasLynch, George Roche, Agustin Navarro, Edwin Feulner, Antony Fisher,John Chamberlain, Percy Greaves, Bettina Bien Greaves, Viktor Frankl,M. Stanton Evans, Hans Sennholz, Israel Kirzner, Leonard Liggio, HenryManne, Thomas Szasz, and J. William Middendorf.	<p>	UFM enrollment has grown to 4,500 with schools in medicine,dentistry, law, theology, architecture, education, economics,accounting, computer science, and business administration—the latterwith a branch in El Salvador. Exchange programs are maintained withAmerican universities such as Texas A and M.	<p>	UFM tuition is maintained at around 20 percent higher than thetwo other private Guatemalan universities, with applicationsnonetheless exceeding admissions by a significant factor. (Some localwant ads for doctors, lawyers, CPAs, etc., stipulate that only UFMgrads will be considered.) But no qualified UFM applicant is turnedaway if tuition payments cannot be met, as student loans are available.	<p>	UFM's high tuition is all the more amazing in view of the factthat Guatemala's national university, whose main campus is just a fewmiles away, charges its students practically nothing. Understandably sosince the national university is allotted four percent of the centralgovernment's budget, in accordance with Guatemala's constitution.	<p>	UFM funding is assisted by Foundation Francisco Marroquin in Stuart,Florida. The foundation states that it is "devoted to encourageeducation in the economics of the market system and the politics offreedom in Latin America." Besides UFM, the foundation solicits fundsfor such other Latin American free-market centers as the Centro deEstudios Sobre la Libertad of Argentina, the Instituto Liberal ConselhoNacional of Brazil, the Centro de Estudios Publicos of Chile, theInstituto Cultural Ludwig von Mises of Mexico, and the InstitutoLibertad y Democracia of Peru.	<p>	UFM academic standards are high, with the university tighteningthose standards over the years. For example, it eliminated thetraditional Latin American university practice of a "second chance " onfinal exams. It also made more difficult the dropping of courseswithout affecting the requisite grade point average. And it raised thescore that degree students must attain on an English-languageproficiency test.	<p>	More striking still is the UFM standard on academic freedom.Its faculty handbook recognizes the right of professors to teach "thatwhich is contrary to [UFM's] philosophy or its policies, <i>as long as itis done elsewhere and under someone else's auspices</i>." (My emphasis.)Thus Francisco Marroquin University openly upholds and enforces theright to decide the faculty and content for all of its courses in viewof what it holds to be "true, false, useful or irrelevant."	<p>	Perhaps the most striking academic standard of all, though, isthe UFM requirement that every student, whether of medicine, dentistry,law, education, theology, etc., take and pass courses on the economicsand philosophies of Mises and Hayek, reading Spanish editions of suchworks as <i>Human Action</i> and <i>The Road to Serfdom</i>.	<p>	With the university now in its 22nd year of operation, tens ofthousands of UFM graduates are having an impact on political andeconomic thinking in Guatemala and Latin America. Consider that UFMco-founder and first rector Dr. Manuel Ayau, who is also a businessmanand former president of the international free-market Mont PelerinSociety, sought the vice presidency of Guatemala in 1990. Given thatAyau's freemarket positions are well known, that he was chosen for theticket is revealing, that he made the 1991 run-off election, coming upwith a respectable showing at the polls, is even more revealing.	<p>	That showing is all the more surprising in view of the factthat Guatemala is a Third World country with a 9 million population ofpredominantly Mayan and Mestizo ethnic groups, a stormy history (twomilitary coups in the early 1980s and some 100,000 killed in armedclashes between security forces and Marxist guerrillas over the past 30years), an inflation rate of about 11 percent, and a literacy rate ofaround 50 percent.	<p>	So UFM's faculty, staff, students, trustees, alumni, and supporters,have their work cut out so as to maintain and spread their free-marketphilosophy. In 1993 Guatemala's President Jorge Serrano, initiallybacked by the army, seized the government. Serrano in one strokeclamped down on the press and abolished the legislature, courts, andthe national constitution. But in one week the would-be civiliandictator fled the country, and Guatemala's constitution was restored.Latin American politics in the twentieth century has been anything butcalm.	<p>	Even so, thanks in part to UFM and its seminal free-market,limited-government thinking, Guatemala's future is not without hope.That hope further springs from economic success stories in Mexico,Chile, and Argentina—Latin American countries also with recent stormyhistories which nonetheless managed to turn themselves around.	<p>	How in the world then did the UFM begin? In a nutshell, inspirationand entrepreneurship. Co-founder Dr. Ayau was inspired by the lecturesand writings of Mises, and through him by the ideas of Leonard Read andF. A. Harper, says Leonard Liggio of George Mason University'sInstitute for Humane Studies.	<p>	Adds Dr. Liggio: "Thanks to Mises' teachings, Ayau and [co-founderand fellow Guatemalan] Ulysses Dent recognized that higher education isthe most important contested area for shaping social change—and thearea in which the socialists have seized most of the ground."</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Free-Market-University.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Many Americans think that our forests are beingdestroyed by logging, that the world's natural resources aredisappearing, that hundreds of species are going extinct each year. andthat the future, with a depleting ozone layer and imminent globalwarming, is bleak. But when Americans look outside their window ortravel on vacation, they in fact find clean air and clean streams, andmiles and miles of open space and forestland.<p>	Furthermore, current information casts doubt on worries aboutthe future. Most of the nonrenewable resources that people feared wouldskyrocket in price. materials like copper and tungsten, are cheaperthan they were ten years ago. And in spite of two decades of worryabout energy, the world is awash in oil.<p><a name="1r"><a name="2r"><a name="3r"></p><p>	Although human beings may be having an effect on the climate,careful study of these issues indicates that the impacts are likely tobe modest. The ozone layer is not being ripped apart by floatingchemicals; even if there has been five percent depletion, as somepessimists suggest (and no one is sure), the loss has about as muchimpact on skin cancer as moving south sixty miles, for example fromPalm Beach to Miami.<a href="#1">[1]</a> Fear of global warming isbased on computer models of climate that are so inadequate that theyare essentially speculation.<a href="#2">[2]</a> And recent satellitestudies of the Amazon suggest that the rate of deforestation may beabout one-fifth of what scientists previously thought.<ahref="#3">[3]</a><p>	The fact is that the environment in the United States is generally ahealthy one, and the alarms about global problems (deforestation,ozone, the greenhouse effect) are exaggerated.<p><a name="4r"></p><p>	The world does have environmental problems, but most of themare quite different from the ones that we read about daily. James R.Dunn and John E. Kinney recently wrote a paper that included two listsof environmental problems.<a href="#4">[4]</a> The first came from apoll of Americans taken by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> and the NationalBroadcasting Company in April 1990. It listed environmental problems inorder, based on the number of people who thought they were seriousproblems. At the top were hazardous waste sites, water pollution fromindustrial wastes, occupational exposure to toxic chemicals, oilspills, and the destruction of the ozone layer.<p>	Then came a list of environmental problems developed by an Ethiopiangeologist, trained in the United States but familiar with a number ofAfrican nations. At the top were diseases (such as sleeping sickness,malaria, and dysentery), soil erosion, loss of soil nutrients(primarily due to lack of fertilizer), lack of sewage disposal andcontamination of water by human bodily wastes, insufficient facilitiesfor treatment of drinking water. and lack of refrigeration.<p>	"The lists have virtually a 100 percent lack of correlation,"said Dunn and Kinney. 'The U.S. list is mostly a media list in thesense that the public must be told of most problems (that is, mostcitizens do not really see or feel the problems on a daily basis)." Incontrast, "the African problems are obvious to everyone who livesthere." They are "megaproblems, pervasive, largely visible everywhereand result in decreasing food production, very high infant mortality.severe social problems, a decreasing average human life span, and adecrease in human productivity, average income, and quality of life."<h4>The Role of Economic Growth</h4><p>	Nearly every one of the problems cited by the Ethiopian geologistcould be corrected by economic growth. And, indeed, the attractivenessof the American environment (and that of most developed nations) hascome about because of economic growth.<p>	There are two reasons for the link between economic growth anda better environment One is that greater wealth leads to greater demandfor environmental quality— and the willingness and ability to sacrificeto attain it. Until people have food on their tables, they can't beterribly concerned with the view from their windows. Only after theyhave basic sanitation (which millions of people still lack) can theyworry about making streams and lakes pristine. In the United Statestoday, people are wealthy enough to willingly pay higher taxes andhigher prices for goods, if necessary, to assure that the environmentis clean.<p><a name="5r"></p><p>	Environmentalists themselves offer the best illustration ofthe connection between economic growth and environmental protection.The readers of Sierra, the magazine of the Sierra Club, have (accordingto Sierra's 1992 reader study) an average income of $79,400, comparedwith the average American adult's income of $37,100.<ahref="#5">[5]</a> These wealthy people want a clean environment andthey are willing to pay for one.<p>	A second reason for the good environmental record in the West is thatthe Western countries are capitalistic. Contrary to much popularrhetoric, capitalism has characteristics that spur pollution controland environmental improvement, even without an Environmental ProtectionAgency.<p>	For example, most pollution is waste. The smoke that contributes toair pollution is often unburnt fuel. Profit-making companies have overthe years tried to save fuel by reducing pollution. One of the earlymeasures of air pollution, the Ringelmann number, was developed byengineers trying to save diesel fuel.<p><a name="6r"></p><p>	Profit-making companies have incentives to be efficient. EconomistMikhail Bernstam compared the use of energy in capitalist and socialistcountries. He found that the market-based economies used only 37percent as much the energy as did the socialist nations to produce thesame output.<a href="#6">[6]</a><p><a name="7r"></p><p>	Market-based economies conserve on other materials as well.In 1965, for example, 164 pounds of metal were needed to produce 1,000beverage cans. But that went down to 35 pounds by 1990, the changecaused by the shift to lighter-weight aluminum and a reduction in theamount of material used.<a href="#7">[7]</a> Competition pressured thecompanies to use less raw material.<p><a name="8r"></p><p>	And environmentalist Randal O'Toole points out that we can thank theautomobile for the dramatic regrowth of forests in the twentiethcentury! By displacing horses, the automobile eliminated the need forso much pastureland for horses, so millions of acres of farmlandreverted to forest.<a href="#8">[8]</a><p><a name="9r"></p><p>	These points--the fact that economic growth leads to greaterdemand for environmental quality, and the fact that capitalismdiscourages waste--help explain the improvements In the Westerncountries. Of course, profit incentives do not completely eliminate allwaste. Traditionally, common law was also a tool that people used toprotect themselves from extreme pollution, and today laws andregulations are widely used to prevent pollution. Interestingly,however, evidence suggests that air pollution declined faster in theUnited States in the 1960s, before passage of the Clean Air Act, thanit did after passage of the Act.<a href="#9">[9]</a><h4>Why the Worry?</h4><p>	So, in the face of such good news, why are Americans so worried?Perhaps because when the most severe problems have been solved, themore abstract ones surface. There is always more to be done.<p><a name="10r"></p><p>	But there are other reasons, too. While environmental groupsplayed an important role in publicizing the need for improvements inair and water pollution in the past, today many are bureaucraticorganizations whose programs depend on large memberships and steadydonations. It is in the interest of these groups to keep fear alive. Ina paper given at the Mont Pelerin Society in 1991, PERC SeniorAssociate Richard Stroup observed: "it is ironic that to date, atleast, the media and most voters seem not to have recognized thatrepresentatives of environmental groups face the same conflicts ofinterest [as business executives do]. They may be nonprofit, but theirfinancial health and expansion depend on donations and governmentgrants, both of which are likely to be enhanced if they can convincethe public that crisis looms."<a href="#10">[10]</a><p>	Stroup also points out that reporters are trying to break intoprint and editors are trying to win readers with dramatic scarestories. Even scientists get into the game. While their science may behonest, the way they interpret their results (say, on global warming)may determine whether their laboratory gets additional funding or not.And government agencies find that "a crisis loosens the purse stringsand paves the way for increased power or 'turf'," says Stroup.<p><a name="11r"><a name="12r"></p><p>	Politicians, always ready to take advantage of public perceptions,have based policy on heavily slanted information about environmentalproblems. Such policies may have unfortunate consequences. For example,government regulations requiring fuel efficiency have led to smallercars, which result in more highway deaths.<a href="#11">[11]</a> Theexplosion of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986 seems to have beencaused by the withdrawal from the market of asbestos-based putty thatwas used to seal the o-rings.<a href="#12">[12]</a> This withdrawalstemmed from the EPA's campaign against asbestos (largely unwarranted,it turns out). The current government campaign to eliminate CFCs (suchas Freon) will raise the price and energy requirements of refrigerationaround the world, adding to the troubles of the world's poorest people.Fewer, smaller refrigerators mean more food poisoning and less fresh,wholesome food.<p>	So the environmental picture is mixed. As long as economicgrowth occurs, we can expect a better environment, but if we use ourresources to fight largely imaginary disasters, we may end up harmingthose whose environments are in the worst shape.</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>S.

This does not mean, of course,that the economic planners don't continue to try; some will neverconcede defeat, even when theory and history tell them to give up.Along with the economic planners are the social planners, who usuallycall themselves egalitarians or defenders of social justice. But thetruth is, they, too, along with the economic planners, should throw inthe towel. Interestingly, the reason why the social planners shouldgive up is the same reason why the economic planners should consigntheir visions to the dustbin. It all has to do with knowledge.<p>	Let me explain by focusing on one social movement in theUnited States which is ripe with social planning: mainstream feminism.Although feminists generally argue that the use of legislation associal planning has its limitations, they see legislative change as atleast a partial means to positive cultural change.<ahref="#1">[1]</a><p>	Complete cultural change requires an entire transformation ofmany existing institutions such as "the family, childrearingarrangements, the economy, the wage labor market, and humanconsciousness."<a href="#2">[2]</a> So, in fact, legislation is seen asa compromise to real reform, which requires the abolition of markets. 		<h4>The Problem With Planning</h4><p>	Since the whole abolition of markets is not feasible to most,legislative mandates are the next best thing. Always keep in mind thatplanning is planning; whether on a large or small scale, the sameproblem arises. This problem is what F. A. Hayek calls a knowledgeproblem.<p>	Each individual in an economy possesses knowledge only someof which is known by others. This <i>subjective</i> knowledge of particulartime and circumstances is that of one's values, tastes, plans, talents,desires, and so on. This knowledge, of a contextual nature, isdispersed throughout the economy, and is constantly changing.<ahref="#3">[3]</a> Furthermore, much of this knowledge is inarticulateor tacit. Because of the contextual and subjective nature of knowledgein society, any one person or group of persons cannot possess all ofthis knowledge. The basic economic problem that all societies face,therefore, is how to utilize this knowledge . Ludwig von Mises explainsexactly why economic calculation, the utilization of subjective anddispersed knowledge, in a planned economy is technically impossible.<ahref="#4">[4]</a> According to Mises, there are really two processes ofeconomic valuation in an economy: that of the consumer and that of theproducer. Both processes are necessary for economic calculation andcoordination. For example, even if the planners could know thesubjective valuations of goods by the consumers in an economy (or evenassume that they know what should be valued by consumers) and the bestproduction techniques for producing these goods, economic calculationwould still be impossible. This is because there would be no means forknowing or calculating how the scarce productive resources should beutilized. That is, how would the planners know if a piece of landshould be used as a site for a factory or for a potato farm or for anyother number of uses? Mises explains that what is necessary foreconomic calculation is private ownership of the means of production.Without the existence of prices and the profit calculations they makepossible, central planners could never possess the knowledge necessaryto direct resources so that people's basic wants are satisfied. It isthe private ownership of the means of production which leads to acompetitive bidding process among resource owners, which in turngenerates market prices for these resources.<a href="#5">[5]</a> It iswith the use of these market prices that economic calculation takesplace.<p>	What is important to note here is that the economic phenomenabeing conveyed or "calculated" in a market price are subjective innature. That is, they are the subjective valuations of individualactors in any market. The "objective" price seen in a market is theresult of the interaction of the subjective valuations of numerousmarket actors. As Mises explains, "The subjective use-value of each[commodity] is not immediately comparable as a purely individualphenomenon with the subjective use-value of other men. It only becomesso in exchange value [price], which arises out of the interplay of thesubjective valuations of all who take part in exchange."<ahref="#6">[6]</a> It is this subjective nature of economic phenomenathat dismisses the possibility of economic calculation under socialism.<p>	And it is also the subjective nature of social phenomenawhich dismisses the possibility of successful social planning. Just aseconomic planners must "guess" where resources should be utilizedbecause it is impossible for them to know the subjective valuations ofconsumers and producers, social planners, attempting to produce equalopportunities for both men and women, must also ''guess" at what thesubjective term "opportunity" means to all women. But this is also animpossibility.<h4>Opportunities Cannot Be Objectified</h4><p>	Opportunities are subjective in nature. Furthermore, the knowledgeregarding what different individuals value as opportunities isdispersed throughout society, is contextual in nature, and isconstantly changing. Social planners could never possess all of thisinformation. How then, could they be successful at organizing societysuch that all opportunities are "equal." In fact, since opportunitiesare subjective in nature, they cannot be objectified or thereby"equated" one with another.<p>	In a planned system, whereby women are told that they mustplay a certain role (or roles) in society, it is difficult to arguethat this is a system which allows for individual women to plan theirown lives and decide their own opportunities. This will always be themajor problem with centralized social planning of any scale: theindividual woman can never be the focus of attention, only women insome sort of generic sense. Therefore there will always be a largenumber, if not the vast majority, of women who are not satisfied withwhat the planners decide to do. Decentralized planning, with each womanplanning her own life, would be more successful than centralized socialplanning in fostering an atmosphere in which opportunities remain wherethey actually are: in the minds of individual women.<p>	Furthermore, planners do not seem to comprehend the complexity ofour society. Because of the complexity of market orders, they cannot beplanned with any degree of success. This is also true, for the socialorder in general. In fact, the more complex an order is, the morespontaneous it must be. Attempting to plan the order such that aparticular end is reached will be futile. But just as important, thisattempt will also produce unintended and undesirable consequences, onlysome of which can be predicted.<p>	Important in this idea of markets as spontaneous orders, asHayek explains, is that individuals within markets must be guided bygeneral rules, not by specific commands. General rules provide aframework under which individuals act in a more or less similar way.Because these rules are general, they are applicable to a variety ofcircumstances and, most important, allow people to utilize theirindividualized "knowledge of time and circumstance." Hayek explains,"They [the rules governing a spontaneous order] will have to be appliedby the individuals in the light of their respective knowledge andpurposes; and their application will be independent of any commonpurpose, which the individual need not even know."<a href="#7">[7]</a> 	<p>	In her book <i>Reclaiming the Mainstream: Individualist FeminismRediscovered</i>, Joan Kennedy Taylor argues that the feminist movement inthe United States has gone through several important changes since itsconception. The most important of these was the movement from a focuson individualism to that of collectivism.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Anotherway of approaching this idea is that when feminists focused on theindividual, the desire was to change the general rules of society sothat they applied to both men and women in the same (or near same)manner. In other words the focus was on equality under the law ingeneral, or equality with respect to the process, to the rules of thegame—not equality with respect to specific ends.<p>	Women, therefore, demanded the right to own property, to sue, tomake contracts, and to vote, all of which men could already do. Hayekexplains that general rules, "must be the same, if not necessarily forall members, at least for whole classes of members not individuallydesignated by name."<a href="#9">[9]</a> Although one can argue thatthere should be general rules which apply differently to men and women(for example, whether women should enter combat or not), these shouldbe exceptions and not norms, especially if women themselves desire tohave the same general rules in all cases. This is because the generalrules of society should change as cultural norms change. In actuality,some general rules are cultural norms, while others are deliberatelydesigned. And, in fact, these two "types" of general rules worktogether or influence one another.<p>	It was a change in the cultural norms that led women to callfor changes in the deliberately designed general rules of society (thedemand for property rights and the like). And, in turn, these changesin the general rules influence cultural norms.<a href="#10">[10]</a><h4>Women Enter the Market Arena</h4><p>	Two of the most important changes individualist feminism madewith regard to the general rules of society were giving women the rightto own property and to make contracts. Both of these rules areprerequisites of a market order. Allowing women these rights, thereforeopened up the possibility for women to enter the market arena.<p>	Before explaining the importance of these particular changes, itshould first be noted that both the freedom to own property and to makecontracts are general rules, and not specific commands because theactual ownership rights and the terms of individual contracts are leftto the market participants. The general rule is that contracts can bemade, and then can be legally upheld. Legislative mandates, which forcethe terms of particular contracts, are not general rules, but areinstead specific commands. The terms of contracts are no longer left tomarket participants, but are instead stipulated across the board.<p>	It is unfortunate, but today most feminist goals are oftenset in very specific terms: the desire for more women in uppermanagement or public office (a set number or percentage of populationis often given), the desire for equal wage rates between men axedwomen, or the desire for all businesses to offer very specific terms ofemployment, to name a few examples. Given these particular or specificgoals, legislative mandates are set in place in order to bring themabout. Instead of the intended goal, however, what we get areunintended consequences such as an increase in sex discrimination and adecrease in self-determination by women.<p>	Now, why is freedom of contract, specifically, so importantto women? First, again, as Hayek explains, "although we can endeavor toimprove a spontaneous order by revising the general rules on which itrests, and can supplement its results by the efforts of variousorganizations, we cannot improve the results by specific commands thatdeprive its members of the possibility of using their knowledge fortheir purposes."<a href="#11">[11]</a> In other words, specificcommands hinder market actors by not allowing them to adjust thegeneral rules to their individual circumstances by utilizing theirunique knowledge.<h4>Women and the "Knowledge Problem"</h4><p>	Why is the utilization of individual knowledge in labor markets soimportant to women? In essence, employers face a "knowledge problem"regarding which employees to hire. They must trade off the costs ofscreening individual employees with the costs of missing out on hiringvery productive workers. This is why firms, indeed market forces, haveproduced different ways by which employers can screen employees atlower costs. These include employment agencies, interviews, references,different types of employment tests (such as aptitude or skill leveltests), as well as brand names in educational and vocationalinstitutions.<p>	All of these devices decrease screening costs for employersand thereby increase the likelihood that potential employees will behired on the basis of their individual attributes rather than on thebasis of their group membership. This is especially applicable to womenbecause men and women are biologically, and sometimes culturally,different. These differences are often viewed by employers asstatistical differences in terms of employment practices. For examplewomen, on average, have higher turnover rates than men; women, onaverage, are more likely to take time off upon the birth of a child,and so on. Anything which increases the flow of information regardingindividual employees will lead to a decrease in employer discriminationbased upon these group averages. Insofar as the flow of information isinterrupted, employers' screening costs remain high and they resort tohiring on the basis of statistical averages. Legislation that prohibitsthe use of employment tests, for example, on the basis that the testsare biased against particular groups in society will actually decreasethe likelihood that individual members of these groups can setthemselves apart from the group and be hired on individual meritconsiderations.<a href="#12">[12]</a><p>	The freedom to make creative, individualized employment contractscan be a vital source of information to employers and thereby decreasediscrimination. Legislative mandates take away this means forindividual women to distinguish themselves, but more important, theytake away the very method by which women can bring about social changewithout the use of legislation.<p>	In fact, it is the unique ways in which individual economicactors can utilize their specific knowledge within a market order thatwill determine the changes in the order over time. "The particularcontent of the order will depend on the concrete circumstances knownonly to the individuals who obey the rules and apply them to factsknown only to them. It will be through the knowledge of theseindividuals both of the rules and of the particular facts that bothwill determine the resulting order."<a href="#13">[13]</a> The pointbeing, the order will change over time as individuals apply theirparticular knowledge to the rules of the order. But note that the orderchanges according to this knowledge, which contains individual tastesand subjective values of market actors. The resulting order issomething which emerges spontaneously in the sense that there was nodeliberate design of the whole order. Instead, the order adjusts to theindividual actions of people within the order. <p>	What message does this give to feminists who desire social change?It says that it is up to women themselves to change the order fromwithin. The order cannot be changed through legislative mandates fortwo reasons: the unintended consequences which result in decreasedopportunities for women, and because mandates actually destroy the verymeans to social change that women have--the utilization of individualknowledge through freedom of contract.<p>	This idea of social change through freedom of contract doesnot appeal to many feminists because it places the responsibility forchange on those who desire the change. It provides the message to womenthat they are not passive agents in social evolution, but are insteadresponsible for a large amount of that evolution. It maintains thatmarkets do not take opportunities away from women, but instead, thatmarkets actually provide opportunities for women to instigate socialchange. </p><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol>	<a name="1"><li> See, for example, H.

DiLorenzo</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. DiLorenzo, this month's guest editor,is Professor of Economics at LoyolaCollege, Baltimore, Maryland (U.S.A.).</p><hr noshade><p>	When most people hear the word "fascism" they naturally think ofits ugly racism and anti-Semitism as practiced by the totalitarianregimes of Mussolini and Hitler. But there was also an economic policycomponent of fascism, known in Europe during the 1920s and '30s as"corporatism," that was an essential ingredient of economictotalitarianism as practiced by Mussolini and Hitler. So-calledcorporatism was adopted in Italy and Germany during the 1930s and washeld up as a "model" by quite a few intellectuals and policy makers inthe United States and Europe. A version of economic fascism was in factadopted in the United States in the 1930s and survives to this day. Inthe United States these policies were not called "fascism" but "plannedcapitalism." The word fascism may no longer be politically acceptable,but its synonym "industrial policy" is as popular as ever.<h4>The Free World Flirts With Fascism</h4><p>	<a name="1r"><a name="2r">Few Americans are aware of or canrecall how so many Americans and Europeans viewed economic fascism asthe wave of the future during the 1930s. The American Ambassador toItaly, Richard Washburn Child, was so impressed with "corporatism" thathe wrote in the preface to Mussolini's 1928 autobiography that "it maybe shrewdly forecast that no man will exhibit dimensions of permanentgreatness equal to Mussolini. . . . The Duce is now the greatest figureof this sphere and time."<a href="#1">[1]</a> Winston Churchill wrotein 1927 that "If I had been an Italian I am sure I would have beenentirely with you" and "don the Fascist black shirt."<ahref="#2">[2]</a> As late as 1940, Churchill was still describingMussolini as ''a great man."<p>	<a name="3r">U.S. Congressman Sol Bloom, Chairman of theHouse Foreign Relations Committee, said in 1926 that Mussolini "will bea great thing not only for Italy but for all of us if he succeeds. Itis his inspiration, his determination, his constant toil that hasliterally rejuvenated Italy..."<a href="#3">[3]</a><p>	One of the most outspoken American fascists was economist LawrenceDennis. In his 1936 book, <i>The Coming American Fascism</i>, Dennisdeclared that defenders of "18th-century Americanism" were sure tobecome "the laughing stock of their own countrymen" and that theadoption of economic fascism would intensify "national spirit" and putit behind "the enterprises of public welfare and social control." Thebig stumbling block to the development of economic fascism, Dennisbemoaned, was "liberal norms of law or constitutional guarantees ofprivate rights."<p>	<a name="5r"><a name="5r">Certain British intellectuals wereperhaps the most smitten of anyone by fascism. George Bernard Shawannounced in 1927 that his fellow "socialists should be delighted tofind at last a socialist [Mussolini] who speaks and thinks asresponsible rulers do."<a href="#4">[4]</a> He helped form the BritishUnion of Fascists whose "Outline of the Corporate State," according tothe organization's founder, Sir Oswald Mosley, was "on the ItalianModel." While visiting England, the American author Ezra Pound declaredthat Mussolini was "continuing the task of Thomas Jefferson."<ahref="#5">[5]</a>	<p>	Thus, it is important to recognize that, as an economic system,fascism was widely accepted in the 1920s and '30s. The evil deeds ofindividual fascists were later condemned, but the practice of economicfascism never was. To this day, the historically uninformed continue torepeat the hoary slogan that, despite all his faults, Mussolini atleast "made the trains run on time," insinuating that hisinterventionist industrial policies were a success.<h4>The Italian "Corporatist" System</h4><p>	So-called "corporatism" as practiced by Mussolini and revered byso many intellectuals and policy makers had several key elements:	<p>	<b>The state comes before the individual.</b> Webster's New CollegiateDictionary defines fascism as "a political philosophy, movement, orregime that exalts nation and often race above the individual and thatstands for a centralized, autocratic government." This stands in starkcontrast to the classical liberal idea that individuals have naturalrights that pre-exist government; that government derives its "justpowers" only through the consent of the governed; and that theprincipal function of government is to protect the lives, liberties,and properties of its citizens, not to aggrandize the state.	<p>	<a name="6r">Mussolini viewed these liberal ideas (in the Europeansense of the word "liberal") as the antithesis of fascism: "The Fascistconception of life," Mussolini wrote, "stresses the importance of theState and accepts the individual only in so far as his interestscoincide with the State. It is opposed to classical liberalism [which]denied the State in the name of the individual; Fascism reasserts therights of the State as expressing the real essence of the individual."<a href="#6">[6]</a><p>	<a name="7r">Mussolini thought it was unnatural for a governmentto protect individual rights: "The maxim that society exists only forthe well-being and freedom of the individuals composing it does notseem to be in conformity with nature's plans."<a href="#7">[7]</a> "Ifclassical liberalism spells individualism," Mussolini continued,"Fascism spells government."	<p>	The essence of fascism, therefore, is that government should bethe master, not the servant, of the people. Think about this. Doesanyone in America really believe that this is not what we have now? AreInternal Revenue Service agents really our "servants"? Is compulsory"national service" for young people, which now exists in numerousstates and is part of a federally funded program, not a classic exampleof coercing individuals to serve the state? Isn't the whole idea behindthe massive regulation and regimentation of American industry andsociety the notion that individuals should be forced to behave in waysdefined by a small governmental elite? When the nation's premierhealth-care reformer recently declared that heart bypass surgery on a92-year-old man was "a waste of resources," wasn't that the epitome ofthe fascist ideal—that the state, not individuals, should decide whoselife is worthwhile, and whose is a "waste"?	<p>	<a name="8r">The U.S. Constitution was written by individualswho believed in the classical liberal philosophy of individual rightsand sought to protect those rights from governmental encroachment. Butsince the fascist/collectivist philosophy has been so influential,policy reforms over the past half century have all but abolished manyof these rights by simply ignoring many of the provisions in theConstitution that were designed to protect them. As legal scholarRichard Epstein has observed: "[T]he eminent domain...and parallelclauses in the Constitution render . . . suspect many of the heraldedreforms and institutions of the twentieth century: zoning, rentcontrol, workers' compensation laws, transfer payments, progressivetaxation."<a href="#8">[8]</a> It is important to note that most ofthese reforms were initially adopted during the '30s, when thefascist/collectivist philosophy was in its heyday.<p>	<a name="9r"><a name="10r"><a name="11r"><b>Planned industrial"harmony."</b> Another keystone of Italian corporatism was the ideathat the government's interventions in the economy should not beconducted on an ad hoc basis, but should be "coordinated" by some kindof central planning board. Government intervention in Italy was "toodiverse, varied, contrasting. There has been disorganic...intervention,case by case, as the need arises," Mussolini complained in 1935.<ahref="#9">[9]</a> Fascism would correct this by directing the economytoward "certain fixed objectives" and would "introduce order in theeconomic field."<a href="#10">[10]</a> Corporatist planning, accordingto Mussolini adviser Fausto Pitigliani, would give governmentintervention in the Italian economy a certain "unity of aim," asdefined by the government planners."<a href="#11">[11]</a><p>	<a name="12r"><a name="13r">These exact sentiments were expressedby Robert Reich (currently the U.S. Secretary of Labor) and IraMagaziner (currently the federal government's health care reform"Czar") in their book <i>Minding America's Business</i>.<ahref="#12">[12]</a> In order to counteract the "untidy marketplace," aninterventionist industrial policy "must strive to integrate the fullrange of targeted government policies--procurement, research anddevelopment, trade, antitrust, tax credits, and subsidies--into acoherent strategy..."<a href="#13">[13]</a><p>	<a name="14r">Current industrial policy interventions. Reichand Magaziner bemoaned, are "the product of fragmented anduncoordinated decisions made by Many different executive agencies, theCongress, and independent regulatory agencies.... There is nointegrated strategy to use these programs to improve the...U.S.economy."<a href="#14">[14]</a><p>	<a name="15r">In his 1989 book, <i>The Silent War</i>, Magazinerreiterated this theme by advocating "a coordinating group like thenational Security Council to take a strategic national industrialview."<a href="#15">[15]</a> The White House has in fact established a"National Economic Security Council." Every other advocate of aninterventionist "industrial policy" has made a similar "unity of aim"argument, as first described by Pitigliani more than half a centuryago.	<p>	<b>Government-business partnerships</b>. A third defining characteristic ofeconomic fascism is that private property and business ownership arepermitted, but are in reality controlled by government through abusiness-government "partnership." As Ayn Rand often noted, however, insuch a partnership government is always the senior or dominating"partner."	<p>	<a name="16r">In Mussolini's Italy, businesses were groupedby the government into legally recognized "syndicates" such as the"National Fascist Confederation of Commerce," the "National FascistConfederation of Credit and Insurance," and so on. All of these"fascist confederations" were "coordinated" by a network of governmentplanning agencies called "corporations," one for each industry. Onelarge "National Council of Corporations" served as a national overseerof the individual "corporations" and had the power to "issueregulations of a compulsory character."<a href="#16">[16]</a><p>	<a name="17r"><a name="18r">The purpose of this byzantineregulatory arrangement was so that the government could "securecollaboration...between the various categories of producers in eachparticular trade or branch of productive activity."<ahref="#17">[17]</a> Government-orchestrated "collaboration" wasnecessary because "the principle of private initiative" could only beuseful "in the service of the national interest" as defined bygovernment bureaucrats.<a href="#18">[18]</a><p>	<a name="19r"><a name="20r"><a name="21r">This idea ofgovernment-mandated and -dominated "collaboration" is also at the heartof all interventionist industrial policy schemes. A successfulindustrial policy, write Reich and Magaziner, would "require carefulcoordination between public and private sectors."<a href="#19">[19]</a>"Government and the private sector must work in tandem."<ahref="#20">[20]</a> "Economic success now depends to a high degree oncoordination, collaboration, and careful strategic choice," guided bygovernment.<a href="#21">[21]</a> 	<p>	<a name="22r"><a name="23r"><a name="24r">The AFL-CIO hasechoed this theme, advocating a "tripartite NationalReindustrialization Board—including representatives of labor, business,and government" that would supposedly "plan" the economy.<ahref="#22">[22]</a> The Washington, D.C.-based Center for NationalPolicy has also published a report authored by businessmen from LazardFreres, du Pont, Burroughs, Chrysler, Electronic Data Systems, andother corporations promoting an allegedly "new" policy based on"cooperation of government with business and labor."<ahref="#23">[23]</a> Another report, by the organization "RebuildAmerica," co-authored in 1986 by Robert Reich and economists RobertSolow, Lester Thurow, Laura Tyson, Paul Krugman, Pat Choate, andLawrence Chimerine urges "more teamwork" through "public-privatepartnerships among government, business and academia."<ahref="#24">[24]</a> This report calls for "national goals and targets"set by government planners who will devise a "comprehensive investmentstrategy" that will only permit "productive" investment, as defined bygovernment, to take place.<p>	<a name="25r"><a name="26r"><a name="27r"><b>Mercantilism andprotectionism</b>. Whenever politicians start talking about "collaboration"with business, it is time to hold on to your wallet. Despite thefascist rhetoric about "national collaboration" and working for thenational, rather than private, interests, the truth is thatmercantilist and Protectionist practices riddled the system. Italiansocial critic Gaetano Salvemini wrote in 1936 that under corporatism,"it is the state, i.e., the taxpayer, who has become responsible toprivate enterprise. In Fascist Italy the state pays for the blunders ofprivate enterprise."<a href="#25">[25]</a> As long as business wasgood, Salvemini wrote, "profit remained to private initiative."<ahref="#26">[26]</a> But when the depression came, "the government addedthe loss to the taxpayer's burden. Profit is private and individual.Loss is public and social."<a href="#27">[27]</a> 	<p>	<a name="28r">The Italian corporative state, <i>The Economist</i>editorialized on July 27, 1935, "only amounts to the establishment of anew and costly bureaucracy from which those industrialists who canspend the necessary amount, can obtain almost anything they want, andput into practice the worst kind of monopolistic practices at theexpense of the little fellow who is squeezed out in the process."Corporatism, in other words, was a massive system of corporate welfare."Three-quarters of the Italian economic system," Mussolini boasted in1934, "had been subsidized by government."<a href="#28">[28]</a><p>	If this sounds familiar, it is because it is exactly the result ofagricultural subsidies, the Export-lmport bank, guaranteed loans to"preferred" business borrowers, protectionism, the Chrysler bailout,monopoly franchising, and myriad other forms of corporate welfare paidfor directly or indirectly by the American taxpayer.<p>	<a name="29r"><a name="30r">Another result of the close"collaboration" between business and government in Italy was "acontinual interchange of personnel between the...civil service andprivate business."<a href="#29">[29]</a> Because of this "revolvingdoor" between business and government, Mussolini had "created a statewithin the state to serve private interests which are not always inharmony with the general interests of the nation."<ahref="#30">[30]</a><p>	<a name="31r">Mussolini's "revolving door" swung far andwide: Signor Caiano, one of Mussolini's most trusted advisers, was anofficer in the Royal Navy before and during the war; when the war wasover, he joined the Orlando Shipbuilding Company; in October 1922, heentered Mussolini's cabinet, and the subsidies for naval constructionand the merchant marine came under the control of his department.General Cavallero, at the close of the war, left the army and enteredthe Pirelli Rubber Company...; in 1925 he became undersecretary at theMinistry of War; in 1930 he left the Ministry of War, and entered theservice of the Ansaldo armament firm. Among the directors of thebig...companies in Italy, retired generals and generals on activeservice became very numerous after the advent of Fascism.<ahref="#31">[31]</a> 	<p>	Such practices are now so common in the United States—especially inthe defense industries—that it hardly needs further comment.	<p>	From an economic perspective, fascism meant (and means) aninterventionist industrial policy, mercantilism, protectionism, and anideology that makes the individual subservient to the state. "Ask notwhat the State can do for you, but what you can do for the State" is anapt description of the economic philosophy of fascism.	<p>	<a name="32r">The whole idea behind collectivism in generaland fascism in particular is to make citizens subservient to the stateand to place power over resource allocation in the hands of a smallelite. As stated eloquently by the American fascist economist LawrenceDennis, fascism "does not accept the liberal dogmas as to thesovereignty of the consumer or trader in the free market...Least of alldoes it consider that market freedom, and the opportunity to makecompetitive profits, are rights of the individual." Such decisionsshould be made by a "dominant class" he labeled "the elite."<ahref="#32">[32]</a><h4>German Economic Fascism</h4><p>	<a name="33r"><a name="34r"><a name="35r">Economic fascismin Germany followed a virtually identical path. One of the intellectualfathers of German fascism was Paul Lensch, who declared in his book<i>Three Years of World Revolution</i> that "Socialism must present aconscious and determined opposition to individualism."<ahref="#33">[33]</a> The philosophy of German fascism was expressed inthe slogan, <i>Gemeinnutz geht vor Eigennutz</i>, which means "the common goodcomes before the private good." "The Aryan is not greatest in hismental qualities." Hitler stated in Mein Kampf, but in his noblest formhe "willingly subordinates his own ego to the community and, if thehour demands, even sacrifices it."<a href="#34">[34]</a> The individualhas "not rights but only duties."<a href="#35">[35]</a><p>	Armed with this philosophy, Germany's National Socialists pursuedeconomic policies very similar to Italy's: government-mandated"partnerships" between business, government, and unions organized by asystem of regional "economic chambers," all overseen by a FederalMinistry of Economics.	<p>	<a name="36r"><a name="37r"><a name="38r"><a name="39r">A 25-point"Programme of the Party" was adopted in 1925 with a number of economicpolicy "demands," all prefaced by the general statement that "theactivities of the individual must not clash with the interests of thewhole . . . but must be for the general good."<a href="#36">[36]</a>This philosophy fueled a regulatory assault on the private sector. "Wedemand ruthless war upon all those whose activities are injurious tothe common interest," the Nazis warned.<a href="#37">[37]</a> And whoare these on whom "war" is to be waged? "Common criminals," such as"usurers," i.e., bankers, and other "profiteers," i. e., ordinarybusinessmen in general. Among the other policies the Nazis demandedwere abolition of interest; a government-operated social securitysystem; the ability of government to confiscate land withoutcompensation (wetlands regulation?); a government monopoly ineducation; and a general assault on private-sector entrepreneurshipwhich was denounced as the "Jewish materialist spirit."<ahref="#38">[38]</a> Once this "spirit" is eradicated, "The Party...isconvinced that our nation can achieve permanent health from within onlyon the principle: the common interest before self-interest."<ahref="#39">[39]</a><h4>Conclusions</h4><p>	Virtually all of the specific economic policies advocated by theItalian and German fascists of the 1930s have also been adopted in theUnited States in some form, and continue to be adopted to this day.Sixty years ago those who adopted these interventionist policies inItaly and Germany did so because they wanted to destroy economicliberty, free enterprise, and individualism. Only if these institutionswere abolished could they hope to achieve the kind of totalitarianstate they had in mind.	<p>	Many American politicians who have advocated more or less totalgovernment control over economic activity have been more devious intheir approach. They have advocated and adopted many of the samepolicies, but they have always recognized that direct attacks onprivate property, free enterprise, self-government, and individualfreedom are not politically palatable to the majority of the Americanelectorate. Thus, they have enacted a great many tax, regulatory, andincome-transfer policies that achieve the ends of economic fascism, butwhich are sugar-coated with deceptive rhetoric about their allegeddesire only to "save" capitalism.	<p>	<a name="40r">American politicians have long taken their cuein this regard from Franklin D. Roosevelt, who sold his NationalRecovery Administration (which was eventually ruled unconstitutional)on the grounds that "government restrictions henceforth must beaccepted not to hamper individualism but to protect it."<ahref="#40">[40]</a> In a classic example of Orwellian doublespeak,Roosevelt thus argued that individualism must be destroyed in order toprotect it.	<p>	Now that socialism has collapsed and survives nowhere but inCuba, China, Vietnam, and on American university campuses, the biggestthreat to economic liberty and individual freedom lies in the neweconomic fascism. While the former Communist countries are trying toprivatize as many industries as possible as fast as they can, they arestill plagued by governmental controls, leaving them with essentiallyfascist economies: private property and private enterprise arepermitted, but are heavily controlled and regulated by government.	<p>	As most of the rest of the world struggles to privatize industry andencourage free enterprise, we in the United States are seriouslydebating whether or not we should adopt 1930s-era economic fascism asthe organizational principle of our entire health care system, whichcomprises 14 percent of GNP. We are also contemplatingbusiness-government "partnerships" in the automobile, airlines, andcommunications industries, among others, and are adoptinggovernment-managed trade policies, also in the spirit of the Europeancorporatist schemes of the 1930s.	<p>	The state and its academic apologists are so skilled at generatingpropaganda in support of such schemes that Americans are mostly unawareof the dire threat they pose for the future of freedom. The road toserfdom is littered oath road signs pointing toward "the informationsuperhighway," "health security," "national service," "managed trade,"and "industrial policy."</p><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li> Benito Mussolini, My Autobiography (New York: Charles	Scribner's Sons, 1928).		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li> Cited in John T.

This essay is adapted from apaper originally presented at an Association of PrivateEnterprise Education conference in Washington, D.C., lastyear [1993]</p><hr noshade><p>	There is an old saw that "He who is not a socialist at twentyhas no heart; he who is at thirty has no head." Perhaps then the worldgrew up in the 1980s, and learned the sad wisdom that the great schemesfor bettering the human condition through government intervention didnot actually work. The U.S.S.R. and its Eastern Europe satellitescrashed in flames, while the widespread famines and other humantragedies in the Third World showed the Soviet development model ofheavy industrialization and a squeeze on agriculture to be equallyunsuited for developing countries.	<p>	Meanwhile the welfare state in the advanced industrial economies hasproven itself unable either to produce overall prosperity or to remedy"social injustices" like poverty. Admittedly the rollback of the statein the 1980s in the United States, Britain, Canada, and elsewhereconsisted much more of rhetoric than of action, but interventionism ison the defensive both politically and intellectually. It simply doesnot work. And as secure property rights are the indispensablefoundation of free markets, they too are enjoying something of arenaissance.	<p>	Nevertheless that old saw lingers, in the form of a suspicionthat the triumph of free markets has been a triumph for themean-spirited; there are even those who still continue to believe thatwith sufficient will, sufficient compassion, intervention can be madeto work.	<p>	It cannot, and the most immediate reason why it cannot is thateverything in life is more complicated than it seems, and we simplycannot foresee all the consequences of our actions. For this reason wehave over a long time developed general rules for both personal andpublic decisions, and the most important of these in the latter area isthat the neglect or flagrant violation of property rights leads tocounterproductive results. What Rudyard Kipling called "The Gods of theCopybook Headings" have persisted in returning afresh to the scene ofeach disaster and saying "We told you so."	<p>	But though this is a triumph of experience over hope, it is more thanthat. Free markets and their philosophical premise, property rights,are not a mean, grasping, Scrooge-like set of institutions collectivelylabeled "Devil take the hindmost." Rather, they represent the only wayof organizing a society that really respects individual people.	<p>	Property rights are not a human right, they are the human right, andthe reason that coercion fails practically is not a different reasonfrom the reason that it fails morally. Coercion, even when "benign,"founders on the rock of individual responsibility. You cannot as apractical matter take property rights away, and you cannot as a moralmatter do so. People own themselves, but they do not own others, andthere is nothing moral or idealistic about saying that they do.Property rights are a matter not only of the head but also of theheart.<h4>The Challenge to Property Rights</h4><p><a name="1r"></p><p>	There is no difficulty in demonstrating the importance of propertyrights to economic efficiency. There is no difficulty in demonstratingthat historically societies with property rights are richer and freerthan those without. Yet if we only present them in this way, sayingthat they have worked so far, we risk being cast as the man who, havingfallen off the Empire State Building, was heard as he passed the tenthfloor saying to himself "So far, so good."<a href="#1">[1]</a><p>	Some people will claim that conditions have changed, or thatthe longer-term negative consequences of respect for property are nowsurfacing (for instance with regard to the environment) and that theymust now be jettisoned. Indeed, the very success of property rights increating wealth can turn, as Schumpeter said it would in <i>Capitalism,Socialism, and Democracy</i>, into an argument that they can and should beabandoned.<p>	Even now there is a persistent "progressive" claim that we aremoving into a new age, that somehow our increased prosperity, ourincreased awareness, the environmental "crisis" or something else hasproduced a situation where what used to be good enough, or the bestavailable, is now unacceptable. And part of this claim is that we mustsubmerge our individualism and our materialism and march cheerfullyinto a glorious communal future as comrades. Economics, they say, isnot all life is about. This, in fact, is taken to be the core of the"idealist" position, and it is against this claim that property rightsmust be defended.<h4>King Charles' Ax</h4><p>	Yet the denunciation of property rights as materialist is quiteinaccurate. They are the most fundamental human right, and they addressthemselves to the spirit and the meaning of life directly, and to theaccumulation of material wealth only indirectly.<p>	Indeed, those who would separate "mere things" from the "highervalues" simply don't understand what the world is like. King Charles Iof England would be the first to point out that an ax may undo apolitical philosophy. No matter how elegant it might have been, histheory of the divine right of kings could not withstand the practicaltest of whether it could govern a world of fleshly subjects and rulers,physical crops in the field, mere stone walls and lowly water inrivers. No matter how bright the eye of a child, or elegant thecouplets of a poet, without food the child will die and without pen andink the inspiration will pass unrecorded and be lost.<p>	In this sense, and in this sense alone, a devotion to propertyrights is a triumph of experience over hope. For the essence of utopianphilosophies is their unwillingness to accept the tragic element inlife, whereas to accept property rights is to accept it. And to objectto the tragic in life on the grounds of "idealism" is to object not toa political philosophy but to the fundamental nature of the universe.<p>	Inevitably in this vale of tears our hopes and dreams assume physicalform. Time passes and we must use it one way or another, and once wehave it is gone and all we have is what we did with it then. To take anindividual's property is to steal that time, to steal the hopes andpurposes embodied in the acts of transforming the world, and it is tosay that the physical objects, the surds if you will, matter more thanthe hope that produced them. Thus it is that those who would violateproperty rights, not those who defend them, are the true materialists.<p>	If we had world enough and time, it might be no offense for thestate to take the fruits of our labor. If we were immortal, who couldbegrudge an hour's work? But the time we chose to invest in thattransformation of matter will never come again, and as one of ClintEastwood's characters once observed, it is a hard thing to take all aman has and all he will ever have. All we have is our time, our effortand our free choice, and to take what we do with these is to take ofour essence, to violate our personal integrity, and to steal part ofour soul.<h4>Property Rights and John Stuart Mill</h4><p>	It may be alleged, of course, that the butcher has an obligationto other members of society, that it is his moral duty to give of hisexcess to those in want. To begin with, there is a world of differencebetween saying that everyone should be charitable and in saying thatthey should all agree on what charity is, and without elaborating muchI would say that it is because of this that socialists must be at warwith human nature. Until some way is found to produce unanimity insociety. redistribution in violation of property rights remains only away of producing the appearance of agreement and of charity, but notthe reality.<p>	There is also a world of difference between saying that it isthe butcher's moral duty to be charitable, and saying that it is ourmoral duty (or right) to force him to act as though he were charitable.What we are asserting is not that we should force the butcher to becharitable (for we cannot get inside his head and rearrange histhoughts), but that we should force him to act as though he was, fromour point of view, charitable. Coercion will make the butcher act asthough he shared the majority--or government--view of charity, but itwill not in fact make him share that view.<p><a name="2r"></p><p>	And this is crucial. For in forcing him to act according to ourconception of generosity, rather than his own, we deprive him of anymoral freedom, and put material above moral considerations. Hisphysical goods will be transferred to another, and he may be compelledto produce more even once he knows it will be diverted to the purposesof others. But he will not be acting voluntarily. And so in an act ofcoercive redistribution, the material aspects are rearranged as theywould be in an act of charity, but the intellectual and moral ones, theintentions and feelings, are not.<a href="#2">[2]</a><p><a name="3r"></p><p>	As the great economic philosopher Frederic Bastiat wrote a centuryand a half ago, one's person, liberty and property are "the three basicrequirements of life, and the preservation of any one of them iscompletely dependent upon the preservation of the other two. For whatare our faculties but the extension of our individuality? And what isproperty but an extension of our faculties?"<a href="#3">[3]</a><p>	Adam Smith's famous observation that it is not from the benevolenceof the butcher that we expect our dinner, and that we speak to him notof our needs but of his advantage, relies on this point. The butcher'sstock embodies his time, effort, risk, and dreams, and to take itbecause we want it, for ourselves or for others, is to assault hisperson. To substitute our judgment for his, or to try to, is amonstrous violation.<h4>Property Rights and the Grim Reaper</h4><p>	In a utilitarian sense, perhaps, my respect for your propertyrights is merely a concession to you in return for your respect formine, and if that is as far as someone is willing to go it will have todo. But in a deeper sense my respect for your property rights is basedon my practical and moral respect for your individuality. Not only willyou resist my attempts to make you do what I want, but all I reallyknow about your choices is that they are and must be yours.<p>	Thus my respect for property rights is based fundamentally onhumility. I believe that the purpose of life is, at best, somewhatobscure, and that living is a difficult activity that inevitably, insome sense at least, ends in failure. As Paul Newman's character put itin <i>Buffalo Bill and the Indians</i>, "the last thing a man wants to do isthe last thing he does." And this fact stares everyone in the face, orat the very least peers over their shoulder constantly.<p>	I am going to die. I don't know much about you, my readers, butI know that as Seneca wrote ''You will die not because you are sick butbecause you are alive." And as death rushes toward you and all of us(and if you have one of those digital watches that beeps every hour youdon't need to miss it happening) you have chosen to spend these momentsreading this essay. Many people would consider this folly. And theyaren't sitting, <i>The Freeman</i> in hand, absorbing ideas on liberty andproperty. They are out shopping, or sky-diving, or fighting with theirin-laws, or doing any number of things.<p>	Once again, if the arrow of time were not unidimensional, thiswould not be a problem. If you didn't like what you had done, you'djust do something else. But in our universe making one choice means notmaking another, so we can in fact make our choices badly and be stuckwith it.<h4>Property Rights and Joseph Stalin</h4><p>	The only way to avoid these conclusions, and into the bargain toprotect others from the terrible fate of justified guilt, is to rejectthe premise of individualism. We may say that it is simply not truethat individuals are, or should be, left to face the universe of moralchoices alone (we have already seen that the world of moral choices isa world of choices about material things with moral consequences, so wecannot avoid the moral choices by saying that where we went was merelyphysical. So is all motion, and all choice). We may say that thepurpose of the individual is to serve the greater good and that theindividual's choices will be dictated by the greater good, or itsagents, and that only the greater good can feel any culpability forthose choices.<p><a name="4r"></p><p>	In its purest form this is as a practical matter impossibleto hold, and even the most rigid Stalinists would blame an individualworker who neglected his revolutionary duties. Even if you submit tothe common will, if you do it badly you are to blame. Or, to quoteElizabeth Fox-Genovese's <i>Feminism Without Illusions: A Critique ofIndividualism</i>, "Here I am arguing that individualism actually pervertsthe idea of the socially obligated and personally responsible freedomthat constitutes the only freedom worthy of the name or indeedhistorically possible."<a href="#4">[4]</a> There's that darn personalresponsibility again, in the writings of a self-described foe ofindividualism.<p>	But in fact I simply do not accept the collectivist vision as adescription of the world, let alone as a prescription. I observe and Ibelieve that if told what to do for the common good I must myselfdecide whether to obey, and I must live with my choice. Even ifdisobedience means death, I cannot turn on the Zyklon B and say "Justfollowing orders."<p><a name="5r"></p><p>	This is very much the same as C.S. Lewis' argument at the beginningof <i>Mere Christianity</i>: even if you say "I do not believe in individualresponsibility" you will observe as a matter of fact about theoperation of your personality that you do. You will in fact consideryourself responsible for your actions, even if only in that you takepride in complete submission to authority.<a href="#5">[5]</a><p>	So I begin by taking the intellectually humble position that Ido not know what other people should do. If asked by the shoppers andsky-divers whether they should be reading these words or doing whatthey are doing, I can certainly inform them. I can inquire as to howthey expect to benefit from what they are now doing, and what theythink they might experience by choosing something else. If I find thatthere is something wrong or suspect about their expectations in one orboth cases, I can pursue the matter as long as they want me to. I caneven make a suggestion as to what I think they should do. But I do notknow. And since I do not know, I take the intellectually humbleposition that I will not compel them.<p>	The knowledge that we do not know must make us more profoundlyhumble. To assert that I know what you should do implies necessarilythat I know what I should do, and who among us will cast the firststone on that account? No one makes all decisions perfectly becausethere are so many and life is so difficult. We all, to be blunt, messthings up, and it's mostly a question of avoiding mistakes as much aspossible, making amends where necessary, and not getting too down overour own fallibility. It's just life.<p>	But I also take the morally humble position that even if I didknow, I could not compel others. I do not know the meaning of yourlife, nor of mine, and I have my hands full with the latter. Yet I donot spare time to run yours not because I hate you or scorn you, butbecause I do not believe that I can make your choices for you at all.It's not just that I shouldn't; I can't. This is a matter ofdefinition: no matter what I say, you must choose whether to do it,even if it's "Your money or your life." And if I do try I will only getin your way.<p>	The meaning of your life is the meaning of your choices, so tomake them for you is to void your life of meaning in pursuit ofmaterial, not moral, situations that I prefer.<h4>Money Can't Buy Happiness</h4><p>	Indeed, it is always vital, in my view, to go back to firstprinciples, in this case asking what society is for and what the goodlife is. To take a rather trivial example, the reason that airportsshould be private is not that private property increases the wealth ofsociety and moves us closer to the New World Order. It is that privateairports let people go where they want.<p>	And to treat government as some institution for achieving the greatergood, and asserting that it can and should override individual rightswhen "prosperity" requires it, is not only to advocate a policy thatalmost certainly won't work. It is also to assert that individualfreedom is a good like any other, and with a low price. It is to saythat we would be better off in an unfree society with a per capitaincome of $20,000 than in a free society with a per capita income of$3,000, and that is simply not so. As Booker T. Washington wrote in hisautobiography, "I have learned that success is to be measured not somuch by the position that one has reached in life as by the obstacleswhich he has overcome while trying to succeed."<a href="#6">[6]</a><p>	Thus while I enjoy luxury as much as the next guy, I would prefer myown log cabin to a gilded cage. And I would not dream of calling"idealistic" any philosophy that did not respect this same preference,in me or in others.<h4>The Constitution of Liberty</h4><p>	Respect for property rights means respect for individual choice,and therefore we can quickly identify laws and institutions inimical torespect for individual choice by their impact on property rights. Youin the U.S. are blessed with a Constitution that firmly protects them,though you are cursed with a Supreme Court that has all but destroyedthem, while we in Canada have a Constitution that ridicules them and aSupreme Court that does likewise. But we should aim for a legislativeand ultimately a Constitutional order that does protect them, when wedo not have one, and for a restoration of judicial sense and henceConstitutional government when we do.<p>	In order to do this we must win the intellectual battle, and wecannot win it on the terrain of Pareto Optimality not because ourarguments are so weak there but because they are so strong. Anyone whoreally understands the terms "utility maximization" will not fall for"beneficial" legislation.<p>	No, where we must win is on the enemy's terrain, where we arguethat property rights literally are human rights. We own ourselves, notother people, and we may exercise that ownership as we see fit. But ourownership of other people, which we do not possess, we may notexercise. Thus rent-seeking, the curse of modern government, is ruledout <i>a priori</i>. A government that respects property rights is not in thebusiness of redistributing income, period. 	<h4>Property Rights Are Human Rights</h4><p>	And so we must remember that a Constitution that protects propertyrights is a Constitution that protects not the exploiter or thepampered heir, but one that protects individuals.<p>	In fact there is no "human right" that is not best understoodas a property right, including free speech, freedom of religion, theright to bear arms, the right to be free of arbitrary search andseizure, and the right to freedom of contract.<p>	Even the ninth and tenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitutionare, from this point of view, easily explained. Since no one maydelegate to government a power he or she does not possess, thegovernment may not go about assuming powers it hasn't expressly beengiven, even on the grounds that "it's for the best." Like the entireBill of Rights, this section was questioned by some who argued that noone could possibly take any other view. Fine and good, said thedoubters, if it's that obvious let's put it in just for good measure.History has proved that even they did not doubt strongly enough, butthe other parties were right that, given the nature of the U.S.Constitution, the government could not possibly have the power toundertake any sort of coercion of its citizens not expresslyenumerated.<p>	Moreover, if human rights literally are property rights andvice versa then the so-called "positive" rights are not rights at all.For they are the right to someone else's property, which means theright to someone else's person, and that you do not have. Not havingit, you certainly cannot delegate it to government. And from this pointof view we will not lose sight of why you may not, and will not fallinto practical or moral errors.<p>	To take a rather less cosmic example, consider the coercive,universal, shoddy education currently afflicting youth in NorthAmerica. What is particularly remarkable about this problem is that forthirty years we have been throwing money at our schools, like goodmaterialists, yet as the quality of education declines still furtherthe only thing we can think of to do is to throw more money at them.This is even empirically silly, since those nations that out-school usfor instance Japan--have much shabbier, much more crowded schools thanwe do.<a href="#7">[7]</a> The problem is that our educational systemdoes not allow people to take control of their own or their children'seducation, to make the important choices themselves. This is apractical error and it is a moral error, but it is not two errors. Itis one very big one.<p>	For you do not have the right, through any means at all, tomake other people's choices for them. You do not have the abilityeither. This is where and why practicality and idealism intersect. Theattempt to make other people's choices for them will fail because theyare fundamentally theirs to make. You can, of course, reduce the choiceset available to them, but if you do you are engaged in a deplorableviolation of their personal integrity, not in an act of benign andmagnanimous charity. 	<h4>Conclusion--A Prison Called Heaven</h4><p>	This was driven home to me quite forcefully in a rather unlikelysetting in December of 1992, when the Fraser Institute hosted around-table luncheon where the guest speaker was KarlhermannKlottschen, director of the <i>Treuhandanstalt</i> (the agency charged withprivatizing the ''economy" of the former German Democratic Republic).My thesis, as I noted at the outset, is that property rights are notmaterial in nature, except insofar as the universe is. The right toproperty is first and foremost the right of self-ownership, and becomesa right to things only because the universe is made of material stuffand the arrow of time is unidirectional. In such a universe it is theheight of miserable materialism to constrain the free choices ofothers, and the height of idealism to allow them.<p>	And when Herr Klottschen was asked what was the most lastingdamage done by socialism in East Germany, this is what he said:</p><ul>	<p>	I think they have robbed people of the most precious thing they	have; that is, to spend their time in a way that they wish. They have	taken away this very precious thing which we cherish, and that	is the freedom, the liberty to move where you want, and to do	what you want, and this they have basically forbidden. I think	that is a very serious crime for which there is no penalty....	What I find is very disastrous is to put 16 million people in a	prison for 45 years and pretend they are in heaven.<a href="#8">[8]</a>	</p></ul>	<p>	There is no doubt at this point in history that violations of propertyrights do not achieve their goals, and indeed East Germany was not aprosperous place. But money cannot buy happiness, and what was reallywrong with the GDR, as Herr Klottschen rightly stated, was thatpeople's dreams and ideals were destroyed. Even if the GDR had enjoyedgreater material wealth than, say eighteenth-century England, thelatter would have been a better place to live.<p>	So it is wrong, even preposterous, to call property rightsmaterialistic. They are the most basic human right. They are the onlyhuman right. They are what makes life worth living.</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>This analogy was in fact used by environmentalist	Paul Ehrlich in an ongoing debate with economist Julian Simon	about the so-called "limits to growth," after he had lost $500	in a bet with Simon about metal price trends in the period 1980-90,	The Economist December 21, 1991, p. 26.		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>Frederic Bastiat, The Law (Irvington-on-Hudson,	N.Y.: The Foundation for Economic Education, 1974 [first published	1850, in French]), p. 26.		<a href="#2r">Return</a><p><a name="3"><li>In this sense those who respect property rights	manifest true idealism.

Both are exceptionally fineand patriotic Americans. One, call him Bill, flew as a navigator on aB-29 bomber based in the Pacific. The other, call him Joe, fought as aninfantryman in Europe. Fortunately, neither was injured during the war.Although alike in many ways, a notable difference between Bill and Joeis that Bill is forever and with great relish recalling his bomberdays, while Joe steadfastly refuses to mention his wartime experiences.Odd as it may seem, this difference between Bill and Joe contains animportant lesson about big government and democratic politics.<h4>Politicians, Like Bombers, Seldom See Their Victims...</h4><p>	I once asked Bill why he attended so many reunions with hisformer crew members and why he never tired of recollecting his waryears. And why does Joe say absolutely nothing about his time in thearmy? Bill's response is revealing. "Joe fought in combat, face to facewith the enemy. He saw lots of blood and guts and death and suffering.But for me, the war was great. Nothing bad happened to me. My buddiesand I flew lots of missions over Japan and nearby islands. All I eversaw were little puffs of smoke on the ground where our bombs hit."<p>		Reflecting on Bill's response, I realized that politicians andtheir bureaucratic appointees are much like bomber crews: they wreakmuch havoc, but seldom experience first hand the consequences of theiractions. As a result, political activity is generally pleasurable. Butif governing were more like infantry service and less like bombing runsthat is, if politicians witnessed firsthand all the suffering unleashedby government taxation and regulation--politicians would surely be lessenthusiastic about their schemes.	<p>	Agricultural subsidies are a good example. Farm-price supportsinflict all sorts of harm on millions of people. Consumers payunnecessarily higher prices for food while taxpayers dole out more intaxes to support and administer these programs. These higher prices andheavier tax burdens, in turn, have a significant injurious secondaryeffect: fewer resources are available for producing other worthwhilegoods and services. Also, poor people shoulder a disproportionate shareof this unnecessary wealth destruction because they spend largerpercentages of their incomes on food than do wealthy citizens. Inshort, the nation is a poorer and more unjust place because ofagricultural subsidies.	<p>	Politicians know that agricultural subsidies are destructive.Washington's unremitting stream of partisan bombast and simple-mindedsound bites should not be taken as evidence that politicians arestupid. They aren't. Most politicians are quite aware that agriculturalsubsidies confiscate enormous wealth from large numbers of people inorder to give it--after much skimming by the bureaucracy--to a smallnumber of politically influential farmers in a way that works againstthe public interest. Yet there appears to be no end in sight to suchwasteful programs.	<p>	Some observers succumb to utter cynicism and argue that politiciansare inherently evil. While I don't deny that representative democracytends to select peculiar types of people for political office--perhapspeople who are, typically, a bit more hungry for power and fame than isthe average citizen--I don't believe that politicians' character flawsare responsible for the interest-group feeding frenzy that todaycharacterizes democratic government.	<p>	Few politicians are indifferent to human suffering and misfortune.Most politicians in the United States come from solid middle-classbackgrounds, have loving and beloved families and dear friends, andwouldn't dream of mistreating people they deal with personally. Idaresay the personal values most politicians possess differimperceptibly from the personal values motivating most of middle-classAmerica. This is what with straight faces, nearly every politician canlook squarely into a camera's lens and insist that he or she is a goodperson who only wants to do what's right. Friends of liberty do theircause no favors by exaggerating the moral shortcomings of politiciansor by portraying them as inherently stupid, fiendish, or sinister.	<p>	Nevertheless politicians do many harmful things. The reason Ibelieve, is that--like the destruction wrought by bombers--the illeffects of most political acts are like little puffs of smoke.Politicians seldom come face to face with people whose suffering isperceptibly caused by government policies.	<p>	Of course, politicians do see stacks of statistics, charts, andgraphs telling them (if they chose to pay attention) of the higher foodprices caused by agricultural policies, as well as of the many othermaladies inflicted by their programs. But such figures are faceless. These figures are to politicians what little puffs of smoke are tobombers: bombers know that tremendous human suffering occurs justbeneath the little puffs of smoke, but because the bombers don'tencounter this suffering up-close and personal, they are largelyunaffected by it. Likewise, statistics, charts, and graphs seldom causeremorse or regret for politicians. It is relatively easy to harm otherswhen you never see your victims face to face. 	<h4>...But Politicians Do See Interest-Group Beneficiaries</h4><p>	The problem of faceless victims of government is compounded bythe fact that there is a class of people that politicians do see faceto face on a regular basis: members of organized interest groups.Interest groups are persistent in seeking special privileges fromgovernment. And such persistence pays off, partly because politiciansare not diabolical miscreants. Most politicians are just like you andme: They are often willing to go out of their way to lend a hand tofamiliar and friendly faces. Politicians no doubt feel proud andgratified when familiar farming lobbyists shake their hands warmly slapthem on the back, and thank them for higher price supports. Just aspoliticians care little about victims they never see, they care verysincerely about those with whom they are in daily face-to-face contact.<p>	It is human nature to favor friends and familiar acquaintancesover unnamed, face less others--other people encountered by politiciansonly as data points in various reports. The longer a politician remainsin Washington (or in a state capital). the more his or her circle offriends and acquaintances comes to be composed of interest-grouprepresentatives and other politicians, all of whom are forever seekingspecial favors. In addition, extended time in office inevitably causespoliticians to lose face-to-face contact with the folks back home--theordinary folks, that is, rather than the special-interest groups. 	<h4>Conclusion</h4><p>	If every politician actually saw the faces of his or her victimsin addition to the faces of his or her interest-group clients, thepolitical game would be far less biased against consumers and otherpersons who are not represented by lobbyists strolling the halls ofgovernment power. Unfortunately, the nature of interest-group politicsis that only those groups with relatively few members can organizeeffectively to conduct face-to-face political lobbying of electedofficials. Consequently, without some fundamental change in the scopeof government or our political institutions, most citizens willcontinue to be victims of the policy bombs forever dropping out ofWashington and state capitals.</p>	<HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Politicians-Lose-Touch.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

E. Chesher</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Chesher is Professor of Philosophyat Santa Barbara City College.</p><hr noshade><p>	It is nearly commonplace now for intellectuals to think that welive in the "post-modern" era in which everything is subjected to notonly close scrutiny but "deconstruction," revision, interpretation, orsome other possible adjustment in understanding. Yet such a reflexiveway of thinking is nothing new. Philosophers have always engaged in it.With the voices of intellectuals being more widely and effectivelytransmitted in our high-tech era, however, the reflexive mode ofthought is gaining wider promotion and impact.	<p>	One of the benefits that accrue from this assault on the tradition isthe discovery of mythology disguised as common knowledge orintellectually supported doctrine. An example of this, directlyrelevant to our concerns in this essay, relates to the idea of theworker in modern society. The commonly received view, as evidenced byan examination of how the worker is depicted in the media, in publicentertainment, and indeed, in philosophy itself, has the worker as avictim of powerful, sinister forces variously identified ascorporations, or employers, or capitalists, or business, or themilitary industrial complex--forces that conspire to exploit, enslave,and thereby diminish the worth of those who labor for a living.Deprived of the power that comes from owning the means of production,the worker is at the mercy of the owners, the capitalists. Short ofuniting and eventually seizing the means of production, or threateningstoppage of production through strikes or other collective action, theworker is doomed to remain a victim, slave to the desires of thecapitalists.	<p>	This model, the reigning but aging paradigm, is clearly adversarialand pessimistic: the worker is inherently disadvantaged, at odds withthe owner/capitalist, and bound to suffer injustice and hardship untilhe joins forces with other workers, prepared to enter into mortalcombat. According to this view, the cause of worker suffering iscapitalism itself, commerce in a free society. There is, of course,historical documentation of worker abuse, child labor, and hazardousworking conditions that is consistent with this view, but severalpoints are worth making. 	<ol>	<li>As long as one human being has power over another, the possibilityof abuse exists, but this is a feature of human weakness, not of freecommerce as such. We ought not blame capitalism for worker exploitationany more than we should blame parenthood for abuse of children.		<li>At least some portion of the plight of the worker, especially inthe first hundred years or so of the industrial revolution, was due tothe ignorance and crudeness that accompany the early stages of anydevelopmental process, and not to the vicious motives of the owners ofproduction. In retrospect, and, given the knowledge, sensibilities, andexpectations that we now have as a result of experience andsocial-political growth, the working conditions of the early industrialworker are beyond belief, and are certainly unacceptable by today'sstandards. However, to assume, as the popular model does, thatconditions would have been radically better had workers owned the meansof production is highly speculative. Nor is it borne out by theexperience of workers in Communist countries since 1917, in contrastwith the lives of workers in capitalist societies.		<li>The unprecedented progress in technology in the present century,resulting in an enormous increase in distributable goods, has madepossible the extension of material goods to working people undreamed ofin previous centuries. Pressure to distribute those goods equitably hasincreased in direct proportion to their production. There are, today,many workers in industrial nations whose quality of life matches thatof the privileged few at the beginning of the modern era.		<li>Regardless of the causes of worker plight in the early andmiddle stages of industrial development, there is nothing in principleadversarial in capitalism: the worker is not necessarily and always atcross purposes with management; a free market is not necessarily anarena where workers must lose. Indeed, in response to felt needs,workers have, both collectively and individually, found means ofsecuring higher wages and safer, more desirable working conditions forthemselves, from forming labor unions, to convincing employers of thecost-beneficial advantages of higher wages and improved workingenvironments. All of this is consistent with the idea of capitalism,not contrary to it, as the popular model would have it.		<li>Regardless of the early history of industrialism and capitalism,the world of industry and commerce today so little resembles its crudebeginnings that a fresh look is in order, especially if we wish tounderstand what it is to be a worker in the post-modern era. Thetraditional model of the downtrodden masses is an anachronism whenapplied to societies of developed nations.</p></ol>	<p>	In attempting to understand what it is to be a worker as we approachthe twenty-first century, I will be making some very fundamentalassumptions about human beings, assumptions which I believe aresupported by common sense, though perhaps not shared by allintellectuals. It is in terms of this view of human beings that I thinkwe can make sense of the worker of his concerns, of what he ought to doand expect in an ever-changing, increasingly complex,technology-intensive society. The assumptions are these: the worker isa human being who is by nature motivated to seek his own happiness, issufficiently capable of recognizing obstacles and opportunities tohappiness so as to act in the direction of happiness, and realizes thatsecuring happiness is at least in some measure dependent upon hisefforts. He knows, in addition, that success in life (i.e., securing areasonably happy existence), requires his paying attention to theworld, especially those aspects that are likely to affect his chancesof success. He also acknowledges that other human beings are, ingeneral, like him in these ways. In short, a worker is a rational,self-interested person in a world of other rational, self-interestedpersons, aware that reality calls upon them to live intelligently inorder to achieve a good life. Of course, this is a very generaldescription, applicable to all human beings in every era, in everyplace. It is also description at a very fundamental level: the truth orerror of this description has profound implications for how we are tounderstand everything else about human life and human society. Giventhese assumptions, what can be said about the worker in contemporarysociety? 		<h4>The Effects of the Global Economy</h4>	<p>	Perhaps the most significant relevant feature of contemporary life isthe emerging global economy: national alliances based on mutuallybeneficial economic interests; foreign trade relations impacting onnearly every aspect of domestic economies; opportunities as well ascompetitive challenges from abroad in cheaper labor, natural resources,consumer markets, innovations in production, management, distributionof goods and services. The effects of the global economy on the workerare more dramatic and far-reaching than any other development in humanhistory since the Industrial Revolution. Indeed, the very concept of"worker" is undergoing change, as the demand for more skilled labor andwhite-collar workers increases, and as technology introduces moreefficient tools for the production and distribution of goods andservices.	<p>	The global economy, hastened by the collapse of Communism andthe parallel spread of democracy and free-market commerce, hassignificant implications for workers in developed nations. Theavailable, abundant, and growing supply of unskilled workers indeveloping nations will increasingly compete with and eventually makeobsolete, unskilled labor in the developed nations, just asindustrialism over the past two hundred years has replaced human toilwith machines in so many areas of life. In the developed nations,demand for skilled labor will increase, opening up opportunities foremployment in expanding service, information, and entertainmentindustries. to name a few.	<p>	A worker about to enter the market would do well to considerwhat skills are likely to be in demand, and to acquire such skills aswould be consistent with her aptitude, interests, and specialcircumstances. This might require educating oneself as to the marketdemands, seeking employment/ career counseling, and embarking upon acourse of action such as a training program, vocational school,apprenticeship, or college. Put simply, it would be prudent of a youngadult about to enter the labor force, to consider economic realities,to learn of the opportunities available, and move in the direction ofthose opportunities.	<p>	In contrast with workers of the past, a contemporary workershould not expect to work for one and the sameemployer/company/industry from graduation to retirement, nor should sheexpect her present knowledge and skills to be marketable for alifetime. (Consider, for example, the challenges and changes awaiting ayoung auto mechanic or audio-visual repairman entering the work forcein 1960 and expecting to work in that field for the next 35 years!)Workers already employed would be wise to determine the extent to whichthe forces of change are likely to threaten or otherwise alter theirjobs. If, for example, they are in a low-skilled, labor-intensiveindustry, competition from abroad will be an increasing reality. Itwould be wise to consider retraining, education, acquiring skills thatwill be in demand. All of this, admittedly, goes against the demand for"job security" which in recent years has become quite pronounced,especially among members of unions and others who lobby for protectivelegislation. 	<h4>Job Security</h4>	<p>	Job security is a contemporary economic myth worth exploding. Ina free market, a job is "secure" only to the extent that there is ademand for it--that is, to the extent that there are customers willingto pay for the product or service that makes the job possible at all.Thus, to demand job security is tantamount to demanding a "guarantee"that there be customers. This would require state-mandated, coercivemeasures creating, in effect, involuntary servitude, a condition thatexists under socialist planned economies where the state, rather thanfreely choosing individuals, makes economic decisions. To the extentthat one person's job is "made" secure, someone else's job or freedomor opportunity to pursue one will thereby be threatened. To expect "jobsecurity," either from membership in a union, or from protectivelegislation, is therefore not only unrealistic, but attempts to bringit about would shift the burden of responsibility for one's life fromoneself to others, and would deprive individuals of the right to makechoices for themselves in precisely those areas where their welfare isat stake. Much of what goes under the name of (special) "worker'srights" as distinct from basic human rights such as the right toliberty and property, is of this nature: ultimately contrary to a freesociety and to the best interests of workers themselves.	<p>	A rapidly changing democratic and capitalistic world favors workerswho are flexible, trainable, and adaptable. It also promises growingopportunities for creative and industrious individuals. With morepeople working as subcontractors, or by piece, the more familiar,traditional image of worker as wage-laborer struggling in assembly-linefactories under the fierce command of greedy capitalists is all butobsolete in developed nations. In order to avoid the extra-laborexpense and other burdens of having employees, many companies aresub-contracting their work to individuals, who then are effectivelyself-employed and who could, conceivably, enter into agreements, orjoint ventures, with other workers.	<p>	For example, one company, a manufacturer of fishing tackle, hasworkers throughout the country assembling lures, spinners, floaters,and small jigs in their homes. Materials are sent to the workers, whoassemble them at their own pace, according to their own schedules, thenreturn the completed products by mail and are paid a set fee percertain quantity. The worker establishes his own hours, provides hisown workplace, and produces according to personally set quotas, needs,and demands, rather than those of an employer. The worker may evenenlist the aid of friends or family. He does not have to punch a timecard, account for his every move, or go through some bureaucraticritual to take an afternoon off or get permission to experiment with anew way to do the work. The "employer," in turn, enjoys the benefit ofa nearly endless labor pool, does not have to provide an assemblyplant, or pay workers' compensation insurance and fringe-benefits. Thisis a mutually beneficial arrangement, one that will replace, in manyinstances, the traditional assembly-line-factory model of massproduction employment. Such an arrangement, in contrast with the oldmodel, has less of the adversarial, "master-slave" features. 	<h4>Flexibility for Workers</h4>	<p>	The new model allows the worker to work for more than one employer ata time if she chooses. It does not impose, from the top down,restrictions and regulations concerning working hours, environmentalimpact, and safety. Additionally, there is less government involvement,since there is no workplace, no shop, no factory for OSHA to regulate,no labor practices for the Labor Department to enforce, no need for aworker compensation bureaucracy, or the permits, licenses, warnings,affidavits, bonds, deposits, employee records, and various otherdocuments that in-house employment requires. And yet, this is still aworker doing labor; this is still a business owner or a corporationseeking profit: in short, this is still capitalism in operation.	<p>	At the high-tech end, as the telecommunications industry expands, andas personal computers, fax-machines, and other information-processingand transmitting devices become common household items, a significantportion of office work now being conducted in commercial buildings,will be performed at home--and in increasing numbers, by workers whowill likely be self-employed, hiring out their skills and equipment tocompanies who will no longer need to lease office space for this work.(These buildings can be converted into apartments, or refitted forother uses; traffic congestion will be eased; air quality will improveand countless other benefits will follow.) And yet, this is still aworker doing labor; this is still a business owner or a corporationseeking profit, still capitalism in operation. As the kind of work, andthe conditions of employment change, so too will the relationshipbetween employer and employee and among co-workers. Just as businessesare entering into international alliances, so too might workers unitethrough computer networks to exchange ideas and techniques, discussproblems, seek solutions, and form organizations that can help themmarket their skills and negotiate with prospective employers.	<p>	Historically, we have seen a variously progressing evolution inthe improvement of life generally, and the conditions of workersspecifically, over the past few centuries, certainly since thebeginning of "modern" times. Some of this is due, no doubt, to theincreasing replacement of human toil with machines, with the growth inproductivity due to industrialization, mass production, the division oflabor, and the general increase in wealth that has resulted from theexpansion of commerce.	<p>	When one compares the life, the working conditions, and the prospectsfor alternatives available to workers in developed nations to that ofworkers in underdeveloped nations, the progress that commerce makespossible--for workers as well as owners--is dramatically evident.Clearly, that there were downtrodden masses at the beginning of themodern era is not in the nature of a business society, but is owing toother factors. The further we are from those beginnings, the moreevident this becomes. In the developed nations, the world is catchingup. The ideals of the humanistic tradition: respect for persons aspersons, protection of individual rights, in short, personalsovereignty, self-determination, and human dignity, have taken hundredsof years to reach the present point, with considerable distance to go.But progress has been made, due, in large part, to the spread ofdemocracy and the growth of commerce, especially in the last half ofthe present century. Workers themselves, through organized labor,increased productivity, and political action, have contributed to thegrowth of democracy and commerce, and thus to their own well-being. Butthere are limits beyond which one ought not go, even in the name ofsecurity or protection, if one is to live in a free society and remainautonomous.	<p>	Workers ought to recognize that there can be no free society withouteconomic freedom, without free markets. It must also be recognized thathuman beings, the vast majority of whom are workers, are better off ina free society--have more opportunities and alternatives. Thus, it isin the best interest of workers to champion actions, institutions, andattitudes that promote freedom. With freedom comes risk, and so aworker in a free society ought to prepare for risk. If he expectsothers to protect him from accidents, job loss, medical costs, and oldage then he must relinquish sovereignty to those who will assume theresponsibility. But this is the same as relinquishing his freedom. Onecannot have it both ways. Freedom means risk. Besides, to give upfreedom for economic security is futile as well as foolish, sincesecurity is impossible. This does not mean that risks cannot be reducedor guarded against. There are all manner of arrangements, frominsurance, to safety training, to education, to negotiated terms ofemployment, to a variety of worker organizations that can provideworkers with protection.	<p>	At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, there was widespreadworry that machines would put human beings out of work. The veryopposite has happened. As we approach the twenty-first century, globalexpansion of commerce combined with advancing technology, will provideincreasing opportunities especially for creative, skilled, andambitious workers. Certainly, some industries will disappear, spheresof power and influence will shift, segments of populations will bedisplaced, some communities will wither. All of this is inevitable inhuman life. The world is entering a period of unprecedented growth,which means loss and displacement, as well as progress andopportunities. More than ever before, human beings will be called uponto be attentive, thoughtful, and responsive to matters which affecttheir welfare. The particulars of how this ought to be done will varywith context, but the general recipe for a successful life remainsunchanged and continues to hold promise in direct proportion associeties are free. 	<HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Contemporary-Worker.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Still, don't we needregulators with coercive power such as only government has? What wouldhappen if everyone could, without penalty, forge checks, violatecontracts, dump poisonous wastes into the soil, and manufacture carsthat are accident-prone? The market some times regulates itself, butnot always: people will often profit by causing injury and damage toothers.<p>	The problem is that the watchdogs themselves are imperfect. They arevulnerable to bribery and corruption, and most of all, operate withgross inefficiency. Moreover, those who are entrusted with positions aswatchdogs often have an inordinate desire to increase their own powers.Regulating others often gives them more satisfaction than their incomedoes, and they spare no effort to keep on increasing their ownregulatory powers. And often nobody watches the watchers.<p>	I shall present three examples, deliberately taken from a diversearray of activities, to illustrate how this problem affects thebusiness community.<h4>1. Environmental Regulation</h4><p>	Not many people set out to make their natural environment dangerousfor human habitation, or desire to render entire species of livingthings extinct. Laws are enacted to inhibit those whose actions havethis effect. Today, however, regulations have become soall-encompassing that no business and no landowner could long surviveif all the regulations now on the books were strictly enforced. Forexample, there are countless underlings in the Departments of Interiorand Agriculture who are empowered to say to farmers "That mud puddle inyour back field is hereby declared a wetland' thus making it no longerpermissible for farmers to cultivate such land although they stillcontinue to pay taxes on it.<p>	Thousands of letters were sent out in 1993 from the Bureau ofReclamation of the Department of the Interior, informing the recipientsthat the Bureau intended to look for endangered species on their land.What if the landowner refused to permit such inspection? Then, sincethe absence of endangered species could not be confirmed by inspection,uncultivated parcels would be labeled as habitat for endangeredspecies.<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	What happens if a piece of land is declared a habitat? Strictcontrols on use then come into play. "When the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService had designated a habitat-study zone, one family lost $60,000worth of production a year."<a href="#1">[1]</a> Since the zone is off limits to crops, afarmer cannot replant there. Moreover, banks no longer will make loansto buy such properties because they are aware that the buyer will notbe able to use the land for planting crops.<p>	Congress passes a law; the "beef" in the law is the enablingclause which permits the regulatory agency to make whatever regulationsit deems necessary and proper to implement the law. Those who aresubjected to the regulations must obey every one, however trivial orburdensome, or else receive large fines or even jail sentences. Usuallythe act is applied by its enforcers beyond the scope of what wasenvisioned when the law was passed. Already every landowner is subjectto the intricately detailed provisions of the Clean Air Act, the CleanWater Act, the Safe Drinking Water Acts the Endangered Species Act, theNational Environmental Policy Management Act, and so on. They aredrowning under a flood of regulations, from which the only benefit maybe to the regulators, keeping them in well-paid positions at theexpense of the taxpayers.<p><a name="2r"></p><p>	The mission of the national Biological Survey is "to catalogeverything that walks, crawls, swims, or flies around this country." Todo this their agents must be able to enter every parcel of land in theUnited States--not every decade, as with the census, but on acontinuous basis. "Landowners fear that the net effect will be totransfer de facto control of thousands more acres to the federalgovernment.<a href="#2">[2]</a><h4>2. Housing Regulations</h4><p><a name="3r"></p><p>	In past decades, prior to the massive interference of the federalgovernment, inexpensive housing was far less of a problem than it istoday. Cheap rooms could be had, for a dollar or two a week, with noparticular amenities and perhaps a bathroom down the hall shared byseveral tenants<a href="#3">[3]</a> But in most cases American cities these "flop-houses"facilities were torn down: "We can't have people living like that." Thegovernment tore down the building and built other ones at much highercost. Most of those who had previously occupied these buildings couldnot afford the new ones.<p>	To limit the cost to tenants, rent control measures were initiated,but of course such controls only prevented new housing from beingbuilt, and massive shortages developed. Who wants to risk losing moneyon real estate in New York City! Landlords who can sell do so at a lossand get out.<p>	But rent control is only the most notorious form of regulation.In most states it is illegal to refuse to rent a room or apartment tosomeone because he or she is a welfare recipient: the ultimate threatof the renter whose every whim is not satisfied is "I'II report you tothe Welfare Board and then you'll never be able to use your buildingsfor rental again!" It is a pervasive desire of landlords not to rent towelfare recipients; in general, owners say, they have little sense ofresponsibility; they are 'all rights and no responsibilities." Manytend to be slovenly and messy in their personal habits; they demandprivileges not in the contract; they leave lighted cigarettes wherethere are no ashtrays, and leave the flushing of toilets to lesserbeings. Landlords do what they can to avoid renting to them, but ifthey say "I'm evicting this person because she has dirty habits" theywill be told "No, you're trying to evict her because she's on welfare,and that won't work."<p><a name="4r"></p><p>	New regulations are constantly introduced to make ownershipof rental property more burdensome. Every door (in some states) must beequipped with a large metal rod on a spring so that it willautomatically close in case of fire. (This costs about $50 per door.)With new regulations being continuously enacted, the landlord's marginof profit, already precarious, often disappears entirely. Moreover, itprofits the tenants to break some pipes or destroy some electricalfixtures because they don't have to pay rent until these arerepaired.<a href="#4">[4]</a><p>	Meanwhile a new state law (in Minnesota, for example) specifiesthat if the owner does not pay his entire property tax in the year itis due, the entire property can be confiscated the following year.(What happens if the owner has a bad year? The government confiscatesthe property and may operate it at a loss, payable by taxpayers.)<h4>3. Mining</h4><p><a name="5r"></p><p>	In a recent Roper public opinion poll, people were askedtheir opinion of each industry. Of 222 industries, mining ranked nextto last: only tobacco fared worse.<a href="#5">[5]</a> But mining was,and is, more heavily regulated in the United States than in any otherindustrial nation.<p>	Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan decided to build a new copper smelterin Texas City, Texas. Japanese officials were assured by state andfederal officials that all the relevant permits would be issued in 12to 18 months. The first application was submitted in June of 1989. Thencame three years of conflict among environmental groups, permittingagencies, and company management. Air-and-water discharge permits hadto be obtained; the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had to issue its ownpermit; and an assortment of permits from state, county, and cityagencies were also required--more than thirty in all. The Army Corps ofEngineers promised a decision within sixty days, but waited 21 months.<p><a name="6r"></p><p>	Exhausted by the attrition, Mitsubishi finally cancelled the project.The new chairman of the Texas Water Commission said that when hispermit came up for review in four years he would demand zero dischargeof waste water--technically a virtually impossible demand. The airdischarge permit from the Texas Air Control Board would take most of ayear; building the plant would take another two years, and less than ayear after that the company would be faced with the zero-dischargerequirement. For these reasons Mitsubishi abandoned the project inMarch of 1992. They decided to build the identical copper smelter inJapan, where all the required permits were obtained in 14 days and theplant was built in 17 months. The president of Key Metals and MineralsEngineering Corporation, Dr. Thomas Mackey, wrote, "This action ended amarvelous opportunity for the U.S. to acquire a minimum-pollutionenergy-efficient modern copper smelter which would have beenstrategically located on the Gulf of Mexico's coast...."<a href="#6">[6]</a><p>	As a result of this and numerous similar incidents, Japan is ahead ofthe United States in the development of mining technology. For manyyears the United States was a net exporter of copper. Today the UnitedStates has been surpassed in copper production by Chile. Gradually weare becoming non-competitive.<p>	In 1992 the Congress passed a bill which may seem trivial by itself,but taken together with a mass of similar ones, is a significant strawin the wind on the future of mining in America. As a result of the newlegislation, whenever your company buys an electric motor you are nowrequired to buy "the most efficient" one: 96 percent efficiency is nowmandated, whereas the earlier requirement was 94 percent. So what, onemight say--what's a difference of 2 percent? The catch is that it mustbe 96 percent-efficient <i>when operating at full speed</i>. The 96percent-efficient motor is more efficient at full speed, but it hasless starting torque. In fact a conveyor belt <i>could never get started</i>with the newly required motor. But since the 94 percent-efficient motoris no longer permitted, users must now go from a 96 percent-efficientmotor of 100-horsepower to one of 200-horsepower, just to get the motorstarted.<p>	Once the 200-horsepower motor is running, it doesn't require all thatextra energy--it can easily do with 100. But since the 100 horsepowermotor that would do the job is now outlawed, it is necessary to use the200. The extra energy is wasted, but no other option exists that is notillegal. By less contrast, Japan can still use the 94 percent-efficientmotor. American equipment will be more inefficient and more expensive,thanks to many laws such as this one.<p>	The new law does not save energy--it requires industry to wasteenergy. It does its bit to make the United States non-competitive. Itis assisting the gradual process of de-industrializing America.<h4>Conclusion</h4><p>	Regulation--actually, more suitably called "prohibition"--of limitedscope is necessary to prevent people from harming other people--thatis, when one person or group would otherwise violate the rights ofothers. But the vast majority of today's regulations are not of thiskind, but could better be called regulation for regulation's sake. Itis these that are eroding America's industrial base and making theUnited States increasingly non-competitive in the world economy.<p>	It was not always so: America today would be unrecognizable tothose who lived here a century ago, thanks to the labor and ingenuityof many thousands of productive individuals--inventors, manufacturers,merchants, farmers, and countless others employed by them andassociated with them. But in the last half century an opposing forcehas gathered momentum, threatening to bring these productive advancesgradually to a halt. The conflict is between those who have <i>created</i>this vast array of goods and services, and those whose aim is to<i>control</i> the creators. Will the economies of other nations, not asburdened as ours by harassing regulations, replace the United States asthe economic leaders of tomorrow? At present it is far from clear whatthe outcome will be.</p><h4><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>Jeff A. Taylor. "Species Argument," Reason.

Ihad taken along a large bag of Snickers candy bars with which toappease the children of my various hosts. But these treats proved to beextremely popular with adults. They were consumed soon after dinner onmy first night in Moscow, amidst repeated exclamations about how"fresh!" they were. It was explained to me that Snickers are hotcommodities for Moscow speculators--they hold them for six months or soand then sell them for many times the original purchase price. This isby no means the strangest feature of the post-Communist economy that isemerging in Russia. (Counterfeit cigarettes cheap, Russian-madecigarettes packaged in recycled Marlboro boxes--are pretty odd.)Indeed, it does not seem strange at all when it is viewed in itscontext. Markets are springing up in the ruins of Communism like weedsin the ruins of an abandoned building. That this is so should come asno surprise to anyone. And this, in itself, is revealing.<p>	When the opportunity presents itself, people will make a buck.What is remarkable is how frequently the opportunity presents itself.The case of the Russian entrepreneur who speculates in Snickers is notunlike that of the American entrepreneur who speculates in agriculturalcommodities. When a commodities broker buys a farmer's wheat at a fixedprice per bushel before the wheat is even planted, he is speculating(i.e., taking a risk) that the wheat will actually sell for a higherprice at harvest time. The farmer, on the other hand, trades thepossibility of a higher price (and the risk of a lower one) forcertainty and security. When a Russian entrepreneur holds a shipment ofSnickers for six months, he is also speculating that the price will goup. The supplier who sold him the Snickers is trading risk forcertainty and, perhaps, the steady cash flow he needs to continue toimport goods. And as long as some people prefer the certainty of lessmoney now to the possibility of more money later--because they prefersecurity to risk or because they need a steady cash flow, or for someother reason still--any market, even a "black" market, will providenumerous opportunities for such speculation.<p>	The chaotic, hyperinflationary Russian economy has produced asubstantial number of speculators in the brief period since thecollapse of Communism--speculators in real estate, consumer goods,currency--and it has made many of them quite wealthy, at least by localstandards. The response of the Russian populace to this phenomenonmirrors the response of Americans to successful speculators in our owneconomy. Financial speculators who reap enormous profits from correctlyanticipating market fluctuations are not generally respected in theUnited States; they are commonly thought to be unproductive parasites,and probably criminals as well. In a like manner, Russians commonlylump together all successful members of the emerging business classwhether they be drug dealers or currency speculators or real estatespeculators or importers dealing in consumer goods--and characterizethem as "mafia." And, like Americans, they resent the disproportionateeconomic and political influence, and the relatively high standard ofliving, that accrue to successful speculation.<p>	Of course, some speculators are criminals, and it is quite natural toresent those who live well off ill-gotten gains. Indeed. it is anatural, though not very laudable, tendency of human beings to resentanyone who has whatever one does not. And the results of speculationare not always entirely congruent with the preferences of consumers:Russians would like their Snickers to be fresher (and they would liketo be able to buy less profitable items like needles and thread).Everyone would like to buy their food at lower prices. Americans wouldlike to see less of the instability in large companies and financialinstitutions that results from unsuccessful or especially predatoryspeculation. These are understandable sources of resentment, even ifthey are not entirely rational. But I think there is something more atwork here.<p>	It is worth noting that people are generally quite resistant tothe argument that speculators make an important contribution to themarket--that there might be less food, no Snickers, a lower level ofeconomic activity in general without the activities of speculators.That speculators can profit from taking risks, providing capital,improving efficiency, and so forth, is more likely to be seen as adefect in the market than a virtue of speculators. What is at work hereis an idea that has been in place at least since the medievalinjunction against usury.<p>	Thomas Aquinas, along with other medieval philosophers andtheologians, argued that lending money at interest is morally repugnantbecause "this is to sell what does not exist, and this evidently leadsto inequality which is contrary to justice." (Summa Theologica II-II,Question 78) The speculator, like the usurer, traffics in what does notexist, at least not yet. The speculator does not grow any food orimport any Snickers. From one perspective, it seems that the speculatorproduces nothing, but profits from the productive activities of others.From another perspective, however, one might say that what thespeculator produces is the market itself (or, at any rate, that thespeculator facilitates the exchanges that constitute the market). Fromeither perspective, speculation appears to be a very pure form ofcapitalist practice, and thus speculation is a magnet for anyresentment that capitalism engenders.<p>	But it seems clear that this resentment is misplaced. Adam Smith'soriginal defense of the market economy provides a crucial insight intohow to think about the moral dimension of speculation. Although Smith'sargument that division of labor and freedom of exchange constitute themost efficient mode of economic organization is most often cited bycontemporary defenders of capitalism, this is by no means his mostfundamental argument. For Smith also argued that the market economy isthe only economic system that functions to bring self-interest intoharmony with the good of society.<h4>The Virtue of Capitalism</h4><p>	Smith, unlike many other moral theorists, did not construe thecommon human inclination to pursue one's own self-interest asinherently evil, as something incompatible with the moral life. Rather,he construed self-interest as an essential feature of individualwell-being, and also as a force that might be directed toward thepublic good. The great virtue of capitalism, he argued, is that itaccomplishes precisely this: capitalism is nothing more nor less than aframework of laws and institutions which allows people to enrichthemselves (i.e., pursue self-interest) only, or at least primarily, byproviding goods and services that contribute to the well-being ofothers. Capitalism transforms the pursuit of self-interest into thepursuit of mutually profitable exchanges with the other members ofone's community, i.e., into pursuit of the public good.<p>	Seen in this light, the speculator becomes a kind of economicadventurer, a hero of the capitalist revolution, if you will. Thesuccessful speculator is one who, through superior luck, imagination,or intelligence, is able to identify previously unnoticed opportunitiesfor mutually beneficial exchanges. By facilitating these exchanges, thespeculator expands the economic horizons of a community in much thesame way that more traditional adventurers expand our geographical orintellectual horizons. However, and this is a crucial component ofSmith's argument that is often forgotten, this process works onlywithin an appropriate framework of laws and other social institutions.If the laws and institutions of a community reward exchanges whichbenefit (some of) the participants at the expense of other members ofthe community, these are the exchanges that speculators willfacilitate. If economic laws and institutions reward exchanges thatdisrupt the economy, we can be sure that the economy will be disrupted.Thus, the task of the political economist is a difficult one--toestablish a framework of laws and incentives that accomplishes thisharmonization of self-interest with the public good. People willspeculate. Whether or not this benefits the community depends largelyon whether or not society recognizes and seeks to exploit the potentialbenefits of speculation.<p>	The genius of Adam Smith's defense of the market is his recognitionof the complexity of human nature. The natural inclination to pursueone's own self-interest is potentially anti-social, but it is also apotential source of virtually unlimited economic progress. Theresentment of speculators that is pervasive in both post-CommunistRussia and the contemporary United States is, at least in part, anattempt to simplify human nature by identifying the pursuit ofself-interest as something inherently antisocial, and thus as somethingthat must be suppressed in order to create a just and humane society.And this has the seemingly paradoxical implication that post-CommunistRussia and the contemporary United States face essentially the sameproblem. Both must seek to restore faith in the value of individualentrepreneurship--Russia in order to create a market economy and theUnited States in order to preserve the market economy that we alreadyhave.<p>	I am optimistic that Russia will succeed in this task. Despitethe resentment of economic success that is pervasive in Russia, mostRussians are quite well aware of the benefits of a more or lessunfettered market, and quite unwilling to return to the managed economyof the recent past. (Even the reconstituted Communist Party claims thatit does not oppose the transition to a market economy but, rather, thatit simply wishes to mitigate the dislocations attendant on rapid socialchange.) I am less optimistic that the United States will preserve amarket economy in the face of increasing resentment of successfulspeculators. Decades of relative economic success have created apolitical culture that encourages impatience and envy. Americans are nolonger willing to trust the "invisible hand" of the market, or toundertake the difficult task of creating a political culture whichallows this invisible hand to harmonize self-interest with the publicgood. Instead, they want to enjoy the benefits of speculationsresponsive and expanding economy with out the costs.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Sweet-Speculation.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

New York.</p><hr noshade><p>	Although we can say a great deal about the institutions of afree society, and why they are desirable, speculating about thespecific ways in which people will choose to organize themselves withinsuch institutions is always a tricky matter. After all, the wholejustification for the institutions of a free society is that onlythrough its institutions can human beings discover progressively betterways of dealing with scarcity (of both goods and knowledge) and thusimprove both our material and non-material welfare. Our ignorance ofthe details of a free society is precisely why having a free society isso important.	<p>	Nonetheless, this need not completely discourage us from imaginingwhat the details of some aspects of a freer economy might look like.One way to go about this task is to look at the various ways aparticular industry is unfree and imagine what removing thoserestrictions might do. In conjunction with such a thought experiment wemight also look for historical examples where the industry in questionwas more free and explore the ways in which it operated and organizeditself.	<p>	The banking industry is especially suited for just this kind ofanalysis. If we want to know what commercial banking might look like ina free society, we need only turn to contemporary regulation and thehistorical record to begin to piece together a coherent story.	<p>	There are four major areas in which the freedom of Americancommercial banks is restricted. The first area is the set ofprerogatives taken away by this existence of government central banks,particularly the private issuance of currency. The second deals withrestrictions on geographic location, while the third concerns therelationship between banks and non-bank firms. Fourth, as a result ofthe first three, is mandatory deposit insurance.<h4>Central Banks and the Issuance of Currency</h4><p>	In order for central banks to undertake the activities they, ortheir political overseers, have deemed necessary, they must acquire amonopoly over the production of currency. This restriction on thefreedom of individual banks to create the kinds of financialinstruments their customers might want has large and pervasive effectson the macroeconomy and the size of government more generally. Because"customers" must use the government-issued currency, they have no wayof indicating their dissatisfaction with its quality or value. This iswhat enables governments to use the banking system to raise revenue; ifthey create more currency, it will be accepted by someone somewhere.	<p>	Central banks also have had a notorious time, even when the politicalincentives to inflate can be overcome, figuring out precisely what theright quantity of money should be. In a small version of what wouldface a comprehensive economic planner, central bankers attempt toestimate the demand for money and create the appropriate amount inresponse. For the reasons so skillfully articulated by Mises and Hayek,there are enormous knowledge barriers to this kind of central planning,even in one industry.<p>	In a free society one would expect banks to produce their ownbrands of currency which would compete for the business of money users.Although this may seem a bit strange, having lived in an economy withonly one currency, it really is not that much different from where weare today. Firstly, banks already offer competing monies. A checkingaccount at Chase Manhattan is a different brand of privately producedmoney from a checking account at Citibank. Checking accounts areliabilities of the banks that create them, making them privatelyproduced. They also differ in various ways: interest paid or not, rateof interest, fees charged, services offered, overdraft protection, andso on. Depositors choose among banks today based on the total packageof products and services that accompany a checking account. One wouldexpect the same if currency were competitively produced.	<p>	More important, competition in currency production would giveproducers the incentive to neither overproduce nor underproducecurrency, and therefore maintain its value. In order for banks to gettheir liabilities (either currency or checking accounts) accepted, theywould have to make them redeemable in some commodity (such as gold) orsome other asset. Customers would not accept mere paper liabilitieswithout some connection to an item which had value outside of thebanking system.	<p>	As a result, any bank which overproduced would find customersreturning unwanted currency which would lead to a fall in the bank'sholding of the backing commodity, reducing its ability to create loans.Banks cannot afford to risk reserve shortages like this, so they wouldreduce their outstanding currency liabilities until those lossesstopped. Banks that issued too little currency would see their reservespiling up and would be sacrificing the interest they could earn bymaking loans backed by those reserves. In a free society, the samemarket forces that create incentives to produce the correct quantity ofshoes toothbrushes, or eggs, would apply to currency. Because thebanking system of a free society would get the supply of moneygenerally right, it would also avoid the macroeconomic problems ofinflation and deflation that have resulted from unfree central bankingsystems.<p>	Virtually every country on the planet has had some experiencewith privately produced currency. The historical evidence suggests thatcountries with less regulated currency production had fewer bankfailures and more stable macroeconomics. The Scottish banking system ofthe late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is a good example ofthe benefits of freedom, especially when compared with thesubstantially less free English banking system of the time. The U.S.experience of the nineteenth century provides a good example of howproblems can develop when even private currency production isoverregulated. The recurring crises and panics of the period can beseen as unintended consequences of misguided bank regulations.	<p>	In order to make their currency monopoly work, central bankshave imposed other restrictions that would be absent in a free society.For example, central banks require banks to hold certain minimum levelsof reserves. Normally these are higher than banks would otherwise holdand they usually do not earn any interest. Effectively they are a tax.In addition, reserve requirements prevent the public from havingaccurate information about bank portfolios. Banks that could afford tohold fewer reserves because they are safer are prevented from doing so,and banks who are riskier and might choose to hold higher reservelevels, especially in the absence of government mandated depositinsurance (see below), have no need to do so. In a free society, bankscould pick the level of reserves they saw fit and would have to bearthe consequences of holding too many or too few reserves.	<p>	More generally, a free society would not see central banks in the waythey have developed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. There isnothing inherent in the evolution of banking that necessitates them,and their existence results from constitutionally unconstrainedpoliticians striving after a cheap source of revenue. Of course banksin a free society would likely develop interbank institutions such asclearinghouses, but these would have no special government privilegesand would be forced to compete for members and business.<h4>Interstate Banking</h4>	<p>	A more general way of thinking about banking in a free society isthat banks will be subject to the same laws as other corporations. Oneexample of how that is not true today is the issue of interstatebanking. It is very difficult for many American banks to open upbranches across state lines. Laws permitting interstate banking aremade at the state level and they vary from state to state. Althoughmost states have liberalized these laws to some extent in the last 10or 20 years, full nationwide banking does not exist.		<p>	One result of this is that many banks are insufficientlydiversified because they are too closely tied to industries specific totheir state. When those industries falter, the banks fail with them.Banks that can spread their risks across different industries, byoperating in different states, are less likely to fail. One bit ofhistorical evidence for this contention comes from Canada. Canadianbanks have historically been able to operate nationwide. While over5,000 American banks failed in the 1920s and early '30s, only oneCanadian bank did. Although a number of bank <i>offices</i> closed, only theone bank failed. This statistic is even more compelling when oneconsiders that the variation in economic conditions between rural andurban Canada is greater than in the United States, posing a greaterdiversification challenge.		<p>	In a free society, we could expect banks to operatewherever they pleased, just as other firms do now. The need fortraveler's checks, or the hassle of finding a new bank after moving,would disappear as true nationwide banking would make it far morelikely that one's bank would have offices in more places. Oneconsequence of this change would be a smaller number of larger-sizedbanking organizations. However, as evidence from countries which permitnationwide banking indicates, these larger banks would operate moreoffices per capita than smaller banks. This would both improve accessto banking for most people and enable banks to capture the costefficiencies of large-scale production that are now closed off.<h4>Glass-Steagall Restrictions</h4><p>	One other set of regulations on contemporary American banksare so-called Glass-Steagall restrictions. As part of the bankingreform acts of the 1930s, a firm may not own both a commercial bank anda non-bank business. Firms like Sears that provide financial servicescan only provide those services to <i>non-commercial</i> customers.These laws also prevent banks from selling insurance or underwritingsecurities. Many argued that such an intermixture of banking andcommerce was responsible for the numerous bank failures of the early1930s, so a regulatory wall was needed to separate banking fromcommerce. Subsequent research has found this explanation of the bankfailures to be incorrect and the justification for Glass-Steagallrestrictions has been greatly weakened. Even the Clinton administrationhas recognized this and included liberalization of these regulations,as well as those on branching, in its reform package.	<p>	In a free society we would expect to see financialsupermarkets where one could address all of one's financial needs(banking, insurance, investment) in one firm. There are obviousefficiency gains to producers in such a situation, as well as betterservice to consumers with one person or group overseeing their wholefinancial portfolios.		<p>	Because of the activities of central banks and thevarious other regulations noted above, bank failures are a real worryin unfree banking systems. As a result, governments have imposedmandatory deposit insurance in order to prevent the potential bank runsthat their own regulations can trigger. If banks in a free society areunencumbered by central banking and other regulations, we would expectthe whole problem of bank runs to be far less significant. Given this,any possible justification for government-mandated deposit insurancedisappears.<h4>Private Deposit Insurance</h4><p>	Banks in a free society might choose to purchase privately supplieddeposit insurance as a way to reassure customers. They might also enterinto interbank mutual aid agreements, or be insured throughclearinghouses. Historically, banks have used these and other methodsto convey trust to customers. Before deposit insurance banks wouldadvertise their balance sheets and list the members of their boards ofdirectors. Providing this kind of information was a way to establishtheir trustworthiness to actual and potential depositors. With depositinsurance, banks need not do this. It is reasonable to expect thatbanks in a free society will use these ways, and discover new andimaginative ones, of creating the trust on which all banking systemsrest.	<p>	Banks in a tree society will be literally nothing special. Whatmakes banking so unfree today is that banks are treated differentlyfrom other business enterprises. The rule of law that wouldcharacterize a free society would demand that banks be treated nodifferently than other firms. If they are fraudulent or use force, thenthey need to face the consequences. Otherwise, any sort of voluntaryarrangement banks make with customers will be allowed. The result willnot only be a more free banking system, but a more efficient, safe, andproductive one.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Free-Society-Banking.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

The plaintiffs charged that RealFirm's use of onlywhite models in its advertisement amounted to an act of discriminationagainst blacks. Informed by complaints brought in <i>Saunders v. GeneralServices Corp</i>., the plaintiffs' basic argument implied the followingassumptions:</p><ol>		<p>	<li>The absence of black models is the consequence of a decision	to exclude based on racial preference.	</p>	<p>	<li>The absence of black models indicates, on its face, a negative	attitude toward blacks.	</p>	<p>	<li>The exclusion of black models in advertising causes injury to	blacks.	</p>	<p>	<li>The exclusion of black models causes readers to believe that blacks	are not invited to purchase the product (RealFirm apartments).	</p></ol><p>	The charge assumes that a business that uses only white-modeladvertisement is by definition not addressing black consumers, and thatthe failure to address black consumers Is racially discriminatory.Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that the Court could resolve thequestion of whether the newspaper advertisements indicate a racialpreference for white residents "simply by determining whether the totalexclusion of black models 'indicates a racial preference to theordinary reader'"—a test required by the Fair Housing Act.<p>	I reviewed the case with the understanding that every advertisementand every price tag brings bad news to consumers who cannot afford topay the price asked. RealFirm's ads brought the bad news that noteveryone could afford to rent the apartments offered. Among those whocould not afford to rent were blacks who earn less than $35,000. Thiswould be the case whether or not the ads were racially "integrated."The RealFirm advertisements were bad news only for those who desiredsuch a residence, but lacked the resources with which to transform thatdesire into reality. It was of no consequence to consumers who hadneither the desire nor the wherewithal.<p>	To be sure, there have been advertisements whose racist caricaturesbrought the bad news that the advertiser was prejudiced against blacksas a group. However, nothing in the RealFirm ad addressed the racialcharacteristics of potential renters. Although all of the models in thead were white, their function was to symbolize the lifestyle of thepotential renter, not to represent the racial preference of therealtor. The message of the ad was not race-based, but class-based.<p>	One could conceivably argue that the lack of black models inthe ad represented the lack of a significant percentage of upper-incomeblacks who could afford the product. A plausible argument might be thatsince most blacks cannot afford the rents at the apartments, it wouldbe pointless to suggest that they could by including black models inthe advertisement. But RealFirm's choice of models was not meant to be"representative" of the greater percentage of whites among upper-incomerenters. On the contrary, white models were used to represent theneutral consumer within an income bracket, not to match the incomedifferences between blacks and whites, or to send a message ofexclusion to potential black renters.<p>	This line of reasoning carried little weight in the face of thereinforcement the plaintiffs took from provisions of the Fair HousingAct and the policies of public agencies such as the New York CityDepartment of Consumer Affairs. The department's position was that "theomission of African-Americans from ads for luxury goods is an importantfactor in how whites perceive blacks and how blacks perceivethemselves.... While only some of the whites viewing ads for luxuryproducts might actually be able to afford them at least all whites, nomatter what their origins, can imagine themselves in the pictures theysee in these ads. The exclusion of African-Americans from most of thesescenes in our major media, however, keeps them from even imaginingthemselves in such milieus."<h4>Patterns of Consumption</h4><p>	The problem with this position is that its reading of the psychologyof black consumers contradicts the consumption patterns of blacks.First of all, since the use of white-model advertising has notmotivated blacks in all of their previous history to refrain frompurchasing or seeking to purchase a given product, there must be otherreasons for purchasing the product than whether it is represented by ablack model. Secondly, the self-projection thesis assumes that blackscannot imagine themselves in scenes that are populated by white models.But clearly the extent to which blacks are able to imagine themselvesin all-white scenes is borne out by their consumption patterns. Forinstance, although Sears Roebuck was characterized by the New YorkDepartment of Consumer Affairs as using minorities "selectively," inits catalogues, 10 percent of black households made purchases fromSears in 1990, as compared with 14 percent of white households.Although only 4.6 percent of the 22,685 models shown in 157 cataloguesreviewed by the Department were black, 32.5 percent of black familiesmade a catalogue purchase in 1990. The insignificance of the racialcharacteristics of models in advertising is also demonstrated by theblack tenants at RealFirm's apartments who obviously imaginedthemselves as renters despite the appearance of white models in the adfor the apartments.<p>	The plaintiffs also argued that the absence of black modelscaused "ordinary" readers of <i>The New York Times</i>, in which the ad waspublished, to believe that blacks were not invited to purchase theproduct. Those "ordinary" readers were most likely to be persons in theupper-income brackets, whose education ranges from some college toadvanced degrees, and who are employed in a range of occupations fromwhite-collar office worker to corporate executive officer. From what weknow about differences in the socioeconomic status of blacks andwhites, as well as lifestyle patterns, it is plausible to assume thatthe majority of these ordinary readers are white. From what we knowabout the lifestyles of the social classes, we can hypothesize thatwhile the incomes and occupational status of blacks are lower than thatof whites, it is likely that the black readers either share or aspireto a lifestyle comparable to that of whites in the same class. For asresearchers have found, as members of an ethnic group move up thesocioeconomic ladder, they become more middle class in theirexpectations, standards of living, lifestyles, and values. 	<h4>Correlation Does Not Mean Proof</h4><p>	A basic principle of social science research is that the existenceof a correlation between two variables (the more of one variable, themore of the other; or the more of one, the less of the other) is <i>noproof</i> that one of them causes the other. Some other variablecorrelated with them may be the real cause. In that case the originalcorrelation, though real, is spurious: it does not indicate a truecausal relationship. Consider this example of a statistically accuratestatement which points to a <i>spurious</i> relationship: Single peopleeat more candy than married people. Why? Not because marriage affectsthe appetite, but because the unmarried part of the population includeschildren, who generally eat more candy than adults do. This isdetermined by calculating the original correlation between maritalstatus and candy consumption while holding constant the third<i>control</i> variable of age.<p>	The arguments of the plaintiffs and statements by their expertwitnesses abound with spurious assumptions that may be summarized asfollows:</p><ol>	<p>	<li>The more racially integrated real estate advertisement is,	the less likely black consumers will believe they are excluded	from the offering.	</p>	<p>	<li>The less racially integrated an ad, the more black readers feel	humiliated.	</p>	<p>	<li>The perception of discrimination is evidence of actual	discrimination.	</p></ol>		<p>	The assertion that black readers view white-model ad as evidenceof the realtor's preference for white tenants implies that blacksbehave only in terms of their racial identification to the exclusion oftheir class interests.  In fact, like other ethnic groups, black behavein terms of the interaction of their ethnic group status and theirsocial class status, and it is often difficult, it not impossible,tofully separate out the effect of each of these variables in isolationfrom the rest.<p>	Social inequalities exist between the races, while at the sametime class differences within racial groups create divisions that aresometimes hard to bridge. This is illustrated by the polarizationwithin the black community based on divergent experiences of twogrowing segments of the black community: hard-pressed lower-classfamilies headed by women versus upper middle-class families withworking fathers (and often also working mothers) accustomed to thesecure and comfortable life styles enjoyed by whites of their class.<p>	The overwhelming majority of the research on the reactions ofblacks to advertising has to do not with the <i>reaction</i> of blacks towhite-model advertising, but with their <i>attitudes</i> about integratedadvertising. Various studies show the following: that black and whitereactions to advertising stimuli are highly similar; that blacks tendto evaluate both integrated ads and black model ads rather similarly;that while black consumers tend to react positively to black casttelevision commercials, this does not affect their decision to purchasethe product offered. Two important facts about black reactions tointegrated advertisements emerge from the limited research conducted sofar: that using black models in an advertisement does not produce auniversal response in blacks; that even though integrated advertisingmay be designed to inform black consumers that "their kind" is beinginvited to purchase the offering, their reactions to integratedadvertising appeared to be independent of their perceptions of thereasons why advertisers introduced it.<p>	Pioneers in the practice of integrated advertising apparentlyinterpreted the absence of criticism from blacks to mean that blackconsumers in general were reacting positively to their ads.  But whenwell over a fourth of the black people they interviewed expressednegative feelings about such ads, there was reason to question theadvertiser's assumption.  Instead of perceiving a message ofhumanitarianism on the part of the advertiser, most of the consumersviewed the advertiser as being interested in selling the product tomore people, particularly black people. Many saw this as tokenismmotivated by greed. Others see the depiction of blacks in advertisingas the reinforcement of stereotypes. Researchers at the New York CityDepartment of Consumer Affairs report that although all the minoritiesthey interviewed in the advertising and modeling industries want to seemore minorities in advertising "there exists a wide divergence ofopinion as to when, how, and where minorities ought to be depicted inadvertising."<p>	Since the studies above are of unrepresentative samples ofblack consumers, their results cannot be generalized to the nationalpopulation. However, the findings do suggest that if courts are goingto define housing discrimination in terms of the response of blacks tothe biological characteristics of models in real estate advertising,they must first determine what that response is; whether it isuniversal; and whether it is independent of people's perception of themotives of the advertiser. Even if such data were collected it wouldhave no bearing whatsoever on establishing whether discrimination inhousing has occurred. That can only be established by an investigationof whether the advertiser refuses to enter a transaction withprospective tenants on the basis of their race.<p>	Perhaps this explains why in its comprehensive 1989 study of the past50 years of the status of black-white relations, the National Academyof Science's Committee on the Status of Black Americans makes nomention of the impact of advertisement on the attitudes of blacks. TheCommittee identifies three major sources of the persistent residentialseparation of whites and blacks: discrimination, black and whitepreferences for ethnically homogenous neighborhoods, and socioeconomicdifferences between the two groups. In its analysis of data ondiscriminatory real estate practices the Committee makes no mention ofreal estate advertising as such a practice. I interpret the omission asan indication of the failure of researchers to establish that theunderrepresentation of blacks in real estate advertising constitutesevidence of discrimination. Researchers have placed more emphasis onactual discriminatory practices, such as steering black homeseekersaway from predominantly white neighborhoods and into predominantlyblack areas.<p>	As I noted above, logically the charges of discrimination againstRealFirm are irrelevant. But sociologically, they are enormouslysignificant as yet another occasion in the ongoing struggle betweencompeting definitions of rights that fuels the conflict betweenclaims-making groups who seek access to important social institutionsand facilities such as mass media and the judicial system that controlsocial definitions and meanings. It has nothing whatever to do withcapitalism and everything to do with the transformation of Americansociety from free market economics to economic and politicalcollectivism. This transformation is not progressive, but representsthe continued resistance to the demands of modern civilization. Itreflects the desire by many to return to a world based on what today iscalled "positive entitlement"—the recognition of membership in orassociation with a primordial or ascriptive group as the basis ofclaims on, allocation of, or control over material rewards, positions,honor, associations, decision-making, or participation. It involves therecognition of racial, religious, or ethnic groups as distinctsub-populations having group rights that must be protected andfulfilled. It is an assault on the legal order of capitalism whichholds the right to property and freedom as supreme, and its principleof justice which requires that men give or take only what they deserve,that they treat other men as independent equals, and that theirrelationships are the product of free, voluntary exchange.<p>	When a society develops an economy in which group membership isgranted primacy over productivity, the premise at work is what Ayn Randcalled "the tribal premise of economics"—"the notion that wealthbelongs to the tribe or to society as a whole, and that everyindividual has the 'right' to 'participate' in it." The case ofRealFirm illustrates the extent to which the tribal premise has beatenback the "spirit of capitalism."</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Tribal-Capitalism.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

OnFebruary 9, [1994] it took me to Washington, D.C., where I had beeninvited by the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House ofRepresentatives. The Committee is in the process of considering whichone of the health care reform proposals it will back or how it willcombine them to come up with its own proposal. It is a foregoneconclusion that they will come up with a variant of reform whichinvolves sweeping changes to the U.S. health care system. As becomesapparent when you listen to the evidence presented to the Committee andhear the questions they pose, it is far from clear what the realmotivation is.	<p>	One thing which is crystal clear is that those who propose itas an alternative, have an entirely idealized vision of the Canadianhealth care system. They imagine that in our system access is equal,free, and unlimited. They are certain that merely adopting it willsolve the problems of high infant mortality and shortened lifeexpectancy amongst low-income members of their communities. And theythink they will be able to accomplish all of this while saving moneybecause the Canadian system is cheaper. No evidence presented to theCommittee seemed to deter them in any way in their enthusiasm. But theevidence they heard should at least have made them think twice.	<p>	First, let me say that I think that the Canadian health caresystem has been one of the best in the world. We have been able toprovide a very good quality of health care to the vast majority ofCanadians. However, it is just as important to note that the quality ofthe system is changing and that there are definite signs ofdeterioration. The main point is that these signs of deterioration aretraceable to structural characteristics of the Canadian system whichalso are embedded in the proposals for reform in the United States.<h4>Premium Capping</h4><p>	The silver bullet in the plan proposed by President Clinton is premiumcapping—that is, the provision that the premium for the standardrequired health care package will be allowed to increase only by therate of inflation and the rate of population growth. In other words,the plan freezes the quantity of health care resources at the presentper-capita level in real terms. There will be no increase in the realcost per person from 1995.	<p>	The silver bullet that controls the costs of the (ten) Canadianhealth care system(s) is the fact that the provincial governments haveacted gradually to cap the budget allocations for health care. Themethods differ by province, but essentially the attempt has been madeto cap the budgets of hospitals for operating expenses, for specialsurgical procedures such as by-pass surgeries and hip replacements, andfor the acquisition of technology. Meanwhile province after provincehas adopted a form of cap for the incomes of physicians thuscontrolling the overall cost of health care. These controls have notprevented health care expenditures from escalating from 5.5 percent ofGDP in 1960 to about 9.5 percent at the moment. In fact Canadian costslook good only by comparison with the United States, which is nowspending 13.5 per cent of GDP—up from the same 5.5 percent as Canada in1960.	<p>	In economics we say that there is no such thing as a free lunch. Thequestion is: how has Canada been able to save the four percentagepoints of GDP? What have we done without? The Democrats on the HouseWays and Means Committee believe, along with many Canadians, that wehave sacrificed nothing, simply controlled the excesses of privateenterprise medicine.	<p>	To cast it in shale relief, it is interesting to restate whatthis belief implies. "The replacement of the dollar-focused,profit-driven judgment of the competitive market by the sociallyfocused, well-meaning judgment of government bureaucrats has beensuccessful in producing a better quality health service, for morepeople at a lower cost." The first clue that something may be awry isprovided by substituting, the word "automobile," or "postal service,"or "airline," or "gasoline," or "bubble gum," or "architecture," or"movies," or anything else for "health service," in the sentence. Infact, based on a tremendous amount of evidence and direct experience itis now possible to say the sentence would not be true for any otherproduct or service. And there is evidence, which others and I providedto the U.S. Congress, that Canadian health care has not succeeded whereall these other attempts at government coordination have failed.	<p>	The Fraser Institute survey of hospital waiting lists, which Ipresented to the Ways and Means Committee of the House ofRepresentatives, shows that nearly one percent of our population iswaiting for surgery. That survey also shows that, unlike the myth,access is not uniform across the country but varies enormously byprovince. That is not surprising, of course, because health spendingalso varies by province. One would expect the more a province spends,the closer it would come to the U. S. experience of no or very shortwaiting lists. The shortest waiting times are measured in Ontario whichspends $7,200 per family of four on health care, nearly double theamount spent in Prince Edward Island, which has the lowest cost care at$4,800 and the longest waiting times.<h4>Technology Gap</h4><p>	A comparison of technologies shows that many Canadians do nothave access to the latest diagnostic machinery and enough treatmentfacilities at their disposal. To pick a topical example, we haveone-tenth the number of nuclear magnetic resonance imaging machines percapita as the United States. While there will always be the question(with no definitive answer) of how many is enough, the fact thatprivate NMRI facilities are opening in Alberta and British Columbia,and that Canadians are going into the United States to get suchdiagnostic imaging done, suggests that we have not kept pace in thisarea.	<p>	The Congress learned from Dr. William Mackillop of the KingstonRegional Cancer Centre that cancer patients are now getting lessradiation therapy for specific cancers than they were getting ten yearsago, to their detriment. Less radiation therapy means more surgery,more disfigurement, and less longevity than otherwise would beachieved. Dr. Mackillop pointed out that there was a shortage ofradiation therapy units, a shortage of people to operate them, and ashortage of people to train people to operate them. This, he noted, inspite of the fact that the current increasing demand for cancer therapyhad been well forecast as early as 1975 because the incidence of canceris age dependent and the average age of our population is increasing ina very predictable way. The bureaucrats had simply not reacted to theforeseeable need, he pointed out.	<p>	Perhaps the most important comment he made to the Congress, concerneda comparison he had made of waiting times for radiation therapy betweenCanada and the United States. The comparison he offered was based on acomprehensive survey of cancer centers in Canada and the United States.Dr. Mackillop asked the centers to provide the number of weeks that apatient could expect to wait for therapy for cancers of specific types.He found that in every case Canadian patients were waiting longer thanAmerican patients. In the case of some cancers, the median wait wasthree times as long in Canada as it was in the United States.	<p>	While Dr. Mackillop had many nice things to say about the Canadiansystem, about how unnecessary surgeries and treatment were kept to aminimum, he betrayed a concern about whether the system ofbureaucracies in government was capable of anticipating and reacting tothe health care needs of the population in the way that it should. Hein particular thinks that cancer patients are not receiving thetreatment they need and should be getting.	<p>	Our testimony was given some real-life impact by the testimonyof Lisa Priest of the Toronto Star newspaper. Ms. Priest has been doinga series of articles on how waiting lists affect particular patients inOntario. Her stories are both heart-wrenching and effective in pointingto the specific problems which beset our health care system. Ms. Priestsurprised observers, however, by coming to the paradoxical conclusionthat faults and all, she would choose the Canadian health care systemover the American system, because, she noted, there are two thingsCanadians fear when they go to the United States: that they will getshot or get sick. Evidently those who go there to get the healthcare--including the cancer therapies about which Ms. Priest writes--arenot included in this assessment.<HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Canadian-Health-Care.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

L. Billingsley</h4></center><hr><p>K.L. Billingsley is a media fellow of thePacific Research Institute in San Francisco.</p><hr noshade><p>	Critics of the government are not always right that taxpayersdon't get what they pay for. Sometimes they get more. For example, thegovernment of California has recently provided a lesson in the linkbetween human behavior and economics that the best university would behard-pressed to duplicate. But the lesson proved both expensive anddifficult to learn.	<p>	In California, no government agency exists to provide health care formiddle-class working people and their families. There is, however, asystem for the poor called Medi-Cal, which the taxes of middle-classworking people pay for, but which remains off-limits to them.	<p>	A number of press accounts have pointed out massive fraud inthe Medi-Cal system, which is limited by law to California residents.But people from countries as far away as India have flown in, receivedoperations costing hundreds of thousands of dollars--in one case $2.7million--and quickly departed the country leaving the bill toCalifornia taxpayers who can't use the system themselves.	<p>	In some cases, Medi-Cal's own personnel helped people to committhis fraud and tried to cover up investigations. Here a bureaucraticprinciple was at work. More "clients" means bigger budgets, which meansa bigger allocation from the state and increased job security. So thebureaucratic incentive, unlike the private sector, is to ignore fraudand bloat the budget.	<p>	Democracy is not simply the counting of heads but involves therule of law. In 1986, the United States government granted blanketamnesty to millions of people who had flouted American immigrationlaws. Federal and California officials rewarded not only them but thosewhose status remained illegal.	<p>	In 1988 Medi-Cal began providing prenatal care to illegal immigrantsresiding in or even intending to reside in the state. California evenlaunched an advertising campaign called "Baby-Cal," spending $78,000for spots on Spanish-language radio and television stationstransmitting from Mexico. The state quickly got what it paid for, andmore.	<p>	"If you build it, they will come," was the phrase from themovie Field of Dreams. California not only built it but advertised iton television. And they came, in droves.	<p>	According to the most recent figures cited in a San DiegoUnion-Tribune study, un-documented aliens gave birth to nearly 96,000babies in the state during 1992. This constituted a full 85 percentincrease over the last three years and does not include those coveredunder amnesty who also used Medi-Cal. The costs for 1992 came to $230million. That same year 40 percent of California's 237,000 publiclyfunded births were undocumented immigrants. And 41 percent of those whoused Medi-Cal for maternity care also used the welfare system afterdelivery.	<p>	There are several lessons here. First and foremost, as fiscalconservatives have often pointed out, you get what you subsidize. Forexample, if you subsidize single-parent families, you will getsingle-parent families. If you subsidize indigence, you will getindigence. If you subsidize the births of foreign nationals in thecountry illegally, you will get what you pay for. But state officialsare just now learning that lesson.	<p>	Medi-Cal's John Rodriquez told the Union-Tribune that in his "wildestimagination" he never imagined the program growing so fast. "I think,"he added, "we are 1 seeing a magnet effect." Precisely.	<p>	America has been and always will be a country of immigrants.Historically, however, immigrants have traditionally come through legalchannels in search of opportunities, not through illegal channels insearch of handouts. The "Babv-Cal" fiasco shows how welfare state fraudhas corrupted immigration. And as Cuban-American author George Borjaspoints out, most people now coming are unskilled and may wind up onwelfare even if such programs were not their original attraction.	<p>	As the Medi-Cal episode also proves, good intentions can havedisastrous consequences. And contrary to what one often hears, there isno "free" health care, something California's four-billion-dollar debtconfirms. Federal politicians might see a warning here, but they seemto be missing the point.	<p>	On the contrary, they are now promising universal health carefor every American and claim that a tax on cigarettes and changes inMedicare will pay for it all. The failed statist medical experiments ofother countries provide some prospects as to its possibilities ofsuccess . And California's Medi-Cal program gives some clues as to whatwe can expect in the way of waste and fraud. American nationals willhold no monopoly in pillaging the system. If you build it, they willcome.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Medi-Cal-Fraud.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Christiansen</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Christiansen is a professor of economicsat California State University, Hayward.</p><hr noshade>	<p>	Two sweeping studies of government regulation and deregulation,respectively, have been published in recent years. The findings ofthese studies deserve to be better known. The studies also meritattention for what they did not say about environmental regulation.	<p>	The first study, by Robert Hahn and John Hird, was published inthe Yale Journal on Regulation in the winter of 1991. It surveyed allof the major benefit-cost studies on regulation that had appearedbefore the authors wrote their article. The authors concluded that inonly two areas, the environment and highway safety, could one plausiblyargue that the benefits of regulation had outweighed its costs. Itshould be emphasized that, with respect to the areas outside of theenvironment and highway safety, the authors were not claiming thatregulation had had no benefits. They were claiming, however, that inlight of its costs, people generally would have been better off ifregulation had not occurred.	<p>	The second study, by Clifford Winston of the Brookings Institution(Journal of Economic Literature, September 1993), surveyed areas wheresignificant deregulation has taken place, such as airlines andtrucking. Environmental deregulation was not studied because littlesuch deregulation has occurred. In every single case examined by theauthor, however, deregulation was found to have had net benefits.	<p>	It should be pointed out that the article in the Yale Journalwas written before the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Even beforethat legislation went into effect, Paul Portney of Resources for theFuture estimated that the amendments would impose costs far in excessof their benefits. The annual costs were estimated to be on the orderof one-half percent of the entire U.S. gross national product, a hugeimpact for one piece of regulatory legislation. When this legislationis considered in conjunction with other environmental measures (notedbelow) that were not considered in the Yale article, it seems verylikely that environmental regulation has had the same overall impact asother regulation. In other words it has been generally harmful.	<p>	The authors of the Yale article are well aware that benefit-costestimation is a very imprecise science, especially so in the case ofthe environment. The likelihood that various measures will improve, orharm, human health simply is not known. There are also seriousphilosophical questions that can be raised about the relevance ofbenefit-cost estimates for public policy decisions. However, theresearch findings are in some cases so dramatic that basic conclusionscan nevertheless be drawn about the efficacy of regulation.	<p>	Any net benefits from environmental regulation prior to 1990 seem tohave been due primarily to air pollution standards for factories.Estimates by Myrick Freeman of Bowdoin College indicate that emissionsstandards for new trucks and automobiles have probably had costs wellin excess of their benefits. Virginia McConnell of the University ofMaryland has found that the performance of vehicle inspection andmaintenance programs--for example, smog tests for used cars--has beeneven more dismal. According to Freeman, it is likely that waterpollution control efforts have also failed to pass a benefit-cost test.	<p>	Numerous other examples can be given of perverse environmentalregulation. It now appears that the "Superfund" toxic-waste programwill cost more than the government bailout of failed savings-and-loanassociations. The activities of the California Coastal Commission,which regulates the use of one of the most valuable coastlines in theworld, cannot pass a benefit-cost test. Notwithstanding some recentcourt decisions that have narrowed its scope, the Endangered SpeciesAct has emerged as one of the most economically destructive pieces ofregulatory legislation ever passed.	<p>	Even factory air pollution control has not been nearly so efficientas it could have been because firms are not always allowed to use theleast-cost method of emissions abatement. It is still the case, forexample, that firms must use abatement technologies dictated by theU.S. Environmental Protection Agency, regardless of their cost.	<p>	On the other hand, there has been limited progress in reformingthe control of air pollution. A factory may now, for example, be ableto pollute somewhat more than it formerly could if it can find, andpay, another factory to pollute somewhat less (so as to compensate forthe increased pollution of the first factory).	<p>	Factories have incentives to enter into such arrangements insofar asone factory can abate pollution more cheaply than another. Suppose onefactory could abate some pollution at a cost of $50,000. Suppose asecond factory in the area could abate the same amount of pollution ata cost of $40,000. Under such circumstances, if the first factory paidthe second factory $45,000 to undertake the abatement in question, bothfactories would be better off by $5,000. That is, the first factorywould save $5,000 by paying the second factory instead of abating thepollution itself. The second factory would gain $5,000 by receiving apayment in excess of its (relatively low) abatement costs. The airquality in an area can thereby be maintained at lower overall cost thanwould have been the case under the old rules; in the past, factorieswere not allowed to make such agreements.	<p>	It would be a mistake, however, to conclude that, as a generalprinciple, regulation can be successfully reformed or undone withoutfundamental changes in the structure of government itself. For everycase of reform or of outright deregulation, several examples could begiven of new regulation that is exceedingly harmful. The 1990Amendments to the Clean Air Act, for example, require that a certainnumber of vehicles in cities with dirty air run on alternative fuels,whether or not improved air quality could be had in a cheaper way.	<p>	The problems go much deeper than calls for "regulatory reform"or "reinventing government" would suggest. After all, the negativeimpact of regulation under the existing form of government is simply amild version of the ills of socialism. That is, when governmentsattempt to direct the use of resources, they are subject to two majordifficulties: (1) they are subject to perverse political pressures(what economists call "the public choice problem"); and (2) even whengovernment officials are well-intentioned, they cannot have all theinformation necessary to make efficient decisions. (This is whatAustrian economists refer to as "the knowledge problem.")<h4>Limiting Government</h4><p>	The structure of government itself must therefore be changed sothat its power to direct resources is limited or eliminated. A modestproposal would involve restoring respect for property rights under theFifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution. Prior to theGreat Depression, the U.S. Supreme Court would consider the impact thatregulation had on property owners and whether it was "essential" for a"legitimate public purpose." Under such "strict scrutiny," as the Courtcalled it, regulation was often struck down as unconstitutional.	<p>	Such a stance limited regulation's excesses. Especially after1937, however, the Court refused to interpret the Fifth and FourteenthAmendments in the same way. Now, regulation can pass constitutionalmuster without the necessity of taking the interests of property ownersinto account, unless it involves the outright confiscation of land, orunless it drives the value of the property to zero.	<p>	A more radical suggestion for constitutional change would be todeny government the power to regulate the use of property altogether.From this perspective, environmental problems could be addressed, notby restricting the rights of existing property owners, but byestablishing new property rights to the natural resources in question.If groundwater basins were converted into private property, forexample, the new property owners could sue anyone who polluted them.	<p>	In a similar vein, environmental organizations could be giventitle to members of various endangered species. For example, anornithological society could own the bald eagles in an area. If a baldeagle were shot, the society would be owed compensation, which it mightuse for, say, a breeding program. On the other hand, the society wouldbe liable if an eagle killed or maimed a lamb of a sheep ranch owner.To be sure, there would be enforcement problems, just as there areenforcement problems if a species is covered by the Endangered SpeciesAct. The main point of such changes is to reduce conflict in society.People could not legally undertake actions that would directly harm theperson or property of others unless they paid compensation.	<p>	As matters stand, opposing parties are encouraged to engage inpolitical conflict to promote their interests. A political gain to oneparty constitutes a loss for the opposing party. For example, once baldeagles have been declared an endangered species, sheep ranch ownersmust stand idly by as birds maim their lambs. The ranch owners are notentitled to compensation.	<p>	Economists are just beginning to understand why governmentshabitually fail, and they have only begun to appreciate the importanceof private property rights for the allocation of resources. Naturalresources are no exception to Jefferson's maxim: The government is bestthat governs least.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Environment-Regulation.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Its actual effect would be to reduce ourindividual freedom and move us further down what F.A. Hayek termed "theroad to serfdom."<a href="#3">[3]</a> 	<p>	<a name="4r">The legislation would amend the Robert T. StaffordDisaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act<a href="#4">[4]</a> inorder to, among other things: (1) require "disaster-prone" states toadopt a model building code and enforce this code on new construction,either directly or through their local governments and submit to theFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) a disaster mitigation plan;(2) require any new federal building <i>or building which has beenassisted by federal funds</i> to meet the new building code standards; (3)create two new federal insurance programs: (i) a primary insuranceprogram and (ii) a reinsurance program whose rates would be set byFEMA; (4) create a new natural disaster mitigation and planningadvisory panel to FEMA; and (5) require insurance companies to notifytheir policyholders of their nonparticipation in these new programs ifthe insurance company fails to participate and require insurancecompanies that participate in the current federal flood insuranceprogram to notify FEMA of policyholders living in flood plains andrequired to have flood insurance who refuse to purchase the floodcoverage.<p>	<a name="5r">Can anyone look down this list and answer "no"to the question Albert Jay Nock suggests we put to any federal program:"Does this add to the power of the state?"<a href="#5">[5]</a> There isno question that this bill further extends the arm of government intothe lives of everyone and will add to the cost of construction. Butwill it accomplish its purpose and at reasonable cost? In order toanswer this we must go back to Bastiat:<ul>	<p>In the economic sphere an act, a habit, an institution, a law	produces not only one effect, but a series of effects. Of these, the	first alone is immediate; it appears simultaneously with its	cause; it is seen. The other effects emerge only subsequently;	they are not seen; we are fortunate if we foresee them.	<p><a name="6r">There is only one difference between a bad economist	and a good one: the bad economist confines himself to the visible	effect; the good economist takes into account both the effect	that can be seen and those effects that must be foreseen.<a	href="#6">[6]</a> 	</ul><p>	As the new Act adds ten new purposes to the Stafford Act (as well as29 new definitions), we can be excused for summarizing them in order tosimplify our answer. The Act itself is really a response to the largelosses suffered in the United States in recent years due to naturaldisasters. In the past two years we have had hurricanes in Florida andHawaii, floods in the Midwest, and earthquakes and fires in California.This has led to concern that insurance companies will become insolvent,reinsurance will be unavailable, and the federal government will besaddled with huge payments for disaster relief in the face of ongoingattempts to reduce the deficit. Let us, for now, take as given the factthat the Act will mean a large intrusion of the federal government intothe building industry and the insurance industry. Will this result inimproved solvency of insurers? Promote reinsurance? Reduce exposure to(or at least reduce the cost of) natural disasters? Reduce the taxpayerburden for natural disasters? Unfortunately the answer to each of theseis "no."<h4>Solvency of Insurers</h4><p>	<a name="7r">Let us take these questions in order. Why would the Actnot improve the solvency of insurers? The answer is to be found inacknowledging that the bill is really what Gordon Tullock identified asrent-seeking behavior,<a href="#7">[7]</a> in this case of the propertycasualty insurance companies. The insurance companies are seeking toget the government (taxpayers) to share the risk of insurance againstnatural disasters. How could the insurance industry be in danger ofinsolvency from natural disasters? There is only one answer: they havebeen selling insurance at too low a premium.<p>	<a name="8r">Premiums, in a freely operating industry, willcover losses after accounting for the investment earnings of theinsurance company. If a company is selling insurance for a premiumwhich does not cover the expected loss minus the investment earnings,it will eventually go out of business. This is the discipline of themarket. As Ludwig von Mises pointed out, it is this market disciplinewhich results in efficient use of resources, insuring that the value ofthe resources used in production at least equals the value to consumersof the service or good produced with these resources.<ahref="#8">[8]</a>	<p>	What the Act will do is to allow insurance companies to sellinsurance at below-market rates, with new federal programs acting, ineffect, as the subsidizing agent. If the market is not providingreinsurance because the expected losses (the probability of theoccurrence times the loss) are not calculable, then why should weexpect that FEMA can figure out what the premiums should be? Since thisis a government program, and thus rates will be set through thepolitical process no matter what the statute says, we can expect therates to be underpriced. The net result is that insurance companieswhich would not survive the market test will continue to survive, andthus improperly price resources, and all insurance companies will takeon greater risk than they otherwise would. This must result in eitherincreased paid losses from natural disasters, and thus create just asmuch danger of insolvency for insurance companies, as it will now becheaper to locate in disaster-prone areas, or increased governmentregulation of the insurance and building industry in order to offsetthis incentive.<h4>Reinsurance</h4><p>	<a name="9r"><a name="10r">The Act surely will not promote thestrengthening of the reinsurance market. The fundamental problem, ashas been pointed out in a recent article in the Federal Reserve Bank ofCleveland's "Economic Trends," is that natural disasters arelow-frequency, high-impact events. <a href="#9">[9]</a> As such theycreate two problems for insurance. First, they are difficult to predictand thus price. Second, they are subject to "adverse selection": thosemost likely to purchase disaster insurance are the ones most likely toneed it. Persons living in the San Fernando Valley of California aremuch more likely to purchase earthquake insurance than those living inMichigan or Ohio. The people who purchase insurance will be much morelikely to suffer from a disaster than the average person.<ahref="#10">[10]</a> This complicates the insurance market becauseinsurers attempt to assemble a pool of uncorrelated risks.	<p>	<a name="11r">There also is the problem of "moral hazard": once I aminsured against an accident, I am less likely to take precautions toavoid the accident.<a href="#11">[11]</a> Is there any reason tobelieve that a federal government reinsurance program, managed by FEMA,and advised by a newly created, politically appointed board, is capableof solving these problems? Even if it could what if the actuariallysound premiums for reinsurance were so high that no one wouldparticipate? Is it likely that FEMA would stick to these premiums?Isn't it more likely that there will be political pressure to setpremiums sufficiently low to give the appearance that the problem hasbeen solved?<h4>Exposure to Natural Disasters</h4><p>	By reducing the cost of insurance, and by increasing the numberof persons who purchase insurance, the Act will result in greaterexposure to natural disasters. Suppose I have just had my housedestroyed by an earthquake around Malibu. My insurance company says,"Fine, we will pay for this damage, but there is no way we are going toget stuck again and we are not willing to provide you with furtherinsurance." I now find that I must bear the whole risk of buildinganother $2 million home in an earthquake-prone area. Am I less likelyto build my home in this area under these circumstances than if myinsurance company says: "We now participate in the new PrimaryInsurance Fund and thus can now provide you with insurance for yourhome at reasonable cost"? To ask the question is to answer it. It isobvious that reducing the cost of locating in disaster-prone areas mustdo only one thing: increase the amount and value of buildings in suchareas. When disaster does strike, as it inevitably will, then my housewill now be standing there to be destroyed.<h4>Burden on Taxpayers</h4><p>	<a name="12r">Can the Act reduce taxpayer burden for naturaldisasters? It cannot reduce the value of buildings placed indisaster-prone areas by reducing the cost of insurance. The currentgovernment policy of providing de facto insurance to everyone indisaster-prone areas makes the point. In <i>The Constitution ofLiberty</i>, Hayek warned that when the government undertakes ad hocpolicies it will inadvertently be setting a principle.<ahref="#12">[12]</a> By providing disaster relief on a regular basis,people come to expect government relief in the face of a disaster. TheAct itself is a response to the fact that reducing the risk of locatingin dangerous areas results in activity which creates greater exposure.It is an attempt to replace the de facto insurance program with anexplicit program. However, at least there was some uncertainty underthe old program. Congress might say "no" to relief, or provide minimalrelief. With the Act, this modicum of uncertainty will be eliminatedand there will be even greater reason for people to expose themselvesand their property to risk. The government will now be under legalpressure to provide the relief which it now grants simply underpolitical pressure.<p>	Is the result likely to be more taxpayer exposure, or less?People who argue that it will be less will say that persons who didn'tpurchase insurance before will purchase insurance now, because it willbe cheaper or more available. Thus, there will be less loss totaxpayers, since the premiums will go toward providing the relief. Butwith the increase in the number of persons with insurance, the adverseselection and moral hazard problems, combined with the fact thatpremiums must be set through the political process, the likely resultwill be greater taxpayer exposure in the long run. What happens whenthe federal reinsurance program comes up $25 billion short? It will, ofcourse, borrow from the Treasury under the Act. And if several hundredthousand voters who own homes are now forced to pay much higherpremiums in order to pay off this debt, will there be no politicalpressure simply to extend the length of the debt to the Treasury? Willthis not especially be the case if the debt of the reinsurance fund iscarried as an asset on the books of the federal government, and thusdoes not add to the perception of the federal debt? In the end, thedebt of the reinsurance fund will never be repaid and it will result inthe same loss to the taxpayer as if the taxpayer had directly providedrelief.	<p>	Given that there is nothing inherent in FEMA to allow it toprice disaster insurance and reinsurance more accurately and morecheaply than the market, what must happen as the exposure to disastersincreases and the premiums rise for a large group of homeowners? Thesame thing that happened when the federal government provided insurancefor deposits of savings and loans and banks: greater regulation. Theinsurance companies and homeowners will be faced with more and moregovernment control. The types of insurance required, the premiums thatmay be charged, where buildings may be placed, how they may be built,what materials must go into building them, where they can belocated--all this and more will be mandated by the federal government.The Act itself already sets up the mechanism for doing so and beginsthe process.	<p>	<a name="13r"><a name="14r">Karl Marx was certainly correct inpointing out the inevitability of the process.<a href="#13">[13]</a>Eventually, just as happened with Social Security more and more personswill be required to purchase insurance, "in order to spread the risk,"which really means in order to subsidize those who are located in themost risky areas. Required premiums, set by the federal governmentthrough FEMA, will be the way that the government indirectly taxespeople to pay for the results of the massive program that will havestarted "because catastrophic natural disasters...pose particularproblems in terms of substantial long-term consequences...andinadequate insurance and reinsurance coverage."<a href="#14">[14]</a><p>	<a name="15r">Let us admit that Hayek was right, people musttake responsibility for their own actions.<a href="#15">[15]</a> Harshas it may seem, providing de facto insurance to persons who locate indisaster-prone areas results in greater loss of life and property thanwould otherwise be the case. It took us decades to learn that ourwelfare policies have created a larger problem than they were meant tosolve. Let us admit that we must simply reduce our proclivity to rushto every disaster with "federal dollars." Before we once again embarkon a Promethean journey, let us simply admit that the problem ofnatural disasters is not too little insurance, but rather too much defacto insurance.</p><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol>	<p><a name="1"><li> H.R. 2873, 103d Congress.	<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li> See his essay, Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne	voit pas.		<a href="#2r">Return</a><p><a name="3"><li>This is the 50th anniversary of his The Road to	Serfdom, University of Chicago Press.		<a href="#3r">Return</a><p><a name="4"><li>42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.		<a href="#4r">Return</a><p><a name="5"><li>See Our Enemy, The State (Delavan, Wisc.:	Hallberg Publishing, 1935), 1983.		<a href="#5r">Return</a><p><a name="6"><li>See note 2.	<a href="#6r">Return</a><p><a name="7"><li>Professor Tullock provided the seminal treatment of	the subject in his ''The Welfare Costs of Tariffs, Monopolies.	and Theft," Western Economic Journal 5 (June 1967). pp.	224-232.		<a href="#7r">Return</a><p><a name="8"><li>See, for example. his major work, Human Action (New	Haven: Yale University Press. 1949).		<a href="#8r">Return</a><p><a name="9"><li>"The Economy in Perspective."

Kamath</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Kamath is a professor of economicsat California State University Havward.</p><hr noshade><p>	The administration of President William Jefferson Clinton wasvoted into power in 1992 by a minority of the American electorate onthe basis of its promise of "change." As a centerpiece of its platformof change, the new administration promised a "new economic paradigm," amajor tenet of which was to create a liberal trading environmentthrough strategic intervention in the process of international trade.Such strategic trade policy involved government intervention to open"closed" foreign markets (the example that was offered was Japan),government activism to serve the national interest in supporting"strategic" industries (e.g., commercial aircraft and semiconductors)and selective targeting of trading partners who were trading "unfairly"by subsidizing their exports or dumping them in the U.S. market.	<p>	In spite of the victories in Congress on the North AmericanFree Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Uruguay Round of Negotiations ofthe General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT), neither of which wasinitiated by them, the Clinton administration remains wedded to aphilosophy of managed and strategic "fair" trade as witnessed by recentconfrontations with Japan, China, India, and a host of other nations onissues ranging from the opening of "closed" markets to human rights.	<p>	The slogan of "fair" trade has regularly inflamed the passionsof the American people since the founding of the republic. Yetsuccessive presidential administrations and the majority of theAmerican people, have on balance been champions of free trade and havethereby made the U.S. the richest country in the world. As the championof multilateral free trade through the active encouragement andsustained support of the GATT, the U.S. has also been instrumental insupporting world development and making people in other free-tradingnations prosperous.	<p>	Yet, America in the eighties and early nineties has witnessedthe rise of protectionism in the form of retaliatory tariffs and otherforms of administered non-tariff barriers. Its "Japan problem" hasgiven rise to a groundswell of popular support for "managed" trade andfor punishing its partners for alleged "unfairness," even under theostensibly free-trade administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush.The Clinton administration evidences an activist strain of theprotectionist virus that has plagued the nation's movement toward freertrade, in smite of appearances to the contrary.		 <h4>Free Trade vs. "Fair" Trade</h4><p>	It is a commonplace of elementary economics that voluntary exchangecreates benefits/wealth for all parties to the exchange. When it comesto trade between nations, the same principle applies since it is onceagain individuals who are involved in these exchanges. In fact, theclassical theory of comparative advantage underlying the case for freetrade argues that such trade is good for a country even if othercountries do not return the favor.	<p>	Yet, the case for managed "fair" trade continues to be made onthe grounds that free trade results in the loss of jobs, thedeindustrialization of America, the loss of "strategic" industries to"unfair" foreign competitors, the loss of American economic leadershipand, most recently, is alleged to be the cause of global environmentalpollution and needs to be made contingent on the achievement of acommon standard of human rights. Both the logic and experience of freetrade convincingly refute each one of these claims.<h4>The "They Took Our Jobs" Myth</h4>	<p>	Trade creates jobs as economic activity expands. The experienceof the most free-trading nation on earth, Hong Kong, clearlyillustrates this point. With no natural resources, except its peopleand one of the world's finest natural harbors, but with complete freetrade, Hong Kong has witnessed an increase in its per capita incomeover twenty-five fold and an increase in employment of over twentytimes within a short span of forty years. Today, its per capita incomeis greater than that of the United Kingdom, of which it is still acolony. This stellar economic performance has been achieved while thepopulation of this largely barren island-peninsula colony increasedfrom around 300,000 to six million over this period. The experience ofthe other "tigers," Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea, is similar. Lestthese examples be considered atypical, the cases of western Europe,North America, and Japan have been similar both before and especiallyafter the two World Wars.	<p>	The common argument that is advanced in favor of "fair" trade is thattrade deficits (i.e., excesses of imports over exports) cause joblosses. While this argument reveals a lack of understanding of whattrade deficits imply in the standard system of balance of paymentsaccounting, it is pertinent to note that over 21 million new jobs wereadded between 1980 and 1990 even as the U.S. ran up huge trade deficitswith the rest of the world. And the majority of these jobs paid ratherwell, contrary to the ''McJobs" myth. Job growth was mainly in thosesectors that were largely unprotected against foreign competition suchas computers and data-processing, telecommunications, petroleum andchemicals, pharmaceuticals and health-related products scientific andphotographic equipment, banking and finance, entertainment, leisure andrecreation, hospitality and tourism, and the service professions.	<p>	Meanwhile, protectionist measures designed to "save" jobs insuch industries as automobiles have not kept employment in them fromshrinking drastically and, in fact, may have added to their troubles.The quotas (euphemistically called "voluntary" export restraints—VERs)against Japanese autos imposed by the Reagan administration in theearly eighties did not prevent the net loss of over 200,000 jobs in theU.S. auto industry.	<p>	Robert Crandall of the Brookings Institution has estimated thatthe 27,000 direct jobs that were saved in the U.S. auto-manufacturingsector cost around $160,000 per job saved (in 1984 dollars) in terms ofeconomic welfare losses in production and consumption. The VERs addedabout $2,000 to the price paid by consumers, reduced consumer choice,reduced the competitiveness and efficiency of American producers, andresulted in windfall profits for American and Japanese (and otherforeign) automobile manufacturers, leading to the shift of Japaneseauto production to luxury cars and further exacerbating Detroit's woesin this high-margin segment of the industry. Japanese transplantfactories that were set up in the U.S. in order to avoid protectionistsentiment and restraints, reduced the magnitude of the job losses inthe auto industry and the other pernicious effects of VERs.	<p>	The experience in steel, textiles, and a host of other industriessuch as dairy products, shipping, and meat-packing was similar. Theseindustries continued to shrink while protective tariffs and subsidieswere lavished on them to "save" jobs. For example, in the lateeighties, consumers spent $27 billion on textile and apparel subsidiesalone, and the cost per direct job saved was $42,000 in an industrywith an average wage of $12,000. In the protected dairy products andshipping industries the cost per job saved was estimated as $220,000and $270,000 respectively in 1987. In the carbon-steel industry for the9,000 direct jobs saved, the cost was a phenomenal $750,000 per job.The impact of these high-cost "saved" jobs is the diversion of scarceresources from other, more market-oriented industries with perhaps amuch larger number of jobs that never came into existence.	<p>	Restricting steel imports destroyed jobs. It is estimated thatin the 1980s, steel restraints protected 17,000 jobs in the wholeindustry, while they cost 54,400 jobs in steel-related industries, fora net loss of over 35,000 jobs. Higher steel costs added to the burdenof steel-using industries that were trying to compete against foreignmanufacturers. Thus, for example, expensive steel raised the cost ofbuilding cars in Detroit and promoted Japanese auto imports.<h4>The Deindustrialization Myth</h4><p>	The widespread belief that the U.S. has lost its manufacturing base inthe face of foreign competition is simply wrong. Deindustrializationnever happened. In terms of absolute output, America's manufacturinglead continues to increase, not fall. The U.S. share of total output ofOECD countries (the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment, comprising the bulk of the market-oriented industrialeconomies of the world) increased from 36 percent in 1973 to 39 percentin 1986, and its share of the industrialized world's manufacturedexports was estimated to be 18 percent, the same as in 1980, and aheadof Japan's current 17 percent share. Moreover, the absoluteproductivity level of U.S. labor in general, and manufacturing labor inparticular, continues to be the highest in the world. Americanmanufacturing productivity increased at the fastest pace among the OECDnations in the eighties. The U.S. share of OECD manufacturingemployment also increased from 24 percent in 1962 to 28 percent in1985, while the share of countries like France, Germany, and the UnitedKingdom fell.	<p>	If rising incomes and technological innovation raise the demandfor services instead of manufactured goods, economic and socialsurvival require that such services be supplied. The decline in theU.S. of the share of manufacturing in total output and employment hasbeen the result of relatively fast productivity growth in manufacturingand an increase in the demand for services as compared to manufacturedgoods. The result has been very similar to what happened to theAmerican agricultural sector in the early part of thecentury--unprecedented gains in agricultural productivity and a risingdemand for manufactured goods led to a decline in the share of outputand employment in agriculture. This "deagriculturalization" was notonly desirable, given the shifts in demand and productivity, it alsooccurred amidst a period of rising trade surpluses in agriculturalproducts. In any case, many of the countries with some of the higheststandards of living in the world today specialize in the provision ofservices.<h4>The Industrial Policy Myth</h4><p>	Another common complaint against free trade and argument for"fair" trade is that other countries, most especially Japan, aretargeting and subsidizing "strategic" industries for takeover andultimate market domination. The argument is that the U.S. governmentshould create a "level playing field" with countervailing tariffs, orsubsidies and industrial policy. Once again, the logic and evidence ofactual trade belies this view.	<p>	The logic of "strategic" targeting and industrial policy requiresthat government officials possess vast amounts of information about thefuture and be able to outguess private entrepreneurs with money atstake. This is, as F.A. Hayek taught us, impossible because of theknowledge problem involved in collecting vast amounts of dispersedknowledge in order to predict successfully an unknowable future.Communist nations suffered from the fatal conceit that governmentplanners could perform such impossible feats before theirill-constructed policies eventually collapsed.	<p>	Secondly, strategic targeting, even if possible, would lead toa cycle of retaliation and counter-retaliation which would ultimatelymake everyone worse off. The results of the infamous Smoot-Hawleytariff in the early thirties illustrate the point. Escalating subsidiesand industrial policies will distort the price signals essential forthe functioning of a dynamic economy, leading to unintendedconsequences that are worse than the original alleged disease.	<p>	The United Kingdom suffered from the disastrous consequences ofits post-war protectionist and interventionist industrial and laborpolicies. It was the "sick man" of Europe until free-market policies inthe eighties restored some of its economic dynamism.	<p>	Japan is presented as an example of successful strategic targetingand industrial policy. Yet the actual evidence seriously questions thisalleged success. If Japanese strategic targeting had been successful,the original company that later became Sony would have nevermass-produced the transistor radio and, in fact, the present-day SonyCorporation may have never come into existence. Similarly, Mr.Shoichiro Honda would have never manufactured Hondas if he had takenthe Japanese government's advice.	<p>	While some Japanese industries clearly capitalized on theopportunities provided by government subsidies, low-interest loans, andimport protection, a large number of targeted industries simply did notdo well, or actually became inefficient and/or failed. These includethe highly protected and inefficient agricultural industry; the heavilysubsidized and low-interest loan-financed coal mining, petroleumrefining, and petrochemical industries; the protected and politicallymollycoddled wholesale and retail distribution industries; the largelyunsuccessful and government-assisted aerospace and large commercialaircraft companies; and the government-supported shipbuilding industrywhich, after an initially successful period in the late sixties andearly seventies, ran into heavy weather and had to downsize massivelyin the late seventies and early eighties. Japan's most successful andinternationally competitive industries such as the automobile andconsumer electronics industries have enjoyed practically no specialgovernment favors. The industrially targeted steel industry actuallyyielded below-market returns and has been judged by sophisticatedanalysts as an example of unsuccessful targeting.	<p>	What industrial policies and protection did do was to keep theJapanese standard of living lower than what it otherwise would havebeen. In 1988, the Japanese standard of living, adjusted by purchasingpower exchange rates, was estimated to be around 72 percent of theAmerican standard of living. Most of the improvement of its standard ofliving has occurred in the last fifteen years as it has dropped itstariff and non-tariff barriers.<h4>The Japanese "Unfair" Trade Myth</h4><p>	Another common myth about "fair" trade is that Japan severelyrestricts imports. In fact, Japan's formal and informal trade barriersare lower than those in the U.S. and other industrial countries. Forexample, Japan's average tariff on industrial products was 2.9 percentin 1981 as compared to 4.3 percent in the U.S and 5.8 percent in theEC. Non-tariff barriers such as quotas, licenses, and VERs in Japanwere found by a World Bank study to be no different than those in theUnited States, with the Japanese using more non-tariff barriers toprotect agriculture, while the U.S. protects more of its manufacturesin this fashion.	<p>	Japan was the world's third largest importer in 1990, taking in$235 billion worth of goods and services, imports that were almost aslarge as the GNP of India and larger than the GNP of Sweden. Japaneseimports grew by almost 85 percent since 1985. In terms of imports perperson, Japan imported $1,900 compared with $2,050 for the U.S. Yet,the typical Japanese person spent more on American products than viceversa $372 in 1990 as against $357 for the United States. Over the1986-91 period U.S. exports increased by 91 percent, while Japan'sexports grew by around 17 percent and the average OECD growth wasaround 25 percent. U.S. exports to Japan during this period wereespecially strong, doubling to $46.1 billion by the end of 1990. Thegrowth of U.S. exports was strongest in the manufacturing sector.	<p>	Sophisticated econometric analyses by a number of serious andscholarly analysts such as Gary Saxonhouse of the University ofMichigan, Ed Leamer of UCLA, and T.N. Srinivasan of Yale and KoichiHamada have shown that Japan does not "under-import" (as unmeasurableand illogical as that concept may seem) as a number of trade"revisionists" such as Clyde Prestowitz and James Fallows havecontended. In fact, they have shown that Japan's total imports andimports of manufactures are well within the margins of what would beexpected for a country with its natural resource endowments anddemographic characteristics.	<p>	In fact, it can equally well be argued that it is the U.S. which isthe unfair trader. In his book, <i>The Fair Trade Fraud</i>, James Bovard hasdocumented that the U.S. has over 8,000 tariffs, 3,000 clothing andtextile import quotas, and a variety of quotas and other non-tariffbarriers for steel, autos, sugar, dairy, peanut, cotton, beef, machinetools, and other industrial products. Bovard estimates that these tradebarriers cost U.S. consumers $80 billion on an annual basis, or morethan $1,200 per family per year.<h4>The Cleaner Environment Myth</h4>	<p>	A more recent argument for managing trade has been raised byenvironmentalists. According to them, free trade will lead to greaterpollution as production expands in the trading countries. Therefore,only environmentally "safe" industries should be allowed in the newlyindustrializing countries, or trade policy should be linked to toughenvironmental pollution control laws in the developing countries.	<p>	The greatest cause of human misery in the underdeveloped nations ispoverty. Free trade and free markets are the only viable way to achievesustained growth and alleviation of this poverty. Restricting trade orslowing growth for environmental reasons will continue and perpetuatehuman misery in these nations. The existence of the knowledge problemimplies planners cannot know enough to achieve "environmentallyresponsible" managed trade and economic growth.	<p>	In fact, if the economic development of the industrialized countriesis any guide, free trade and free market policies will most likely leadto a cleaner environment. Julian Simon and others have shown howeconomic development in the context of a free market, private propertyrights economy has inevitably led to a cleaner environment whilesimultaneously alleviating poverty.	<p>	A recent report published by GATT shows that since the richercountries pollute less, and trade makes countries richer, protection ormanaged trade is likely to cause more, not less, pollution. Forexample, Princeton economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger have shownthat air pollution in cities rises with national per capita income toaround $5,000, but then falls as income increases further. Trade alsohelps cleaner technologies to spread.<h4>The Strategic Trade Policy Myth</h4><p>	A major influence on the thrust toward managed trade is the presenceof "strategic traders" in its ranks. Recent research in the field ofinternational economics has given rise to what is called strategictrade theory where some of the world's leading trade theorists haveshown that under certain stylized circumstances (for example, where asingle national firm is in combat with a single other-country rivalsay, like Boeing and Airbus in the commercial aircraft industry),strategic support (for example, with a subsidy) of a domestic industryagainst its foreign competitor can be in the national interest andprovide it with a "strategic advantage." Such arguments have beenseized upon by the strategic traders, a group of public policyentrepreneurs and journalists, as evidence of a fatal weakness in thetheory of comparative advantage and the case for free trade. Nothingcould be further from the truth.	<p>	There are many good reasons for rejecting the temptation to implementstrategic trade theory. The most important reason is that the knowledgeproblem makes it impossible to identify which industries to encourage.In any case, targeting one industry with a subsidy will draw awayscarce resources from others so that strategic trade policy on behalfof one industry is simultaneously strategic trade policy against otherindustries. With the likelihood of government policy failure being veryhigh due to the knowledge problem and a host of other problems (calledproblems of "public choice" by economists), strategic tradeintervention is likely to prove most detrimental to the economy.	<p>	Secondly, real-life competition in most industries is unlikethat depicted in stylized strategic trade models. Seldom is onenational industry "champion" pitted against another solitary rival(even in the Boeing-Airbus case the analogy is seriously flawed), andwhen there are more than two rivals the outcomes are likely to be morevaried and run counter to the desires of the strategic policy maker.	<p>	Thirdly, the basic premise of the strategic traders and thecompetitiveness advocates is patently false. Strategic traders portraynations as being like giant corporations with monopoly power pitted inmortal combat with each other. President Clinton himself hascharacterized nations as "big corporations competing in the globalmarketplace." This leads to ill-founded fretting about the"competitiveness" of a nation.	<p>	Not only is the concept of the competitiveness of a nation difficultto define, there is no equivalent counterpart to the one indicator ofthe competitiveness of a corporation--its bottom line in terms ofprofit or loss. When we say that a corporation is uncompetitive, wemean that it is making a loss and that, if it does not improve itsmarket position in terms of profit (or cash flow), it will cease toexist. No such statement can be made about a nation's competitivenesssince it does not have a definable bottom line and does not go out ofbusiness (the trade balance is clearly inadequate and inappropriatesince countries running trade deficits often are attracting huge sumsof foreign investment as did the U.S. in the last decades of thenineteenth and early decades of the twentieth century and as Mexico hasdone in recent years).	<p>	Countries also do not compete with each other like corporationssince international trade is not a zero-sum game. While IBM and Hitachitend to be successful at each other's expense in the same market asthey wrestle for market share, countries normally comprise each others'export and import markets. This means that if China is successful inexporting a large amount of goods to the U.S., it simultaneouslybecomes a large market for U.S. goods. The gains from internationaltrade and specialization accrue to both nations unlike the case of IBMand Hitachi competing for market share.<h4>Human Rights</h4><p>	The most recent argument for managed "fair" trade has focused onthe issue of human rights and workers' rights in developing countries.The Clinton Administration has threatened countries like China with theloss of most favored nation (MFN) status for its human rights record,and a host of other countries such as India, Indonesia, Brazil, andThailand have been placed under "super 301" (named for Section 301 ofthe U.S. Trade Act of 1974) sanctions for these and other reasons.	<p>	Free trade has been a powerful force for the establishment ofhuman rights and workers' rights the world over. It is no accident thathuman rights and workers' rights have been and continue to be violatedroutinely in countries which do not participate in a major way ininternational trade. Even if international trade has not alwaysresulted in the quick establishment of human rights, it is neverthelessa bad idea to use international trade as a political lever.	<p>	The argument for using trade as a weapon to enforce a uniformhuman rights standard can very quickly become the thin edge of a wedgeto demand "fairness" in trade for favored domestic industries andpressure groups by the imposition of sanctions, embargoes andprotectionist measures. This could very well degenerate into aname-calling "beggar-thy-partner" trade dispute. Looking for policy,institutional, and moral differences as sources of unfair trade iscontrary to rule-based trade regimes such as GATT. It results inchallenging every policy in the name of "fair" trade, making managedtrade inevitable and putting bureaucrats and politicians in charge of ahighly politicized trade regime.	<p>	It is very easy to see disputes about workers' rights degeneratinginto the prevention of trade on the basis of genuine comparativeadvantage such as lower wage labor. There are many who regard it as"unfair" for Mexican or Chinese workers to be paid a fraction of thewages of American workers and call for tariffs or trade barriers toredress the balance. Such arguments are very easily extended to"working conditions" and other labor costs. They are destructive to theaspirations of developing nations since they deny the basis forcomparative advantage for these nations. Moreover, the call forworkers' rights is often only a thinly disguised call for universalunionization of labor.<h4>Globalization</h4><p>	The strongest argument against managed "fair" trade is the reality ofthe existence of globally integrated multinational corporations likeIBM, AT&T, and Procter & Gamble, and the interdependence of theinhabitants of our "global village." It is estimated that over fortypercent of world trade is carried out by over 2,000 multinationalcorporations that do not have a national identity and that produce anddistribute through a globally-integrated operational network. Anyattempt to impose "fair" trade on ostensibly "foreign" competitorsthrough countervailing measures such as anti-dumping duties is morethan likely to end up hurting ostensibly "domestic" corporations. Thishas been the experience with U.S. Section 301 sanctions against foreigncountries and trade agreements such as the semiconductor agreement,which resulted in injury to "domestic" corporations like IBM, DEC,Apple, and so on.	<p>	The comedy of the recent "buy American" campaigns that precededand followed the 1992 presidential election illustrates the futility ofnational policies and efforts to protect "us" from "them" in the faceof this globally interlinked trade. Today, anyone wishing to "buyAmerican" may have to purchase a car with a nameplate like Honda orMazda rather than Chevrolet, Dodge. Ford, or Pontiac. Some of Leelacocca's much touted new line of American-built cars such as theIntrepid are not even built in the U.S.—they are built in Canada.<h4>In Conclusion</h4><p>	Logic and hard evidence dictate that we resist the siren song of"fair" trade if we wish to maintain and enhance our standard of livingin an interdependent world. Free trade is still the best option forpromoting American prosperity in spite of our current problems and theexhortations of our politicians. Managed "fair" trade can only lead tocostly mistakes and policy errors and an ever-escalating cycle ofretaliation and counter-retaliation putting our world trading systemand our futures at risk. Our economic and social future depends on keeping our borders open and thegoods and services flowing!</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Managed-Trade.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Saltzman</h4></center><hr><p>Mr. Saltzman teaches American literature and publicspeaking at St. John's School, Houston, Texas.</p><p>He is chairman of the Houston PropertyRights Association speakers bureau</p><hr noshade><p>	"Zoning goes down for third time" read the morning headline of<i>The Houston Post</i> last November 3. As they had in 1948 and 1962,Houstonians voted once more to remain America's largest city without azoning ordinance.<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	"We've got to stop the cancerous erosion of the quality of lifein many of our neighborhoods. Those people are crying out for help.Zoning is the answer," said the president of the Houston Homeowner'sAssociation last August.<a href="#1">[1]</a></p><p><a name="2r"><a name="3r"></p><p>	Yet, the vast majority of Houstonians were not cryingout for zoning. Hispanics and low-income blacks voted overwhelmingly,58 percent and 71 percent, against a measure touted as the way to"save" their neighborhoods.<a href="#2">[2]</a> In a low-turnoutreferendum, only 10 percent<a href="#3">[3]</a> of the city'sregistered voters gave their nod to zoning, disproving the pro-zoners'claim of widespread discontent among Houstonians with their"under-regulated" land market.</p><p>	In fact, with 17 separate land-use ordinances covering thingsso specific as trailer parks, rendering plants, and commerciallandscaping, property in Houston is not exactly "under-regulated."However, the evidence from this debate in Houston highlights theadvantages of a large city that relies more than any other in Americaon the market to determine land use.<h4>Exaggerated Risks</h4><p>	With zoning, a city can regulate the location and design of allland uses, from houses to gas stations to bars. Its supporters saidthat homes unprotected by zoning risk a loss in property value if abusiness or apartment locates nearby.<p>	Not necessarily. Drive around central Houston and you'll findplenty of expensive new houses built across the street from or adjacentto existing commercial or apartment buildings. The people who build andbuy these homes are not dumb. There is obviously a strong market forhomes in convenient urban settings.<p><a name="4r"><a name="5r"></p><p>	This casts doubt on the need for zoning to protect or boostproperty values. Within Houston are two small, independent cities,Bellaire and West University, with zoning. Between 1970 and 1980 homeprices in Bellaire and West University climbed more slowly than in manyHouston communities, including those lacking private neighborhoodrestrictions against businesses and apartments.<a href="#4">[4]</a> Infact, between 1990 and 1993, average annual home sale prices actuallyfell in the two zoned cities while sprinting up in a number of Houstonneighborhoods, restricted and unrestricted.<a href="#5">[5]</a> Thefinancial risks to homes unshielded by zoning are, at best, greatlyoverstated.<p><a name="6r"></p><p>	Another exaggeration is that single-family neighborhoods withoutzoning are likely to be overrun by businesses and apartments. In theHouston Heights, a century-old neighborhood of 300 blocks, only about 5percent of the residential blocks have private restrictions.<ahref="#6">[6]</a> Also, a Prohibition-era law left over in the Heightsbans liquor sales. Those are the only controls on property in theHeights for the last 100 years, apart from city codes. <p><a name="7r"><a name="8r"></p><p>	Yet single-family homes occupy almost 86 percent of the lotson interior streets. Businesses take up 7 percent; industrial uses,less than 2 percent; apartments, less than 2 percent; churches andschools, 4 percent.<a href="#7">[7]</a> Similar distributions in landuse have been documented for other unrestricted inner-cityneighborhoods.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Why does this happen?<p><a name="9r"></p><p>	In Houston land uses tend to segregate themselves as investorsrespond to market incentives. Under the Houston system, heavy industryvoluntarily locates on large tracts near rail lines or highways;apartments and stores seek thoroughfares; gas stations vie for busyintersections.<a href="#9">[9]</a><p>	With the market at work there's no need for government-imposeddistricting. Businesses that open inside quiet residentialneighborhoods will compete poorly with establishments that enjoy thevisibility and traffic count of a heavily traveled street. Businessesthat thrive amidst homes often serve strong local demand.<p>	"Shade-tree" mechanics appear in low-income neighborhoods to serviceold cars owners cannot afford to replace. "Mom and pop" grocery storessupply those who have no cars. In Houston's West End, an area with alarge population of artists, stylish and expensive townhomes existbeside framing factories and studios. Around Houston, such mutuallybeneficial mixtures of commercial and residential uses reflect themarket's sensitivity to consumer needs, a sensitivity unimpeded by thetastes of politicians and bureaucrats.<p><a name="10r"></p><p>	Pro-zoning fears ignore the self-regulating qualities of the market.In locations with stable demand for single-family homes, healthy realestate values are likely to prohibit many "noxious" uses like junkyardsand machine repair shops that want cheap land. Without realizing it,the homeowners have "zoned out" such uses through their own freechoices. As zoning expert Bernard Siegan says, "the most effective ofrestrictions [is] competition."<a href="#10">[10]</a><h4>Self-Buffering</h4><p>	Since the market creates predictability in land use, anyone canbuffer himself according to his own standards from uses he dislikes. Hecan pursue his own notions about quality of life without the localgovernment imposing its version on him.	<p><a name="11r"></p><p>	People who like proximity to retail services can live on ornear heavily traveled streets and assume the risk of facing more noiseand traffic than individuals who seek the peace and quiet of aninterior residential street. The need to keep bars away from residentsis a frequent justification for zoning, but one Houstonian said helikes living near a bar because "patrons to establishments andpedestrian traffic are deterrents to crime."<a href="#11">[11]</a> InHouston, to each his own.<p><a name="12r"></p><p>	Even without zoning, home buyers wanting control over thedevelopment of land in their neighborhood have a choice called "deedrestrictions." Usually, these deed restrictions are initiated by anoriginal developer to cover all property purchased in a subdivision for25 or 30 years. Restrictions are often renewable after that period, andmost homes in Houston built since World War II have such renewablerestrictions.<a href="#12">[12]</a> Enforceable by civic associationswith help from the city, the document can prevent businesses orapartments from entering the neighborhood. It can even requireresidents to keep their lawns manicured or their homes painted onlycertain colors. However detailed, deed restrictions contain rulesvoluntarily accepted by home buyers, unlike the edicts issued toproperty owners by a zoning commission<p>	Predictably, zoning proponents criticize deed restrictions fornot providing air-tight protection against mixed uses. Restrictions endat subdivision boundaries, leaving residents at the neighborhood's edgepossibly unbuffered from an apartment or business. Zoning supporterswant guarantees of protection that neither deed restrictions nor themarket's natural separation of land uses can provide.<p><a name="13r"></p><p>	But are such guarantees possible, even under zoning? In FortWorth and Dallas, two zoned cities, one can notice an eight-storyoffice building overshadowing nearby homes, a high-density apartmentcomplex and a shopping center across a narrow street from homes, and ajunk dealer and a tire store next door to homes. Even in tightly zonedcentral Connecticut, one can find a factory right beside a home, a newsupermarket being built next to homes, and a bar across the street fromhomes all mixes routinely denounced as "incompatible" by zoningadvocates in Houston.<a href="#13">[13]</a><p><a name="14r"></p><p>	In land-use patterns and in the predictability of those patterns,Houston and zoned central cities are more similar than pro-zonersadmit.<a href="#14">[14]</a> The difference is that Houstoniansinternalize risks (quite successfully) that zoning attempts to controlelsewhere by managing the property rights of citizens.<h4>The Houston Advantage</h4><p><a name="15r"></p><p>	That's the Houston advantage: private property rights. True,Houston has many strict ordinances, but without zoning, citizens inHouston maintain over their property much of the control that othercities give to local government. Zoning dramatically increases theopportunity for public officials to manipulate private property formaximum political benefit and "impose costs on others at no cost tothemselves,"<a href="#15">[15]</a> writes economist Thomas Sowell.Under zoning, local goods and services reflect regulatory costsHoustonians avoid.<p><a name="16r"><a name="17r"><a name="18r"></p><p>	One such good is housing. Without zoning, Houston ranksconsistently as the leader among major American cities for housingaffordability. "It's more affordable here than any other large city inthe nation," said University of Houston economist Barton Smith.<ahref="#16">[16]</a> According to Smith, one reason for thisaffordability is Houston's lack of zoning.<a href="#17">[17]</a> And afederal report in 1991 cited zoning as a leading cause for the shortageof affordable housing in America.<a href="#18">[18]</a> How does zoningpush up the cost of housing?<p><a name="19r"><a name="20r"><a name="21r"></p><p>	The proposed Houston zoning plan showed how. It contained densitycontrols that would have forced higher rents for many new apartmentsand higher prices for many new townhouses.<a href="#19">[19]</a> In onecase, a planning commissioner effectively froze the renovation of alow-income apartment building by having it zoned into a district justfor single family homes. In this way, the structure became a"non-conforming" use, discouraging lenders from risking money on theproject.<a href="#20">[20]</a> In the long run, zoning increases thecost of housing by restricting its supply. Ironically, zoning makessuch bad policy a predictable choice for municipal authorities becausethey are sensitive to the desire of politically influential homeownersto limit development near their neighborhoods.<a href="#21">[21]</a> Inunzoned Houston, developers can adjust the number of dwelling units perlot to suit consumer demand, not the agendas of zoning insiders.<p>	Zoning proponents say they just want bargaining power with adeveloper of land near homes. Ideally, they argue, a compromise on useor design could be struck that would create a "win-win" situation foreveryone.<p><a name="22r"></p><p>	Well, not exactly everyone. Concessions to build fewer dwellingunits in an apartment could raise rents there, pricing some individualsout of the complex. And the likelihood of construction delays fosteredby zoning procedures and squabbles will price some builders out oftheir market as well. For example, according to one journalist, zoningand related land-use regulations have boosted the cost of developmentin Austin, Texas: "Problems whether they involve neighborhoodopposition, new ordinances, unclear policies or moratoriums mean delaysand delays cost money."<a href="#22">[22]</a> The interests of the mostvulnerable consumers and producers are protected by secure privateproperty rights, not by zoning.<p>	Such rights also provide Houston with employment opportunitiesthat zoning would have removed. One case involved Forged VesselConnections, a manufacturer of special parts for pressure vessels. Thecompany has been in its location in the largely black community ofAcres Homes for the last 17 years and employs residents from thesurrounding neighborhood. But the plant was zoned into a residentialdistrict, meaning the building could not expand, meaning the end ofplans to add 35 new jobs by 1996.<p>	In unzoned Houston home businesses are common and operate relativelyfreely wherever they are not prohibited by deed restrictions. But thezoning plan had a different approach:<p><a name="23r"><a name="24r"><a name="25rnn"></p><p>	No employees on site except residents. No signs. No parkingspaces for customers. No external evidence of commercial activity.<ahref="#23">[23]</a> For Houstonians, a taste of the regulation plaguinghome businesses in 90 percent of American cities.<a href="#24">[24]</a>And the Houston Homeowner's Association, a leading pro-zoning interest,assured its members that there was no reason why home business"standards have to be limited to these prohibitions,"<ahref="#25">[25]</a> suggesting that more rules could be added later.<p>	Zoning would have created undue hardship for many entrepreneurs. Forexample, one single mother started a telephone answering service in herown home, hiring other women from the neighborhood for help. Zoningwould have forced her to fire her employees or rent office space. Shemight have applied for an exemption and prayed that her aspirationssuited her neighbors and city officials. This scenario offends theprinciple that the opportunity to use private property for employmentis a right, not just a favor granted by local government.<p>	The greatest beneficiaries of Houston's abstention from zoningare not the rich, greedy developers as zoning proponents would claim.Big developers in zoned areas enjoy the reduced competition brought byzoning and can afford the lawyers and other consultants needed toacquire variances from zoning rules. Those who have the most to gainfrom the free exercise of rights to private property are the unemployedand the poor, those who can least afford the costs of regulation.<p><a name="26r"><a name="27r"></p><p>	Examples occurred during the 1980s when Houston lost 250,000jobs<a href="#26">[26]</a> during the "oil crash." As one Houstonreporter recalls: "Because there were a handful of neighborhoods wherethere were no significant barriers to home businesses, the bust becamean opportunity instead of a devastation. Time and time again I saw theunemployed become entrepreneurs.<a href="#27">[27]</a> Time and timeagain in Houston's Hispanic neighborhoods entrepreneurs also emergefrom homes.<p>	Affordable housing near retail services, home businesses unhinderedby excessive regulation--these are the blessings, not cancers, of acity in which the people determine the use of their property.<p><a name="28r"></p><p>	If anything, the presence of zoning, not the lack of it, canbe cancerous to an old neighborhood. Real estate economist Jack Harrisexplains that, "zoning causes problems in transitional neighborhoods.Although the market may indicate the need for change in land use,zoning attempts to prohibit change."<a href="#28">[28]</a> Harris issaying that the market is smarter than bureaucrats and politicians.Unfettered by the realities of the marketplace, they may attempt to"improve" or "preserve' a neighborhood by zoning out most businessesand apartments, as if declining communities can be economically revivedjust by legislating non-existent demand for single-family homes.<p>	A free market in land use does not guarantee neighborhoodrevitalization. But letting people decide what to do with theirproperty can assist the recycling of land, especially when commercialor multi-family construction may capture the only viability aneighborhood has.<p><a name="29r"></p><p>	In the end, zoning restrictions only inspire their circumvention. Aspeculator will purchase tightly zoned properties for theirartificially deflated price and then turn a hefty profit by negotiatingwith the proper officials for a less restrictive classification.<ahref="#29">[29]</a> Such a scheme favors those with political clout. Atleast without zoning, larger benefits go to the original propertyowners, who can sell their land at its actual market price. Either way,market forces prevail. Zoning just slows them down and makes themcostlier.<p><a name="30r"></p><p>	But zoning makes intolerance less costly. Some pro-zoners demandedthe separation of houses from low-income apartments. "These ramshacklecomplexes contain hundreds of people of minimal educational andeconomic attainment, with value systems completely foreign to themajority of homeowners,"<a href="#30">[30]</a> complained the vicepresident of the Committee to Zone the City in August of 1990. In otherwords, it is not just the wrong kind of land uses that are"incompatible" with homes but the wrong kind of people as well. Suchefforts to exclude the poor cannot prevail where the property rights oflandlords and developers are secure.<h4>Moral Costs</h4><p>	Zoning makes business activities and housing more expensive, butthe greater cost of zoning is moral. In essence, zoning grants a cadreof public officials and favored private citizens the free exercise ofstate power to force their designs on the use of someone else'sproperty. This process trivializes the individual's basic right toself-determination. By voting down zoning, Houstonians havestrengthened their claim to that right.</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li> "Is Your Neighborhood Next?", political	advertisement, Citizens for Zoning,		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>Karen Weintraub, "Zoning goes down for third time,"	The Houston Post, p.

Whether that istrue or not, upon close examination it often turns out to be quitedifferent in crucial respects than we had previously believed. Considerthe theory of externalities, in which a distinction is made between thesocial costs and private costs of human actions and transactions.Normally, the voluntary trades that characterize production andexchange activities in market economies are mutually beneficial to theparties involved a priori because each exchanges something they wantcomparatively less for something they want comparatively more. Eachbears the private costs of his actions generated by alternate usesforgone in the decision to use the resources employed in the way thatthey were. A meaningful difference between the social costs generatedby these actions and the private costs exists, however, when<i>unintended</i> costs (often termed <i>external</i> costs) areimposed on third parties. In such cases, too many resources will beemployed in the industry or activity involved, because only the privatecosts and benefits are being considered by the parties generating theexternalities, and the private costs are by definition less than thetrue social costs.	<p>	The quintessential examples are air and water pollution, whichaffect the environment adversely and often pose human health hazards.It has come to be accepted by many economists that in such cases thegovernment is justified in imposing some sort of coercive regulatorypolicy to reduce the external costs generated and to obtain a morecorrect resource use. Other observers--including many leaders of theenvironmental movement--extend this logic to a more radical conclusion.They believe that pollution and waste are so pervasive and threateningthat government must either socialize the economy, taking full controlof industry to end pollution, or force an end toindustrial/technological market society itself in order to save thehuman race.	<p>	A variety of arguments can be marshaled in opposition to theseviews. First, solutions more consistent with the maintenance of a freesociety, such as specification of private property rights (sinceexternalities are a common-property problem) and tort law (in whichthose harmed sue for compensation) can often be applied to solve orreduce externality problems.	<p>	Second, industry and technology--in the forms of such things asmedicine and sewage, and water treatment--have often been intentionallyemployed to <i>improve</i> human health.<a href="#1">[1]</a> Indeed, as measured by mean lifeexpectancy-the single best summary indicator of environmental risksfaced by human beings--people face fewer such risks now than everbefore in human history, and do so as a direct result of technical andeconomic progress in the market economy.		<p>	Third, the whole externality effects of industrial market societyare being mischaracterized. As industry and technology develop, someforms of pollution are generated and others are <i>eliminated</i>. Theelectric stove largely ended the breathing of wood smoke in the home.The automobile ended the scourge of horse manure in cities, which wouldotherwise constitute a terrible source of pollution and a public healththreat. As an inherent element of technological development, firms haveprogressively discovered and employed more and more efficient sourcesof fuel and power generation in order to reduce costs under competitivemarket pressures. This caused pollution per unit of output generated todecline steadily long before the EPA and the 1970 Clean Air Act werecreated. Indeed, according to economist Paul MacAvoy, there is noevidence that those regulatory mechanisms improved on that record.<ahref="#2">[2]</a>	<p>	A closely related point constitutes the central argument of thispaper. While it is true that market activities often generateexternalities and new technologies often have unintended side effects,<i>nobody has ever offered a convincing reason why such external effectsshould more frequently be detrimental than beneficial</i>. Creation of theautomobile generated traffic and mobility problems that Henry Ford andother developers of the technology never foresaw, but it alsoeliminated local monopolies and monopsonies by integrating markets (aswell as eliminating horse manure pollution), which was also no part oftheir intent. Environmental ideology, however, and the regulatorypolicy it drives, are biased toward finding the detrimental sideeffects of market industrial activity, and ignoring ormischaracterizing the beneficial effects. The example of industrialCO<sub>2</sub> emission is striking. 		<p>	Carbon dioxide is quantitatively the largest singleemission of free market industrial/technological society, and over timethese emissions have begun to add substantially to atmosphericCO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Automobiles contribute heavily byemitting carbon monoxide, which is unstable and quickly mixes withatmospheric oxygen to form carbon dioxide. Most economists and allenvironmentalists treat CO<sub>2</sub> as an unqualified pollutant;that is, a substance which generates only external costs. As one of theprimary greenhouse gases, industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emission is accusedof being a primary factor generating global warming, that is, raisinglower atmospheric temperatures over time. Such rising temperatures areasserted to be eventually capable of melting the ice caps and causingdeserts to expand, threatening disastrous loss of land area andincreasing famine. Consequently, the argument goes, massive governmentcontrols and interventions must be employed to reduce industrialCO<sub>2</sub> emission. 		<p>	Actually, the evidence that global warming is even occurring, muchless that human CO<sub>2</sub> emission is generating such warming isvery weak. Most ground station atmospheric temperature time series showno warming in the last forty or fifty years, though one data seriesdoes show a very slight temperature rise.<a href="#3">[3]</a> Tyros Nsatellites, in orbit since 1979, may eventually settle the matter. Theyuse an extremely sensitive system of microwave radiometers to measurelower atmospheric temperature. The satellite observations cover a largearea at a time (a circular "footprint" 110 km in diameter) and are notrestricted to land, as are most surface based temperature recordingsystems. Over this period in which, by global warming theory,temperatures should have risen more rapidly than ever before in humanhistory, since industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emission has been larger thanever before, the satellite data show no upward trend in globaltemperature <i>at all</i>.<a href="#4">[4]</a><p>	If the effect of industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emission on loweratmospheric temperature is obscure and debatable, however, certainother effects are not, or at least should not be. CO<sub>2</sub> is theprimary nutrient that plants use in transforming sunlight into plantmatter (carbohydrates) through photosynthesis. That is, plants<i>grow</i> by transforming CO<sub>2</sub>, other nutrients, andsunlight into plant matter. For various natural reasons, many of whichare unknown, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration has varied widelyover the earth's history. The last Ice Age seems to have reduced theCO<sub>2</sub> level far below concentrations existing in earlierhistoric periods. Indeed, it may have reached a level within 100 partsper million (PPM) of being too low to sustain life on earth.<ahref="#5">[5]</a><p>	The significance of this is that industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissionis correcting what is, in terms of the Earth's geological andecological history, an imbalance of atmospheric CO2 on the low side. Inparticular, as Sylvan Wittwer, Professor Emeritus of Horticulture atMichigan State University explains, at current atmosphericconcentrations (about 365 PPM), CO<sub>2</sub> is the <i>limiting</i>nutrient in plant growth, the one plants cannot obtain in adequateamounts. Increasing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration<i>increases</i> plant growth. Wittwer explains that it also makesplants healthier and tends to benefit common food plants more than itdoes common weeds.<a href="#6">[6]</a> The beneficial effects ofCO<sub>2</sub> are well established in the scientific literature, andthe knowledge is so common in some circles that nursery owners havebeen deliberately enriching the CO<sub>2</sub> content of theatmospheres in greenhouses to as much as 1,000 PPM for decades.	<p>	In economic terminology, the point is that, at current atmosphericconcentrations, industrial enrichment of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> hasa positive marginal product for plant growth. Many hundreds ofscientific experiments have been conducted to determine CO<sub>2</sub>productivity effects on particular plants, which often yield startlingresults. Recently, for example, Sherwood Idso, a well known soilphysicist at the U.S. Water Conservation Laboratory in Phoenix,Arizona, planted two groups of orange trees in the ground in identicalsoil and climate conditions. In similar experiments the plants areusually grown in laboratory pots, so Idso's experiment more closelyapproximated real world conditions. Then he enriched the atmosphericCO<sub>2</sub> content around the second group of trees by 75 percentand observed the two groups over time. Trees in the CO<sub>2</sub>enriched group bore fruit a year earlier than the control group, andafter three years were 2.8 times as large on average. Their fruityields were enormously larger, and by every measure of plant vitalitythey exceeded the control group.<a href="#7">[7]</a><h4>A Greener World?</h4>	<p>	Evidence is accumulating that industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emissionis increasing plant growth around the world. For example, scientists atthe Finnish Research Institute, in a recent study of European forests,discovered that there had been a 25 to 30 percent increase in thegrowth and growing stock of those forests between 1971 and 1990, whichthey attribute at least partly to the increase in atmosphericCO<sub>2</sub> over the period.<a href="#8">[8]</a> They stronglyhinted that this process is probably operating world wide. Other dataindicate so. At Mauna Loa recording station in Hawaii, scientistsmeasure the amplitude of the oscillation in atmospheric CO2concentration between summer, after spring plant growth has reduced theconcentration, and winter, after much vegetation has died and returnedCO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere. The scientists report that thisoscillation, which is known as the "breath of the biosphere," hasincreased by 15 percent since 1959, indicating that plant sequestrationof CO<sub>2</sub> has risen that much in the northern hemisphere overthis period.<a href="#9">[9]</a> If so, this CO<sub>2</sub>"fertilization" effect must be more than offsetting deforestation inthe tropics. Indeed, it may <i>automatically</i> compensate as rain foresttrees are cut and stop sequestering atmospheric carbon through growth,leaving more in the atmosphere to generate and be removed by plantgrowth elsewhere.<p>	The world is actually getting <i>greener</i>, then, due tothe beneficial effects of industrial CO<sub>2</sub> emission, contraryto the dismal projections of the environmental apocalyptics. On thebasis of the Mauna Loa data, Patrick Michaels computes that theprobability that the world is <i>not</i> getting greener is only 3percent. Consumers driving their automobiles, instead of feeling guiltyfor using depletable fossil fuels, as environmental apocalyptics soardently wish them to, might justifiably take satisfaction in helpingto feed the world's billions, since that is <i>exactly</i> what theyare doing. It is safe to say that economic models which exclude such asystematic, beneficial externality, cannot generate accurate estimatesof the costs or benefits of CO<sub>2</sub> emission abatement, and mustsystematically <i>overstate</i> the amounts of such emission abatementthat is economically justified. They may even get the justifieddirection of change wrong.<h4>Blinded by Ideology</h4>	<p>	How can economists studying environmental issues andother effects of technical change and industrial development miss allthis? It seems odd that they would, since the theory of externalitiesmakes specific reference not just to external costs but also toexternal benefits possibly resulting from human actions. Environmentalideology seems to blind most analysts to those benefits. In a recentpaper on the issue of global warming policy, William Nordhouse makesthe following amazing admission in a discussion of the costs andbenefits of CO<sub>2</sub> emission abatement: </p><ul>	<p>	In contrast to the cost function, we know little about the shape	of the damage function...We suspect that higher levels of greenhouse	gases will hurt the global economy, but because of the fertilization	effect of CO<sub>2</sub> or the attractiveness of warm climates, the	greenhouse effect might on balance actually be economically	advantageous.<a href="#10">[10]</a> 		</p></ul>	<p>	Later in that paper, following a discussion of the various factorsthat must be considered in assessing the impacts of CO<sub>2</sub>emission and of emission abatement on the global economy, Nordhouseadds the following: </p><ul>	<p>	These remarks lead to a surprising conclusion. Climate change is	likely to produce a combination of gains and losses with no	strong presumption of substantial net economic damages. This is	not an argument in favor of climate change, or a laissez-faire	attitude to the greenhouse effect. Rather, it suggests that a careful	weighing of costs and damages will be necessary if a sensible	strategy is to be devised.<a href="#11">[11]</a>	</p></ul><p>	Unfortunately, though Nordhouse is among the fairest and most moderateof modern economic analysts dealing with such issues, theseobservations appear to be unrepresentative of his general philosophy.In an even more recent paper on the same subject, Nordhouse not onlycompletely fails to mention the "fertilization effect" of CO<sub>2</sub>, butexpresses a highly pessimistic perspective on the risks associated withhuman industrial activity. That paper begins with a statement, phrasedin the best apocalyptic style, that mankind is playing dice with thenatural environment through a multitude of interventions. The usualbleak list follows, with none of the potential beneficial effects orside effects of scientific/ industrial progress mentioned.<p>	This attitude carries through to the last section of Nordhouse'spaper, titled, symptomatically, <i>Uncertainties and Anxieties</i>. Heremarks on the relatively small amount of coercive governmentalcontrols for emission abatement his and other economic models justify,with some apparent disappointment, which becomes clear as he thenwrites the following:</p></ul>	<p>	Yet, even for those who downplay the urgency of the most likely	scenarios for climate change, a deeper anxiety remains about	future uncertainties and surprises. Scientists raise the specter of	shifting currents turning Europe into Alaska, of mid-continental	drying transforming grain belts into deserts, of great rivers	drying up as snow packs disappear, of severe storms wiping out	whole populations of low-lying regions, of surging ice sheets raising	ocean levels by 20 to 50 feet, of northward migration of old or	new tropical pests and diseases decimating the temperature	(sic) regions, of environmentally induced migration overrunning	borders in search of livable land. Given the potential for	catastrophic surprises, perhaps we should conclude that the	major concern lies in the uncertainties and imponderable impacts of	climate change rather than in the smooth changes foreseen by	the global models.<a href="#12">[12]</a>	</p></ul><p>	Nordhouse clearly reads different scientists than I do. Most ofthe elements in this list of potential disasters seem highly unlikely.But notice his uniform concentration on catastrophic surprises, with nohint that beneficial surprises might be equally possible. Nordhousegoes on to point out that society often has to make decisions in theabsence of complete information, and that a reasoned decision processlists events that may occur, assigns them probabilities, and weighs theexpected values of costs and benefits under alternate courses of actionin such a way as to maximize the expected value or utility of theoutcome. This standard neoclassical economic argument is difficult todeny. But any society whose intellectual opinion makers andgovernmental decision makers--like Nordhouse--only presume disasters tobe likely, and never beneficial surprises would arrive at incorrect andharmful policy decisions with unnecessary frequency. Indeed, theprogressive extension of controls such myopic disaster preventionpolicies entail would eventually end the very freedom that has been aprecondition of modern human well-being. </p>	<h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><a name="1"><li> See Steven Gold, "The Rise of Markets and the Fall of	Infectious Disease," The Freeman, November 1992, pp. 412-415.<a name="2"><li> Paul W.

Americans have been led to expect theinformation revolution would bring us not one, but possibly hundreds ofcompeting information networks. Now the future of telecommunicationsand cable will be dominated by a single system created under U.S.government jurisdiction and subject to U.S. government oversight.	<p>	Until just recently, the evidence suggested that the free market,without central government direction, would be allowed to establishinformation networks according to the needs of consumers. Technology,advancing rapidly, had been driving costs down at a rate that promisedincreased affordability of multimedia services over time. The sheereconomics precluded any possible "need" for government assistance . Themarket process, without central direction, would develop not one"infrastructure" but instead many networks from which consumers couldchoose. In that free market, if a consumer disliked the level ofperformance or security offered on one service, he or she would be freeto use a different one. Firms that did not satisfy consumers would haveto adapt or fold, at their own expense.	<p>	But now the U.S. government asserts control over this evolution. Ithas worked out an arrangement with the large cable andtelecommunications firms: The government will let these firms merge andwill loosen a few other restrictions. In exchange, the firms willdevelop a single, centralized, fiber-optic cable informationsuperhighway, called the "National Information Infrastructure" (NII),according to government standards. Presumably, most transmissions wouldhave to use that one central highway.	<p>	The government wants to subsidize the building of that highwayso that its price will be low enough to attract others from anymarket-based network that might offer a competing service. After usingits power to price out market-based networks, the government would havede facto control over virtually all telecommunications. The governmenthas also decided that in order to subsidize access to NII "foreveryone," it must levy a tax on all phone, cable, and otherinformation services. Of course, that means "everyone" would have topay that tax, at least indirectly.	<p>	One irony of this intrusion is that, in the name of "promotingcompetition," the government claims it wants to "force competition." Noone in the industry, it seems, has pointed out that competition cannotbe "forced." Competition is only one element of sound markets, and itmust evolve spontaneously. The monopolies the government officiallywants to avoid are possible precisely because of the government'sinvolvement. No monopoly could survive the modern telecommunicationsera without government protection or privilege. Under free markets,without government meddling, competition is guaranteed.	<p>	But apparently the big multimedia firms don't want competition.They prefer the easier life of government privilege and protection.They want the government to control and structure the market to theiradvantage. Cable and telephone firms, citing the large investmentsneeded to begin laying cable, told the government they were reluctantto begin, unless officials would carve up the market in advance and letthe corporate players know who their limited competitors would be ineach region. Then they could proceed with "certainty." The governmentwas all too happy to comply. That means free markets and competition incommunications and entertainment have been sacrificed to power-hungrycorporations, legislators, and bureaucrats.	<p>	The first casualty of that communications monopoly is consumerprivacy. As the telephone, computer, and cable services merge, theClinton administration is already pushing a bill to allow the FederalBureau of Investigation, the National Security Council, and otherlaw-enforcement agencies to tap into citizens' voice and datatransmissions over the NII.	<p>	The second casualty, common in business-government arrangements, isthe freedom of suppliers to select their customers. The regional phonecompanies (the seven "Baby Bells") will have to make the NII availableon a "nondiscriminatory" basis. The government wants "universalservice," meaning advanced telecommunications services "available toall." It also wants the system's developers to put schools, libraries,and hospitals "on-line" for free. If not, it will "re-regulate" thesystem. Declaring telecommunications a "necessity," Vice President AlGore said, "Congress, the executive branch, the FCC, and the stateswill share responsibility for revising universal service [and] willshare responsibility for meeting those obligations...."<p>	Citizens, including multimedia firms, should resist the idea ofa single superhighway created under government fiat. Indeed, somepersonal computer makers have already expressed "disdain" for thegovernment's single-superhighway idea. Competition and choice requiresfree markets, not rigged games benefiting those corporations with themost political weight. Consumers should not be satisfied with anycentralized monopoly, especially in such an important area ascommunication of information.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Info-Superhighway.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Politiciansand the courts have created an overwhelming presumption in favor of thegovernment's right to seize control over private land, private homes,boats, and cars, and even the cash in people's wallets. While thedispute over property rights is often portrayed as merely an economiccontest, the power of government officials to seize private propertydirectly subjugates citizens to the capricious will of those officials.<p>	Once upon a time, possession was nine- tenths of the law.Nowadays, gossip is sometimes nine-tenths of possession. Thousands ofAmerican citizens are being stripped of their property on the basis ofrumors and unsubstantiated assertions made by the government'sconfidential informants.<p> <a name="1r"><a name="2r"><a name="3r"><a name="4r"><a name="5r"></p> <p>	Beginning in 1970, Congress enacted legislation topermit government to seize property of Mafia organizations and big-timedrug smugglers.<a href="#1">[1]</a> In succeeding decades, otherforfeiture laws were enacted, and federal agents can now seize privateproperty under more than 200 different statutes.<a href="#2">[2]</a>From 1985 to 1991, the number of federal seizures of property underasset forfeiture laws increased by 1500 percent--reaching a total of$644 million.<a href="#3">[3]</a> State and local governments have alsoseized hundreds of millions of dollars of property in recent years.<ahref="#4">[4]</a>  According to Steven Kessler, a New York lawyer whoauthored a three-volume 1993 study on federal and state forfeiture,"The use of forfeiture has probably increased a hundred-fold in thelast ten years."<a href="#5">[5]</a>  Thousands of Americans have hadtheir property confiscated thanks to the forfeiture laws.<p> <a name="6r"><a name="7r"> </p> <p>	Unfortunately, the moreforfeiture laws legislatures enacted, the less attention police seem topay to major criminals. Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois noted inJune 1993 that 80 percent of the people whose property is seized by thefederal government under drug laws are never formally charged with anycrime.<a href="#6">[6]</a> Representative John Conyers of Michigandeclared at a June 1993 congressional hearing: "A law designed to givecops the right to confiscate and keep the luxury possessions of majordrug dealers mostly ensnares the modest homes, cars and hard-earnedcash of ordinary, law-abiding people."<a href="#7">[7]</a><h4>Legalized Theft</h4><p> <a name="8r"> </p> <p>	Willie Jones of Nashville was flyingto Houston on February 27, 1991, to purchase plants for his landscapingbusiness. Because Jones was black and paid cash for his plane ticket,the ticket clerk reported him to nearby Drug Enforcement Agencyofficers, who presumed Jones was a drug courier. DEA officers at theNashville airport approached Jones, checked his identification, andasked permission to search him. Although Jones refused to grantpermission, the officers searched him anyway and found $9,000 in cash.The DEA agents then announced that they were "detaining" the money.Jones observed: "They said I was going to buy drugs with it, that theirdog sniffed it and said it had drugs on it." (A 1989 study found that70 percent of all the currency in the United States had cocaine residueon it.)<a href="#8">[8]</a> Jones never saw the dog. The officersdidn't arrest Jones, but they kept the money. When Jones asked theofficers for a receipt for his money, they handed him a receipt for an"undetermined amount of U.S. currency." Jones objected and asked theofficers to count the money out, but the officers refused, claimingthat such an action would violate DEA policy.<p> <a name="9r"><a name="10r"> </p> <p>	Federal judge Thomas Wiseman,in an April 1993 decision, concluded that "the officers' behavior atthis point was casual and sarcastic... they believed that the seizureof the currency was all but a fait accompli ... they cared little forMr. Jones's feelings of insecurity ."<a href="#9">[9]</a> Judge Wisemanconcluded that the DEA officials' testimony on the seizure was"misleading," "unconvincing," and "inconsistent" and ordered the moneyreturned--after a two-year legal battle. Jones observed: "I didn't knowit was against the law for a 42-year-old black man to have money in hispocket."<a href="#10">[10]</a><p> <a name="11r"> </p> <p>	A married couple in Ottsville,Pennsylvania, had their $250,000 home confiscated after police foundmarijuana plants inside the house; the couple and their three childrenwere effectively evicted from their own home. District Attorney GaryGambardella, who filed the motion to confiscate the home, observed:"People say that selling drugs is a victimless crime, but the childrenare the real losers here." <a href="#11">[11]</a><p> <a name="12r"><a name="13r"> </p> <p>	Asset forfeiture increasesthe power of local policemen over people they do not like. InWashington, D.C., police routinely stop black citizens and "confiscatesmall amounts of cash and jewelry on the streets and in parks--evenwhen no drugs are found or charges filed."<a href="#12">[12]</a> BenDavis, a resident of Washington, complained, "I've got money in bothpockets, but I don't know how much. The assumption is, if I can't tellyou exactly how much I have, it must be from criminal enterprise."<ahref="#13">[13]</a><p> <a name="14r"> </p> <p>	Increasingly, the mere suspicion ofa government official is sufficient proof to nullify all claims that acitizen legitimately owns his property. The Volusia County, Florida,sheriff's department set up a "forfeiture trap" to stop motoriststraveling Interstate 95 and seized an average of over $5,000 a day frommotorists between 1989 and 1992--over $8 million dollars total. Inthree-quarters of the seizures, no criminal charges were filed. Aninvestigation by the Orlando Sentinel revealed 90 percent of thoseseizure victims were black or Hispanic.<a href="#14">[14]</a> Whenconfronted with this statistic, Volusia County Sheriff Bob Vogel said,"What this data tells me is that the majority of money beingtransported for drug activity involves blacks and Hispanics."<p>	People whose cash was seized by the deputies received scantdue process of law; as the Sentinel noted, one deputy told two blacksfrom whom he had just confiscated $19,000: "You have the right tofollow us back to the station and get a receipt." Even citizens whoprovided proof that their money was honestly acquired (including alottery winner's proof of his lottery receipts) were treated like drugdealers. Volusia County officials routinely offered "settlements" todrivers whose cash they seized, offering to return a percentage of theseized cash if the drivers would sign a form promising not to sue.<p> <a name="15r"><a name="16r"><a name="17r"> </p> <p>	Assetforfeiture laws are turning some federal agents into the modern-dayequivalent of horse thieves. Ranchers are being victimized by seizuresbased on allegations of violations of environmental laws. On March 10,1992, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and state agents trespassed 15miles onto Richard Smith's Texas ranch, accused him of poisoningeagles, and seized his pickup truck. The agents later tracked downSmith's 75-year-old father, W.B. Smith, and seized his pickuptruck--threatening to leave an old man who had had five heart bypassoperations ten miles out of town with no transportation.<ahref="#15">[15]</a>  The agents produced no evidence to support theiraccusation and returned the trucks nine months later without filingcharges.<a href="#16">[16]</a>  W.B. Smith complained: "The Fish andWildlife Service is out of control, and the Endangered Species Act hasgiven them the tools to destroy the ranching industry."<ahref="#17">[17]</a><p> <a name="18r"> </p> <p>	Lawyer Nancy Hollander told theHouse Government Operations Committee in June 1993: "All too often, inmy practice back in Albuquerque, I see cases where someone loses thefamily pick-up truck at the time of arrest for a non-money related,non-drug federal crime. These persons frequently give up the criminalcase, even when the prosecution has little merit, to negotiate therelease of a vehicle which provides their livelihood." <ahref="#18">[18]</a><p> <a name="19r"> </p> <p>	Confiscation based on mere suspicionis the essence of contemporary asset forfeiture. In Adair County,Missouri, local police seized Sheri and Matthew Farrell's 60-acre farmbased on an unsubstantiated tip from a paid drug informant who claimedthat Farrell had a vast field of marijuana and used tractors outfittedwith special lights to harvest it at night. Police made no effort toinvestigate the allegations before seizing Farrell's farm. The caseagainst Farrell and 34 other local defendants collapsed when theinformant refused to testify in court--first because he claimed he hadlaryngitis, and then because he claimed a total loss of memory.<ahref="#19">[19]</a>  Despite the collapse of the prosecution's case,the police refused to return Farrell's farm. They had a change of heartafter the <i>Pittsburgh Press</i> exposed the case, although theyrequired that the Farrells sign an agreement promising not to suebefore giving back the farm. The case cost the Farrells over $5,600 inlegal fees.<h4>Distorted Law Enforcement Priorities</h4><p> <a name="20r"> </p> <p>	Asset forfeitures distorts law enforcementpriorities; instead of chasing violent criminals, some police targetwealthy citizens. Early in the morning of October 2, 1992, a small armyof 31 people from eight law enforcement agencies smashed their way into61-year-old Donald Scott's home on his 200-acre Trail's End Ranch inMalibu, California. The raiders were equipped with automatic weapons,flak jackets, and a battering ram.<a href="#20">[20]</a> Scott's wifescreamed when she saw the intruders, Scott came out of the bedroom witha pistol in his hands, and police gunned him down. After killing Scott,the agents thoroughly searched his house and ranch but failed to findany illicit drugs.<p> <a name="21r"><a name="22r"><a name="23r"><a name="24r"><aname="25r"> </p> <p>	Ventura County district attorney Michael Bradburyinvestigated the raid and issued a report in 1993 that concluded that a"primary purpose of the raid was a land grab by the [Los AngelesCounty] Sheriff's Department."<a href="#21">[21]</a> Bradbury revealedthat at a briefing before the raid took place, government agents wereinformed that the ranch had been appraised at $1.1 million and that "80acres sold for $800,000 in 1991 in the same area."<ahref="#22">[22]</a>  The law officers at the briefing were told that ifthey discovered as few as "14 marijuana plants" on the ranch, theentire property could be seized.<a href="#23">[23]</a> Bradbury alsoconcluded that a Los Angeles sheriff's deputy had lied to obtain asearch warrant and declared: "This search warrant became Donald Scott'sdeath warrant. This guy should not be dead."<a href="#24">[24]</a> LosAngeles officials claimed that a confidential informant told them thatmarijuana was being grown on Scott's ranch, but the informant deniedever making such a statement.<a href="#25">[25]</a><p>	In Pittsburgh, federal prosecutors last year devastated JaneWard after she had fully cooperated with them in testifying to helpsolve the murder of her husband, John Ward. Prosecutors decided thatJohn Ward had been a drug dealer and that all of his previous incomewas drug-related. They proceeded to confiscate almost all of the assetsof the widow (who had her own legitimate business); federal officialsarrived with a truck at the Ward's home and carted off all the family'sfurniture. Prosecutors even sought to confiscate all the proceeds fromWard's life insurance; Jane Ward and her three children were forced togo on welfare, according to Terrance Reed, Ms. Ward's lawyer and one ofthe nation's leading authorities on forfeiture law.<p>	Asset forfeiture property grabs are sparking fights acrossthe nation--even in states known for giving government a long leash,such as Maryland. In Frederick, Maryland, police seized a 1988 Toyotapickup truck from a local resident after he bought $40 worth of a drugplacebo from an undercover cop at an open-air drug market. UnderMaryland law, local police and prosecutors have effectively unlimitedpower to confiscate any vehicle they suspect was involved, or that theowner intended to be involved, in transporting drugs. Maryland policehave confiscated thousands of autos and trucks in recent years, oftenbased on mere accusations.<p> <a name="26r"><a name="27r"> </p> <p>	After Maryland Delegate JohnArnick proposed a law to reform the forfeiture procedure to shore updefendants' rights, state officials went berserk. Harford CountyState's attorney Joseph Cassilly denounced Arnick's proposal: "It's acrazy law. Absolutely crazy... It's just going to inconvenience thehell out of everybody" by requiring police officials to testify incourt to explain why cars were confiscated.2<a href="#26">[26]</a>Frank Charles Meyer, an assistant state's attorney in Baltimore County,justified the existing law: ''It hurts the bad guy, it benefits thegood guy and it doesn't really cost."<a href="#27">[27]</a> Policesometimes "settle" the forfeiture cases by allowing the auto owners tobuy back their car for half the car's value.<h4>Government by Gossip</h4><p> <a name="28r"><a name="29r"><a name="30r"> </p><p>	The Justice Department's 1992 annual report on asset seizuresdeclared, "No property may be seized unless the government has probablecause to believe that it is subject to forfeiture."<ahref="#28">[28]</a> In reality, government officials are seizingpeople's property based solely on ''hearsay"--rumor and gossip--fromanonymous informants.<a href="#29">[29]</a> (Hearsay evidence is heldin such low esteem in the American judicial system that it cannot beintroduced into court in criminal proceedings.) Police routinely refuseto reveal their source of a rumor about the forfeiture target; somepolicemen have likely invented anonymous informants to give them apretext to take private property they covet. In Fort Lauderdale,Florida, police seized the $250,000 home of a dead man from his heirswho had cared for him while he was dying of cancer. The justificationfor the seizure? A "confidential informant told police that [two yearsearlier] the owner . . . took a $10,000 payment from drug dealers whoused a dock at the house along a canal to unload cocaine. The informantcan't recall the exact date, the boat's name or the dealers' names, andthe government candidly says in its court brief it 'does not possessthe facts necessary to be any more specific,' " as the <i>PittsburghPress</i> reported.<a href="#30">[30]</a> Although the police had noevidence that the deceased homeowner was involved in drug dealing, aninformant's vague, uncorroborated assertion was sufficient to evict theowners and seize the property. While government agents can use hearsayevidence to justify a seizure, property owners are usually prohibitedfrom offering hearsay evidence to support their claims.<p> <a name="31r"> </p> <p>	Law enforcement officials are also seizingapartment buildings to punish the landlords for not eradicating drugdealing in the apartments. (If the same standard were applied toinner-city public housing projects, almost every public housing projectin the country could be seized from the government; in 1993 BaltimoreMayor Kurt Schmoke blamed maintenance problems at one public housingproject on drug dealers who refused to let city workers enter thebuildings.)<a href="#31">[31]</a><p> <a name="32r"> </p> <p>	In Florida, the Dade County Commissionrevised county laws in 1989 to allow county officials ''to demolish anuisance building within 30 days after the police report drug activityat the property. Proof of drug activity is defined in the ordinance asone arrest."<a href="#32">[32]</a> The owner of a 36-unit apartmentbuilding in Milwaukee sought to placate the police by evicting tentenants suspected of drug use, giving a master key to local beat cops,forwarding tips to the police, and hiring two security firms to patrolthe building. The city still seized the building be- cause, asMilwaukee city attorney David Stanosz declared, "Once a propertydevelops a reputation as a place to buy drugs, the only way to fix thatis to leave it totally vacant for a number of months. This landlorddoesn't want to do that."<p><a name="33r"><a name="34r"></p> <p>	The owner had encouraged the police to send undercover agentsinto the building--but the police claimed they were too short ofofficers.<a href="#33">[33]</a> In July 1992, several Clevelandlandlords informed the police of drug dealing in their buildings; thecity responded by quickly seizing the buildings and evicting alltenants, even in a building where drug-dealing occurred in a singleapartment.<a href="#34">[34]</a> Apparently, the worse the police failto control crime, the more power police acquire to seize law-bidingcitizens' property.<h4>The Long Arm of Legal Plunder</h4><p> <a name="35r"> </p> <p>	Asset forfeiture is spreading likewildfire through the statute books. Some Islamic countries imposeDraconian penalties on men who approach and talk to women in public. InWashington, D.C., Portland, Oregon, and Hartford, Connecticut, policeconfiscate the cars of men who drive up and suggest a "capitalist actbetween consenting adults" to streetwalkers. Customs Service officialsin Texas seized a $138,000 Lear jet after discovering that the ownerhad made a typographical error on paperwork he submitted to the FederalAviation Administration.<a href="#35">[35]</a> (The FAA's usualresponse to such a mistake is to require the owner to correct theform.)<p> <a name="36r"><a name="37r"> </p> <p>	The Immigration andNaturalization Service has seized over 30,000 cars and trucks since1990 from either people helping illegal immigrants enter the UnitedStates or construction companies transporting illegal immigrants to jobsites .<a href="#36">[36]</a> Customs agents confiscated the $113,000that a Vietnamese mother had collected from 20 families in the Seattlearea to take back to Vietnam for humanitarian relief for theirrelatives.<a href="#37">[37]</a> (Customs officials pronounced thewoman guilty of violating the Trading with the Enemy Act.)<p> <a name="39r"><a name="40r"><a name="41r"> </p> <p>	A NewJersey mother's Oldsmobile was confiscated by police after they allegedthat her son had used it to drive to a store where he shoplifted a pairof pants.<a href="#38">[38]</a> One New York businessman was forced toforfeit all of his gas stations because of a failure to pay New Yorksales tax.<a href="#39">[39]</a> A New Jersey construction company hadall its equipment seized after state officials decided that the companywas technically ineligible to bid on three municipal projects that ithad already completed.<a href="#40">[40]</a> Suffolk County, New York,legislators considered a law in 1993 to allow local officials toconfiscate the "cars, boats and planes used in connection with anymisdemeanor."<a href="#41">[41]</a><p>	Asset confiscation programs are creating thousands of newpolice informants. The Justice Department routinely gives monetaryrewards to individuals who report information or make accusations thatlead to a seizure. The forfeiture program thus turns many airlineticket agents into conspirators with the government, since anyone whopays cash for an airline ticket stands a chance of being reported as asuspected drug dealer or an accomplice to drug dealing.<h4>Perverse Incentives</h4><p> <a name="42r"><a name="43r"><a name="4r"> </p> <p>	Forfeiture isthe biggest growth area in law enforcement partly because federal andlocal police agencies usually keep a large amount of the booty theyseize. Federal Judge Richard Arnold noted in 1992 that some observerswere questioning "whether we are seeing fair and effective lawenforcement or an insatiable appetite for a source for increased agencyrevenue."<a href="#42">[42]</a> In Nueces County, Texas, Sheriff JamesHickey used assets from a federal drug forfeiture fund to grant himselfa retroactive $48,000 salary increase just before retirement ($400 amonth for the previous ten years). The sheriff was indicted forembezzlement by a federal grand jury in August 1993.<ahref="#43">[43]</a> Even internal government documents concede thatfederal agents have gone overboard: a September 1992 Justice Departmentnews letter noted, "Like children in a candy shop, the law enforcementcommunity chose all manner and method of seizing and forfeitingproperty, gorging ourselves in an effort which soon came to resembleone designed to raise revenues."<a href="#44">[44]</a><p> <a name="45r"> </p> <p>	Prosecutors and legislators stack the deckagainst property rights. A 1990 Justice Department directive declared,"It is the Department's position that no advance notice or opportunityfor an adversary hearing is statutorily or constitutionally requiredprior to the seizure of property, including real property."<ahref="#45">[45]</a><p><a name="46r"></p> <p>	Professor Claudio Riedi noted in 1992 in the <i>University ofMiami Law Review</i>, "Frequently, the government can meet its burdenof proof by simply qualifying one of its detectives as an expert, whothen testifies that a particular way of bundling money is typical fordrug dealers. Standing alone, such testimony may be enough for ashowing of probable cause, and may therefore entitle the government toforfeiture. In contrast, an innocent owner must adduce massive evidenceto prove her case."<a href="#46">[46]</a><p><a name="47r"></p><p>	The <i>Orlando Sentinel noted</i>, "Deputies routinely said bills indenominations of $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100 were suspiciousbecause they are typical of what dealers carry. But that leaves fewalternatives for others."<a href="#47">[47]</a><p>	In most forfeiture court proceedings, it is up to the ownerto prove that his house, his car, or the cash in his wallet was legallyobtained--the government has no obligation to prove that the propertyis guilty. The fact that a government official makes an unsubstantiatedassertion that a piece of property was somehow involved in illicitactivity effectively transfers the ownership of that property to thegovernment.<p><a name="48r"></p><p>	Asset forfeiture is proliferating in part because of a technicalityin the law that allows the government to claim that it is suing onlythe item of property, not the property's owner. This is why forfeiturecases often have peculiar titles such as <i>"U.S. v. 1960 bags of coffee,""U.S. vs. 9.6 acres of land and lake,"</i> or <i>"U.S. vs. 667 bottles ofwine."</i> And since the Bill of Rights recognizes the rights only ofcitizens and state governments, not the rights of chunks of land orbottles of wine, there are almost no due process restrictions ongovernment's attacks on property. A federal appeals court recognizedthis when it announced in August 1992: "We continue to be enormouslytroubled by the government's increasing and virtually unchecked use ofthe civil forfeiture statutes and the disregard for due process that isburied in those statutes."<a href="#48">[48]</a> The citizen must showvastly more evidence to reclaim his property than the government did toseize it in the first place.<p>	Government officials routinely refuse to return seized propertyeven after an accused person has been tried and found innocent. Thecosts of suing the government to recover property are extremely high,routinely exceeding $10,000, and citizens must post a bond of up to$5,000 before filing suit. (The bond is required to cover thegovernment's legal costs in having to defend against a property owner'sefforts to reclaim his property.) The legal battles required to recoverwrongfully seized property often take two, three, or more years. If theproperty seized is only worth a few hundred dollars, the person cannotpossibly break even by suing the government. Most forfeiture statutesdeny a private citizen any compensation for his attorney's fees when hesuccessfully reclaims forfeited property.<h4>No End in Sight</h4><p><a name="49r"><a name="50r"></p><p>	Although the number of asset forfeiture actions has skyrocketed inrecent years, Justice Department officials apparently believe that theseizure bull market has only just begun. Cary H. Copeland, director ofthe Department of Justice's Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture,declared at a June 1993 congressional hearing: "Asset forfeiture isstill in its relative infancy as a law enforcement program."<ahref="#49">[49]</a> The Federal Bureau of Investigation announced in1992 that it anticipated that its total seizures of private propertywould increase 25 percent each year for the following three years.<ahref="#50">[50]</a> The Supreme Court marginally limited governmentforfeiture powers in several 1993 decisions, but Justice Departmentspokesman Mark Sakaley indicated that the decisions were not expectedto have a major impact on forfeiture programs.<p><a name="51r"><a name="52r"></p><p>	Mr. Copeland declared that asset forfeiture "is to the drugwar what smart bombs and air power are to modern warfare.''<ahref="#51">[51]</a> Asset forfeiture basically allows governmentagencies to carpet bomb the rights of the American people. The FederalEighth Circuit Court of Appeals complained in 1992 that it was"troubled by the government's view that any property, whether it be ahobo's hovel or the Empire State Building, can be seized by thegovernment because the owner, regardless of his or her past criminalrecord, engages in a single drug transaction."<a href="#52">[52]</a><h4>Conclusions and Implications</h4><p> <a name="53r"><a name="54r"> </p> <p>	Law enforcement in theUnited States is reverting back toward conditions existing in Englandbefore the Magna Carta, when rulers almost automatically seized all theproperty of any person convicted of a felony. Such seizures spurredEnglish barons to force King John to limit his powers in 1215.<ahref="#53">[53]</a> Unfortunately, some federal officials appear tocherish a pre-thirteenth century philosophy of government power. (A1992 U.S. Solicitor General's brief quoted the Old Testament andpraised forfeiture as an "ancient punishment.")<a href="#54">[54]</a>Asset forfeiture provisions presume that government officials shouldhave the power to inflict economic capital punishment on privatecitizens for the breaking of scores of laws.<p>	Many civil libertarians believed that the liberal Clintonadministration and Attorney General Janet Reno would correct some ofthe most overt abuses in the forfeiture program. However, Reno hascontinually postponed substantive reform and even derailed a bipartisanliberal-conservative congressional effort to reform the forfeiture law.Instead, Reno's Justice Department has put forward its own "reform"proposal that has been derided as a "prosecutor's wish list" byforfeiture expert David Smith.<p>	The asset seizure controversy redefines the relation betweenthe State and the citizen: what pretext does the State need to claimthat a citizen's property actually belongs to the State? Do people havea right to their property only until some "secret informant" tellspolice something bad about the citizen's use of his property? IfCongress proposed to forcibly alter all private deeds and titles in theUnited States by adding a clause stating that the government acquiresautomatic ownership rights if any law enforcement official hears arumor about a property's possible illicit use, the public backlashwould raze Capitol Hill. But, increasingly, that is the law of theland. </p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>The federal government had possessed limited seizure	powers since 1789, but these were limited to areas such as smuggling	and customs evasion.	<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>Cary Copeland, "Civil Forfeiture for the	Non-Lawyer," U.S. Department of Justice.

T. Armentano</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Armentano is Professor of Economics at theUniversity of Hartford and the author of Antitrust andMonopoly, Second Edition (New York, Holmes & Meier, 1990).</p><hr noshade><p>	The recently proposed mega-mergers in the telecommunications industrymay usher in a more activist period of antitrust regulation. This wouldbe unfortunate since antitrust is a generally failed and discreditedpolicy. The laws, allegedly enacted to protect consumers, have beenused historically to harass efficient corporations that have increasedmarket output and lowered market price.	<p>	How could a public policy allegedly designed to help consumershave come to hurt them instead? One explanation is that antitrustregulation was never intended to protect consumers. It was intended toshield some firms from the efficiency of other firms and, like tariffs,was fundamentally protectionist. This public-choice perspective on theorigins of antitrust law is reinforced by recent historical researchand by the fact that more than 90 percent of all antitrust litigationinvolves one private firm suing another. If it looks, walks, and quackslike a special-interest duck, it's probably a special-interest duck.	<p>	A second way to resolve the antitrust paradox is to argue thatthe regulators, the courts, and the academics that rationalizedantitrust enforcement were fundamentally confused about certain basiceconomic concepts such as "competition" and "monopoly power." When afirm lowers its price, is that "competition" or is it an attempt tomonopolize? When a firm gains market share, is that evidence ofrelative efficiency or is it an attempt to monopolize in restraint oftrade? Is advertising pro-competitive or anti-competitive? Is researchspending and innovation an important element of competition, or is it a"barrier to entry" that restricts competition and harms consumers?Clearly, theoretical ambiguities could contribute to a massivelymisdirected antitrust enforcement effort. Again, the antitrust paradoxwould be resolved.	<h4>Bad Theory, Bad Policy</h4><p>	To understand how theoretical confusion can lead to inappropriatepublic policy, that is, how bad theory can lead to bad policy, it mightbe useful to focus attention on the dominant micro-economic models andthe generally accepted welfare analysis. The perfectly competitiveequilibrium model dominated micro-economic theory in the 1940s, '50s,and '60s, and departures from that model's assumption or economicperformance were often used to rationalize antitrust intervention.Generations of students who studied antitrust economics (or "industrialorganization" as the subject came to be called) were told that"competitively" structured markets tended inevitably toward anequilibrium condition where price, marginal cost, and minimum averagecost were all equal and where, by definition, consumer welfare wasmaximized.	<p>	According to this approach, consumer welfare could not be maximizedif products were differentiated or if firms advertised; if some firmsachieved economies of scale and scope that other firms could notachieve; or if high market share (or collusion) resulted in some"control" over market price. Firms with "monopoly" power misallocatedresources" (relative to perfect competition) and became legitimatecandidates for antitrust prosecution.	<p>	The theoretical predictions of antitrust economics were accompaniedby empirical research and by statistical (mostly regression) analysis.Early industrial organization economists were enthusiastic supportersof antitrust regulation because they believed that there were strongstatistical correlations between market share and rates of return.Presumably "dominant firms" in concentrated markets tended to earnlong-run monopoly profits; consumers could be made better off by anantitrust policy aimed at reducing market "concentration." Thusmicro-economic theory and hard empirical evidence were alleged to haverationalized a vigorous antitrust (especially anti-merger) enforcementeffort.	<p>	Three important strands of criticism of the traditionalist industrialorganization paradigm developed in the 1970s and they help explain amodest change in antitrust enforcement in the 1980s. First, "newlearning" critics (mostly Chicago-school economists) challenged many ofthe older empirical conclusions concerning mergers, marketconcentration, and profitability. With appropriate adjustments for timeand sample size, much of the alleged correlations between marketconcentration and profit disappeared. Second, revisionist case analysisdemonstrated that antitrust regulation was often employed against firmsthat had increased their outputs and lowered their prices. Third, thebasic theoretical paradigm itself--the static equilibrium models andtheir welfare analysis—was subject to important criticism. The best ofthat criticism was based on insights associated prominently withmembers of the Austrian School of Economics.	<h4>Austrian Theory</h4>	<p>	Austrian economists generally held that real-world departuresfrom perfect competition were not necessarily examples of marketfailure, nor could such departures rationalize antitrust intervention.Products should be differentiated if consumer tastes aredifferentiated; firms should advertise if information isn't perfect;lower costs achieved by innovative firms should keep high-cost firmsout of markets. All of these practices were elements of a rivalrousdiscovery process and were not resource misallocating. That they wereinconsistent with the perfectly competitive equilibrium condition wasirrelevant since that condition itself was entirely irrelevant forpolicy purposes.	<p>	Further, Austrian economists held that the empirical studiesthat attempt to measure monopoly power or social welfare loss werefundamentally misleading. The divergence of price from some measure ofaccounting cost was a disequilibrium condition and represented nothingsinister. Indeed, such divergencies were necessary in order to provideinformation and incentives to entrepreneurs to move resources to theirhighest valued use. Business organizations that made above-normalprofits were simply more efficient at managing risk, discoveringpreferences, and reducing costs over the long run.	<p>	In addition, Austrian economists argued that the condemnationof the dominant firm in the industrial organization literature wasthoroughly contrived. The source of that contrivance was the equationof the dominant firm with the textbook monopoly. Yet the textbookmonopolist misallocated resources by definition, that is, because ofstrict equilibrium assumptions that ruled out the entry of othersuppliers. In the absence of equilibrium assumptions--or legal barriersto entry--it was not even possible to define a monopoly priceunambiguously, much less explain why such firms would have incentivesto operate inefficiently. The dominant firm antitrust casesdemonstrated that such organizations gain and hold market share bylowering prices and increasing outputs, precisely the opposite conductand performance predicted by conventional monopoly theory.	<p>	Finally, costs and benefits for Austrian economists were alwayspersonal and subjective; they simply did not lend themselves tointerpersonal aggregation or comparison. This basic Austrian insightobliterated all rule of reason and welfare analysis in antitrustregulation. For examples the conventional rule of reason approachassumes that regulators can promote the public welfare by permittingmergers whose social benefits outweigh their social costs, or bycondemning price agreements whose social costs likely exceed benefits.For radical Austrian subjectivists, however, such utilitariancost/benefit calculations were simply impossible since the data couldnot be known to outside observers and could not be aggregated acrossdifferent individuals or firms.	<p>	It is clear, then, that the Austrian theoretical perspective isextremely skeptical of traditional antitrust economics and of so-called"vigorous" antitrust enforcement. In the current case of the proposedmega-media mergers, they should be allowed to succeed or fail on theirown merits. Public policy should be essentially neutral with respect tointer-firm business cooperation, mergers, and acquisitions.<h4>The Essence of the "Monopoly Problem"</h4><p>	There is a "monopoly problem" in the U.S. economy but it is notto be found in purely private market activity such as business mergers.The essence of the monopoly problem is the existence of governmentlegal impediments to rivalry or cooperation. Legal barriers to entryand prohibitions on inter-firm cooperation prevent the market fromgenerating, disseminating, and using the information that the tradersrequire for efficient plan coordination. Non-legal barriers andso-called restrictive agreements (such as resale price maintenance)simply don't have this effect on private plan coordination. Sinceantitrust regulations unambiguously lower the efficiency of the marketprocess, and since they additionally restrict individual liberty andproperty rights, there's little reason to support the continuation ofsuch regulation. In the name of efficiency and liberty, all antitrustlaw should be repealed.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Antitrust-Policy-Failure.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

W. Ahiakpor</h4></center><hr><p>Dr. Ahiakpor, who was born in Ghana, West Africa, isProfessor and Chairman of the Department of Economics,California State University, Hayward.</p><hr noshade>		<p>	Many African governments and leaders of thought fearincreased marginalization and neglect of their continent in theso-called New World Order following the collapse of Communist regimesin Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet Union. This fearhas been triggered by the enthusiasm of governments in theindustrialized West to help financially the former Communist countriesdevelop into democratic and private-enterprise economies.			<p>	Africans believe that the countries of Europe andthe former Soviet Union receive far more sympathy in attracting fundsfrom governments of the industrialized countries than their own. Afterall, it has been suggested frequently in the West that helping theformer Communist countries financially is in the West's own securityinterest. Such help, it has been argued, is far cheaper than spendingon armaments to protect against renewed Communist threats, should thesecountries revert to their bad old regimes This is why PresidentYeltsin, for example, receives billions of U.S. aid money while littleby way of serious economic or political reform takes place in Russia.		<p>	Africans also have heard or read such comments as"It would be far easier to absorb people from Europe into Americansociety than, say, a thousand Zulus from South Africa." In sum, manyAfrican governments and their Western sympathizers believe that giventhe closer ethnic affinity between peoples of the former Communistcountries and the industrialized West, help to Africa is liable toreceive little consideration on the international agenda. The recentwithdrawal of U.S. troops from Somalia adds to this fear.			<p>	But the anticipated neglect of Africa has potentialbenefits for Africans that are seldom discussed. The benefits include(a) a much better functioning of their economies, (b) escaping fromfurther international indebtedness at the governmental level, and (c)relief from their countries being used as proxies to fight East-Westideological wars. Consider these points in turn.<h4>Deteriorating Economies</h4>	<p>	Most African economies took a turn for the worse during the 1970s,and many continued on that path throughout the 1980s. Today many arecharacterized by inadequate production of food and other basicnecessities, high rates of inflation, low interest rates that penalizesaving (nominal returns are wiped out by inflation), official currencyexchange rates that bear little relation to the demands for theircurrencies in international exchange, severely underutilized capacityin public sector manufacturing industries (less than 50 percent), largeand persistent government budget deficits, and bloated governmentbureaucracies. These features are, of course, the creations of Africangovernments, although Marxists and neo-Marxists may claim otherwise.But the conditions also have been exacerbated by governments of theindustrialized West as well as international agencies, even ifunintentionally .		<p>	Inadequate production of food and other necessities,which is really part of a general decline in production, has arisenmainly from African governments' misguided attempts to make foodavailable cheaply to urban populations by dictating low, unrewardingprices to their rural food producers. (Many Western governments do theopposite, subsidizing their farmers and storing up excess produce,later to be used as foreign aid.) Farmers have reacted predictably bycutting back their production, some turning to subsistence cultivation.		<p>	Enter Western governments and other international ''donors" withfood aid (e.g., the World Food Program) and loans to alleviate theshortages created by the price controls. This international ''goodwill" also attempts to alleviate the shortage of savings by grantingloans at below-market rates of interest and on easy repayment terms.The loans are also meant to fill the so-called foreign-exchange gapincorrectly believed to be responsible for the countries' inability toimport enough raw materials to increase capacity utilization inindustrial production.		<p>	Indeed, some of those responsible for these unwiseinternational "assistance" programs truly believe that market forces donot work well in the less developed countries. They are unable to makegood meaning of trading on black markets in food, foreign currencies,gasoline, or spare parts in Africa. Others correctly understand thatthe black market reflects the economic rationality of its participants,but nevertheless feel constrained by their relations with Africangovernments, or the dictates of their agencies, not to focus onremoving the injurious policies themselves. When pressed on theineffectiveness of their actions for the overall good of the economies,international "helpers" plead the necessity of going slow or employingpalliatives lest the host governments are overthrown by their ownpeople. Thus one now reads excuses from the International Monetary Fund(IMF) and the World Bank about not insisting on the quick removal ofbad economic policies as a condition for granting "StructuralAdjustment Program" loans in the Third World.<h4>Facing Up to Reality</h4>	<p>	But suppose these governments do not receive any"food aid" or concessionary term loans to deal with their economichardship. A few may stick with their unwise policies if they are strongenough to contain their citizens' anger, as countries such as NorthKorea and Myanamar (Burma) have done. But most would finally face up toreality and take the necessary painful steps toward an efficienteconomic system.		<p>	Take the case of Ghana, for example. While the country's economytumbled during the mid-1970s in response to several unwise andinward-looking government policies, external aid increased (from $40million in 1970 to $82 million in 1978, and to $129 million in 1980).But there was a sharp drop in 1982 (to $94 million) when Marxistrhetoric-reciting radicals took over the government. Failure of thegovernment to acquire as much aid as they demanded from the World Bankand the IMF, and the sharp contraction in the economy that year(negative 7 percent in real terms), finally forced some dramaticchanges in economic policy in 1983, particularly with respect to rigidprice controls. Although international financial assistance laterincreased, those reforms culminated in the removal of practically allprice controls by 1988. Today open markets in foreign currencies (aphenomenon abolished by law in 1961) flourish in Ghana and more privatefunds flow in than out.		<p>	<a name="1r">Some of the international aid money has gone tofinance government budget deficits in Africa In some cases, suchforeign financing amounts to more that 75 percent of the budget deficite.g., in Burundi, Cameroon, Chad, Congo, Gambia, Madagascar, Mali, Mauritania, Nigeria, Senegal, Togo, and Zaire duringthe 1980s.<a href="#1">[1]</a><p>	<a name="2r"><a name="3r">Now anyone who runs the family budget onsuch a principle must soon be burdened with unmanageable debt and gobankrupt. Indeed, some of these countries in 1990 had debt greater than100 percent of their national income, including Mali (101 percent),Nigeria (101 percent), Madagascar (134 percent), Congo (204 percent),Mauritania (227 percent), and Somalia (277 percent).<ahref="#2">[2]</a> Others with equally disturbing amounts of debt as apercentage of income in 1990 include Zaire (141 percent), Zambia (261percent), Tanzania (282 percent), and Mozambique (385 percent). And whobears the burden of repayments? Not the governing elite, but the poorproducers of export crops such as cocoa, coffee, peanuts, palm oil, andin some cases local labor employed in oil and other mineral extractingindustries. This is why General Olusegun Obasanjo, a former militaryruler of Nigeria, believes that the "most humiliating index of[Africa'sl decline is the increase in infant and child mortalityresulting directly from our debt problem."<a href="#3">[3]</a> 				<p>	Although the peace dividend from the end of the ColdWar may have evaded the people of the United States, for example,Africans stand to gain a great deal from the New World Order, if theycould be left alone. Several of the civil wars in Africa, includingthose of Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, and Zaire, really havebeen proxy ideological wars between the United States and its alliesand the former Soviet bloc. Indeed, it was to contain "Marxist"Ethiopia that the United States sustained the Somalian dictator, SiyadBarre, in power with military and financial support until the end ofthe 1980s. Thus, "Operation Restore Hope" may justifiably be consideredan atonement to the people of Somalia for past collaboration in theirrepression and economic ruin, rather than mainly altruism.		<p>	A Soviet academic put it best when he suggested, ata Soviet-Canadian African Studies conference held in Moscow in 1990,that debts owed by their African clients, especially Angola andEthiopia, be canceled since they took the form of armaments with whichthose countries destroyed their own economies. The same can be said forSomalia and Zaire with respect to their governments' debt to the UnitedStates.<h4>Bad Advice</h4>	<p>	What about foreign economic advisers as part of foreign aid toAfrica? Would African economies still benefit if Western governmentsand international financial institutions such as the IMF and the WorldBank did not send them technical advisers? In the first place, theseadvisers must be paid for by the recipient countries, and thus are partof their international indebtedness. Second, they may offer good advicebut cannot force their implementation. Third, many of them offer badadvice. And in the case of Africa, as Mahbub ul Haq of the UnitedNations Development Program (UNDP) was recently quoted in The Economistto have observed, the continent "has perhaps received more bad adviceper capita than any other."<p>	<a name="4r">A recent autobiographical account of foreign advisingby Benjamin Higgins tells it all.<a href="#4">[4]</a> His client statesincluded Lebanon, Haiti, Sri Lanka, Brazil, Indonesia, (pre-oil) Libya,Malaysia, Mauritania, Morocco, and the Philippines, mainly during the1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. Other international development experts havefocused on Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Mexico, Kenya, and Tanzania.But when one looks for success stories in economic development, onefinds Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and South Korea—countries thatlargely escaped the attention of development experts during the 1950sthrough the 1970s.<p>	<a name="5r">The experience of Eastern and Central Europeancountries that followed advice from Western economic experts during the1990s is not encouraging either. This is why it is most instructivethat Higgins rates the success of the "international developmenteffort'' not in terms of how countries most affected have fared, but bythe establishment of a "genuine 'international civil service,' of whichthe top members are of very high quality and thoroughly committed, ...and who have achieved a certain unity of ideas..." and against whosepolicies and proclamations, "governments the world over are reluctantto be in open opposition."<a href="#5">[5]</a>	<p>	Besides some specific details of implementation, thekinds of economic policy that encourage economic growth and developmentin a country have been outlined in Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations.These have been restated time and again by the likes of Milton and RoseFriedman and Peter Bauer. Governments around the world have resistedheeding such policy prescriptions because they do not suit theirinterventionist tastes or political ends. This is why foreign economicexperts frequently are of little help in the Third World.<p>	Of course, the flow of aid money to African governments will not ceasein the New World Order. Donor countries still want to retain their spheres ofinternational influence. But the adoption of efficient economic policies thatwould likely follow the curtailment of Western aid would be good for thecontinent.</p><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>World Bank, African Economic and Financial	Data, 1989.		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>World Bank, World Developmentt Report, 1992.	<a href="#2r">Return</a><p><a name="3"><li>Obasanjo and H. d'Orville, eds., Challenges of	Leadership in African Development (New York: Crane Russak, 1990), p.	28.		<a href="#3r">Return</a><p><a name="4"><li>Benjamin Higgins, All the Difference: A Development	Economist's Quest (Montreal & Kingston: McGill-Queen's, 1992).		<a href="#4r">Return</a><p><a name="5"><li>Ibid., p. 267.	<a href="#5r">Return</a></ol><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Africa-and-Neglect.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Walker</h4></center><hr><p>Mr. Walker is an attorney in privatepractice in Tallahassee, Florida.</p><hr noshade><p>	As readers of this journal realize, property rights are not therights of buildings and land, but the rights of humans to own, use, anddispose of property--tangible and intangible, real and personal. Overthe last six decades, American courts have greatly diminished thejudicial recognition of constitutional protection of property rights,though the Supreme Court in recent years has begun occasionally to"rediscover" those rights.<p>	To no surprise, the ethereal world of international human rights lawreflects America's diminished appreciation and defense of propertyrights. One need only examine three of the primary documents ofinternational human rights, and review recent American constitutionalhistory, to recognize the low legal regard for property rights at thedomestic and international levels.<p>	Consider Article 21, paragraph 1 of the <i>American Convention onHuman Rights</i>, born of the Organization of American States:</p><ol>	<p>	<li>Everyone has the right to the use and enjoyment of his property.		The law may subordinate such use and enjoyment to the interest		of society.	</p>		<p>	At least paragraph 2 offers some minor comfort:	</p>	<p>	<li>No one shall be deprived of his property except upon payment of just	compensation, for reasons of public utility or social interest and in the	cases and according to the forms established by law.	</p></ol><p>	"The law may subordinate such use and enjoyment to the interestof society." A rhetorical barrier such as the "interest of society,""public utility," or "social interest" is no barrier at all togovernment interference with property ownership; all a governmententity need do is declare that a government "acquisition" of privateproperty is done in the "interest of society," and the victimizedproperty owner is legally powerless.<h4>Private Property Rights in America</h4><p>	Followers of the demise of constitutional protection of propertyrights in America understand this; at one time, private property wasnot to be taken by government unless for a "public," as opposed to"private," use. "Public use" historically implied such items as publicroads, military installations, or buildings and land to be used bygovernment to carry out its limited, enumerated duties. The U.S.Constitution is clear; as stated in the "takings clause" of the FifthAmendment, "... nor shall private property be taken for public usewithout just compensation."<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	Now labeled by scholar Richard Epstein as the "invisible" public useclause, the U. S. Supreme Court nearly erased the clause from theConstitution in the 1954 case of Berman v. Parker, an urban renewalcase. In 1984, an allegedly "conservative" Supreme Court finished itsmission of constitutional deletion in <i>Hawaii Housing Authority v.Midkiff</i>.<a href="#1">[1]</a><p><a name="2r"></p><p>	At issue was a law which empowered land tenants to enlist theaid of the Hawaii Housing Authority to take by eminent domain theleased land owned by the Bishop Estate charitable trust, the ultimatepurpose being that the tenants would then purchase land from theAuthority. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared the lawunconstitutional, stating, "We must decide whether the FederalConstitution permits a state to take the private property of A andtransfer its ownership to B for his private use and benefit. It is ourview that it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution andthe fifth amendment that this form of majoritarian tyranny should notoccur."<a href="#2">[2]</a> <h4>A unanimous Supreme Court disagreed and upheld the law.</h4><p><a name="3r"></p><p>	Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor dismissed Contract Clause anddue process attacks in a footnote. Focusing discussion on the BishopEstate holding title to 9 percent of the land in Hawaii, she wrote,"The Hawaii Legislature enacted its Land Reform Act not to benefit aparticular class of identifiable individuals but to attack certainperceived evils of concentrated property ownership in Hawaii--alegitimate public purpose."<a href="#3">[3]</a> By inference, one couldconclude that private concentrated ownership is bad, but governmentconcentrated ownership is good; the federal and state governments owned49 percent of Hawaii land. Justice O'Connor's opinion was silentregarding the percentage of government-owned land.<p>	The government did not condemn the property in order to construct agovernment building, or to build a street, or for reason of militarydefense. The government interfered with private property rights solelyto intervene in the private housing market, for the benefit of privatecitizens, contrary to the ownership rights of the landlord and thecontractual relationships between the land lord and tenants. JusticeO'Connor destroyed the public use requirement and substituted a "publicpurpose" requirement, stating that ''where the exercise of the eminentdomain power is rationally related to a conceivable public purpose, theCourt has never held a compensated taking to be proscribed by thePublic Use Clause."<p>	As a matter of constitutional law, the "public use" clause is adead letter. It might as well be the "interest of society" clause inthe <i>American Convention on Human Rights</i>.<p>	(At least certain state constitutions are explicit, ifjurisprudentially repugnant, in their language. For example, theFlorida Constitution states that private property may be taken for apublic purpose rather than use, thus the government's legal power totake private property is acknowledged as legally legitimate for manymore reasons than if only for public "use.")<h4>The United Nations versus Private Property</h4><p>	For an even more depressing look at the absence of propertyrights recognition at the international level, consider Article 17 of<i>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</i>, courtesy of the United Nations:<ol>	<p>	<li>Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in		association with		others.	</p>	</p>	<li>No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property.	</p></ol><p>	Wonderful. The government cannot take your property arbitrarily--thatis if the government draws your name, deed, or title out of a hat.Otherwise, presumably, if the government has some desire for yourproperty, and has some non-arbitrary procedure or protocol for takingthe property, then the government gets your property.<p>	Even more shocking, in the collective opinion of the United Nationsthe government should not be required to compensate you once it hasyour property. At least the "just compensation" constitutionalrequirement retains some life in American law--if you have a goodenough legal team to assure that the government does justly compensateyou.<p>	(The much discussed <i>Lucas</i> case from the 1992 term ofthe Supreme Court revolved around the just compensation issue, and thesole ray of jurisprudential light from that case is that if agovernment regulation removes all viable economic value from a propertythen the government must compensate the property owner. While the Lucasdecision was a victory for property rights proponents within ourconstitutional system, the victory was but a successful skirmish.)<p><a name="4r"></p><p>	The <i>Universal Declaration</i> certainly is a product oftwentieth-century minds, and more's the pity. While certain rights,properly understood, are deemed worthy of protection, so is a laundrylist of entitlements to other persons' property via social security,public insurance schemes, ad infinitum--the usual "social" or welfare"rights." As pointed out by Gottfried Dietze, any document produced toprovide some sort of legal bridge among communist, capitalist, andsocial-democrat nations cannot contain strong provisions on behalf ofprivate property; furthermore, the weak regard for private property"was due to the fact that Western democracies had become sympathetic toa social appreciation of property, whether they openly professed such asympathy in international negotiations or not. No matter how graduallyand imperceptibly it may have happened, a social conception of propertyhas become so generally accepted by the so-called free societies thatit constitutes a veritable ius gentium."<a href="#4">[4]</a> Americanlegislatures and courts began to severely diminish property rights inthe 1930s and 1940s. It is no surprise that if America would not standfast for the human right of property ownership, neither would the restof the world.<h4>The European Experience</h4><p>	But what of the European experience with regionalized internationalhuman rights? In the <i>First Protocol to the Convention for theProtection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms</i>, a product of theCouncil of Europe's member nations, property is addressed as follows:<h4>Article I</h4><ul>	<p>	Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of	his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions	except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided	by law and by the general principles of international law.	</p>	<p>	The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the	right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to	control the use of property in accordance with the general interest	or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or	penalties.	</p></ul><p>	"Public interest." "In accordance with the general interest." "Securethe payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties." Again, wesee a document which provides a slight acknowledgment of propertyownership, and provides no shield against government encroachment uponthe sphere of individual sovereignty made more robust by privateproperty. Europe we need not look to.<p>	Fortunately, neither the <i>Universal Declaration</i> nor the<i>American Convention</i> have any legal effect upon domestic Americanlaw. The Senate has not ratified either treaty, despite considerablelegal-academic and "progressive" support for incorporating theprovisions of these "human rights" documents into the framework offundamental American law.<p>	Still, the rhetorical surrender by successive Americanadministrations regarding property rights as human rights reflectsthree generations of Americans living off their inherited philosophicalcapital--with little understanding of what happens when the capital ofproperty rights is exhausted by social engineers in the "interest ofsociety." Proponents of "international human rights" and strongconstitutionalism would do well to read the words of Canadian attorneyand columnist Karen Selick, who recently addressed the topic of"property rights as human rights" quite elegantly:<p><a name="5r"></p><ul><p>	In fact, property rights are the inevitable extensions ofthose most basic of human rights, the rights to life and liberty. If aperson chooses to spend some of his precious time on earth convertinghis energy into property (i.e., working for a living), then deprivinghim of that property later is equivalent to retroactively depriving himof that portion of his life which he spent working. It's likeexpropriating an entire chunk of his life. It's like enslaving him.<ahref="#5">[5]</a></p></ul><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>Hawaii Housing Authority v.

We hear of rights not just tolife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, but to a host of otherthings as well, including rights to employment, education, a certainlevel of income, a certain quality of housing, race and genderrepresentation in the workplace, freedom from economic insecurity, andhealth care. Often these claims are made on behalf of some group; thuswe hear of women's rights, the rights of minorities qua minorities, therights of gays and lesbians, the elderly, children, the handicapped andsometimes even the rights of animals. Usually a careful appraisal ofwhat the advocates for these various groups are saying indicates theirbelief that their rights can be fulfilled only by acts of government.Hence they petition the government for new laws or other favors.<p>	If we consider the original rights expressed in the Declarationof Independence and enumerated in the U.S. Constitution, it should beclear that there are massive differences between those rights and thesenew ones. The original rights were rights to live by one's personalefforts without the interference of others, and in particular, withoutinterference by government. That is what the founders of the UnitedStates were declaring independence from, after all. The Declaration ofIndependence speaks of the right to <i>pursue</i> happiness; it does not offera guarantee that one will <i>achieve</i> happiness. This makes all thedifference in the world; for in a free society there can be noguarantee that effort will meet with success.<p>	Nevertheless, today we see plenty of demand for such guarantees, andmore and more promises being made by government in response to thesedemands. Take the minimum wage. What this "right" does is force anemployer to pay a higher wage than employees' services might be worthunder free market conditions. Or consider the "rights" to access nowmandated by the Americans With Disabilities Act. This legislationrequires businesses and other organizations to make extra-economicaccommodations but does not clearly spell out what they have to do tocomply. Such ambiguity is another characteristic of many recentlydiscovered "rights."<p>	Given the vast differences between what is stated in this country'sfounding documents and the demands we now see, accuracy and honestycall for a different term than <i>rights</i>. The term<i>entitlements</i> crept into our political and socio-economic lexiconto refer to federal programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Itis notable that the decision to partake of the fruits of these programswas not left up to the individual. By law, he had to participate, andthis meant relinquishing an important aspect of freedom. Moreover,entitlements are always financed by compelling others to pay. Thus,they lead to more and more interference with individual freedom asgovernment grows in size to administer its programs, seizing the fruitsof individuals' actions both to support itself and to fulfill itsentitlement guarantees.<p>	In other words, there is a hard and fast difference between<i>rights</i> and <i>entitlements</i>, a difference which the pastseventy years of government policy has blurred to the point ofindistinguishability. A free society must recognize the distinction.Otherwise, it has no way of knowing which claims of rights toacknowledge and which to reject as spurious. Legitimate rights are easyto recognize. They can be acted on by individuals without theassistance of government and without forcibly interfering with otherindividuals. Entitlements, on the other hand, cannot be fulfilledexcept through specific government actions which require forcibleinterference with others. Protecting rights is thus compatible withlimited government. Granting entitlements requires an ever-expandingand increasingly meddlesome state. The more entitlements the stategrants, the more it must extend itself to make good on its promises,and the greater its level of interference with people's actions.Moreover, by interfering with successful actions, government becomes adrain on the individual's energies. The individual must expend more andmore effort to get the same personal benefits. This translates into adisincentive to produce, and when less is produced, there is less toseize and distribute. Soon, the state can no longer keep its promises.<p>	Today, government sees itself as in the business of providingguarantees in the form of entitlements; new, spurious "rights" such asthose named at the outset are manufactured by the hundreds of pages ofnew legislation our government churns out every day. A government whichknows its place, however, will shun entitlements. Attempts to provideguarantees to citizens, no matter how well intentioned or how wellorchestrated, cannot be made without introducing more and moreinterferences with genuine rights as the government grows exponentiallyin order to administer the programs.<p>	The government that sees itself as in the business of fulfillingentitlements soon finds itself under pressure to grant more and more.Then, faced with burgeoning bureaucracy, declining opportunities,declining prosperity, and a general malaise, it soon finds that itcannot grant anything worthwhile at all. Today's entitlement-grantingmachine is leading the country into the economic equivalent of abottomless pit. Only time will tell if we can reverse the process byrecovering the distinction between rights and entitlements andredefining the purpose of government as protector of the former, notguarantor of the latter.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Rights-vs.Entitlements.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

It is one of the few parts ofthe Bill of Rights that authorizes the government to violateindividual liberty, since under the takings clause, the government,exercising so-called eminent domain, can compel a person to sell hisproperty. But although the framers unfortunately believed thegovernment would sometimes have to compel the sale of property, theyalso were aware of the potential for abuse that government poweralways represents.<p>That skepticism about government power led them to put safeguards inthe takings clause. First, property could only be taken for "publicuse."  The phrase is vague. But the intention is clear: thegovernment should not be allowed to take the property of one citizenmerely to give it to another. Second, the framers required thatowners be justly compensated. That requirement has problems. In themarketplace, we know what just compensation is. It is the priceconsented to by a seller and buyer. But under a forced sale, there isno just price  because consent is lacking. The government must resortto proxies, such as the price agreed on for "comparable" properties.Comparables are often far from identical.<p>But like the "public use" criterion, the requirement of justcompensation had two worthy intentions. First, it recognized that aproperty owner was not a servant of the state. If the governmentwanted his property, it had to pay him. Second, the compensationrequirement would restrain the government. Obviously, if privateproperty were free for the taking, the government would take muchmore than if it had to pay for it.<p>Unsurprisingly, the government has found a way around the safeguards.It has effectively taken private property for use other than publicand without paying for it. How? Through regulations that restrictowners’ use of their property.<p>For example, local zoning regulations tell people what they can andcannot do with their land. The federal government has increasinglyused the Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA)to stop owners from developing or farming their land. If an animal onthe endangered species list lives on a property, it is against thelaw to destroy the animal's habitat. This has been the case withfarmland in California that is home to the kangaroo rat, in PacificNorthwest forests that are home to the spotted owl, and with otherprivate property. Under the Environmental Protection Agency'sinterpretation of the CWA, private "wetlands" (some owners claimtheir property is not really wet) are protected and may not bedeveloped.<p>The government's policy has led to countless tragedies. Elderlycouples who looked forward to retiring on the profit from the sale ofproperty have suddenly found that their assets are worth littlebecause the government prohibits development. In one case, a couplesaw the value of their land drop from over $800,000 to $30,000 in oneyear after the government declared development illegal forenvironmental reasons. In another case, a man who spent $1 millionfor two South Carolina beachfront development properties wasprohibited from building because a state commission thoughtundeveloped beach was better for tourism. The price of the landplummeted.<p>Unlike in eminent domain cases, the owners are not paid a penny in a"regulatory taking." (Congress is considering legislation that wouldrequire payment if the property value is reduced more than tenpercent.) Government officials and environmentalists argue that nocompensation is due because the owner retains title to the property.Thus, they say, no taking occurred.<p>The objection to that reasoning should be obvious. The framers couldnot have meant that a taking occurs only when the government acquirestitle. That would make the takings clause hollow. The governmentcould avoid having to pay for any private property simply byprohibiting all uses except the one it seeks, while leaving titlewith the original owner. That is already happening. The city ofTigard, Oregon, required the owner of a hardware store to dedicateten percent of his land for a bicycle path and open space in returnfor a permit to expand his store. (The case was appealed and the U.S.Supreme Court placed some restrictions on what a government candemand as a condition for a permit.)<p>The advocates of government land-use restrictions often argue that nocompensation is due because the activity being suppressed harmsothers. They like to say that you are not due compensation becauseyou are not allowed to use, say, your gun to murder someone. Thatargument assumes what it needs to prove. It is true that if you donot have the right to perform a specific act, then your forbearanceshould not be compensated. However, the question is whetherdestroying the habitat of the kangaroo rat or the golden-cheekwarbler on one's own land violates anyone's rights. It is hard to seehow it does. Some cases may be harder. If a landowner changes thetypography [sic] of. his land and, as a result, water runs onto hisneighbor's land, that may be a rights violation.<p>But that is a matter for the courts, the common law, and theparticular circumstances. A general policy that landowners may neverdevelop a wetland or an endangered species' habitat is unjustified.<p>Environmentalists also argue that if the government has to pay whenit restricts land use through regulation, it will not be able toafford to regulate. That, of course, is an argument for theapplication of the takings clause to regulatory restrictions. Untilnow, there has been little to brake the regulatory juggernaut. If theregulators have to worry about how the taxpayers will react, perhapsthey will not be so eager to interfere with private property. If theframers intended the takings clause to restrain government activity,then there is no reason to think that its regulatory activity shouldnot also be restrained. The framers were worried about government’sgeneral penchant to cause mischief and not just outright seizure ofproperty.<p>Opponents of the notion of compensation for "regulatory takings" poseas friends of the taxpayers and of budget restraint. They say theyare trying to save the public money by fighting the property rightsmovement that has sprouted in reaction to the Endangered Species Actand other government intrusions. Saving the taxpayers money is anoble cause. But there is more than a dash of hypocrisy here. Theirmethod of sparing the taxpayers is to allow the government torestrict the use of private property by fiat even if owners lose allthe value of their land.<p>It should be understood that a landowner's right is in the physicalproperty, not its value. The value--or market price is the result ofother people's estimation, which cannot be owned. If someone's landfalls in value from $1 million to $500,000 as a result of voluntaryaction (changes in consumer tastes or in the surrounding area, forexample), no rights have been violated. One cannot own a particularset of market conditions. Thus, when government restrictions on theuse of private property cause the value to fall, the government'soffense is not theft of value. That is merely the result of thegovernment's real offense: the restriction on the owner's peaceableactions, which is enforced, ultimately, at the point of a gun.<p>It we apply the principle of liberty to the takings issue, we easilysee that, in fact, taxpayer compensation for regulatory takings isnot the right solution to this problem. It may have the beneficialeffect of restraining government activity. But there is no justice inforcing taxpayers to compensate property owners for theft committedby bureaucrats. That merely substitutes one act of theft for another.The real source of the crime is the takings clause itself. Itviolates individual liberty, and the only corrective is to amend theConstitution and get rid of it. The government should never be ableto compel a person to sell his property.<p>Respect for property rights, which unfortunately was always less than100 percent, has been in a free fall since the New Deal, when theSupreme Court said that the Constitution contains two kinds ofrights: fundamental (speech, press, assembly, religion) andnonfundamental (property). The New Deal court actually upheld thegovernment's authority under the interstate commerce clause, to stopa farmer from growing wheat on his own land for his own use.<p>Of course, the Constitution has no such division of rights, andproperty is specifically protected in several places. The reassertionof the right to property is one of today's brighter developments. Theproperty rights movement should be encouraged in every way becauseproperty rights are the key to limiting the power of government. Buta true property rights movement should not stop short of calling foreradication of the takings clause. That is the root of all evil inthis matter.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Eminent-Domain.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Hornberger</h4></center><hr><p>Mr. Hornberger is founder and president of TheFuture of Freedom Foundation</p><hr noshade><p>	After a nine-month trial, the jury found O.J. Simpson not guiltyof the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. There wasanger and outrage among most white Americans. The evidence clearlyseemed to point to the defendant's guilt. The feeling was that a jurycomposed largely of black Americans acquitted Simpson simply due to hisrace.	<p>	Amidst all the cries for "jury reform" in the aftermath of theSimpson case, it is important to examine the nature and purpose oftrial by jury in criminal cases.	<p>	The Constitution called our national government into existencein 1787. That document clearly stated that, unlike all othergovernments in history, this government would be one of specific,enumerated powers. If the power was not enumerated, the government wasprohibited from exercising it.	<p>	But the citizenry was not satisfied with that safeguard. Theyknew that it was the natural tendency of government officials--evenelected ones--to exercise ever-expanding control over people's livesand fortunes. And they knew what government officials had donethroughout history to those who resisted or opposed their power:imprisonment, fines, torture, and even death.	<p>	Thus, the American people demanded a safeguard, which essentiallysaid this: Even though the Constitution specifies the limited powersthat the national government may exercise, to be safe, we are addingten amendments to the Constitution that make the limited powers of U.S.government officials even clearer.	<p>	Americans recognized that it was to be a vital function of governmentto protect people from the violence of others--that is, to punishpeople who murdered, raped, stole, etc. But they also recognized thatgovernment officials would be tempted to use these powers against theirenemies who had committed no crime. Thus, Americans ensured the passageof the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments to the Constitution.The principles protected by these amendments stretched back to ancientEngland: trial by jury; protection from unreasonable searches andseizures; reasonable bail; the confrontation of witnesses; protectionfrom self-incrimination; protection from double jeopardy, and so forth.	<p>	Relatively few Americans understand the true purpose of trial by juryand the real power of juries in criminal cases. And part of the reasonfor this lack of understanding lies in the following fact: Judgesacross America lie to the juries about the true nature of their power.	<p>	Juries in criminal cases, of course, have the power to judgethe facts of the case. They decide whether the accused is guilty or notguilty of the offense charged. This is the standard instruction givento them by the judge.	<p>	But juries have much more power than that. They also have thepower to judge the law in every single criminal case. That is, if thejury believes that a law is unconscionable or unconstitutional orimmoral or evil, the jury has the right to acquit the accused--even ifthe evidence establishes beyond any doubt that he committed the act.	<p>	Why is this power so important? Because the whole purposebehind trial by jury was that ordinary citizens would be one of thelast bastions against governmental tyranny.	<p>	For example, assume that Congress passes an evil and oppressivelaw--i.e., that all Orientals are now required to secure a licensebefore operating any business. The president decides that the law isunconstitutional and vetoes it. The Congress, deciding that the law isconstitutional, votes to over- ride the veto. The Supreme Court, in aclose decision, holds that the Congress has the power to regulateeconomic activity--it upholds the constitutionality of the law.	<p>	Is this the end of the matter? No. Because the government mustnow bring criminal proceedings against Orientals who, having beendeprived of a license, are continuing to try to sustain their lives byunlawfully operating their businesses. And the jury in each particularcase has the power to decide the constitutionality and the morality ofthe law. The jury can vote to acquit the accused even though headmittedly has violated the law. And under principles of doublejeopardy, the accused cannot be tried again for the same offense.	<p>	In other words, the jury is the con- science of the community,standing as one of the final safeguards in the system.	<p>	Many lawyers and judges respond: "But this power would resultin anarchy." There are two fallacies with their reasoning. First, thepower already exists--it has existed for two hundred years--it clearlyhas not resulted in anarchy. Second, a jury verdict of not guilty doesnot serve as precedent for future cases. Only judicial decisions onmatters of law (mostly from appellate courts-- after an accused hasbeen convicted) serve as precedents. So, if a jury in one case acquitsan Oriental because the jury finds the law abhorrent, a jury in anothercase involving identical facts must make its own determination as tothe rightness and morality of the law.	<p>	Imagine what trial by jury could have accomplished in Nazi Germany,for example. If every person who had been accused of a crime had beenentitled to a jury trial, the jury could have nullified the Nazi edictsand laws by simply voting to acquit the defendants.	<p>	But central to this entire idea is this: the jury is ultimatelyin charge--it has the power to acquit regardless of the wishes ordemands of the judge or anyone else. That is, the jury has the power torender a verdict for which the jurors cannot be punished. Their verdictis final.	<p>	For example, jury trials in Nazi Germany would have done littlegood if the jury could be sent to jail or otherwise punished forrendering the wrong verdict. If the jury must do what the judge ordersit to do, then the jury simply becomes an instrument of the tyranny--arubber stamp for it--rather than a barrier against it. This was pointedout by the great 19th-century lawyer Lysander Spooner in his brilliantwork, An Essay on the Trial by Jury (1852):</p><ul>	<p>	The only principle upon which these questions are asked [by a judge],	is this--that no man shall be allowed to serve as a juror, unless he	be ready to enforce any enactment of the government, however cruel or	tyrannical it may be. What is such a jury good for, as a protection	against the tyranny of the government? A jury like that is palpably	nothing but a mere tool of oppression in the hands of the government.	A trial by such a jury is really a trial by the government	itself--and not a trial by the country--because it is a trial only by	men specially selected by the government for their readiness to	enforce its own tyrannical measures. If that be the true principle of	trial by jury, the trial is utterly worthless as a security to	liberty. The Czar might, with perfect safety to his authority,	introduce the trial by jury into Russia, if he could but be permitted	to select his jurors from those who were ready to maintain his	laws, without regard to their injustice.	</p></ul><p>	Where does trial by jury come from? It actually goes back much furtherthan the Constitution. It stretches all the way back to the year1215--to Magna Carta. The king of England had claimed total power overthe lives and fortunes of his subjects . With Magna Carta, the greatbarons of England--at the point of the sword--exacted an admission fromKing John that his powers were, in fact, limited. The language of theGreat Charter states in part:</p></ul>	<p>	No freeman shall be arrested, or imprisoned, or deprived of his	freehold or his liberties, or free customs, or outlawed, or exiled,	or in any manner destroyed, nor will we [the king] pass upon him, nor	condemn him, unless by the judgment of his peers, or the law of	the land.	</p></ul><p>	No one—lawyers, non-lawyers, and judges alike—disputes that Americanjuries do, indeed, have the power to nullify unconscionable lawsthrough acquittal of the accused--and that they cannot be punished fordoing so. Therefore, what is the problem?	<p>	The problem is that 20th-century judges--state and federal alike--lieto the jurors by instructing them that they must accept the law asgiven to them by the judge. The judge tells jurors that their solepower is to judge the facts and that they lack the power to judge thelaw. Most jurors enter the jury room not realizing that the judge haslied to them. They do not know that they are one of the final barriersto governmental tyranny. They do not know that their power over theaccused--not the judge's power--is ultimate. They do not know that theyhave the power to acquit the accused if they believe that the law thathe is charged with violating is evil and oppressive. They do not knowthat the judge cannot punish them for voting their conscience.	<p>	Was this always the case? No. Throughout the 19th century, Americanjudges told juries the truth--that they did, in fact, have the power todecide not simply the facts of the case but the justness of the law, aswell. But beginning in the late 1800s and continuing throughout the20th century, judges began lying to the juries. And the citizenry,having lost the spirit and knowledge of liberty that guided theirancestors, did not know any better.	<p>	Why are knowledge and awareness of this power so importanttoday? Because if jurors knew the truth about their power, many peoplewho are prosecuted for economic or political crimes would be acquitted.Jurors, serving as a palladium of liberty, could vote to acquit peopleaccused of violating drug laws, gun controls, licensing restrictions,environmental edicts, and other laws that proscribe peaceful behavior.	<p>	What does this power have to do with the Simpson case? It isdifficult to say. Possibly nothing. O.J. Simpson was charged withmurder. By finding Simpson not guilty, the jury was clearly not sayingthat laws against murder are evil and oppressive. Instead, the verdictturned on two different possibilities: one, after hearing all theevidence, the jury had a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt;or, two, even though the evidence established the defendant's guiltbeyond a reasonable doubt, the jury voted to acquit because thedefendant was black.	<p>	It is important to remember that under the presumption of innocence,Simpson walked into the courtroom an innocent man--as innocent as youand I. It was the duty of the state to prove its case beyond areasonable doubt. If it failed to do so, in the eyes of the jury, thejury had no choice but to acquit. It was not sufficient that the jurybelieve that Simpson probably committed the murders. It was notsufficient that Simpson failed to find the "real" killers. Unless thestate proved his guilt to a moral certainty, the jury had to acquithim.	<p>	One big problem is that police officers, over the years, havebecome accustomed to lying in criminal cases. Any defense attorney canpoint to any number of instances where cops have lied, especially inhearings on motions to suppress evidence, to make sure that a "guilty"person does not go free. In fact, when the police failed to secure awarrant to search Simpson's house (something that every first-year lawstudent knows is a virtual necessity), their story was that they weretrying to protect Simpson from the real killer. Their story did notring true--it had an air of falsehood about it. Then later, policemanMark Fuhrman, a principle witness for the state, was caught red-handedlying about never having referred to blacks as "niggers." Moreover,after decades of police abuse, blacks in the ghettos have as serious adistrust of local police as many middle-class whites have of the BATF,the DEA, and the FBI.	<p>	Having permitted and even encouraged cops to lie over the yearsin order "to get their man," prosecutors and judges now must face theconsequences. When a person who very well may have committed a crime isbrought to trial, many of the police witnesses against him areadmittedly dishonest individuals--people who have implicitly beentaught that it is okay to commit perjury and to manufacture evidenceagainst the accused. Thus, if the jury has this knowledge, the burdenon the state is even larger than ordinary--the state must convince thejury that in this case the cops really are telling the truth. Theburden is comparable to a U.S. Attorney's telling a white, middle-classjury that FBI and BATF agents, despite governmental perjury in theRandy Weaver case, are not lying in this case.	<p>	Is it possible that the Simpson jury voted to acquit solely onthe basis of race? Of course. We should remember, however, that therewere three non-blacks on the jury; they could have "hung" the jury bysteadfastly voting to convict. But even if the verdict was perverted,it serves as no precedent in future cases.	<p>	Trial by jury is certainly not perfect. But as someone long agoput it, it is better that ten guilty people go free than one innocentperson be found guilty. Properly understood, trial by jury is one ofour most cherished safeguards of liberty.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Trial-byJury.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

And now, in every criminal trial, the jury are told thatthe accused "has, for trial, put himself upon the country; whichcountry you (the jury) are."	<p>	The object of this trial "by the country," or by the people, inpreference to a trial by the government, is to guard against everyspecies of oppression by the government. In order to effect this end,it is indispensable that the people, or "the country," judge of anddetermine their own liberties against the government; instead of thegovernment's judging of and determining its own powers over the people.How is it possible that juries can do anything to protect the libertiesof the people against the government, if they are not allowed todetermine what those liberties are?	<p>	Any government, that is its own judge of, and determinesauthoritatively for the people, what are its own powers over thepeople, is an absolute government of course. It has all the powers thatit chooses to exercise. There is no other--or at least no moreaccurate--definition of a despotism than this.	<p>	On the other hand, any people, that judge of, and determineauthoritatively for the government, what are their own libertiesagainst the government, of course retain all the liberties they wish toenjoy. And this is freedom. At least, it is freedom to them; because,although it may be theoretically imperfect, it, nevertheless,corresponds to their highest notions of freedom....	<p>	The question, then, between trial by jury, as thus described,and trial by the government, is simply a question between liberty anddespotism. The authority to judge what are the powers of thegovernment, and what are the liberties of the people, must necessarilybe vested in one or the other of the parties themselves--thegovernment, or the people; because there is no third party to whom itcan be trusted. </p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Jury-Trial.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

O. Box 59,Helmville, MT 59843.</p><hr noshade><p>	Governments at all levels are raging out of control, tramplingthe rights of the people, escalating the attack on the Bill of Rightsseemingly without any recourse available to the people. Until recently,it has not been widely appreciated that for the last hundred years, wehave been missing a crucial check and balance which would allowindividual citizens to just say no to oppression.	<p>	America's Founders were worried that the central governmentthey created might someday grow too powerful and begin to pass lawswhich would violate the rights of the sovereign people. But they had an"ace in the hole"--a magic bullet--that they believed would suffice tohold this new, experimental government in check. That was the right toa trial by a jury of one's peers.	<p>	You might wonder how a jury can restrain a government. The keyis the fact that juries can protect people from arbitrary and unjustprosecutions--and from bad laws. But since the legislature createslaws, aren't we supposed to obey them, and then ask our legislaturesfor any changes that need to be made?	<p>	Realistically, more substantial and direct means are needed toprotect us from overly ambitious governments and oppressive laws thanto simply ask lawmakers for reforms. Ordinary citizens have been--andstill are--outgunned by wealthy, powerful, special interests whosefortunes too often depend upon forcing people to observe laws that arenot in the public interest.	<p>	From the outset, America's Founders realized that the temptations ofpower and corruption would someday be too much for any of the threebranches of government to resist, let alone check and balance the otherbranches. They foresaw the folly of trusting the government to protectindividual rights and realized that, ultimately, citizens at the locallevel, acting according to dictates of their individual consciences,would need to have the final authority--the final check and balanceexpressed as veto power over bad laws.	<p>	Fortunately the institution of trial by jury had already firmlyestablished the principle: a centuries-old legal doctrine carried overfrom England to the colonies, via the common law, which holds thatjurors may judge whether a law is a good law--that is, a law that doesnot violate the rights of free men and women. By this doctrine, ifaccording to the dictates of their consciences, jurors do not think alaw is just, or if they think the law has been misapplied, they maydecide not to convict an otherwise "guilty" defendant. Even a singlejuror can thus prevent a conviction, by voting not guilty. This isknown as jury nullification or jury veto power.	<p>	English common law and American tradition also provide that ifthe jury as a whole decides to acquit a given defendant, that decisionis final . A verdict of "not guilty" cannot be overturned, nor can thejudge harass the jurors for voting for acquittal. Jurors can never bepunished for voting their consciences, even if they have taken an oathto follow the law as stated by the judge!<p>		These principles probably date back to the time of the MagnaCarta. In England in the mid-1600s, the Levellers, led by Lt. Col. JohnLilburne ("Free-born John") explicitly advanced the notion that thejury is the judge of the law. The Quakers then joined the Levellers inadvancing the idea.	<p>	In 1670, William Penn was arrested for preaching a Quaker sermon,thereby breaking the law of England, which made the Church of Englandthe only legal church. The jurors in his trial, led by Edward Bushell,refused to convict him, despite being detained for days and heldwithout food, water, tobacco, or toilet facilities. The most adamantfour of them were then put in prison for nine weeks.	<p>	When it eventually released the four by court order, the highestcourt of England both acknowledged and established that trial jurorscould not be punished for their verdicts. Our freedoms of religion,peaceable assembly, and speech thus all trace to our right to a trialby a jury of peers, a jury not intimidated by the government.	<p>	The sedition trial of John Peter Zenger, in the American colonies,was another landmark case. Zenger was arrested for publishing materialsthat accused the royal governor of New York colony and his cronies ofcorruption. While the charges were true, the jury was told that underthe law, truth was no defense.	<p>	Zenger's attorney, Andrew Hamilton, argued to the jury that they werejudges of the merits of the law and should not go against goodconscience by convicting Zenger of violating such a bad law. The jurorsagreed. Zenger was acquitted in about fifteen minutes, and his casehelped establish the right to freedom of the press.	<p>	The Founding Fathers were clear about where they stood on theissue of the rights of jurors. The rights of juries to judge the lawwas widely recognized in the colonies. John Adams, in 1771, stated: "Itis not only... [the trial juror's] right, but his duty in that case, tofind the verdict according to his own best understanding, judgment, andconscience, though in direct opposition to the direction of the court."	<p>	In a letter to Thomas Paine in 1789, Thomas Jefferson said: "Iconsider trial by jury as the only anchor vet devised by man, by whicha government can be held to the principles of its constitution." In1804, Alexander Hamilton said that jurors should acquit even againstthe judge's instruction "if exercising their judgment with discretionand honesty they have a clear conviction that the charge of the courtis wrong." John Jay, the first chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court,wrote in Georgia v. Brailsford (1794): "The jury has a right to judgeboth the law as well as the fact in controversy."	<p>	During the nineteenth century, judges began chipping away atthis vital and fundamental right of free citizens, transferring moreand more power to themselves, often contending that jury review of lawwas "no longer necessary"--now that free, democratic elections hadreplaced monarchy.	<p>	Then, in 1895, the Supreme Court, in Sparf and Hansen v. U.S. said itshould be up to the judge to decide whether the jury would be told ofits right to judge law as well as the facts, unless a state'sconstitution or statutes provide otherwise. The court acknowledged thatjurors have the power to judge the law, but, going againstlong-established constitutional principles, denied that it was a legalright.	<p>	Today, jurors are generally told that they must accept the lawas the judge explains it and may not decide to acquit a person becausetheir consciences are bothered by what seems to them to be an unjustlaw.	<p>	Judges falsely tell jurors that their only role is to decide ifthe "facts" are sufficient to convict the defendant, and that if so,they "must" convict. Defense attorneys are not allowed to encouragejurors to vote to acquit because they believe the law is unjust orunconstitutional, and defendants are usually stopped short and rebukedif they so much as mention their motives to the jury.	<p>	In plain words, in what comes down to a power struggle betweenthe People and the judicial system in these United States, we, thepeople, have been losing.	<p>	In fact, jurors still, to this day, retain the power to veto or"nullify" bad laws. They are just not told this by the courts. Andjudges and prosecutors exclude people from serving on juries who admitthat they believe they can judge the law or who have doubts about thejustice of the law. This destroys the protections jurors were supposedto be able to muster on behalf of fellow citizens against unjustprosecutions. How can our right to a trial by an impartial jury befulfilled if those who may have qualms about the law are routinelyexcluded from jury service?	<p>	Judges and others within the courts have for too long been waging awar--a campaign of disinformation--so that jurors will have no ideawhat their rights are. Trial by jury is reduced to mere formalities,mere window dressing for what are really trials by government.	<p>	It is past time that the people themselves begin to demand thattheir rights as jurors be respected. These are rights that accrue whenpeople accept their civic responsibility to judge another human being.They derive directly from the defendant's right to trial by jury andare therefore "unalienable."	<p>	Thus, it is not just jurors whose rights are being denied. Every timejurors' rights are ignored or overridden, the defendant gets aless-than-fair trial. This is now a pervasive, constant problem becausejudges have been so busy systematically misinforming jurors for so longthat many attorneys--and judges--are not even aware that these rightsexist.	<p>	We should fight for what is right, while we still can. You canhelp defeat the forces of tyranny. As a juror, you cannot be punishedfor voting your conscience. You can resolve to judge the law in everycase on which you serve as a juror. And you can tell other jurors thatthey have the same power. </p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Tyranny-Jury.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

This is an edited versionof an essay that originally appeared in The Voluntaryist, Box 1275,Gramling, SC 29348; sample newsletter available on request. Reprinted bypermission.</p><hr noshade><p>	Mystification is the process by which the commonplace is elevated tothe level of the divine by those who have a vested interest in itsunassailability. Government is a perfect example of mystification atwork. Government is a group of individuals organized for the purpose ofextracting wealth and exerting power over people and resources in agiven geographic area. Ordinarily people object to and resist thievesand robbers; but in the case of government, they do not because thegovernment has created a mystique of legitimacy about its activities.	<p>	"Government is founded on opinion," wrote William Godwin. "Anation must have learned to respect a king, before a king can exerciseany authority over them." Past governments used the divine right ofkings, by which monarchs claimed the divinity of being appointed torule by God, as a means of instilling this respect; rebellion againstthe king became rebellion against the will of God. Contemporarygovernments have replaced this with the legitimacy derived from suchconcepts as "democracy," "equality," the "motherland," or the "Americanway of life." Such patriotic concepts have the ability to rousefeelings of awe and reverence in the population. These reactions areingeniously channeled to support the government, and in turn helpcreate the mystique of legitimacy which governments need to survive.	<p>	In a libertarian context, the issue of state legitimacy reducesto one question: Does any individual or group have the right toinitiate force? For the libertarian, it is always illegitimate toinitiate force against nonaggressors. Libertarianism is the politicalphilosophy based on the concept of self-ownership; that is, every humanbeing, simply by being a human being, has moral justification over hisor her own body. This jurisdiction, which is called individual rights,cannot properly be violated, for this would be tantamount to claimingthat human beings are not self-owners.	<p>	If individuals cannot properly violate rights, then it cannotbe proper for any organization or group of individuals to do so.Certainly the number of people involved in initiating aggression has nobearing on whether or not the violation of rights is legitimate. Thiswas clearly pointed out by a 17th-century libertarian who wrote:<ul>     <p>     What can be more absurd in nature and contrary to all common sense     than to call him Thief and kill him that comes alone with a few to     rob me; and to call him Lord Protector and obey him that robs me     with regiments and troops? As if to rove with 2 or 3 ships were to     be a Pirate, but with 50 an Admiral? But if it be the number of     adherents only, not the cause, that makes the difference between a     Robber and a Protector: I will that number were defined, that the     Prince begins. And be able to distinguish between a Robbery and a     Tax.     </p></ul><p>	. . . Without a doubt, the most effective method by which thestate creates a mystique is through control of education. The evolutionof compulsory state-controlled schooling reads like a history ofpolitical maneuvering, in which the goal of teaching children literacyskills plays a minor role. Public education is by no means inept ordisordered as it is made out to be. It is an ice-cold, superb machinedesigned to perform one very important job. The problem is not thatpublic schools do not work well, but rather that they do. The firstgoal and primary function of schools is not to educate good people, butgood citizens. It is the function which we normally label stateindoctrination.	<p>	The early supporters of state education understood this. HoraceMann, for example, a 19th-century supporter of public education, saw itas a means of assimilating foreign elements into an otherwiseestablished Protestant, puritan culture. With regard to the IrishCatholics, Mann maintained:<ul>     <p>     With the old not much can be done; but with their children, the     great remedy is education. The rising generation must be taught as     our children are taught. We say must be, because in many cases     this can only be accomplished by coercion. . . . Children must be     gathered up and forced into schools and those who resist and     impede this plan, whether parents or priests, must be held     accountable and punished.     </p></ul><p>From their inception, public schools were a form of social control. OneIrish newspaper, which represented those children being unwillinglyassimilated, observed:</p><ul>     <p>     The general principle upon which these compulsory schooling laws     are based is radically unsound, untrue, and A-theistical. . . . It     is that the education of children is not the work of the Church,     or of the Family, but that it is the work of the State.     </p></ul><p>	In contrast to the xenophobic fever with which many native Americansrushed to impose their cultural preferences upon immigrants,libertarians condemned state schools. Josiah Warren compared them to"paying the fox to take care of the chickens." He realized that statecontrol of education, like state control of religion, would create anorthodoxy which would suppress dissenting views. It would become abureaucracy to serve the interest of the bureaucrats and those whoultimately controlled the state apparatus. When the statists insistedthat compulsory, regulated education was necessary because people couldnot distinguish truth from falsehood and might be led astray, HerbertSpencer countered: "There is hardly a single department of life overwhich, for similar reasons, legislative supervision has not been, normay be, established."	<p>	Today, the ideal of social control through education has beenrealized. Like Pavlovian dogs, children enter and exit schools to thesound of bells. They begin each day by pledging allegiance to the flagof the United States of America and by singing the national anthem.Through political science and history classes, which present severelyslanted history, they are taught to revere democracy and theConstitution. School is "the twelve-year sentence" during whichchildren are molded into good citizens. Indeed, as we have seen, thechief function of education is to train obedient citizens. "It isinevitable that compulsory, state-regulated schooling will reflect thephilosophy of the status quo," commented historian Joel Spring. "It isafter all those who have political and social power who gain the mostbenefit from the existing political climate and depend on itscontinuation." In practical terms, the public school system has assumedthe role of an official church by imbuing its subjects with agenuflecting respect for the state.	<p>	The state projects an image of massive strength, the image of aself-perpetuating, self-contained institution upon whose goodwill thepeople depend. In fact, the reverse is true. Government rests upon thegoodwill of the people. Without their support, it becomes fragile andwill eventually disintegrate. A government is no more powerful than thehuman resources, the skills, the knowledge, and attitudes of obedienceit commands. Every dollar the state spends has been taken from anindividual. It has no resources of its own. Every law it maintains isenforced by an individual. As Etienne de la Boetie observed of thestate: "He who abuses you so has only two eyes, has but two hands, onebody, and has naught but what the least man . . . except for theadvantage you give him to destroy." That advantage is what we call thesanction of the victim or the consent which the oppressed must give totheir oppressors.	<p>	Libertarianism is a direct attack upon the mystique of the state. Itrecognizes that the state is only an abstraction and reduces it to theactions of individuals. It applies the same standard of morality to thestate as it would to a next-door neighbor. If it is not proper for aneighbor to tax or pass laws regulating your private life, then itcannot be proper for the state to do so. Only by elevating itself abovethe standards of personal morality can the state make these claims onyour life. . . .	<p>	Conservatives and liberals demand different varieties of lawand order without regard to the fact that the ultimate in order may befound in a concentration camp. On the surface, it might seem thatconservatives and liberals are engaged in deadly combat, but they areactually in fundamental agreement on one crucial methodological point:namely, that the state is a proper means of achieving socialchange--that the use of force legitimized by the state is a proper wayof controlling other people's peaceful activities. This is theirfundamental disagreement with libertarianism.<p>William Godwin formulated the libertarian rejection of force inepistemological terms:</p><ul>     <p>     Force is an expedient, the use of which must be deplored. It is     contrary to the intellect, which cannot be improved but by     conviction and persuasion. Violence corrupts the man who employs     it and the man upon whom it is employed.     </p></ul><p>. . . The battle against statism today is not a battle against anyparticular politician. The issue is deeper. It is a battle against a way ofthinking, a way of viewing the state. The main victory of the state has beenwithin the minds of the people who obey. In commenting on the British ruleover India, Leo Tolstoy wrote:</p><ul>     <p>     A commercial company enslaves a nation comprising two hundred     millions. Tell this to a man free from superstition and he will     fail to grasp what those words mean. What does it mean that thirty     thousand men . . . have subdued two hundred million? Do the     figures make clear that it is not the English who have enslaved     the Indians, but the Indians who have enslaved themselves?     </p></ul><p>People today enslave themselves when all that freedom requires is the word"No."</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server&copy; please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/State-Mysticism.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><center><h4>Synopsis</h4><table border=4 cellspacing=5 width="80%"><tr>	<td>	Who is important in history and will be remembered, and why?  Can	an individual ensure they will be remembered?  Those for whom stone	and bronze monuments are erected are the least important in history,	and those who are truly important need erect no monuments. The	failure to understand who and what is important in history has a	direct bearing on the quality of individual life, and even on the	survival of the specie itself.	</td></tr></table></center><p>Thoughts produced by the motion picture <i>Land of the Pharaohs</i>, starringJack Hawkins and Joan Collins, answer the cause of many of the societalproblems of man.  And point to the solution.</p><p>The film is a fictionalized account of the life of the Pharaoh Khufu. Virtually from the moment of becoming Pharaoh he begins to plan for histomb.  To provide him with security for his body, and the food andother items necessary for his journey into and through the afterlife. And to ensure that the memory of his existence is preserved for alltime.</p><p>Most human  beings, at least in the latter part of their lives, beginto think of what they have accomplished in life, the purpose andmeaning of their life, and wonder if and how they will be remembered. Some make a conscious effort to ensure they will be remembered.</p></p>Yet--and this is a major thought of this essay--those who are trulyimportant in history need take no steps to ensure they will beremembered.  The corollary to this is that if a person is not trulyimportant, they can do nothing to ensure they will be remembered in thelong term.  For the purpose of this discussion I will define "longterm" as being 2,000 years or more.  The reason for this concerns thelives of Cicero and Marcellus, which I will discuss later.</p><p>	When we think of important people in history, what type of persongenerally comes to mind?  Most people would probably think first ofgenerals and politicians.  And perhaps religious figures.  This isreinforced by history books, encyclopedias, and the statues andmonuments found all over the planet.  Including of course the pyramidsof Egypt, probably the most spectacular of physical monuments.<p>	The reason for emphasizing the word "physical" also involves a centralthought of this essay, for I maintain that the truly spectacularmonuments are those which are largely intangible.  Not physical in thesense of being a statue or monument.<p>	Since we are talking about the concept of importance, perhaps I shouldoffer a definition.  Definitions are necessary to ensure effective,precise communication.  If I mean one thing by a word, and you assume adifferent meaning, then we can not communicate effectively.<h4>Importance</h4><p><a name="1r"></p><ul>"A measure of the amount of property<a href="#1">[1]</a> created or effected."</ul><p>	As a matter of interest, and for possible use in this essay,I would like to also provide a definition of urgency, which is closelyrelated to the concept of importance.<h4>Urgency</h4><ul>"A measure of the amount of property created or effected relative to thetime involved."</ul><p>	It should be noted from the definition of importance there isthe possibility of negative importance, which would be associated withthe destruction of property.  I shouldn't need to mention that thedestruction of property is something not to be desired and should notbe considered to be a "noble" act or purpose of life of an individualvolitional being.  If you think about it, such an objective or purposeis not consistent with volitional life.  No progress could be made ifthe objective--or even a major function--was to create and then destroyproperty.  Which of course is one of the reasons why our currentsocietal structures are in decay.  We seem to enjoy creating andbuilding things, and then destroying them.  Much as a two year oldchild does.  Including cities and even entire countries and groups ofpeople, as in World War Two.	<p>	Yet when we read history books and encyclopedia, who are the featuredheroes?  The ones who get the most pages?  I think it would bereasonably accurate to say that, as a rule of thumb, the more propertydestroyed--including human lives--the longer the encyclopedia entry andthe more books and articles written about the person.	<p>	Conversely, it almost seems the greater the property creation,especially when it is intangible property such a knowledge, the smallerthe entry in the encyclopedia.  Although in fairness, such people oftenhave a large number of book written about them.  But I would argue thatas a relative thing, they have far fewer books written about them.	<p>	For example, contrast the work of Heinrich Hertz, James ClarkMaxwell, and Nikola Tesla vs. Alexander of Macedon and Napoleon. Hertz, Maxwell, and others are responsible for creation of theknowledge which has provided us with radio and modern communications,and television.  While the work of Tesla--as the inventor of alternatingcurrent technology--lights and powers the world.	<p>	I have not looked recently and don't really remember the numberof pages in, for example, the Encyclopedia Britannica, devoted to eachof the above people.  But, since I am talking principles and the exactnumber is not important, I think it is safe to say that many more pagesare devoted to the politicians--civil, military and religious--than totruly important people.  Those who create property.	<p>	What was the basic characteristic of the work of the two groups? Alexander and Napoleon destroyed property and lives--with life being aform of property)--and generally reduced the quality of life. Especially for those who died and whose property was destroyed.  But itwent beyond that, as Napoleon impoverished France and Europe for acentury.  That was his legacy for mankind.<p>	The work of the other group--the so-called "scientists"--createdknowledge which could add to the quality of life.  I said "could" onlybecause when it does not it is usually also due to the other group--thepoliticians.  They often use it to destroy property and lives andrestrict its ability to be used for the betterment of mankind.<p>	There is another characteristic of people such as Alexander, GenghisKhan, Napoleon and Hitler.  There are all serial killers.  And serialproperty destroyers.  The phrase and elucidation of the concept is ofmodern derivation, usually meant for a private killer.  Someone who isnot empowered to kill people through the political process.  Since Ihave used the word and concept of politics and wish to elaborate onthat in the context of the discussion, I will provide a definition ofthat word and concept:	<h4>Politics</h4><ul><p>	"A system in which one group of people called politicians controlthe lives and property of other people."</ul><p><a name="2r"></p><p>	This is the basic characteristic of a political group or entity. How this control is achieved or who and how many people are controlledis immaterial.  Whether it is one person who has effective control or asmall group, and whether the person or group assume the control throughforce or are appointed by members of the group is also immaterial and amatter of style not effecting the principle.  The concepts of socialismand communism and whether the state merely controls the property oftheir victims or professes to own<a href="#2">[2]</a> it are also amatter of style in that it represents a degree of control, and notwhether there is or is not control over the lives and property ofothers.  Whether there is freedom or slavery. 	<p>	Now that I have used the words freedom and slavery, perhaps Ishould provide a definition of those:	<h4>Freedom</h4><ul>"The societal condition that exists when every individual has 100% controlover their own property."</ul><H4>Slavery</h4><ul>"Seizure or control of the property of an individual without their consent."</ul><p>	I should not have needed to emphasize the word <i>own</i> inthe definition of freedom, but it is so common for people to controlthe property of others without their permission that I felt itnecessary.  And, I think I must again comment on the permission ofconsent in controlling the property of others.  With slavery, the mostobvious property controlled is that of the person enslaved--theirphysical body.  Although by doing so you are effectively controllingthe remainder of any tangible property they may own.<p>	There is a great difference in allowing a friend to use yourproperty, and in empowering the political state to control yourproperty through the process of voting.  This could be moral, althoughperhaps irrational, but what is immoral is that at the same time youalso appoint and allow the state to control the property of otherpeople.  The fact that they have done the same for your property andthat of others does not make the act moral.  There is also the matterof what item or property is controlled, how much of it is controlled,the extent of control, and when.  These questions are left open when weonce say it is okay for one person or group to control the property ofothers.  Rather than carry on with a detailed discussion of thisconcept, I will leave it for the reader to think more about it if theywish.<p>	Since time immemorial it has been considered almost necessaryand "normal" for man the specie to engage in war, to kill others of thespecie and destroy their property.  Although this was and is onlyconsidered acceptable when the political entity of the individualsinvolved declared war on another such entity.  To kill as a privatematter was not considered acceptable.  As Voltaire said,</p><p><a name="3r"></p><ul>	"It is forbidden to kill...unless to trumpets."<a href="#3">[3]</a></ul><p>	It is the acceptance of the concept of politics that empowerspeople to kill other people and to destroy their property.  And to takecontrol of it, perhaps for days or centuries.  And it empowersindividuals such as an Alexander or Napoleon to be serial killers.  Andto then be venerated and honored in history for their deeds.<p>	Not everyone who goes into politics has aspirations of becominga serial killer, although there should be--but is not--thought they areembarking on an immoral enterprise.  Many who enter politics think onlyof "doing good" for others, yet the mechanism they select is defectiveand both immoral and irrational.  Further, politics is a great seducer. As answering the siren call of Lorelei, the trappings of power--theability to control things and people--eventually seduces and corruptsalmost all.<p>	There is only the occasional great man who can, because of thenecessity of protecting their own lives and property, and that of theirfriends and group, acquire great power and--when the emergency isover--relinquish it.  And even refuse the insistence of others to carryon controlling their lives and property.  An individual such as PubliusCornelius Scipio--the great and important <i>Scipio Africanus</i>.<p>	When Carthage attacked Rome starting the Second Punic War, killingScipio's father and threatened Rome itself, the young Scipio--barely outof school--offered to take command of the shattered Roman armies inSpain when no one else would take the apparently hopeless job.<p>	Within four years Carthage had been routed from Spain and Hannibal'sbrother killed.  Scipio then turned his attention to Hannibal's owncity, even though Hannibal was still virtually at the gates of Rome. By so doing, and then defeating at the Battle of Zama the man manyconsider to be the greatest general in history, ended the war.  Scipiothen refused to sack Carthage and had his defeated enemy appointedmilitary governor of his own country.<p>	For his great victory, Scipio was of course accorded a Triumph. He was also offered the position as sole ruler of the Roman Empire forlife. Which at that time was ruled by a trio of consuls, one of whombecame nominal ruler on a rotating one year basis.  At the age of onlythirty-five, Scipio refused, saying...</p><p><a name="4r"></p><ul>"No man should rule other men, and certainly not for alifetime."<a href="#4">[4]</a></ul><p>	Yet we live in such a miasma of falsehoods that we believe theonly way to solve the problems of mankind and to regulate individualsocietal behavior is through coercion.  Through societal structuresbased on coercion, whether their style is democratic or dictatorial,socialist or communist.  The latter two are more economic concepts thanpolitical, although all depend on controlling the lives and property ofothers.  Dictatorial and democratic involve the style of choosing theleader and/or ruling group, not whether there will be coercion.<p>	The concept of fraud enters the picture when a ruler or r&eacute;gimeuse mind control--often euphemistically called education--to convincetheir victims that something is other than what it is.  Thus we equatedemocracy and freedom, when they mutually exclusive concepts.  Weconvince people they are free when in fact almost all decisionsregarding their lives are not under their control.  Even when they seemto be.  We tell people their "education" is "free."  We tell them thatby going to war they will ensure freedom.  We refer to killing peoplein war--and even without war--as "wasting" them.  This avoids theunpleasantness of having to think we have murdered them.<p>	We mesmerize people into  believing that giving away freedom ofaction will preserve individual freedom.  Or provide safety from crime. Yet as we give away ever more freedom, crime increases.  We believethere is a difference between a tax collector confiscating money andthe actions of a burglar or thief.  That the one who tries to stop andapprehend a burglar is a hero, while the one to tries to stop a taxcollector is a criminal.<p>	Our entire social structure is based on such fallacies and fantasies. A truly fabulous system--a system based on fables and superstitions. And, like the thousands building pyramids for Pharaoh, we sing as welabor under the whip, toiling to support the state.<p>	Who then is important?  And what are their monuments?  This brings tomind the beautiful statement of the son of Christopher Wren, who said:</p><p><a name="5r"></p><ul>	"...Lector, Si monumentum requiris, circumspice..."<a href="#5">[5]</a></ul><p>	This monument--St. Paul's Cathedral--is an intellectual idea whichhas been transformed into something tangible.  And, in a sense, this isno different than a Sony Walkman, which is also a monument, although toand created by many different people.  The technology required to buildit comes from thousands of people over as many years, each of whomcreated knowledge which led to the creation of new and additionalknowledge.<p>	Almost as a first thing, it required some way to catalogue andpreserve knowledge as it was created.  Thus those involved in thecreation of language, writing, and "printing"--even including chiselingsomething into stone or writing on a papyrus scroll--were involved atthe very beginning of the knowledge and technology that would lead to aWalkman.<p>	Of course there are more obvious and well known people involvedalso, such as Galileo, Newton, Faraday, Hertz, Maxwell and the peopleinvolved in materials technology.  With credit to one of the two mostimportant people who ever lived, Andrew J. Galambos, I would call thisgroup of people and the knowledge they created, the ideologicalflowstream of history.  These are the people who comprise themainstream of history, and not those who destroy and control theproperty of others.<p>	It also required knowledge in business.  How to bring people togetherin a cooperative business effort to create and manufacture a product. Knowledge of production engineering and product assembly, ofcontrolling product quality.  Of finance and advertising.<p>	To see their monuments you need only look around you.  In tangibleform it is the products of our modern technological world.  Thematerial things and the knowledge represented by them which have thepotential to add to the quality of life of each individual human being. I said potential because some times, and for various reason, they donot.  Or at least the full potential is not realized when it could andshould be.  Such as when the political state interferes, for example inhealthcare, although I do not wish to pursue this branch of thoughthere.<p>	Sadly, many people, while accepting the degradation of individuallife caused by the concept of politics, then clamor and rail againsttechnology.  Even while accepting it, perhaps surreptitiously.  Theylike the fact they can flick a switch and have light, to watchtelevision, to travel to a far corner of the world on jet aircraft, butthen complain about other aspects of technology.	<p>	Conveniently forgetting that with the products of technology andbusiness you have a choice.  You can buy a toaster or not buy one.  Orany one of a variety of toasters.  You can travel to the other side ofthe world on a jet or walk or not go at all.  But with the "product" ofthose to whom we raise statues and monuments--the politicians--you haveno choice.  You must accept their "product" or "service" under penaltyof punishment for not doing so.  You must either do as they say, or notdo something which is prohibited.  Until recent decades it wasgenerally assumed that if something was not prohibited you could do it. Now the prevailing concept is that unless something is specificallypermitted, you may not do it.<p><a name="6r"></p><p>	I mentioned Archimedes and Marcellus.  About 2200 years agothe name of Marcellus was known throughout the world, at least theRoman world, which comprised most of the "known world."<ahref="#6">[6]</a>  The name of Archimedes was virtually unknown outsideof Sicily.  This was the situation at the time a soldier of Marcellus,albeit against the instructions of Marcellus, murdered the old manArchimedes--the <i>Sand Reckoner</i>--as he sketched an idea in the sand.<p>	Now, 2200 years later, the situations are reversed.  Archimedesis more well known and respected (and for the right reasons) than isMarcellus.  And, ironically, we originally learned of the existence ofArchimedes through Plutarch's Life of Marcellus.  Now Marcellus islargely remembered because of Archimedes and the fact his troopsmurdered him.<p>	Who is important in history?  Why?  Who should  be our heroes,and who should we emulate?  Which are the acceptable monuments for athinking specie?  Those who create property and give us a choicewhether to use it or accept it?  Or those who destroy property? Property which may have taken millennia of slow, painfully-acquiredknowledge to create.  From where do we receive value in life?  Thosewhose main ambition and ability in life is to control the lives andproperty of others?  Those who destroy property?  Or those who createit?<p>	I leave the decision--and the fate of our civilization and specie--inyour mind and hands.</p>	<hr noshade><h4>Version History</h4><p>Version 01: 1997, January 19</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>	For this discussion, please understand that I	mean both tangible and intangible property, such as knowledge	and ideas.		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>	Ownership is a moral concept which can not	be achieved through theft and confiscation, although control	can be acquired in this manner.

In fact, I would say it is a universal law of nature thatprimitive volitional beings everywhere would and must invent theconcept of a god.  This is consistent with the basic, natural need of avolitional being--a being capable of thought, reasoning, anddiscrimination--to have a feeling of "security" about its world beforeit can venture into that world to learn more about it.<p>	It seems that I have given you the answer to the origin and purposeof religions before we hardly got started.

Also that it was possible to provethat God was not volitional, which I can now do.  The concept that Godmight be anthropomorphic seemed so ridiculous as to not be worthy ofdiscussion.

A world where nothing made sense to you.  Strange andinexplicable things were happening. Things you did not and could notunderstand.  A truly "alien" world in which there was no obviousconnection between cause and effect.  And you could not communicatewith any of the few other volitional beings you encountered.  Imaginethe planet Aristarchus<a href="#2">[2]</a> at the dawn of volitionallife.<p>	You would be very wary of venturing forth into this world.  Sometimesit was dark and you could see almost nothing.  Other times there was somuch light it hurt your eyes.  It was hot and then cold, wet and thendry.  Animals appeared from nowhere, some of them bigger than you.  Andwith an obvious interest in knowing more about you.  Perhaps even howyou tasted.<p>	There was lightning and thunder.  The appearance of the skyfilled you with foreboding, although you weren't sure why. Sometimeseverything was green, and gathering food was simple.  Other times itwas dry, a veritable wasteland, and survival relatively much moredifficult.  Occasionally there were fearsome fires, over which you hadno control.  When it had dwindled to almost nothing you found it verynice and not so fearsome, yet didn't know how to create it if it was nolonger there.<p>	So many things you did not understand that it almost seemedpreferable to not venture forth and try to learn something about themyriad of seemingly incomprehensible things.  Even moreincomprehensible and filling a person with trepidation than unboxingand contemplating your first computer when they were truly primitivethings.  Or someone with no automotive experience contemplating astalled car miles from any possible help.  A very helpless "... where tobegin" feeling.<p>	In order to function in an alien, seemingly incomprehensibleenvironment, a volitional being must feel that they understandsomething, else they are unlikely to make an attempt at acquiringknowledge and learning.  Even when it involves everything of theirworld.  This was the situation of the earliest thinking beings on thisplanet<p>	Another, and in a sense more significant problem, was the lackof knowledge on how to acquire knowledge.  Coupled with a mechanism forpreserving knowledge once it was created.  An ever-increasing body ofknowledge upon which to build.  When the only method for "storing"knowledge was in the minds of living people, this is a tremendousproblem and handicap.  Imagine a situation in which each new generationwould be required to listen to people recite what was known and to tryto build on that.  And when something was not remembered, or notremembered correctly, to be required to learn or discover thatknowledge  all over again.  A great impediment to  knowledge creationand accumulation.<p>	This was the story of our specie for the first 4-5 million years. Only in the last one hundred years have we really acquired the abilityto create and store knowledge in a form which is available to nearlyeveryone so they can use it as the basis for creating additional newknowlege.  This time period represents 0.002% of the period of ourevolution.  If we equated 5 million years to the number of minutes in ayear, this would say that we only truly acquired the ability--on a massscale, available to almost everyone--to store knowledge and make itavailable on a mass scale in the past 10 minutes.<p>	From the requirement that living people be the respositories ofknowledge, the concept of the "hearing" came into our language.  In theMiddle Ages and before, when there was some sort of disagreement,people went to a "hearing" to hear what was known, as there was nothingpreserved in writing.  Now that we have printing and various means ofpreserving things visually we could refer to them as "readings" or"seeings" because that technology is available.  But it is still "Hearye, hear ye ..."	<center><h4>The Tribal Chief and the Witch Doctor</h4></center><p>	For as far back as we have written records there were tribes andtribal chiefs, and also the witch doctor.  We can only make asupposition as to which came first, but I would venture that it is thetribal chief who came first, although followed very closely by thewitch doctor.	<h4>The Tribal Chief</h4><p>	I believe that the concept of the tribal chief came first because ourevolutionary ancestors developed brawn before brain capacity.  Becauseall human beings and their ancestors were created equally (but notequal) under the laws of nature, this means that some were strongerthan others.  It would be natural that one among a group would rise toassume a position of dominance.  Whether it was one of benevolence andcare for the others, or simply that control of others meant an easierlife for the leader.  This is consistent with the First Law ofVolitional Behavior which says that:</p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="80%"><tr><td align=center>	Individual volitional beings seek to acquire the most amount of	property for the least amount of effort.</td></tr></table></center><p>	Were this not so, life as we know it could not exist.  It isboth a necessity for successful volitional life, and something which isthe cause of a great deal of mischief.  This is the cause of peoplewishing to rule others, whether through force or fraud (mysticism).This basic law of nature will be familiar to readers of my essays.<p>	Such readers will also know that--fortunately--there is a balancingSecond Law of Volitional Behavior which says:</p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="50%"><tr>	<td align=center>	All individuals seek happiness	</td></tr></table></center><p><a name="3r"></p><p>	This doesn't seem like a very strong counter-balance to what appearsto be motivation toward naked greed and unrestrained ambition. However, if you have read my essay "Need and Morality in Society" youwill know that this can be a very effective deterrant to attempts togain control of property through force or fraud.  In fact, it is thebasis for the mechansim which replaces the current, primitive,regulatory mechanism of society: Political laws and a political policeto enforce them.<a href="#3">[3]</a><p><a name="4r"></p><p>	Please note that the Second Law does not say an individualwill find happiness in an action.  More appropriate to politicalsocieties, what it does say is that an individual will select analternative which results in the least unhappiness.<a href="#4">[4]</a> That, given a choice, a person will not deliberately chose an unhappyoutcome.  It also means the decision and percieved outcome is relative. It is relative to each individual and their description of happiness(or least unhappiness) to them. Another individual with a differentoutlook on what makes them happy might chose a different action.  Italso says that any definition of happiness is valid (but notnecessarily moral or rational, and thus not necessarily right on anabsolute basis) for any one individual, and that no other person maymorally or rationally say that the definition of another individual isinvalid.<p>	Please note that by property I mean not just tangible property,but also intangible or "intellectual" property.  And, when the two lawsof volitional behavior are merged it also explains why someone canenjoy a sunset, stroking a cat, or being stroked by another humanbeing.  The "property" known as tranquility--and perhaps otherproperties--may be acquired by these actions.<p>	As stated above, The Second Law does not say that the resultsof the quest will be happiness.  What it does says is that a volitionalbeing will not willingly (in the absence of coercion or falsealternatives) seek or accept unhappiness.  In political societies theseeker is often presented with false alternatives:</p><ul>	<li>Would you rather have a 50% tax or a 45% tax?<li>would you rather have an abortion and go to jail, or have the child?<li>would you rather pay an annual road tax for your car of $1,000 or not	be able to drive you car?  And without competition from another road	company offering you an alternative.<li>would you rather send your child to a bad neighborhood school, or to a	less bad school some distance away?<li>etc.</ul><p>	Regardless of the reason, it is an undisputed fact of historythat tribes had chiefs, just as our modern version of a tribe--known asa "country"--also has a chief.  Modern tribes are larger, and with moremegalomaniacal chiefs.  The basic concept has not changed, which ispart of the problem.  It is something which we should and must outgrowif we are to survive as a viable volitional specie.<p>	A truly clever chief will try to rule through a combination offorce and "persuasion," which might also be called "fraud."  After all,the happier your subjects are, the easier it is to rule them. Satisfying both lawsof human behavior for the Chief, but none for thevictims.</p><h4>The Witch Doctor</h4><p>	As intimated above, the witch doctor will inevitably appear in aprimitive society of volitional beings to satisfy the basic need for"intellectual" or mental security.  Mental tranquility to minimizeapprehension--to develope sufficient confidence to venture forth into analien, unknown, and seemingly incomphrensible environment.<p>	Also, being living, biological beings, humans are susceptibleto biological diseases.  Besides the need for mysticism to banishuncertainty about their world, a specie would need people to care forthe sick.  Many lower-order animals show empathy for other members oftheir specie.  We know that at least 100,000 years ago our specieshowed empathy and understanding for the sick and injured members oftheir specie, as indicated by findings in a cave called Shanidar inIraq.<p><a name="5r"></p><p>	The bone evidence found in the cave indicated that Neanderthal mansuffered from arthritis and the inevitable injuries of the difficultlife.  As Rick Gore stated, "All the injuries show signs of healing,evidence that crippled members of the group were fed, protected, andhelped to move by others--the dawn of empathy."<a href="#5">[5]</a>[Emphasis by this author]  I would not be surprised if we find evidencethat empathy existed even much earlier.  I think I see it in lowlandgorillas, and perhaps in dolphins. 	<h4>The Struggle for Supremacy</h4><p>	The witch doctor occupied a position of great power, in a senseperhaps even greater than that of the chief. For millennia it is almostcertain that they contested for the position of supreme influence in atribal group.  Whether it was a very small group, or something as largeas the Egyptian or Roman Empires.<p>	The struggle for supremacy between the traditional priests andAkhenaten--the first prominent and recognized monotheist--are welldocumented.  In the end, the old order won, and Akhenaten and Nefretitiwere murdered, and the pantheon of gods was restored.  They had astrong union.<p>	The functions of chief and witch doctor continued largely separatelyuntil the council of Nicae in 325 AD, when they joined forces for theirmutual benefit and to the detriment of mankind.  It was also here thatby majority vote of mortal human beings the concept of the "trinity"was voted into being.  The concept of the "father, son, and the holyghost."<p><a name="6r"></p><p>	The loser was Ariaus, who believed that Jesus was of a similarsubstance as God (homoiousios) but not of one substance (homoousios).  Only an "i" separated them.  In a truly democratic fashion, by majorityvote of mortal men, he lost.  His losing group then became known as theArian Heresey.  Constantin and the church merged the concepts of forceand fraud to better solidify their control over their subjects.  Aconcept which has been much expanded and "improved" upon over theyears.  Now fraud is an institutionalized part of any chief's tool kitas part of the method of ruling people.  So much so that the Church caneven be dispensed with.  The witch doctor now appears under manyaliases, such as propaganda minister, spin doctor, etc., but they playonly a supporting role to the leader or fühurer.<a href="#6">[6]</a>	<p>Joseph G&ouml;bbels said something to the effect that,</p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="70%"><tr>	<td align=center>	"The more outrageous the lie, the more often it is repeated,<br>	the more likely it is to be believed."	</td></tr></table></center><p>When you couple this with the concept elucidated by Thomas Paine:</p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="70%"><tr>	<td align=center>	"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong,<br>	gives it a superficial appearance of being right...	</td></tr></table></center><p>you end up with people believing all sorts of outrageous and absurd things,such as:<p><ul><li>	democracy means freedom;<li>	inflation is caused by price increases;<li>	a minimum wage boosts prosperity;<li>	a certain level of inflation is necessary, and even good;<li>	monopolies are bad--except for those of the political state;<li>	increasing the number and enforcement of laws will reduce crime.<li>	etc.</ul><p>And, again, as G&ouml;bbels said,</p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="50%"><tr>	<td align=center>	Propaganda made the Third Reich	</td></tr></table></center><p>	It also made the American one, the Russian, and all of the othermodern Reichs or political states.<p>	It creates a situation in which people believe they are freewhen they are not.  A situation in which people actually yearn to beruled, and feel they can not discharge the functions andresponsibilities of individual life.  That only the state can tell themhow to function in the world.  And, as the state increasingly performsfunctions that should be the responsibility of the individual, theindividual loses the ability to make informed and responsible decisionsconcerning their life.  The mind is similar to muscles, in that atrophysets in if it is not used.<p>	An individual with high self-esteem, an inquisitive mind, andintellectual honesty--someone who is or wishes to be in control of theirlife and destiny--should not and will not accept the fact that someoneelse can rule their life.  Even if their name is God.<p>	The only concept or rule a person must observe to live a morallife is that they should not interfere in the property of anotherperson.  That is the only "regulation" needed in a societal group. Rationality is another matter, but also very simple, for as long as allactions are moral, mistakes--which are virtually inevitable in life--willbe handled in a satisfactory manner.	The most pathetic volitional be<p>ing is the one that does noteven recognize that they are a slave and do not have control of theirown lives.  And even extol the beauty of their serfdom, recommending itto others.  Such as people who live under the so-called "democracies."<p>	The Roman galley slave was, in a sense, better off. Chained tohis oar and bench, he knew he was a slave.  There could be little doubtthat he was, for all practical purposes, a 100% slave.  But the personwho believes they are free when the state takes more than 50% of theirproduction and effectively controls all of their property, is living adangerous and pathetic illusion.  The witch doctor--or spin doctor, touse the modern name--has done an outstanding job.	<center><h4>God is Not Volitional</h4></center><h4>Introductory Discussion</h4><p>	It is interesting how you can be certain that something is true,feel confident that you can prove it, but for some reason not reallysearch for the proof.  Yet the idea keeps running around in your head,as if it is being processed in the subconsious.<p>	A number of times starting to write about it, but not getting far andjust leaving it.   Then one day, when you are in a somewhatinappropriate place, having your mind "fetch" the problem and presentyou with the solution.  And for me, the most amazing thing, notforgetting it before I could make a couple of notes about it. So oftenI think of something that seems so perfectly obvious that I could notpossibly forget it, and then promptly doing just that.  Another aspectof the human mind...<p>	One problem in presenting the solution is that it is very simple andobvious from the laws of human behavior.  Yet, while the answer came tome "in a flash," it took decades of thinking before the flash appeared. And, it required inputs from history, biology, pscyhology,thermodynamics and a number of other disciplines.  Thus, while it isnow "obvious" to me, it was not always so. And will certainly not seemobvious to you.  This brings to mind a thought:</p><p><a name="7r"></p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="80%"><tr>	<td>	"The originator of a new concept....finds, as a rule, that it is	much more  difficult to find out  why other people do not understand	him, than it was to discover the new truth."<a href="#7">[7]</a>	</td></tr></table></center><p>	I also remember the story of the great Arthur Stanley Eddingtonwho, upon hearing of the conclusions of Eintein's Special Theory ofRelatively, sat down and wrote out the proof.  Eddington--who may in ahundred years appear to have been even more significant thanEinstein--did not think of the conclusion himself before Einstein did,but had the knowledge and intellectual capacity to realize in aninstant how Einstein had derived it.<p>	Also the story of &Oslash;&Oslash;rsted and his discovery ofa connection between electricity and magnetism.  It is almost certainthat a number of other people had passed a compass or a magnet near anelectrical field and noticed an interaction.  But also that they eitherdid not stop to think about it, or just said "Hmm, that's odd," and itpassed from their mind.  But &Oslash;rsted knew it was a verysignificant phenomena that required an explanation.<p>	People who don't understand epistemology, which is most people,say his discovery of the connection between electricity and magnetismwas an "accident."  Yes, the occurrence of &Oslash;rsted passing the compassin the area of flowing electrical current was an accident, but hisunderstanding of the resulting phenomena was most certainly not anaccident. It required much background knowledge and an inquisitivemind.<p>	The last example I will impose on you is the one of the motoristwhose car was not running properly.  He was in an isolated area andstopped at the only available place to have it attended to.  Themechanic looked at it and in less than a minute it was runningperfectly.  When the motorist asked him how much the service cost, themechanic said "$10."  "Ten dollars!  That's ourageous!  You worked onit for only two minutes!  I want an itemized bill."</p>	<p>	The mechanic sauntered back to this office and in a few minutesreturned with the bill, which said:</p><dl>	<dt>Adjusting Screw		<dd>$00.02	<dt>Knowing which screw to adjust		<dd>9.98	<dt>Total		<dd>$10.00</dl><p>	Yes, perhaps for two minutes of work it seems "outrageous," yetknowing which screw to adjust and how much--and whether it was that orsome other problem--might have taken years of study and work. And somemechanics, taking advantage of the obviously ignorant motorist, mighthave rebuilt the engine for $1,000.<p>	Why have I pestered you with these quotations and stories?  Becausethat which is "obvious" (and correct), is not always obvious.  And thatwhich is obvious and simple to one person may seem like gibberish orgarbage to another.  There may be another reason, for which  I willrepeat an earlier quotation:<p><a name="8r"></p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="70%"><tr>	<td align=center>	"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong,<br>	gives it a superficial appearance of being right...<a href="#8">[8]</a>	</td></tr></table></center><p>	We often believe things to be true when they are not, just because wehave not thought about them, or because no one has pointed out thatthey are wrong.  The knowledge in what is commonly and incorrectlycalled "social science" is composed almost entirely of this type ofuseless, non-knowledge.  This represents a very great handicap, sincemost societal ideas which are right will contravene "conventionalwisdom."	<p>	You may have already found it quite difficult to understand andaccept the definitions I presented and my statements involving the lawsof volitional behavior.  And now I will stretch your knowledge andintellectual capacity further.	<h4>Why God Can Not Be Volitional</h4><p>	If God were volitional, it would represent a irreconcilablecontradiction with laws of volitional behavior.  Let's repeat the FirstLaw of Volitional Behavior again...</p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="80%"><tr>	<td align=center>	Individual volitional beings seek to acquire the most amount of	property for the least amount of effort.	</td></tr></table></center><p>	This is inconsistent with wars and other acts of property destruction. If there were a volitional god, it would not allow such things tohappen.  History as generally written is virtually a never-endingdiscussion of acts of property destruction.  And the old saying that "...god works in mysterious ways ..." is not an acceptable answer.<p>	This oft-repeated statement that "God acts in mysterious ways"is also not consistent with the fact that the universe iscomprehensible.  Our modern technological world is evidence of itscomprehensibility.<p>	God would also seem to be incapable of learning from experience, orat least a very slow learner.  After fifteen billion years he could notconstruct a planetary system that doesn't suffer from all sorts ofnatural or God-induced disasters.<p>	And very slow in his work.  Fifteen billion years to create life?  Atleast in this part of the Universe.<p>	Perhaps incompetent also.  Since, if he is truly omnipotent, hewould also be in charge of making insurance policies.  And not requirethe people he has created to labor under the uncertainties of "acts ofGod."<p>Then there is the Second Law of Volitional Behavior:</p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=4 width="40%"><tr>	<td align=center>	All individuals seek happiness	</td></tr></table></center><p>	Any god who seeks happiness by creating the miseries of this planet isa pervert.  How could someone find happiness in famine, poverty, wars,inflation, depressions, crime, decaying education standards, and allthe other miseries of this planet?<p>	Also, such acts are not consistent with evolution.  In the sense thatnature, apparently--and horror of horrors, acting almostvolitionally--"seeks" improvements and perhaps even "perfection" in whatit does.  What makes me think of that is the wonder, glory, and beautyof nature.  Its wonderful diversity.  And the human body, with itsequisite arrangement of functions and attributes.<p>	Yet having done the wonderful work of constructing the humanbody, would a volitional god have, with malice of forethought, createdcancer, heart disease, malaria, Alzheimer's disease, leprosy, and allof the other hideous maladies than can befall the human body?<p>	Lastly, by allowing and even promoting activities which destroyhuman life, God would be violating the purpose of life.  I don't careto discuss this in detail for several reason. One is that it will giveyou a chance to learn something if you wish to think about the little Isay on this subject.<p>	A major characteristic of life is order, as opposed to disorder. Disorder in nature, as studied specifically in thermodynamics, is knownas entropy.  Life represents order, but when a human being dies youcould say they have been consumed by entropy--that entropy has takenover.<p>	Entropy and disorder is what makes the universe "hostile" toward orfor life.  Live and entropy is almost like good and evil.  It isextraordinarily difficult for life to occur in the Universe, andperhaps even more difficult to sustain itself and flourish.<p>	This is the great sadness for one who understand the lessons ofhistory.  Who sees the perhaps 3.5 billion year evolution of life onthis planet.  From the most primitive single cell life forms to theeventual appearance of hominids "only" five million years ago.  And toknow that this wonderful experiment with life will end if we don'tsolve our societal problems within perhaps 50 years at most.  And tosee politicians posturing around the world as if they were solving theproblems, while they are only accelerating the decline.  With the basicreasons being those I have mentioned in this and other essays.	<center><h4>The Consequences of Religious Beliefs</h4></center><p>	If you have thought about and understood what I have said, youwill realize that virtually everything that passes for religiousknowledge is false, immoral, irrational, or violates natural law. Often all of these.  About the only thing of any value is statementswhich are obviously moral and/or rational, such as the Ten Commandmentsof Christianity.<p><a name="9r"></p><p>	It is immoral to steal, and irrational in the long term ifnot short term.  It is not immoral to covet your neighbor's wife aslong as you do not take any actions on that thought which would violatethe property of the wife or her husband.  Or anyone else.  In the longterm it is almost certainly irrational.  However, it could be moral(but may not be) for the covetor if the covetee<a href="#9">[9]</a>wished to be coveted.  However if she wished to be coveted, then it isprobably immoral relative to her contract with her husband.  Unless shehappens to have an agreement with her husband which allows for suchcoveting and associated actions. No reason why serious thinking can notalso be fun and funny, and provide an increase in happiness.  Even ifmomentary.<p>	Yet, having stated these nice moral things, and emulating the immoralpolitical world in which we are all immersed, the averagechurch-goer--and most other people--go off and do things which areimmoral.  Not because they themselves are necessarily immoral, butbecause that is the way of the political world.  With many things whichare legal being immoral, and many things which are illegal being moral. Bearing in mind also though, that it is almost always irrational toseriously or strongly challenge the the political system, even when itsactions are immoral and irrational.<p>	To an objective observor, which would be one standing outsideof our Universe, they would be appalled at the contradictions in theChristian bible.  Some of the major statements are obviously promotingmorality and rationality, and then there are stories of people begatingall sorts of other people.  Probably with legalizing their relationshipwhich, in the eyes of the ever-moral state, is "bad."  Casting peopleout, and telling people to roast in hell.  Without always being clearof what crime, if any, they are alleged to have committed.	<center><h4>The Decline of Civilization</h4></center><p>	A vibrant, growing civilization--growing in the sense ofquality--requires clear thinking and intellectual honesty.<p>	This means that individuals cannot accept religious, mysticalthinking on any subject.   Unless perhaps for entertainment, althoughit seems a bit macabre.<p>	People can no longer accept the statements of a superb politicalmagician such as a Hitler, who can convince people that murder anddestruction is "beautiful" and "glorious."  That slavery, even of hisown people, is freedom.<p>	For the last fifty years especially, the concept of democracyhas somehow become equated with freedom. In reality, they are mutuallyexclusive concepts.  A democracy differs only in style from adictatorship, with the operative principle being the same.  They areboth societal structures based on coercion, without which they wouldcollapse.  So ingrained is the falsehood, that everyone--no doubt thereader included--will bristle at my statement.<p>	Do you really believe that the violation of a Nazi law wouldhave a different result than that of an American, British, or Europealaw?  Where the régimes say they are "democratic" rather than"dictatorial"?  Assuming you had in fact violated the law?  What arethe choices?  You obey the law, or must pay a fine and/or go to prison. And, if having received a sentence of some type, anywhere betweenprobation and death, you steafastly refuse to accept it, what will bethe result?  Even it involves a cat or dog license.  Or, as in NewZealand, not mowing your lawn.  Or perhaps opening your business onFriday, Sunday, or some other "holy" day when it is not permitted.<p>	Even when the "crime" is a very minor one.  They can not say,"Ah, well, it is a small offense, let's forget it."  Politicalsocieties can not allow that, else they will collapse.  And theirminions be required to find honest, moral employment.<p>	Within the two laws of human behavior, and widely used, acceptable,and moral business practices, lies the solution to the conundrum ofhaving societal rules which are either immoral and irrational, or moraland rational.  Meaning they will be accepted by free choice, ratherthan by coercion.  Because by so doing it will maximize the happinessof all members of society.<p>	Bearing in mind that it may not bring absolute happiness.  Suchas in the case where a person makes a mistake which costs them money. As long as the transactions related to the situation were moral, nocrime has been committed.   Yet, for a period, there will be someunhappiness.  Until volitional beings stop making mistakes, there isbound to occasional unhappiness.<p>	As an intellectual exericse, you might want to think about whether itis even desirable to have a situation in which people did not makemistakes. This would imply that we knew everything and, as AnatoleFrance said,<p><a name="10r"></p><p>	Ignorance is the necessary condition of life itself.  If weknew everything, we could not endure existence for a singlehour."<a href="#10">[10]</a><p>	I think this would tend to create a civilization similar to theEloi of The Time Machine, by H. G. Wells.  They didn't know everything.In fact the knew almost nothing, yet the result is similar...?<p>	There is only one area in which there is clear, right thinkingon this planet.  In the non-volitional area of our knowledge.  Even asthe quality of life continues to decline in a social sense, in atechnological sense it continues to increase.  Even when business andtechnology is hobbled by the political state.<p>	Yet, as further indication of the problems hindering a solutionto our societal problems, people decry the technological progress. They want it but the don't want it.  When, in reality, the "bad press"for technology is not the problems with technology, but the problemswith the political state related to technology.  To wit:</p><ul>	<li>	Greatly hindered and shackled "capitalism" builds more cars than	socialism can build roads to accomodate;<li>	Ever-advancing medical technology exists, but because the medical	delivery systems are increasingly controlled by the state it costs more	and more and is available to less and less people;<li>	Continually advancing communications technology would be more	widely available were it not controlled by restrictive, coercive monoplies	of the political state;<li>	Inflation, which can only occur through debasement of the currency by	the money-issuing authority continues to effect the quality of life;<li>	Only when you accept the mysticism of having a coercive political state	can the concept of war exist.  Without the state you have only a	disagreement between two people, neither of whom would have the coercive	authority to raise any army of millions to "settle" the argument.</ul><p>	In the same vein, if the individual were sovereign rather thanthe state, they would have hard time arranging for and funding borders,Customs posts, passport offices, police forces, anti-subversive controlauthorities, a trade regulation authority, "national" conscription,etc.	<p>As I have observed before,</p><p>	As the number of "sovereign states" approaches the total population,something interesting happens: It is called freedom.<p>	Think of from where it is in life that you truly receive value. Is it from the so-called "services" of the political state?  Some ofthe services they purport to provide are:</p><ul>	<li>	Education<li>	property protection<li>	medical services<li>	road services</ul><p>	Yet in reality are they providing them or hindering their provision? Yes, they control the mechanism that provides these services.  Yet whydo people find they need to hire private security companies, yearn forthe financial means to be able to pay for private medical services, andwant to send their children to other than state-provided, "free"schools?  And why are political entities pleading for accepting peopleto "adopt" potholes in the road and "sponsor" sections of roads andstreets?  While collecting ever-more taxes to do the things they can'tdo?<p>	In the final analysis, the political state hires individuals todo things just as a non-state company does.  Then they mismanage it tothe extent that it provides inferior services at an ever-increasingcost.<p>	Then you have absurd statements such as that of the American "leader"(for which the German word is führer) Clinton who claims that hecreated ten million jobs in four years (or whatever the number was). The more correct stat is that by gross interference in individual andbusiness life, only ten million new jobs were able to be created bybusiness during that time.<p>	Religious and political mysticism prevents people from seeing what istruly happening, allowing them to see only what the state tells them.In fact, so pervasive is the disinformation of the witch doctor andspin doctor that most people have stopped thinking of anything excepttaking refuge in the technology of television and entertainment, whilecontinuing to bad-mouth it.<p>	Heading toward the mindless world of the Eloi and Aldous Huxley'sBrave New World.<p>	This will be the destiny of a volitional specie which continuesto embrace "the opiate of the masses."  Perhaps Marx (or Engels-?) wasright after all...</p>	<hr><h4>Version History</h4><p>Version 1: 1996, September 16</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>	"If God did not exist, it would be necessary	to invent him."

And, that since theyviolate basic natural laws<a href="#1">[1]</a> of human behavior, theynever will work.<center><h4>Discussion</h4></center><p><a name="2r"><a name="3r"></p><p>	Laying in bed on a Sunday morning I was wondering why all politicalsocieties experience continuing and accelerating strife.  Then itstruck me: the Hilary Factor<a href="#2">[2]</a>.  It suddenly becameobvious<a href="#3">[3]</a> to me that this factor and phenomena--andits results--was the reason history can be summed up by a generalizedversion of the title of Gibbon's monumental work, The Rise and Fall ofthe Roman Empire.<p>	That history is a never'ending litany and rendition of politicalstates rising and falling.   Conquering and being conquered.  Peacetreaties made and broken.  Of societies appearing almost from"nothing," rising to rule much of the world, and then going intodecline.  Sometimes the decline is long an agonizing, other timesswift.<p>	That strife and disorder is endemic to political societies.  Ina relatively less populated world it is low and small when the societyis young, but accelerates with age, reaching a climax that destroys orat least totally reshapes that particular entity.  It then goes intodecline as another one surpasses it in power and influence.  Or moreoften now, born of a strife that has reached an intolerable andunacceptable level which creates a call for a strong, dictatorial rulerto end it.  In both cases the cycle then repeats itself.<p>	Another observation is that with the passing of time and history, theviable lifetime of political societies is becoming shorter.  Just as abrief example and generalization:</p><p><a name="4r"><a name="5r"><a name="6r"><a name="7r"></p><center><table width="80%"><tr>	<th>Civilization</th>	<th>Duration<a href="#4">[4]</a><p></tr><tr>	<td>The Egyptian Civilization of the Pharaohs</td>	<td>2,000 years</td></tr><tr>	<td>The Roman Empire</td>	<td>1,000 years<a href="#5">[5]</a></td></tr><tr>	<td>The British Empire</td>	<td>600 years</td></tr><tr>	<td>The North American Empire<a href="#6">[6]</a></td>	<td>200 years<a href="#7">[7]</a></td></tr></table></center><p>	As indicated in the background section above, the reason concerns thevery nature of all thinking beings, and the attempt to contravene andoverride this basic nature.  Which, since it involves basic behavioralcharacteristics of thinking beings, does not work.<a name="8r"><p>	Most people will accept the idea that they are individuals,with their own unique definition of what constitutes success andhappiness for them.  That this definition is not exactly identical withthat of their friends or neighbors.  Often it is quite different and"opposite" or "opposing."<a href="#8">[8]</a>  Also varying withdistance, in that your idea of happiness and success for your own lifemay be very much different than that of a person on the other side ofthe planet.<p>	And the dichotomy of thought which says that we would not wantour best friend--even as an individual--to impose their idea of successand happiness on us and our life.  Yet we are willing to allowstrangers or a faceless entity known as the "government" or politicalstate to do just that.  And, as I said above, we then become opposed tothis entity, whether it is a "democratic" group or an individualdictator.<a name="9r"><p>	Since I have mentioned the word and concept of democracy, I wish tosay something about it.  Differences between so'called "democratic"societies and dictatorial ones are only cosmetic.  There is nodifference in the principle that the political state requires obedienceto its laws, and uses the mechanism of their monopoly on police powersto ensure it.<a href="#9">[9]</a><p>	Once they have decided what is legal, all that is left is foreveryone to obey.  Or protest?  With democracy there is the addeddelusion that you can change things, and that the state only rules byyour consent.  How true is this?  How well does it work?<p>	Disagreeing with things, we may then actually join an oppositionindividual or group for the purpose of asserting our idea and "rights." Seeking political power, and in the end imposing our idea(s) onothers, as they would impose theirs on us.  The very thing we don'twant someone else to do to us.  This willingness to accept a conceptfor society which contravenes ideas for our own individual behavior isthe cause of continuing strife in political, coercion'based societies.</p>	<p>Some people are naturally in favor of or opposed to:</p><ul><li>abortion<li>welfare<li>a minimum wage<li>euthanasia<li>monopolies</ul><a name="10r"><p>	And, since we have implicitly<a href="#10">[10]</a> acceptedthe notion that it is acceptable for some person or group to imposetheir will on all others, it is a simple step to do this.<p>	We would be outraged if an individual or group demanded we buya red colored car, an act which certainly does not concern them oreffect their life.  Yet we see no harm in preventing someone fromhaving an abortion, which is really no business of anyone except thetwo individuals directly involved.<p>	We would be outraged if an individual or group told us we couldnot go to Bali on our holiday, but instead had to go to Nigeria.  Yetwhen an individual is terminally ill and in pain, yet still with theirfull mental faculties, wishes to be allowed to die, we will not letthem.  We insist that someone else take control of their life anddestiny.<p>	If a private company, by offering the best products, prices,and service to their customers gets "too much" of a market share, thereare cries that they are a "monopoly," and must--by decree--give up someof their business.  Yet we plead for the creation and maintenance ofpolitically'mandated monopolies which provide poor service at highprices.  Or at artificially low prices, with the organizations thenbeing supported by money taken from everyone--even those who do notavail themselves of the "service."</p>	<p>George Orwell called this phenomena "doublethink," when he said:</p><center><table border=4 cellspacing=5 width="80%"><tr><td>"Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one'smind simultaneously, and accepting both of them."</td></table><h4>The Hilary Factor</h4></center><p>	The Hilary Factor comprises a number of phenomena noted by greatthinkers of the past, all appearing in one person, who at this pointwill only be identified by a single name.

Does the political state truly appear to be winning?  No. Although statistics can be made to lie, I don't think anyone wouldseriously say that the disruptive factors in society are declining. And that the quality of life is increasing.  The only area in whichthat is true is in the technology available to use, but this happens inspite of the political state, not than because of it.<p>	As the political state uses increasingly Draconian force andthe fraud of doublethink identified by Orwell, the intervention of thestate into personal life increases.  With the only two possible actionsbeing to comply or oppose.  What are the two possible outcomes of this?</p><h4>The State Wins</h4><ul><li>The state wins, and keeps the controls in force	<p>	This would be the "winning" scenario of 1984, as outlined by George	Orwell in his magnificent and very perceptive book of the same name.	</p>	<li>The state wins, and magically eliminates all intervention into private life,	there are no more disruptive influences in society, and we enter	into Utopia.	<p>	If you believe this, then you will also believe that elephants roost	in trees.	</p></ul><p>	The state can "win" by using such complete force (and fraud)that truly all individual activity--if that still has meaning--iscontrolled completely.<p>	They can also "win" through biological technology such as outlinedin <i>Brave New World</i>, in which there are alphas, betas, gammas, etc.,bred to do the bidding of "Our Ford." I believe was his name?  Certainlyless awe'inspiring and terrifying than "President'for'Life, Doctor,Field Marshall Ford," yes?  Almost as benevolent and harmless as First Secretary.<p>Will <i>this</i> be the future of mankind?</p><h4>The State Loses</h4><p>	If the state loses, it could mean that something like a Hitlerappears, wherein--as was often said--criminals acceded to the powers ofthe state.  But then, by definition, this is still a political state. A mechanism ruling through coercion, by whatever means the individualor group arrives in that position.  Hitler, as all politicians do, usedboth force and fraud, and actually became the führer or politicalleader by "democratic" means.<p>	Will <i>this</i> be the future of mankind?</p><p>	For mankind these are the only these two possible scenarios(with  indicated variations) if we continue to ignore the lessons ofhistory.	<center><h4>Learn the Lessons of History</h4></center><p>	First we must recognize and accept the lessons of history whichtell us that coercive societies have never survived in the long termand never will.  Then, and only then, can we start to think of why thishas happened, to learn from history, and to think of and considerpossible solutions.  And to then implement the obvious and onlysolution.<p>	There is an existing, ready'to'use, off'the'shelf concept andsolution. It is a system which does not involve:<ul><li>force<li>fraud<li>interference in the life or property of another person.</ul><p>And,</p><center><table border=4 cellpadding=5 width="85%"><tr>	<td>	It is a system which you should consider and adopt in your personal	life only if you believe it has the possibility for enhancing	the quality of your own personal life, without interfering in	the life and property of another person.	</td></tr></table></center><p>	To intelligently consider possible solutions, and to then acceptone which is correct, we must have a method for determining rightnessin the social sphere.  Something we have long had, but used only thenon'volitional sphere of mankind's knowledge.  There is a fullexposition of this subject in my essay, How Do You Know You Are Right?<p>	As mentioned here and in other essays, the above statement andincluded solution to our social problems is consistent with the basicbehavioral characteristics of all thinking beings.  This means it willwork, and have "no adverse side effects."<a name="18r"><p>	Does this sound different than other proposed "solutions?"Where you must "sacrifice"<a href="#18">[18]</a>?  And which involvesfurther curtailment of what is left of personal freedom?  And, as pasthistory and current events shows us, was not a solution. </p>	<center><h4>The Solution</h4></center><p>	The traditional solution is that there must be more laws, withexisting laws being more vigorously enforced.  Yet, as we know, thishas not solved a single one of our societal problems.<p>	The solution involves understanding and using the two universaland basic laws of volitional behaviour.  These laws are:</p><p>The First Law of Volitional Behaviour:</p><a name="19r"><center><table border=4 cellpadding=5 width="70%"><tr>	<td align=center>	All volitional beings live to create, use, and enjoy	property.<a href="#19">[19]</a>	</td></tr></table></center><ul><p>Corollary:</p>	<ul>	<p>	All volitional beings seek to acquire the most amount of property with	the least amount of effort.	</p>	</ul></ul><p>	If you think about the first law, things must be that way. The conceptof volitional life under any other terms is unthinkable.  In principlethere is nothing wrong with this basic trait, and in fact if you thinkabout it is seems almost mandatory for any thinking being to have thisattribute.  The opposite is almost unthinkable.  It would create totalapathy and lethargy, and is in fact what might be part of an operativedefinition of "hell."  Along with the possibility of knowingeverything.  What would be the purpose of living if you kneweverything?  As Anatole France said:</p><a name="20r"><center><table border=4 cellpadding=5 width="70%"><tr>	<td align=center>	"Ignorance is the necessary condition of life itself.  If we knew	everything, we could not endure existence for a single	hour."<a href="#20">[20]</a>	</td></tr></table></center><p>	Forcing or deceiving people into providing goods and services isalso a prescription for continuing strife, as this interferes withtheir basic desire of having the most for the least amount of effort.<p>	Although I don't want to discuss it in detail here, as it is coveredin other essays, there is another reason for an individual to beresponsible for acquiring the means of survival for themselves.  Itinvolves the concept of morality and that which is moral.  Interferencein, and control of the property of another.  Employing this concept orallowing this to happen also lays the foundation for continuing strifein a society.  It is what causes people to use force or fraud in theachievement of their objectives.<p>	Principle No. 1 might also be a major reason for the statementthat man is "war'like," and that war will always be a part of humanlife and existence.  If the above basic trait did not have a balancingone which is equally powerful, this would be so.  And the specie wouldbe doomed to eternal strife, disorder, and war.	<p>What is this balancing trait?</p><p>The Second Law of Volitional Behaviour:</p><center><table border=4 cellpadding=5 width="50%"><tr>	<td align=center>	All volitional beings seeks happiness	</td></tr></table></center><p>	Do you think that is true or not true?  Would you dispute it orquibble about it?  Doesn't it seem natural?  Would an individual,acting of their own free will and without coercion, voluntarily chooseto be unhappy?<p>	That can occasionally appear to be so, but to have it actuallybe so--and a principle of life--is also unthinkable.<p>	Because each individual has their own definition and image ofhappiness, the operation of this principle can sometimes be deceptive. Especially when people will say they or another person are doingsomething for someone else. After all, could it bring happiness to aperson to drown in the process of saving their child?  This is somewhatof an extreme example, and I think if we can handle this example we mayachieve partial belief in the principle?<p>	Let's look at it from the other side.  You go ahead and letyour child drown because obviously you might or will die, and who wantsto do that?  Yet any sane and rational parent would be devastated bythe thought they had let their child die while they lived.  If I lastedlong enough to shave the next morning and look at myself in the mirror,I would probably kill myself then and there.<p>	Of course you don't want to die, but the life you have createdis as precious or more so than your own.  And always the thought thatthey have almost their entire life ahead of them and have experiencednone of it, while yours is perhaps one'third finished.  Not to speak ofthat wonderful thing called "love," and of caring for someone.<p>	Further, what would your wife, children, relatives and friendsthink of a person who had been unwilling to make the effort?  Thisalone could create a lifetime of unhappiness.<p>	Granted, the decision to leap into the water is not prefaced byall of these thoughts, although undoubtedly for many parents thethought of giving up their life for their child has crossed their mind. The thought had been planted in their mind that, "Yes, I would dothat."  Also, we are surrounded by stories of people who have donethat. So, while our action is spontaneous and without thinking, thethinking and desire to take that action if necessary has already beendone.  We know that if we did not do it we would be truly unhappy.<a name="21r"><p>	The statement does not say that a person will find happiness,only that they will seek it.  Often to seek it in the sense of arelative happiness.  This is especially true in political societieswherein a person is presented with falsealternatives.<a href="#21">[21]</a>  Such as:</p><ul>	<li>Would you rather pay a 55% or a 50% tax?<li>Would you rather pay a $1,000 road tax or to not drive your car?<li>Would you rather go off and fight the régime's war, or go to prison?</ul><p>	If we are to have "laws" or rules for regulating society, whichdoes seem a necessity, would it not be better if they took intoconsideration the basics laws of human behaviour?  Rather than thecurrent system, which seems intent on trying to violate the laws ofhuman behaviour?<p>	Why not say something so simple as the fact that a person coulddo anything they wished as long as it did not involve interference inthe property of another person?  Would this not allow a person to tryto create, accumulate, use and enjoy property as long as they did notdo something which reduced the happiness of another person?  Or theirability to create, accumulate, use and enjoy property?	<p>This would seem to create a situation with minimal societal strife.</p><p>	Of course the next question is, how do we enforce such a situation?  Abetter way to phrase it might be to say "how do we ensure that such asituation will occur?"  That there will be minimal propertyinterference?  I say minimal to allow for mistakes, accidents, and thevicissitudes of human behavior.  That even under the best of conditionsthere may be some interference in the property of another.<p>	As soon as we think of "enforcing" something it implies force. Which is the current system that has not worked even with millennia of"tweaking" or adjusting the basic system of the use of force.  Isn'tthere something that might "control" the behaviour of individualswithout the use of force?  The answer is to be found in The Second Law. The principle upon which to base the system, while the system itselfis to be found in an existing, moral system for regulating behaviour. That is our credit system:  The system of recording and storing aperson's credit history, and in allowing them access to additionalcredit based on that credit history.<p>	All that is needed is to expand the concept of financial creditto include an individual's entire credit'worthiness.  Their credit as afunctioning, individual human being.  And, again, in principle it isvery easy to measure that.  The basic thing to measure is whether ornot they interfere in the property of another person.<p>	This can be modified by how they handle mistakes related to propertyinterference, recognizing that individual human beings--at least at thisstage of evolution--are not infallible and do make mistakes.<p>	If a person has a record of a few such mistakes and has alwayshandled them promptly and properly by admitting the mistake and makingoffers of and paying restitution, that is all to their positive credit. In a sense it can be like the present time, in which people who borrowmoney and pay it back sometimes have a higher credit rating than thosewho have never borrowed money.  You know how the act under the stressof an obligation.<p>	In a different sense, a person who performed a deliberate actof property interference and--eventually--also admitted the mistake, madean offer of restitution and paid restitution, would have a relativelylower rating.  But perhaps not one to cause them major credit problems.<p>	It is our failure to properly and completely understand thesignificance and concept of property that has prohibited us fromunderstanding the simplicity, elegance and utility of the concept ofcredit.  And how to apply it to the "regulating" of a society.<a name="22r"><p>	In a rational and durable society all property within the realm ofthe associated volitional specie will have an owner.  As I havediscussed elsewhere,<a href="#22">[22]</a> ownership is a moralconcept, and must be differentiated from control.<p>	Control of property is moral if you are the owner of that property orhave been delegated control of the property under terms specified bythe owner.<p>	But how can this actually be used to regulate society and limitproperty interference?  How can it regulate societal activities withoutthe use of force?</p>	<p>Simple.  "Simple, he says?!"  Yes.  Remember, and think…</p><ul><li>	All property has an owner;<li>	Access to property can be morally restricted by an owner;<li>	All individuals seeks happiness;<li>	A credit rating can be used to determine whether or not you would	want someone to have access to your property;<li>	Property may be	<ul>	<li>	a food store	<li>	a petrol station	<li>	a telephone company	<li>	a road or roads;	<li>	a school;	<li>	a park;	<li>	a library	<li>	an electricity company;	<li>	etc.	</ul><li>	There are existing "credit clearing houses" which can tell you the	credit rating of a person;</ul><a name="23r"><p>	How would you assemble these thoughts into a mechanism for regulatingbehaviour in a society without the use of coercion?  Without needing apolice force, prisons,<a href="#23">[23]</a> etc.? As said above, simple…<p>	Under the basic laws of nature, which our current societal systemsbased on coercion attempt to circumvent, all volitional beings haveaccess to the universe.  Restricted only by recognizing that allproperty has an owner.  And that volitional life will not survive ifeach individual does not allow access to their property consistent withthe market value of such access,<p>	In such a manner that maximizes the happiness of owner andprospective user.<p>	A person who owns a property cannot maximize their return ontheir investment--and thus their happiness--without allowing access totheir property at such a price that also maximizes the happiness ofusers.<p>	If you think this sounds "idealistic" it is.  It's the ideal conceptand situation.  It is based on valid thought processes, is rational andmoral--and thus right on an absolute basis--and will work.  It also meansit is the only system which will work in the long term.  I dislike anddistrust people who deprecate an idea or concept by saying it is"idealistic" when they don't know what they are talking about.  Such asHTB.<p>	All individuals would be allowed access to property on the samebasis that a person is now authorized access to products and servicesthrough the use of a credit card.  People are allowed access toproducts and services based on their credit rating.  As long as theyhave sufficient credit, they can avail themselves of products andservices based on the terms and conditions stated by the owner andprovider of those products and services.<p>	If a person interfered in the property of another, their creditrating would be "lowered."  Probably to zero.  Since all property hasan owner, this would restrict their access to many or all services.Electricity, telephone, road and school services, petrol stations, foodvendors, etc.  This would "reduce the happiness" of the person whowished to avail themselves of these products and services.<p>	This in turn would be a powerful incentive for the person tosay, "Hey, I'm sorry I did that. I propose an offer of (some amount) asrestitution, including for inconvenience, etc." When the victim of theproperty interference accepts such an offer and the restitution ispaid, then the person's credit rating is restored.  With appropriateannotations.</p>	<p>The same principle can handle all questions a person might raise,such as:</p><ul><li>	What happens in the case of false accusations;<li>	What do you do in the situation when the "property interference" is the	death or serious injury of a person;<li>	Next case</ul><p>	I could continue writing with examples and the answering ofobjections, but the maximum learning, understanding and comprehensiontakes place when a person thinks for themselves.<a name="24r"><p>	Bearing in mind that during the approximate 50,000 years ofevolution of Homo Sapien<a href="#24">[24]</a> our current system ofregulating societal behaviour has not worked.

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><center><h4>Synopsis</h4><table border=4 cellpadding=5 width="80%"><tr><td>The ability to determine right from not right has been the basis for ourmodern technological world.  The failure to use the same intellectualtool in the social sphere is the cause of all our societal problems. The solution to all of these problems is simple if we but clear awaythe pollution in our minds.</td></tr></table><h4>Background</h4></center><p>	This is a very profound question for any volitional specie.  Perhaps<i>the</i> most profound question of all.  More important than questions suchas "What is the purpose of life?"  Why this is so should be obvious. If there is no way to determine whether an idea is right or notright--correct or incorrect--then there is no way to accumulate usefulknowledge.  The specie would therefore be doomed to stay as they areor, more likely, to quickly self-destruct.  A viable civilization ofthinking beings could not develop, let alone survive.<p>	The need for such a tool--to know if you are right on anysubject--should be so obvious as to bring into question the sanity of aperson who would wonder at the need for such a concept or tool.<p>	To not have such a tool would--by default and definition--mean that anyresult was acceptable, whether it was desirable or undesirable, good orbad.  In fact, even the concepts of good and bad, desirable orundesirable, acceptable or not acceptable, could not have meaning andthus would not exist.<p>	Anyone who understands something about nature realizes that thelaws of nature are immutable and unchanging.  When they appear to bechanging or changeable it is only because we do not have a full andcorrect understanding of a particular law of nature or of the phenomenainvolved.<p>	If this were not so, nothing in the universe would work consistently.There would be true and total chaos.  Even assuming we could developthe concept of airplanes and television and the associated products(which by definition would be impossible), they would not perform thesame from one time to the next.  The television set would fly and theairplane would display pictures and sound and not fly.  One time youwould need to put petrol in the tank of your car and the next timesugar.<p>	Sometimes when you stepped off a cliff you would float or riserather than falling.  Water and fire could at different times be thesame or opposite things.<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	One reason why computers can sometimes be frustrating is that--whenthey are functioning as designed--they are <i>totally</i> consistent. For some people this can even be a wonderfully "intoxicating" thing. Unlike people, whose behavior may <i>appear</i> to be inconsistent<ahref="#1">[1]</a>, computers are obviously totally consistent, doingexactly the same thing for the same input.  The same result for a givenstimulus.  Which also makes them the basis for a wonderful teachingtool for children or adults.<p>	Computers are both a product of nature--or, more correctly, ofour understanding of nature--and a perfect example of nature in action.  Immutable and consistent. This also--in principle--makes them easy tounderstand, unlike people.<p>	If, for the sake of argument, we accept that it is true we needsome method of determining if something is right or not right, then wecould discuss two types of rightness:</p><ul>	<li>relative rightness	<li>absolute rightness</ul><p>Then we will consider it as it applies to;</p><ul>	<li>knowledge of our non-volitional world.		<p>	<a name="2r">	</p>	<p>	What is commonly called "science."<a href="#2">[2]</a>	</p>	<li>knowledge of our volitional world	<p>	<a name="3r">	</p>	<p>	What is commonly and incorrectly called "social	science.<a href="#3">[3]</a>"	</p></ul><center><h4>Relative Rightness</h4></center><p>	Relative rightness is similar to "situation ethics, " about which somepeople complain.  And rightfully so.  <i>Situation ethics</i> says thatwhatever is "ethical" changes depending on the subject of discussion oraction, perhaps even the time of action.<p>	A relative concept of rightness is in many ways worse than noconcept of rightness.  It presents the thinker with a "moving target." It provides the <i>illusion</i> that there <i>could</i> be rightness,but then says that it does not exist.  Which describes our currentsituation with volitional knowledge--knowledge concerning thebehavioral relationship of and between the members of our specie.<p>	In political societies, although most people would deny that itis true, "might" often determines what is acceptable in a society.  Irejected the idea of saying "... determines what is <i>right</i>, because Idon't wish to sully the term further.  The old saying of "Might MakesRight."  It is the acceptance of this concept that dooms ourcivilization and specie to endless strife. A rational and perceptiveperson should wonder why we reject the actions of a Hitler, and thenaccept--although sometimes reluctantly--someone such as a Kennedy whomakes war on the hapless Vietnamese.   And having the temerity to sayhe is doing it for "freedom."  Which, incidentally, was Hitler'sexcuse.<p><a name="4r"></p><p>	Although people profess outrage when a person uses force toaccomplish their ends, ultimately it is almost always accepted.  And isthe story of the history of our specie, which consists of anever-ending rendition of one person conquering the people of anothersocietal group, with the individuals doing the conquering being theleading politician (führer or ruler) of their particular politicalentity.  The "relativity" of the situation says that is okay forpoliticians to make war and kill people, but not okay for ordinarysubjects of the régime to do the same.<a href="#4">[4]</a>  This isrelativity in action.	<center><h4>Absolute Rightness</h4></center><p>	What do I mean by the concept of "absolute" as differentiatedfrom "relative"?  When a concept is <i>absolute</i> it means that it appliesunder all conditions, in all situations, and at any and all times. That there are no exceptions or cases under which it does not apply.<p>	With this short description we are now ready to discuss thesolution--the method for determining if anything is right or not right.	<center><h4>The Solution</h4></center><p>	Since most readers should have at least some intuitive understandingof how rightness is determined in the non-volitional world, I willdiscuss this first.<h4>Rightness in the Non-Volitional World</h4><p>	This is the first area of knowledge--and so far the only area--inwhich we have successfully applied the concept of rightness.  Itsapplication to this area of knowledge has produced our moderntechnological world.  Failure to apply it to our volitional world isthe reason for all our societal problems.<p>	It was Isaac Newton who first explicitly and grandly appliedthe concept to what is commonly called "science."  The result was his"System of the Worlds," as expressed in his monumental book <i>PrincipiaMathematica</i>.<p><a name="5r"></p><p>	It is generally thought that Newton's most important works were hislaws of motion and gravity.  While enormously important, his<i>method</i> of creating these laws was the truly significant part ofhis work. That and the message which accompanied it, saying that "theuniverse is comprehensible, and here is how to learn more about it." That it is full of knowable<a href="#5">[5]</a>, useful knowledge, andhere is the method for discovering it.  It was the application of thisconcept and the knowledge it created which was the proximate cause ofthe Industrial Revolution.<p>	This--the integration of the non-volitional sciences--representedthe first of two integrations of knowledge which are required for anyvolitional specie to make the transition to a rational and durablesocial structure.<p>	The tragedy in this is that everyone has always <i>assumed</i> thatthis method for determining rightness applies only to thenon-volitional world.  They do this with the deprecating comment that"... well, you can't apply this to human behavior."  What they are tryingto say with the statement is that human beings and their basicbehavioral characteristics are not part of nature--that human beings donot follow the laws of nature in their behavior.  Since we live in <i>this</i>world--and not another and different world--that statement is ignorant,supercilious, and ridiculous.  It is equivalent to the religious beliefthat our specie is the only intelligent life form in this universe, andthat this planet is the center of the universe.<p><a name="6r"></p><p>	Although I do not wish to discuss extensively here the creation ofknowledge--since it is covered in other writings--I would like tocredit the great R&eacute;ne Descartes<a href="#6">[6]</a> with his conceptthat "all theoretical science [knowledge] should be like Euclideangeometry."  In the sense that knowledge on any subject must be based on"axioms," similar to those used in geometry.  An equivalent conceptbeing the formulation of postulates as the basis for creating new anduseful knowledge on any subject..  That there must be a least two suchpostulates, but probably not three.  And that there can be no<i>meaningful</i> progress in any area of knowledge without such postulates.<p>	This is the reason that after millennia of experimenting withpolitics, our societal structures still have the same problems they hadthousands of years ago.  The reason it will continue, and become worse,with only two possible outcomes.  Mankind will abandon the concept thatsocietal structures based on coercion is an acceptable foundingprinciple for a volitional society, or our specie will continue itsinexorable decline into oblivion.<p>	Descartes thought that laws of nature could be seen to be truethrough the use of reason alone, which was elegantly proven--as if itneeded to be proven--by Einstein.  The only thing needed to accomplishthis is the use of the epistemological tool mankind has always used toacquire and validate new and useful knowledge.<p>	I hesitate to even mention the name for the method of determiningrightness in the non-volitional world, since--as alluded to above--allnon-thinkers will immediately say "Hah!  You are talking about scienceand we need to talk about the world of people, the behavior of people,and about out social structures!"  Please, bear with me...<p>	The epistemological tool we use in what is commonly called "science"is <i>The Scientific Method</i>.  Basically, this involves:</p><ol>		<li>Make one or more hypotheses that <i>may</i> explain a phenomena.	<li>Collect data which, when analyzed and processed <i>may</i> confirm		one of the hypotheses;	<li>Through observation, which can be as part of a planned		experiment or observing a process or phenomena in nature,		attempt to corroborate each hypothesis;	<li>If you can corroborate one <i>hypothesis</i>, then you have created a		<b>theory</b>.</ol><p>	I have somewhat altered the generally accepted steps of the scientificmethod--but not the principles themselves--to more accurately describethe order in which things are generally done.<p>	Assuming an innovator or discoverer makes no errors, then bydisclosing the theory and the method used to corroborate it, othersshould be able to repeat the process and also verify the event. Confirming that what was formerly a hypothesis is indeed a <i>theory</i>.<p>	If this in fact does determine that which is right in thenon-volitional world, how could we summarize this process in just a fewwords?<p>	We could summarize all of the above by saying that the definition of<i>rightness</i> in the non-volitional ("scientific") world is:</p><center><table border=4 cellpadding=5><tr><td>That which is true and valid</td></tr></table></center><p>In other words, that which is:</p><ul>	<li>Based on true premises,	<li>analyzed using valid logic processes, and	<li>corroborated by observation.</ul><center><h4>Volitional Knowledge</h4></center><p>	We have done most of the difficult work to apply the concept tothe volitional domain.  Rather it was done for us by people such asDescartes, [Francis] Bacon, and Galambos.  And in fact it was Galamboswho extended the concept of Bacon and Descartes from the non-volitionalsciences to the volitional sciences.  And, as is common in knowledgecreation, once someone explains the solution to a previously unsolvedproblem, that solution now seems "obvious." For, as ChristianMorgenstern the Younger said:<p><a name="7r"></p><center>"Das Offensichtliche ist das, was man nicht sieht, bis jeman es	erkl&auml;rt."<a href="#7">[7]</a></center><p>	We intuitively know what type of human behavior is "right," butyet--until Galambos--no one took the "simple and obvious" step ofapplying that concept and component to the non-volitional concept ofrightness.  Thereby adapting the principle so that rightness in thevolitional domain may be determined as easily as in the non-volitionaldomain of mankind's knowledge.  This is the concept of <i>morality</i>, orthat which is <i>moral</i>.<p><a name="8r"></p><p>	Galambos therefore performed the second and last integrationof knowledge required of any volitional specie to escape the tyranny ofcoercion-based societies and evolve a social structure whose time scaleof existence will be concomitant with that of their universe.<ahref="#8">[8]</a><p>	Therefore, rightness in the social domain may be expressed bythe statement:</p><center><table border=4 cellpadding=5><tr>		<td>	That which is true, valid, and moral.	</td></tr></table></center><p>	Of course a related problem is that mankind has never had an absolutedefinition of what was moral.  The perceptive person should havealready thought of the solution for this problem:  Use the scientificmethod to create and corroborate a definition for <i>morality</i> or <i>moral</i>.<p>	The integration of the non-volitional sciences before that ofthe volitional sciences creates a dangerous quandary for a volitionalspecie.  It allows them to create the technological ability to destroytheir own specie, while not having the behavioral and associatedsocietal knowledge of how to prevent this.<p>	It is only within the past fifty years or so that we have crossed thethreshold into the "twilight zone."  Prior to that, if one politicalgroup destroyed another, while representing the ultimate personalcatastrophe for each individual who died, it did not endanger thespecie itself.  That is no longer true.  We could destroy our speciewith biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons.<p>	So-called "environmentalists" hold out the concept of the apocalypsebeing caused by pollution.  I agree with them, but not in the sensethey would like.  Pollution will be the proximate cause of the demiseof any end to viable volitional life on this planet, but it will be thepollution of the <i>mind</i>, caused by accepting things which have not beenproven to be false, as being true.  As Thomas Paine said,</p><p><a name="9r"></p><center><table border=4 cellpadding=5><tr>	<td>	"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong,<br>gives it a superficial		appearance of being right"<a href="#9">[9]</a>	</td></tr></table></center><p>	The pollution of knowledge caused by not being able to tell thedifference between right and not right.</p>	<hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>My essay "Human Need" discusses the two basic	principles upon which all human behavior is based.		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>With a good definition of science being "organized,	useful knowledge."		<a href="#2r">Return</a><p><a name="3"><li>This represents a contradiction in terms, since	"science" implies organized knowledge, and the information available	in that area (I do not wish to dignify it by calling "knowledge") is	definitely not organized and universally agreed upon.		<a href="#3r">Return</a><p><a name="4"><li>As Voltaire said, "It is forbidden to kill...unless	to trumpets."		<a href="#4r">Return</a><p><a name="5"><li>There is a very important difference between that	which is knowable but not yet known (or discovered), and that	which is unknowable.

This essay discusses the historic concept of the "job," andthe solution to our current problems of innovation, productivity, andquality.</td></table><hr><h4>Preface</h4></center><p><a name="1r"></p><p>	Nothing I say here should be new or startling to a person.  Infact, it may appear so "obvious and common" that the reader may wonderwhy I bother to say it.  As Christian Morgenster The Younger said:</p>	<ul>	<p>	"Das Offensichtliche ist das, was man nicht sieht, bis jeman es 	erkl&auml;rt."<a href="#1">[1]</a>	</p></ul><p>	In fact, a basic problem is that the ideas are so simple and obviousthat most people do not consider them a possible solution to theproblems of innovation, productivity, and quality.	<p><a name="2r"></p><p>This is generally because of a phenomena noted by Thomas Paine when he said:</p><ul>	<p>	"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial	appearance of being right... "<a href="#2">[2]</a>	</p></ul><p>	Yet I have found that the more successful a company is, the moreof my ideas and concepts they are using.  Still, no one company isusing all of them, and certainly not using them explicitly or properly. And is thus not maximizing their long-term profits, which is thesubject of this essay.<p>	This is an attempt to bring the ideas together in a format which willbe understandable to the reader.  The astute and perceptive reader willimmediately grasp the simplicity and elegance of the concepts, and theease of application.	<center><h4>Background</h4></center><p>	As any rational person realizes, profits are essential to theviability of any organization purporting to offer products and servicesto a market.  They are necessary to provide the resources and incomefor, among other things,</p><ul>		<p>	<a name="3r">	</p>	<p>	<li>	New product research;	</p>		<p>	<li>	product improvement research;	</p>		<p>	<li>	funding production of prototypes, whether of a product or		service;<a href="#3">[3]</a>	</p>	<p>	<li>	funding market research and marketing during the early stages		of a product or possible product;	</p>		<p>	<li>	compensating investors.	</p></ul><p>	Profits however perform a more basic function than this.  Theyare a "marker" or indicator of successful company management.  There isa direct relationship between the profitability of a company and thenumber of things done right.  Such as,</p><ul>	<p>	<li>	Product quality;	</p>		<p>	<li>	productivity;	</p>		<p>	<li>	market acceptance and satisfaction.	</p></ul><p>	During the past approximately 100 years there has been an increasingawareness of the need to satisfy these criteria.  And, with it, anincreasing number of ways for accomplishing this, with many of thembeing fads of the moment.<p>	Interestingly, and probably accidentally since there is--as faras I know--no explicit and complete discussion of the subject, the bestsystem existed several hundred years ago.  The system in which a personwas engaged or contracted to do a "job," then being paid for successfulcompletion of the job.  Unfortunately, before explicit thinking and acohesive explanation of this process was written or published, it wasswamped by the system of mass production and companies ofever-increasing size.  Including the concept of putting workers intogroups or classes and then paying them the same amount on an hourlybasis.  And, although this would be and is denied, virtually regardlessof the quantity and quality of their work.  In principle this is whathappens.<p>	As is normal in the creation and evolution of knowledge, manyof these ideas and fads were at least partially correct.  For example,a production organization could benefit from:</p><ul>	<p>	<li>	Controlling costs;	</p>		<p>	<li>	"wellness and fitness" of individuals;	</p>		<p>	<li>	empowerment, and the associated individual initiative;	</p>		<p>	<li>	quality,  even if done in circles, and especially "zero-defects";	</p>		<p>	<a name="4r">	</p>	<p>	<li>	strategic planning;	</p>		<p>	<li>	entrepreneurship, both external and internal (so-called		"intrapreneurship<a href="#4">[4]</a>")	</p>		<p>	<li>	"job enhancement" (a great catch-all)	</p>		<p>	<li>	"sticking to your knitting";	</p>		<p>	<li>	"management by walking about" (see what's going on--or not		going on--in the company);	</p>		<p>	<li>	"the share economy" (a vain attempt, along with "profit		sharing," to compensate individuals according to their production);	</p>		<p>	<li>	theory x, y and z, which, as any mathematician knows, are variable;	</p>	<p>	<li>	training (no one can argue with that).	</p></ul><p>	I do not remember or have access to information on most of theabove concepts, but I wish to give credit to the creators of theconcepts.<p>	Before continuing with a detailed discussion of the above, Iwould like to return to a generalization I made above:<p>	There is a direct relationship between the profitability of a companyand the number of things it does correctly.<p><a name="5r"></p><p>Repeating myself,<a href="#5">[5]</a> long-term profitability can only be achieved through</p><ul>	<p>	<li>	Product quality;	</p>		<p>	<li>	product innovation;	</p>		<p>	<li>	market acceptance of the product(s).	</p></ul><p>	Of course other things are required, such as controlling costsand ensuring productivity, but I would put them under the bonnet ofbeing a successful entrepreneur.<p>	And in fact, I think everything can be summed up by the laststatement, with anything else being in a supporting role.  There willbe long term market acceptance of a company's products only when thecompany is doing virtually everything right.  Granted, as human beings,there is always the possibility of an occasional error or omission, butas these asymptotically approach zero, the profitability of the companyapproaches its maximum.<p>If this is agreed, then the "only" thing remaining is how to maximize:</p><ul>	<p>	<li>	Innovation;	</p>		<p>	<li>	quality;	</p>		<p>	<li>	productivity.	</p></ul><p>	As the discussion unfolds, you will see that the application ofa very simple principle and concept, easily employed, allows thesefactors to be maximized,  Further, as a byproduct, all the othernecessary activities or attributes are handled.  Such as:</p>	<ul>		<p>	<li>	Cost control;	</p>		<p>	<li>	training;	</p>		<p>	<li>	attendance at the workplace;	</p></ul><p>	Including even such problems as vacations and holidays, pensions,medical insurance and assorted other items now deemed to almostintractable.  I won't elaborate on that statement, but leave it to theperson who wishes to do some thinking on their own to realize how andwhy this is true.<p>	In employing the new process, all past and present fads--at least thevalid parts of them--will be covered, such as:</p><ul>		<p>	<li>	Management by objective;	</p>	<p>	<li>	operations research;	</p>	<p>	<li>	time & motion studies;	</p>	<p>	<li>	decentralization;	</p>	<p>	<li>	recentralization	</p>	<p>	<li>	empowerment;	</p>	<p>	<li>	job enhancement;	</p>	<p>	<li>	sticking to your knitting (and not sticking to it);	</p>	<p>	<li>	quality circles;	</p>	<p>	<li>	intrapreneurship;	</p>	<p>	<li>	the share economy (and profit sharing);	</p>		<p>	<li>	theory x, y, and z (which covers everything else).	</p></ul><p>	Let's examine some of the more serious concepts that almostanyone would consider as important to the success of a business. Wewill find that they are all much more closely related than is realized.<center><h4>Solution</h4></center>	<h4>Empowerment</h4><p><a name="6r"></p><p>For the purpose of this discussion, I will define this term as follows:</p><ul>	<p>	"Allowing the individual to maximize the decision(s) regarding how and	when something is to be done."<a href="#6">[6]</a>	</p></ul><p>	What is the optimum way to do this?  By providing the product orservice specification, and then allowing the person to make thedecision how it will be done.  For a tangible product this may be avery detailed specification, while for a service it may only specify adesired outcome.  Such as "increasing sales by 20%," or "satisfying thecustomer."  The latter of course being the required end-result for anyproduct or service.<p><a name="7r"></p><p>	The best way of doing this is the "job" concept of several hundredyears ago, or the system under which a person might contract for theservices of a gardener, baby sitter, or airline pilot today.<a href="#7">[7]</a></p><ul>		<p>	<li>	Provide the person with a product or service specification;	</p>		<p>	<li>	agree on when it must be completed;	</p>		<p>	<li>	agree on the price for satisfactory completion.	</p></ul><p>	The specification must include the quality, which for most productswould be the fabled, but no longer fabulous, "zero-defects," togetherwith the handling of the situation when and if there are defects.  Ofcourse any such defects must be for the account of the "defector"--theindividual who creates them.	<h4>Quality</h4><p>	In principle we have already covered this: The standard for jobcompletion and delivery is "no defects."  With the person creating aproduct with defects being responsible for rectifying them, includingreimbursement for wasted resources if this occurs.  Whether they arematerials, electricity provided by the contractor, the use ofmachine-aids, or anything else.<p>	Quality now becomes almost a non-consideration, with total qualitybeing an assumed attribute.  If not there initially, it appears soon orthere is no payment for task performance.  Which of course has a majorinput to profitability.  And of course end-customer satisfaction.<p>	When an individual is put in the position where they must recognizeand correct their own mistakes (not the mistakes of others, unless paidto do so), a wonderful thing happens.  It is called "learning byexperience," with the end result being constantly increasingcompetence.  And, in a system where a person is compensated basedalmost exclusively on their own, individual competence, their earningability is suddenly much less restricted than before.  And, any such"restrictions" on their earnings are not imposed on them by someoneelse.  The correction of which are under their own control.	<h4>Training</h4><p>	The astute reader will realize that training now takes care of itself. Why?  Because the better and faster the individual can perform a task,the higher their income.  There is now a direct and positiverelationship between education, ability, imagination, and drive.  Themajor attributes an individual brings to any task.<p>	The individual will now have a "burning interest" in their owneducation.  They may satisfy this by investigating and funding theirown, direct means of accomplishing this, or even by negotiating a dealwith the contractor or entrepreneur under which they work together fortheir mutual benefit.  As opposed to the current adversarial system inwhich the individual complains they are not getting adequate training. With the company then arranging and funding it with some degree oftrepidation, if not reluctance.	<h4>Innovation</h4><p>	This old-fashioned method of handling jobs also opens the doorto the main way in which innovation is encouraged and will flourish,and in which the individual truly assumes control of their own destiny. And becomes an entrepreneur in their own right, and not simply a"worker."<p>	When people are left to do a job on their own, an interestingthing takes place.  A basic law of volitional behavior comes into play:<p>	Individual thinking beings seek to acquire the most amount ofproperty for the least amount of effort.<p>	This is an elegant way of saying that individual human beingsare lazy.  A phenomena taken into consideration by Henry Ford. Undertaking  a new project, he would--in a sense--look for the laziest(but capable) person he knew.  He would put that person in charge ofthe project, knowing they would look for shortcuts.  A common way ofsaying the individual would "innovate."  Innovation is the key to:</p><ul>		<p>	<li>	New products;	</p>		<p>	<li>	improved products;	</p>		<p>	<li>	product manufacturing processes;	</p>		<p>	<li>	improved product manufacturing processes;	</p>		<p>	<li>	productivity;	</p>		<p>	<li>	quality.	</p></ul><p>	In fact, nothing happens without innovation.  There is no product orway to produce one.  Yet we do almost everything that could be done toprevent or inhibit innovation.  With the most significant being ourmethod of production compensation: Paying people on the basis of BeingThere.  By their presence in the workplace, almost regardless of thequantity and quality of work.  Rather than on the basis of:</p>	<center>		<p>		The market value of their error-free production.		</p></center><p>	It just slipped out.  I have given you the key to dramatic increasesin all factors of production:</p>	<ul>	<p>	<li>	Innovation;	</p>		<p>	<li>	productivity;	</p>		<p>	<li>	quality.	</p></ul><p>and therefore to long-term profitability</p><h4>Productivity</h4><p>I just gave you the answer to this problem in the section above on innovation.</p><h4>Profit Sharing</h4><p>	This also needs no further discussion, since--in any case--the conceptis a non-starter.  It is actually communism and/or socialism broughtinto the production environment.<p>	When each individual is compensated for their production according toits error-free market value, we no longer need the concept of "profitsharing."</p>	<center><h4>Conclusion</h4></center><p>	I believe the reader should do some thinking and draw their ownconclusion to the above statements.  In a sense I don't care what theyare.  If you agree with me, then you have learned something.  If youdon't, there can be no doubt about the validity of the ideas, so it isyour loss and not mine.  Except that I will lose also, because we willcontinue to do things in an irrational and immoral way, and it is nocomfort to be me that I am right while everything continues to limpalong as before.</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol>	<p><a name="1"><li>	"The obvious is that which is not seen until	someone first expresses it clearly."

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><table border=4 width="100%"><td><center><h4>Synopsis</h4></center><p>This essay will explain and discuss one of the two basic, motivationaland behavioral characteristics of volitional beings: The desire tocreate, accumulate, and use property.  And, how this is contrary to thewishes of the politicians, who want to control and limit theaccumulation and use of individual property.  How this creates thesearch for "loopholes" in the system, with the politicians also lookingfor them, but to close them.  How this creates increasing stresses inthe associated society, leading to increasing violence and the eventualdestruction of the society.</p></table><hr><p>	We hear a lot about loopholes.  Almost everyone looks for them. Individuals look for them.  Looking for a way to avoid or reduce thisor that tax.  Companies look for them.  A way to get around this orthat regulation.  Bureaucrats look for them of course, but fordifferent reasons.  Individuals and companies want to find them to gothrough them: Politicians and the sub-class "bureaucrat" want to findthem to close them.<p>	Each group has their own reason for finding loopholes, and theyoften search for different types of loopholes.  Almost like a treasurehunt, and there often is a treasure at the end of the hunt, which isthe reason for searching for loopholes.  It all seems like a jollygame, yet it is anything but funny, as it has vast implications for theviability and even the survival of political societies.  And,eventually, of the specie itself.<p>	Why do individuals and companies search for loopholes?	<p>	The answer is obvious and simple: Individuals wish to preserve,safeguard, augment, and enhance their property. And, although this issimple and obvious, it has a very profound meaning and consequences.<p>	The desire to create, accumulate, and enjoy property is a basictrait of all volitional beings.  The recognition of this and how it isimplemented in a society of volitional beings is crucial to itsprosperity and even to its survival, since it is <i>the</i> basic behavioralcharacteristic of an individual being and, therefore, of a society ofvolitional beings.<p>	When I refer to property I include all types of property, andnot just the obvious--tangible property.  I include ideas, or what isoften called "intellectual" property.  And even the pleasurable ideasof a human being, such as the enjoyment of a sunset, of seeing a childsmile, or smelling a rose, feeling the touch of another human being. This intangible property is in fact even more important than thetangible type, for it is a necessary precursor to the creation oftangible property.  The beauty of the sound of a symphony orchestra,the image of a ballerina such as Margot Fonteyn in <i>Nutcracker</i>, or anice skater dancing to <i>Swan Lake</i> may send the mind on a beautifulvoyage of new, wonderful, and useful ideas which will benefit all humanbeings.  Besides bringing enjoyment to the listener.<p>	If this concept of the importance of property and its functionis recognized by the societal structure and not hindered, that societywill flourish and survive in the long term.  Meaning a periodconcomitant with that of their universe.  If it is not recognized, andattempts are made to curtail this basic characteristic of volitionalbeings regarding property creation and use, then the associated societywill rise and then fall, to be replaced by another.  With the cyclerepeating itself until the end of the acceptance of coercion as a basisfor social structures, or the end of the associated specie. Thephenomena Gibbon recognized in his magnificent work "The Rise and Fallof the Roman Empire."  The fate of the Roman Empire can be generalizedfor all societies having the same operational principle as the RomanEmpire--that of a society based on coercion.<p>	The astute reader will immediately recognize the problem: That, since all individuals live to enjoy property, and</p><ul><p>	any curtailment of this desire will produce friction betweenthe individual and the controller(s).</p></ul><p>	The more friction, the more heat (another law of nature), andthe greater the disorder (a related law of nature).<p>	There are many pieces of evidence throughout history to supportthis.  The rise and fall of political societies.  The famous ones ofhistory such as Byzantium, the Egypt of the Pharaohs, the democracy ofGreece, the monarchy of the Romans, Spanish, Portuguese, and BritishEmpires.  In recent times the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the RussianEmpire, both that of the classic Czars and the Communist czars.  Andnow we watch with fascination and incomprehension as the formerYugoslavia is split asunder.<p>	Another piece of evidence is the subject of this essay: Loopholes. The struggle by individuals to find them and exploit them, and of thepolitical masters to close them. And, interestingly, each is trying topreserve and to augment their respective property.<p>	For the individual it might be to save some money on taxes, orto prevent confiscation of some real property such as a car or house. The politician is preserving their own personal job and the system inwhich they function.  I won’t dignify it by saying "... the system inwhich they ‘work’," as <i>work</i> is a positive and useful concept.  Itinvolves the creation of property, whereas the activity of thepolitician and bureaucrat involves the control, destruction ordissemblement of property.<p>	This has always gone on in political societies--social structuresbased on  coercion--and will always do so because it is basic to thebehavior of a volitional being.<p>	In the early stages of coercive societies there is relatively less ofthis activity, as the coercion is relatively less with more opportunityto protect individual property.  A good example of this is the earlydays of what is commonly called "the United States."  There wasrelatively little coercion, since the US was largely founded on thebasis of getting away from the rigid and relatively much higher levelof coercion in Europe and other places.<p>	The kings and other rulers of Europe during the period preceding andduring the mass exodus to the United States would be green with envy ifthey could see the level of coercion in the United States now.  Thearea of less or no coercion to which their subjects fled has changedconsiderably.<p>	When even this mild level of coercion in the 1700s and early 1800s ofthe United States became too much, individuals moved west to get awayfrom it.  The result of this relatively low level of coercion was thecreation of the foundation for the economic power of the United States. It was an atmosphere in which interest in the creation of propertyvastly exceeded interest and willingness in controlling and curtailingit.<p>	One way of curtailing property accumulation is through inheritancetaxes.  Politicians consider this necessary, since if there were nocontrols on property accumulation, the power of individuals outside ofthe control mechanism could become a threat to those inside it--thepoliticians.  Even with their monopoly on police powers.<p>	The relatively low level of coercion during the early years ofthe United States was also fostered by the political constitution andthe construction of the associated political régime.  Especially duringthe term of the first five presidents, in whom the founding principlesof property sanctity and non-interference in the property of others wasvery strong.<p>	At first the constitution made it difficult to create and focuspolitical, coercive power.  Individuals of the House of Representativesand the Senate had worthwhile things to do with their lives, and tookrelatively less interest in interfering in the lives and property ofothers.  But, slowly, they began talking and working with each other totheir mutual benefit and the detriment of those they purported torepresent.<p>	As those who cherished freedom and the sanctity of propertypassed away and--coincidentally--individuals got as far west as theycould go and the bureaucrats had them cornered--the level of coercionslowly began to increase.  Yet the level of coercion was stillrelatively quite low with loopholes hardly needed, and the needed oneslarge and tolerant.  The bureaucrats and politicians (B&Ps) not sonumerous and dedicated.  [I originally used "professional" (withquotation marks), rather then <i>dedicated</i>, but do not like to call theactivity of B&Ps "professional."]  And, as I said, many of the earlyB&Ps were themselves entrepreneurs and creators of property, and sowere relatively less interested in interfering in the life and propertyof others.<p>	But as the B&Ps became more numerous and dedicated to "taking care ofthe people and the business of the people," they begin to close theloopholes.  They become more and more difficult to find and to use.  Asthe B&Ps interfere more and more in individual life and begin to assumeresponsibilities which should rest with the individual, individualsbecome less interested in, and less capable of handling theseresponsibilities for themselves.  After all, "... the state will takecare of me."<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	Politics and political power became an obsession in itself.  The B&Psacquired Acton's Disease<a href="#1">[1]</a> and, seeing the ability to fulfill theirneeds through satisfying the "needs" of the masses, they startedstroking these needs.  Subliminally, they recognized the basicbehavioral characteristic of human beings and exploited it.  A bit likecigarette companies do with cigarettes, with the politicians creatingthe cancerous growth of the political state.  A growth that they nowseem unable to stop, it having gotten beyond even their control.<p>	With this comes an increasingly large, dysfunctional and unproductiveelement of the society, dependent on those who <i>are</i> producing. Forgetting it is not possible to consume that which has not beenproduced.  The decay of individual responsibility and--with it--of theeducational system, creates unemployment.  Worse, it creates a largegroup of <i>unemployable</i> people.  Add to this a minimum wage system andvastly increased interference in what is left of the free marketprocess and the number of productive people begin to decline relativeto the unproductive.  Factor in a so-called "democratic" system underwhich a majority clamors for and votes for B&Ps who will provide themwith what they feel they need, and you have a recipe for disaster.<p>	Voting for someone who promises to provide you with propertywith little or no effort on your part is consistent with the basicnature of volitional beings, yes?  It is also easy for the politician,as they need not work for it either.  Merely create a law saying thatthose who produce must share with those who do not.  This works lesswell as the number of non-producers increases relative to the number ofproducers.<p>	The number of loopholes become less at the same time as the envy anddissatisfaction with everyday life increases.  Both for those notreceiving as much as they think they should, and for those required togive part of their property to others.  It becomes more and moredifficult for the productive element to create and to hold onto theirproperty, while at the same time such activity is decried by theunproductive and dysfunctional element who want such production to be"shared" with them.<p>	They--the receivers as opposed to the creators--now control thelevers of power through the political voting system, and the B&Psanswer their siren call by plugging more and more holes and giving awaymore and more of what is produced.<p>	They are able to sustain this in spite of dissatisfaction as they nowcontrol the financial system and can tinker with it as required toachieve their ends.  Substituting fraud for force.  Even when it defiesall reason, such as the so-called "social security" system, which isneither a "social" system nor a system of "security."  And blaminginflation on price increases, rather than the debasement of thecurrency by the politicians.<p>	Frustration increases on all sides.  Individuals and businessestake greater and greater risks in finding and exploiting loopholes,while the minions of the régime fight back with ever-more Draconian,immoral, irrational, and ridiculous rules.  Another, and very basicreason the B&Ps can get away with this is because they also have amonopoly on police powers.  With the dichotomy of thought thatmonopolies are "bad" unless created by the state, and then they are"good." As George Orwell said,</p><ul>	<p>		"In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of	the indefensible."	</p></ul><p>and,</p><ul>	<p>	"<i>Doublethink</i> means the power of holding two contradictory	beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them."	</p></ul><p>	Orwell was very perceptive, elegantly describing the "basic behavioralcharacteristics" of politicians with those two statements...<p>	Eventually some individuals begin to feel that the only way toobtain redress for and alleviate their frustrations is by the samemechanism used by the political state: Force.  It is irrational, andonly results in increasing and more stringent laws, and more vigorousenforcement of them.<p>	Yet this is the proximate cause for the disorder in coercivesocieties.  And, since those are the only type of societies on thisplanet, it is a planet-wide problem.  And thus a specie-wide problem. The natural desire of volitional beings to create, accumulate and enjoythe use of their property, but living in a coercive society whose mainfunction is the control of this property, its creation, accumulationand use.  Even its enjoyment, with laws restricting almost all aspectsof such enjoyment.  Opening hours and licensing requirements for placesof entertainment, control of the alcoholic beverage industry, controlof gambling and an associated myriad of laws, rules, regulations,measures, bills, and all the other euphemisms for the decrees anddictates of the political régime.<p>	Of course this control is for the "good" of the people, and certainlynot to satisfy the habit and "high" that comes to those with politicalpower.  Right?<p>	There is only one solution to this problem.  That is to createa societal structure whose characteristics are consistent with thenature of man (the specie), and not with those characteristics whichtry to deny or change nature.  This means a social structure in whichall forms of property are protected completely,  Not by a coercive,police-state mechanism, but by a mechanism which takes intoconsideration and is based on the nature of volitional beings<p>	This, the solution to the crises of our societal structures, isdiscussed in "False Alternatives & Human Destiny," a limiteddistribution essay.<p>	In the meantime, you might do some thinking of your own on thesubject.</p>	<hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts	absolutely."

This leads to increasing disorder in which the societalstructure either self-destructs or is taken over by another politicalentity.  The only solution to this basic dilemma is the creation of arational and social structure based on the nature of man<ahref="#1">[1]</a>.</td></tr></table></center><p>	There is a very interesting connection between the attempt tocreate equality in political societies and political protesting. Protesting in the form of marches, strikes, and assorted other things.And between those things and disorder in political societies, and eventhe survival of the specie.<p>	Several days ago when I jotted down the title on my computer screen Ihad a totally different thought concerning how I would start thisessay, and what would be the main example or examples I would use.  Itwas only while watching one of the daily renditions of societaldisasters--euphemistically referred to as the television "news"--that theconnection between protesting and equality struck me.<p>	I believe someone was complaining about "fat cat" salaries, implyingthat the money paid to various business managers was too much.  Theimplication being that either their salary should be greatly reduced,or the salary of others should be raised to that level.  To achieve amore "equitable" situation.<p>	I think I know where this original concept of "equality" originated,at least in modern times, and what fosters it.  What makes it fester,like a sore that refuses to heal.  I believe it originated from thestatement in the American Declaration of Independence, stating that "...all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator withcertain inalienable rights... ," etc.<p>	Many of the so-called "founding fathers" of the United Stateswere very well educated men.  Men of great intellectual ability and asweeping understanding of history.  More importantly, many of them hadstudied what at that time was termed "natural philosophy"--the study ofnature and the natural sciences.  Unlike the intellectuallydisadvantaged of today's American political scene.<p>	Unfortunately, the founding fathers assumed succeeding generationswould be as well or better educated than themselves, and that they neednot explain what being "created equal" meant.  That it meant "createdequal under the laws of nature."  That this "equality" of creationmeant each individual was different from every other.  And that their"pursuit of happiness" would embody this difference.  That each andevery individual would have a different idea of what constitutedhappiness for them.  That each would have their own, differentaspirations in life.<p>	This "equality" is ensured--as we know now, and which they couldonly feel at the time--by that wonderful spiral helix of our DNA.  Whichsays that, practically speaking, there is virtually no chance that anytwo human beings will be identical in their genetic makeup.  Add tothat a slightly different environment and upbringing for eachindividual child, and you have as many interpretations of happiness astheir are people on the planet.<p><a name="2r"></p><p>	In a free society, a truly free society, in which each individualcould do whatever they wished as long as it did interfere in theproperty of another person<a href="#2">[2]</a>, people would be able tofollow their own individual dreams and paths to "pursue" their owndefinitions of happiness.  This is nature, and--in the absence ofcoercion--this is what will happen.<p>	Probably the best example of this actually happening on thisplanet is during the approximate time from 1700-1850 in what is nowknown as the United States.  People were generally more interested increating and building things than interfering in each other's lives. They were too busy for that.  And if that began to happen, they couldmove some distance west and there would be no one to bother them.<p>	The problem began when they reached the Pacific Ocean and therewas nowhere else to go. And the society became increasingly moreaffluent, with the possibility of more leisure time.  And observethat--according to the laws of nature--there were some people who werebetter off than others.  And, sadly, that there were some people whotook advantage of others.  This is also consistent with a basic law ofhuman behavior, which states that:</p><center><table width="60%" border="4"><tr><td>	<b>	Individual volitional beings seek to acquire the most amount of	property for the least amount of effort</b>.</td></tr></table></center><p>	As explained in other essays, this would be a problem for a freesociety were it not for a basic, counter-balancing behavioralprinciple.  I will state this principle without comment so that youwill do some thinking on your own:</p><center><table  border="4"><tr><td>	<b>	All individuals seek happiness</b>.</td></tr></table></center><p><a name="3r"></p><p>	If you need an explanation of this I commend to you my essay entitled<i>Need and Morality in Society</i>.<a href="#3">[3]</a><p><a name="4r"><a name="5r"></p><p>	The situation of everyone having a different definition ofhappiness for themselves, of different hopes and aspirations and meansof achieving them, is anathema to political societies.  To societiesbased on coercion.  Whether they are so-called "democracies"<ahref="#4">[4]</a> or a blatant dictatorship<a href="#5">[5]</a>.  Therequirement for sameness and conformity increases with the age ofpolitical entities.<p>	By controlling the lives of all their subjects political societiesprevent individuals from realizing their full potential.  This isfurther exacerbated by primitive concepts of production and innovationcompensation that group everyone into rather rigid groups.  In thissituation, individuals who are "achievers" regardless of theconstraints are marked as "different" and often attract envy.<p>	A societal structure that controls behavior and creates an atmospherein which there is less and less ability to be different also createsincreasing frustrations for the associated individuals.  Regardless ofhow hard or well the individual works, there is less and lesspossibility for them to express their individuality through positiveachievements.<p>	The society becomes more and more rigid, with more and morelaws saying what you can not do.  And, eventually, the feeling thatnothing is permitted or may done unless specifically allowed.  Andtalking to your "representative" from the ruling group does not do anygood.  Some of them may truly want to help you, but then there areother supplicants with identical or conflicting problems.  And, intruth and practically, your agent or representative can not alter thepolitical state to suit each of the million "clients" they mayrepresent.<p>	The political laws are there for everyone to obey, or there will bedisorder.  Although it appears there is disorder even when they areobeyed.  Which of course brings the call for both more laws, and morecomplete and rigid enforcement of existing ones.<p><a name="6r"><a name="7r"></p><p>	When the individual can not persuade their representative tohandle their problem for them, they begin to look for other ways tohandle the problem.  Perhaps by banding together with people who have asimilar problem or outlook.  Not being able to just ignore the law<a href="#6">[6]</a>, they begin to seek to change it by whatever meansthey can.  First "legally<a href="#7">[7]</a>" and in accordance withthe political laws and, when that doesn't work, "taking the law intotheir own hands."<p>	As every political society matures its laws become moreall-encompassing and restrictive.  It even becomes more difficult toascertain whether a given action is proscribed or permitted.  When theso-called "Supreme Court" of the United States votes 5-4 on somethingit means even they do not agree.  Probably because they also do noteven understand the problem and the associated laws.<p>	Further, their decision does not mean there will be there willbe no more protests.  Because, after all, the decision requiresindividuals follow some other persons' definition of "happiness," andto forego their own aspirations for their life.<p>	This is why, as political societies mature, they experienceincreasing internal disorder.  In the old days, when the specie stilllacked the technological ability to destroy itself, the "only" thinkthat happened was the a younger political society--taking advantage ofthe internal disorder--conquered the decaying society.  With increasingtechnology this becomes less of a probability than a mistake ormisunderstanding resulting in a cataclysmic end.<p>	The only way out of this is through the construction of a rationaland durable social structure based on an understanding of the basicbehavioral characteristics stated above.  It happens this is available,off-the-shelf knowledge, although no one seems interested.</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol>	<p><a name="1"><li>The specie, not the male of the specie.	<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>This is the defining characteristic of a rational	and durable society.

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><center><h4>Synopsis</h4></center><hr><p>	In the discussion of need and morality this essay also promulgates thetwo principle upon which all human behavior is based and can beanalyzed.  In the process of which it provides basic informationrequired for the creation of a rational and durable societal mechanismto replace our present defective and unworkable systems based oncoercion.</p><hr>	<p>	We hear much on the subject of "need" these days.  The needs ofthe poor, the needs of the unemployed, the needs of the sick, the needsof single mothers, etc.<p>	Implicit in all of these are the fact that someone other thanthe "needee" or the needy <b>must</b> satisfy the need.  A pleading"must" and a demanding "must."<p>	All of this without defining the word "need," and certainly with nouniversal agreement how it is to be done or by whom.  Except that--asstated above--it is certainly not the needy who must handle thesituation.<p>	To discuss the subject of need we must break it into two parts: Those required to sustain life, and "discretionary" needs.  The latterare things that would be nice to have, but not absolutely necessary tosustain life.<P>The things necessary to sustain life are:</p><ul>	<li>Water;	<li>food;	<li>shelter from the elements of nature.</ul><p>	Without water a human being will die within a few days.  Withoutfood they will die in some period less than three months, and probablyless than two.<p>	Shelter may be a bit optional in a sense if a person lives in atemperate climate, although in this discussion we will assume that someform of shelter is necessary for all human beings.<p>	Who should provide the water, food, and shelter?  Or, morespecifically, who has the <b>responsibility</b> for providing it?<p>	For very primitive, early man, it would seem obvious that individualshad to provide for themselves.  There were very few individuals andcertainly no organization to do it for the individual.  There waslittle or no concept of "specialization of labor."  No capitalaccumulation and concept of investment and businesses to provideproducts or services.<p>	Given this simple societal structure we could ask ourselves howone individual would get others to provide these services for them? There are only two ways.  One is through a voluntary agreement amongthe few individuals.  To trade services and the associated provision ofa product such as food, water, and shelter.  Which course is a"specialization" or "division" of labor system, although they wouldhave been doing what seemed natural and mutually profitable withoutarticulating the concept.<p>	The only other method possible is through force or fraud.  Requiringsomeone to do it under threat of some specified or unspecifiedundesirable action, or by tricking and deceiving them into doing it. This would be consistent with one basic trait or characteristic of allvolitional beings, which is:<ul><p>Principle No. 1:</p><ul><p><b>The desire to accumulate the most amount of property<br>for the least amount of effort</b>.</p></ul></ul><p>	In <b>principle</b> there is nothing wrong this basic trait, and in fact ifyou think about it is seems almost mandatory for any thinking being tohave this attribute.  The opposite is almost unthinkable.  It wouldcreate total apathy and lethargy, and is in fact what might be part ofan operative definition of "hell."  Along with the possibility ofknowing everything.  What would be the purpose of living if you kneweverything?  As Anatole France said:</p><ul><p><a name="1r"></p><p>	"Ignorance is the necessary condition of life itself.  If weknew everything, we could not endure existence for a single hour."<a href="#1">[1]</a></p></ul><p>	Forcing or deceiving people into providing goods and services is alsoa prescription for continuing strife, as this interferes with <b>their</b>basic desire of having the most for the least amount of effort.<p>	Although I don’t want to discuss it in detail here, as it iscovered in other essays, there is another reason for an individual tobe responsible for acquiring the means of survival for themselves.  Itinvolves the concept of <b>morality</b> and that which is <b>moral</b>. Interference in, and control of the property of another.  Employingthis concept or allowing this to happen also lays the foundation forcontinuing strife in a society.  It is what causes people to use forceor fraud in the achievement of their objectives.<p>	Principle No. 1 might also be a major reason for the statementthat man is "war-like," and that war will always be a part of humanlife and existence.  If the above basic trait did not have a balancingone which is equally powerful, this would be so.  And the specie wouldbe doomed to eternal strife, disorder, and war.<p>What is this balancing trait?</p><ul><p>Principle No. 2:</p><ul><p><b>All individuals seek happiness</b>.</p></ul></ul><p>	Do you think that is true or not true?  Would you dispute it orquibble about it?  Doesn’t it seem natural?  Would an individual,acting of their own free will and without coercion, voluntarily chooseto be unhappy?<p>	That can occasionally <b>appear</b> to be so, but to have it actuallybe so--and a principle of life--is also unthinkable.<p>	Because each individual has their own definition and image ofhappiness, the operation of this principle can sometimes be deceptive. Especially when people will say they or another person are doingsomething for someone else. After all, could it bring happiness to aperson to drown in the process of saving their child?  This is somewhatof an extreme example, and I think if we can handle this example we mayachieve partial belief in the principle?<p>	Let's look at it from the other side.  You go ahead and letyour child drown because obviously you might or will die, and who wantsto do that?  Yet any sane and rational parent would be devastated bythe thought they had let their child die while they lived.  If I lastedlong enough to shave the next morning and look at myself in the mirror,I would probably kill myself then and there.<p>	Of course you don't want to die, but the life you have createdis as precious or more so than your own.  And always the thought thatthey have almost their entire life ahead of them and have experiencednone of it, while yours is perhaps one-third finished.  Not to speak ofthat wonderful thing called "love," and of caring for someone.<p>	Further, what would your wife, children, relatives and friendsthink of a person who had been unwilling to make the effort?  Thisalone could create a lifetime of unhappiness.<p>	Granted, the decision to leap into the water is not prefaced byall of these thoughts, although undoubtedly for many parents thethought of giving up their life for their child has crossed their mind. The thought had been planted in their mind that, "Yes, I would dothat."  Also, we are surrounded by stories of people who have donethat. So, while our action is spontaneous and without thinking, thethinking and desire to take that action if necessary has already beendone.  We know that if we did not do it we would be truly unhappy.	<p>I promise--I will get back to the subject of "need"!</p>	<p>	I could provide many examples to illustrate the truth of theabove two principles.  It will be better though if you think about themand whether they influence your actions.  And look at the world aroundyou and see if you can corroborate them.  Don't assume them to betrue--or false--just see if the actions of you and your fellow humanbeings corroborate the principles.<p>	The next thing to do is to see how these two principles work togetherto influence human behavior.  This might also help your understandingof the individual attributes or principles.  It is the principlesworking together that explains both the problems of our societalstructures and provides the answer for solving those problems.<p>	While Principle No. 1 would create the havoc with everyone "outfor themselves," Principle No. 2 prevents that from happening. Stealing something from your neighbor might appear to be easier thanmaking it yourself or creating something that you could trade for it. It might appear to require the least amount of effort.  And, to have itmight even make you "happier."  But it might also make your neighbormuch less happy to lose his property.  In fact, so unhappy that he isangry with you.  And ready to bash in your skull.  Further, he willtell everyone in the neighborhood that you are a thief.  The resultbeing that you may not be as happy as you initially thought you wouldbe.<p>	Perhaps you could withstand the bash on the head, and maybe even giveas good or better than you got.  But there is still the matter ofeveryone in the neighborhood knowing you are a thief, and not to betrusted.  Maybe they wouldn't even want to associate with you in thefuture.  In the long term such thoughts could be more important and thedeciding factor.<p>	All thinking beings, even people who may not always be rationalor totally rational make value judgments regarding their actions.  Thatprocess tells them whether they will happier, or at least less unhappy,but taking one action as opposed to another.  Or not taking any action. Such as not stealing something from the neighbor.<p>	Principle No. 2 guides us in doing those things which bring positiverewards, and prevents us from doing those things which provide negativerewards.  The things which makes us happier or less unhappy, and thethings which would not make us happy.  And, besides our own happinessis that reflected from others, especially the opinion or feeling ofthose people important to us.  There is also the matter of how we"feel" about ourselves, which is generally called self-esteem.  Ouropinion of our own self-worth.<p>	Principle No. 2 might even be called a "regulating" mechanism,in that it regulates our behavior to that which please ourselves orincreases or maintains our self-esteem and provides in image forourselves in society.  Whether a person appears to honest andtrustworthy, or the opposite.  In this sense it is like a "creditrating" for ourselves and our lives.<p>	Although I will not give examples to substantiate it here, thisis the only regulatory mechanism or "law" required in a free society. And the only way a society can be free.  Operating under such aconcept, a society has no need for a vast system of regulations and anauthority which has a monopoly on police powers to enforce theregulations.<p>	The perceptive reader may realize that such a system works againstboth of these principles of human behavior.  Which is why societalsystems based on coercion do not work, and why the history of thesocietal structures on this planet can be summarized by "The Rise andFall of (blank)," putting in the name of a dearly departedcivilization.  Byzantium, Macedonia, ancient Egypt and Greece, Rome,etc.<p>	Think about that later, while I now continue with our originalsubject, <i>need</i>. Yes, I will finally continue with it...<p>	Principle No. 1 essentially states that what a person may wishto acquire is virtually without limit as long as there is little or noeffort to do so.  Certainly if a human being were given everything theywanted, they would accept it, yes?  Even if you could not use it allyourself, you might want to give it to a friend or relative.<p>	The only thing that puts a limit on your interest and abilityin acquiring property is the effort required, <b>or</b> the disapprovalacquired if it decreases the happiness of another person.  Such as whensomeone steals something from a person.  Or defrauds them of it.<p>	This explains why welfare systems rapidly go out of control. The recipient expends little effort in acquiring "property."  Which maybe in the form of money with which they can actually acquire tangibleitems or pay for services (which are merely a class of property). Perhaps they are "given" a place to live.  A flat or apartment, or ahouse.<p>	In the beginning they may expend some effort in acquiring thisproperty, having to complete forms and justify their "right" to theproperty of others. Taken from them in the form of taxes.  Of coursesome people don't mind this.  Even if they weren't required to supportthe welfare recipient they would gladly do so of their own free will. Even if at the expense of making their life, or the life of theirfamily, more difficult and less enjoyable.  Yes?<p>	In another sense we return to Principle No. 2, because a personcan truly be happy when they give something to someone, but usuallythey want this person to be someone they know, or to at leastappreciate it.  And to not want more because it is has suddenly becometheir "right" by virtue of having received what to them is only thefirst installment.<p>	I have given money and tangible items to friends that seemed toneed it.  And even given money and items anonymously to a group (acharity) for distribution however they saw fit.  I did it because Iwanted to, and because I felt good or "happy"  for having done it.  ButI do not feel happy when someone <b>requires</b> me to give up some of myproperty to someone I do not know and who never thanks me for it.  Evenif they did thank me, I do not accept or am not happy with being forcedto do anything.<p>	And this, dear reader, is a basic reason--if not <b>the</b>main reason--for the disorder and chaos in coercive politicalsocieties, whether they are outright and naked dictatorial societies,or so-called "democracies."  Both of which operate on the same basicprinciple of controlling the lives and property of their subjects.<p>	This concept directly conflicts with Principle No. 1--the desireto acquire property.  It then causes the individual to seek loopholesfor preserving their property and any other reasonable action topreserve their property.  Including their life.<p>	Then, obviously, it is Principle No. 2 which causes the individual tomake a value judgment and not go so far as to cause them to be evenmore unhappy.  This is why people will pay their taxes and endure otherterrorism against their property--the knowledge that if their oppositiongoes too far, they will be much worse off than if they just submit tothe immoral actions of the political régime.<p>	Most people have a breaking point though, and reach a point whereinthey feel they "have nothing to lose."  They cross over the thresholdand Principle No. 2 no longer become operative.  This is when peopleindulge in violent, anti-social behavior.<p>	A clear understanding of Principles 1 & 2 explain virtuallyeverything about human behavior, excepting only those individuals whotruly do not understand the difference between right and wrong, do notunderstand cause and effect, and do not have the ability to make valuejudgments.  People who have this ability can be pushed beyond the pointwhere they will use the process, or do not accept the conclusionarrived at by their mind.  This concept might be useful in thoughtsconcerning what is commonly called "temporary insanity."<p>	Lastly, I would say that when we as individuals, or as a societalgroup, allow one person's perception of their "need"--or of the needs ofothers--to become a claim on the property of another, we try to alterthe behavior which would normally result from Principles 1 & 2, and arethus tampering with nature.  A very dangerous thing.<p>	If we take the other approach--that of understanding that Principles 1& 2 do exist, and are fundamental to all human behavior--we can see whatis wrong with our current and previous attempts to create a workablesocietal system.  And to then construct a new system which will beconsistent with the nature of human beings.  And will therefore work.</p><hr><h4>End Note</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>The Garden of Epicurus - 1894	<a href="#1r">Return</a></ol><hr>Copyright &copy; 1996--WWMorgan<HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server<sup>&copy;</sup> please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Human-Need.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><p>	I do not agree with that statement--I am merely stating a fact onsomething that is accepted by everyone.  Not the image, that is notacceptable to most rational and moral people.  However, the principleof what I have said is accepted by everyone. Why do I say this? Becauseno one uses a proper definition of terrorism, and because people do notthink in terms of principles, but rather of appearances or images.<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	And, because people are not aware of the importance of semanticprecision.  That its use is responsible for everything we know that iscorrect.  And failure to use semantic precision causes us to <i>assume</i>many things to be correct when they are not.<a href="#1">[1]</a>  Thatit is responsible for our ever-increasing technological knowledge andassociated products, and for the fact that we have never truly solvedany of our social problems.<p>	For corroboration of the latter statement I commend to youTaylor Caldwell's magnificent historical biography of Marcus TulliusCicero, entitled <i>A Pillar of Iron</i>.  In this book she recounts everydayRoman life of about 2,200 years ago.  If you did not know the timeperiod or place, you would assume it was a description of life incurrent-day Washington, D.C., London, Paris, Tokyo or any other majorcity.  Why?<p>	Because all of the problems of our present societies are the same asthose of 2,200 years ago.</p><table width="100%">	<tr>		<td><li>declining educational standards</td>		<td><li>depressions and recessions</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td><li>famine</td>		<td><li>inflation</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td><li>pollution</td>		<td><li>crime</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td><li>poverty</td>		<td><li>social disorder</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td><li>too many regulations</td>		<td><li>corruption</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td><li>unemployment</td>		<td><li>wars</td>	</tr></table>		<p>and a myriad of other social problems.</p><p>	None of them have been solved.  In fact, they have only gottenworse as the social deviants of today have access to ever-greatertechnology in pursuit of their objectives.  Which of course begs thequestion of why the knowledge of our technological world is increasingexponentially, while our societal systems are in continuous decline. While the answer to that question will be in this essay, it is not itssubject and it will be unlikely that anyone will see or comprehend thatanswer.<p>	To talk intelligently about the subject of this essay we mustdefine <i>terrorism</i>.  What is it?  As I alluded to in the beginning, thereis a big difference between the <i>image</i> of terrorism and a succinct andabsolute <i>definition</i>.  Between the image and the operative principle.<p>	Precise definitions and semantic precision are very important,as I have discussed at length in a separate essay on the subject. Often when a definition for something is offered, and especially whenthe listener or reader does not like it, they say:</p><ul><li>That's only your definition;<li>it is only words;</ul><p>	or something similar.  In a sense these are true, but they arealso unimportant and not germane to the problem.  If the definition isconsistent with the way something works or explains a natural phenomenaand may be used to acquire additional new and useful knowledge then itmakes no different whose definition it is.  And the statement that "…it is only words" is supercilious.<p>	Semantic precision is important because it would be impossibleto create new and useful knowledge without it.  Volitional life wouldbe unthinkable and untenable   Can you imagine each individual having adifferent definition for everything?<p>	If you don't believe that semantic precision is important,then I assume you would allow me to assign what is commonly known as<i>sugar</i> the new name of <i>petrol</i>?  And to then fill yourpetrol tank with this "petrol"?  Free of charge of course, just as afriendly gesture.  Or to assign the name <i>salt</i> to <i>arsenic</i>and then season your dinner with it?<p>	Our specie has made great strides in technology since the 1600sbecause it was about that time there was an implicit--and not veryexplicit--understanding that standard, precise, agreed definitions wereimportant.  And, more significantly, that there was an epistemologicaltool that was available for determining whether something was right ornot right.  Although that is a separate subject also discussedelsewhere.<p>	Let's talk specifically about the subject of terrorism and whatit is that constitutes an act of terrorism.  What is the obvious? Often it is a bomb that destroys property and usually kills people.  Orit may be more restrictive in that it "only" destroys property, orsomeone is killed with no other property destruction.  And of course itis often an attack on or against a political r&eacute;gime, whether it is adictatorship or a so-called "democracy."<p>	Does it really make any difference who committed the act, orwho or what it is directed against?  In any case, the people killedoften have nothing to do with the "complaint" of the terrorists.  Suchas the people on TWA-800 or PanAm-103.  Most of whom were holidaygoers, business people, or women and children.  People who had nothought in interfering in the life of the terrorists.<p>	Does it make any difference if the terrorists are male or female?  Orthat they might even represent some "good" cause?  Suppose they are infavor of limiting chemical pollution, or do not want animals to be usedfor purposes of medical research?  Does this then make their actionsacceptable?<p>	Or the case of someone trying to attain more freedom for themselvesand others?  And they murder people associated with the presentr&eacute;gime? Many of whom may only be relatively harmlessfunctionaries of the r&eacute;gime, for whom it is just a job and wayof earning money to support their families. Does this "good" causeentitle them to kill such people?  Or to damage the property of someoneelse?<p>	What would be the implications of this if there were certain cases inwhich it was considered acceptable to kill people or destroy property? One would be that someone then must prepare a list of the acceptablemurders and acts of property destruction.  The Nazis were good atmaking such lists, and then acting on them.  If this were the case,then it would be best if you were one of the people who created thelist, so that you could make certain that you or your friends--and theirproperty--were not in the eligible categories. Of course you would befair, but others might not be.<p>	Yet there is a much more important question than this.  Is itever acceptable to destroy the property of another person, includingthat property known as life?  If you say no, then this raises a veryimportant question.  Why do we tolerate it under any circumstances? Or,phrased another way, why do we tolerate it under some circumstances? Such as when it is sanctioned by our own political r&eacute;gime?  Ofcourse if it were sanctioned by another political r&eacute;gime thanagainst us, that would be war, yes?<p>	If it is sanctioned by our own political r&eacute;gime againstanother, it is war on the other r&eacute;gime, but then it is ourpatriotic duty to fight, yes?  As Voltaire said,</p><center><p>"It is forbidden to kill...unless to trumpets."</p></center><p>	Ah, yes, trumpets make it okay.  Or do they?  This again bringsup the "list," and the thought of who creates it.  Of course we knowwho it is.  It is always the political r&eacute;gime or, as some people callit, the "government."<p>	But we still have not generalized the concept of terrorism orof a terrorist act.  At least not explicitly.  We have begun to headtoward the fact that it is an attack on property; something resultingin the destruction of property, including human life.  But we have alsosaid that human life is itself property--the property of the personwhose life it is. Your life is your property, and my life is mine.  Anydeviation from that and we have the concept known as slavery.  If yourlife isn't yours and under your control, then it must be under thecontrol of someone else, which forms the operative concept of the wordslavery.<p>	It is becoming apparent that the concept of property is basicto our discussion of life, terrorism, and slavery. In fact, it is oneof the most fundamental definitions and concepts, central to andforming the basis of knowledge related to volitional beings and theirsocial structures, although I do not want to discuss it fully here.  Ithink you already have a feeling for the necessity of an understandingof property in discussing terrorism?<p>	If, as we have said, it does not make any difference why theact of terrorism is committed, or who it is committed by for it to bean act of terrorism, then this means no one can stand behind the shieldof their organization.  Not even so-called governments.  Politicalr&eacute;gimes.  And, if it means that what we are really talking about iscontrol or destruction of the property of another--with "life" being aspecial class of property obviously belonging to the "owner"--then wehave some very serious thinking to do.<p>	Because this means that any act by a political r&eacute;gimeor government to kill people, or to interfere in their property, is infact an act of terrorism.<p>	Does it make any difference that a majority of people haveagreed that such interference is okay?  As the Germans did underHitler.  Who was elected to office by a majority of the people.  And healso believed in freedom, as indicated by his writings.  Although therecould be a problem here with definitions also.  His definition seemedto involve taking land away from other people for his own people. Lebensraum.  Surely this was a selfless act on his part for the good ofhis people?  But does it really make any difference why he did it?  Orthat he was a duly elected Head of State, exercising the "rightfulprerogatives of such people to declare war on others?  Perhapsdefinitions do matter...?<p>	If a majority of the people--those having brown hair forexample--vote to shave the head of everyone having blonde hair, is thisokay?  If it is under a "democratic" system, with things being decidedby the majority?  If we accept the concept of allowing the majority todecide what is best for everyone, or what they must do,  this is alsocondoning an act of property interference. Shielding it behind thecloak of "the greater good" and the "will of the majority."  Ratherthan being led down this additional path, I will let you do somethinking about this is you wish.<p>	So far I have not mentioned the subject morality and what is moral. But it now seems simple--and the appropriate time--to discuss morality. From out short discussion the perceptive person will immediately seethe connection between morality, property, and terrorism.<p>	Clearly, we could use the concept of property and propertyinterference to create a new, better, more simple, universal andabsolute definition of the word moral:</p><p><a name="2r"></p><center><p>	"<b>Any act that does not involve property	interference</b>"<a href="#2">[2]</a></p></center><p>	This would include the killing of someone, theft of their property, orcontrolling their property without their permission.  Including thecontrol of their life, which--again--forms the operative concept anddefinition of slavery.<p>	My goodness!  Starting out to discuss terrorism, we drifted offto property as a necessary component of a definition for that, and as abyproduct have defined the words moral and slavery.<p>	But what have we done, and where have we found ourselves?  Indeep trouble.  Because it should now be obvious that there are not just"private" terrorists, but also government-sponsored terrorists. Indeed, any government, political r&eacute;gime or entity or-- indeed--anyorganization which engages in war or the killing of people is aterrorist organization, and immoral.  With our new understanding ofproperty, any person or organization that controls or interferes in theproperty of another is a terrorist and acting immorally.<p>	While we are at it and so close to the concept, we might aswell discuss crime.  Might that definition not also be simplified usingour understanding of property?  With interference in the property ofanother being a crime?  This is in fact the operative definition of theword crime.<p>	The common definition of "crime" is violation of a politicallaw.  But since all political laws involve property interference, wewould seem to have another problem.  One for you to think about.<p>	Although it would open a new subject, which I will not truly do, youmust see that the English language is not very precise.  Indeed, anylanguage that has a dictionary of synonyms must be imprecise accordingto the percentage of synonyms existing related to that total number ofwords in the language.  Of course poets and others would say that thisadds to the "richness" of the language, but it also adds to theconfusion and is a burden on those learning the language.<p>	We have also unlocked the door to proper definitions of ethicsand that which is ethical, but I will leave that to the reader as anexercise.  Although, as you might by now suspect, I have written aseparate essay on that subject...<p><a name="3r"></p><p>	When we understand the concept and definition of property manythings become simple and "obvious."<a href="#3">[3]</a><p>	The purpose of this essay was to put terrorism into perspective, andto illustrate some of the misconceptions, falsehoods, and errorsrelated to our understanding of our social structures.  To encouragethought on the problems created by this, and perhaps even thought to asolution involving the creation of a rational and durable socialstructure.</p><p>	It should not be surprising to you that an essay already existson that subject also...</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4>	<ol><p><a name="1"><li>As Thomas Paine said, "A long habit of not thinking a	thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right..." 		<p>	[Thomas Paine, Introduction to <i>Common 	Sense</i>, Penguin Books, 1983, p. 63]	</p>		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>A person can not interfere in their own property. 	This refers only to interference in the property of another	person.		<a href="#2r">Return</a><p><a name="3"><li>As Christian Morgenstern the Younger (Lyric Poet)	said, ".Das Offensichtliche ist das, was man nicht sieht, bis	jeman es  erkl&auml;rt."

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><p>	I started to write an essay on the subject of ethics, but thenrealized I could not do that until I had covered the concept ofproperty and the political state.  A proper understanding of theconcept of property is essential to a discussion of ethics.  And,contrasting a rational and moral concept of property with that used inpolitics and by the political state provides a good contrast toillustrate a rational definition of property.  Also essential to, andimplicitly included in a proper definition of property is the conceptof ownership.<p>	In fact, discussing the concept of ownership and working backwards isperhaps the best way to define and illustrate the concept of property.<p>	Everyone probably feels they understand the concept of property, andeven its definition, yet I contend that virtually no one has orunderstands a rational and defensible definition of property.  Andcertainly no one associated with politics or the political state has oruses an absolute, durable, rational, and moral concept and definitionof property.  The proof of this, although I will not discuss that here,is that the political state even exists as a concept, and the associatedchaos and disorder evidenced by history and current events.	<h4>Ownership</h4><p>	Almost everyone has a feeling for what constitutes evidence ofownership, but let's list the factors:</p><ul>		<li>Total and complete control of the property;<li>the ability  to use the property as the owner wishes;<li>the ability to sell the property when and if the owner wishes;<li>the ability to not sell or dispose of the property<li>the ability to sell the property at any price agreeable to both seller and	purchaser.</ul><p>	Some people might already dispute this, especially the first item, butremember--I am talking about a rational and moral definition in a freesociety.  An absolute concept, and not a relative one.<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	With credit to Frederic Bastiat<a href="#1">[1]</a> and the conceptof "that which is seen, and that which is not seen," there is also avery important component missing here.  That is how the property wasacquired.  Was it acquired in a moral transaction, in which theprevious owner--acting in the absence of any coercion and withoutfraud--offered it for sale? And, did the current owner agree topurchase it at the offered and/or negotiated price, free of anycoercion or fraud?  Or was it acquired by paying for it with stolenmoney?  Does such an act constitute ownership?<p><a name="2r"></p><p>	If coercion or fraud was involved it creates serious questions. For example, did the previous "owner" acquire the property morally? Was he<a href="#2">[2]</a> in fact the true owner, which is the reason for the quotationmarks?  Because, if he did not, then he was not the owner of theproperty, but merely the controller.  What if the previous "owner"acquired the property through theft--he stole the property?  Does thatmean he is the owner of the property, or merely that he hadacquired control of it through immoral means?<p>	This is a very important consideration, and at the heart of theproblem concerning property and the political state.<p>	Does theft of property confer ownership?  What would be theimplications of this if it were true?<p>	It would certainly make it much easier to acquire and to ownproperty.  It would no longer be necessary to produce or to createproperty, since all that would be necessary would be to steal it.  Totake it by force or fraud.  Taking it at the point of a gun, or throughdeception, confusion, etc.  You could steal you neighbors car andthereby become the "owner."<p>	But what would this do to a society which operated on this basis?  Itwould mean chaos and murder. And the eventual--probably sooner ratherthan later--end to the creation of products and property.  Why botherwhen all that was necessary was to steal it?  And why go to the troubleof creating property if it would only be stolen anyway?  Of course eachperson could create a fortress to safeguard their property, but youprobably could not trust anyone to help you guard it.<p>	"What are you talking about?"  "Why are we having this discussion" "Obviously this would not work, so what is the purpose of thediscussion?"<p><a name="3r"></p><p>	Because this is the way the political state works.  Any politicalstate, whether it is "democratic" or something else.  In the beginning,almost all modern political states acquired control over vast amountsof property through force, taking it from local native inhabitants, Such as in the United States, where it was taken by force--and lessoften through fraud--from the original inhabitants, known commonly butincorrectly as "Indians."<a href="#3">[3]</a><p>	Then, later, they acquired control (I avoid the use of the word"ownership") over more property by paying for it with stolen money. Money taken from individuals through taxation.<p>	I don’t want to get into a full discussion of theft and taxeshere, as I have discussed it at length in other essays.  To keep itshort here, do you freely, and without reservation, give the moneyknown as "taxes" to the political state?  Would you do so if there wereno adverse consequences for not doing so?  All of it, or just some ofit?<p>	Would you rather keep the school tax money so you could pay forand use a school of your choice?  Would you freely join the"subscription plan" for keeping a foreign army in some foreigncountry?  Would you freely, voluntarily, and with great enthusiasm,contribute to a bridge or road being built in some foreign country? Would you endow a pension for some person or persons who had failed tosave for their own?  Or pay the living expenses of one or more peoplewho could not find a job?  While you yourself have a hard time makingends meet?<p>	Would you pay the medical expenses of another person, perhapseven though it meant you could not afford proper medical care foryourself or a member of your family?  Or in lieu of a holiday in thesun during the unusually cold Winter?	<p>Enough of that.<p>	The principle is that ownership can not be acquired by payingfor something with money stolen from another person or persons.  Oracquired through fraudulent means.  This is again tantamount to sayingthat theft confers ownership, and I hope you realize by now that thisdoes not and would not work.<p>	Even the US government would appear not to agree with this, althoughthey are very hypocritical about it.  For example, they have justpassed the much-publicized--and criticized, but not for the rightreasons--Helms-Burton Act.<p>	Basically, this says that since the Castro r&eacute;gime"expropriated" the property of Americans in the 1960s, anyone who nowacquires the "ownership" of this property from the Castro r&eacute;gimemay be sued in American political courts.  Further, that the Americanr&eacute;gime may also deny entry permits to the American tribal areas. The ones they stole from the "Indians."<p><a name="3r"></p><p>	There would appear to be a "statute of limitations" on thisexpropriation<a href="#3">[3]</a> business.  The fact that the Americanr&eacute;gime stole the property centuries ago seems to make it "okay"? Doesn’t it?<p>	One problem with accepting that theft confers ownership is thatthere are then many other questions to answer.  Then you must decidewho is allowed to do this.  May everyone participate, or only a selectfew?  Such as those who work for the political state?<p>	And, if you steal property and manage to maintain control of itfor specified period of time, will this then constitute ownership?  Ifso, what is the period?<p>	Should the period be several hundred years as the case with theAmerican Indians?  Of should we have a "party caucus" or a group ofcommittees decide it, and perhaps come up with a compromise period of62 1/2 years?  Surely that would please the majority of the people. And if not, well, just tell them " ... that’s the law."  Surely that willthen make it acceptable to all.  Which is the "<a href="Glossary.html#DEMOC">democratic</a>" way.  I willresist the temptation to define and discuss "democratic," which--in anycase--has been done in other essays.<p>	Based on this brief discussion, what might be a rational definitionof property?  I will not provide the ultimate, final, and absolutedefinition of property here, but rather an "operative" definition withwhich to carry on the discussion of ethics.</p><center>	<p>	"Any tangible or intangible item acquired through moral means."	</p></center><p>	By including "intangible" we cover the concept of ideas, whichare in fact the first, most important, and highest form of property. Nothing happens until there is first an idea of what and how somethingis to happen.<p>	Of course we do have an open item here, and that is the word"morally" and the concept of morality and what is moral.<p>	Rather than go into that subject, I will leave it hanging for anotheressay, and say only that in this context--the concept of property--itmeans it can not be acquired through theft or fraud.<p>	Does this provide some food for thought, or would you just prefer toaccept the status quo and continue with a system in which theft doesseem to confer ownership?<p>	Now, I am ready to write the definitive essay on the concept of<a href="Ethics.html">ethics</a>. Hopefully you will be interested inreading it…<p>	I know--this is "not long enough for this subject."  Yet it isquite sufficient for anyone capable of rational thought and theextrapolition of ideas.  I am sorry for any reader who does not fallinto this category.</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>French economist, 1800-1849, author of "That Which Is	Seen And That Which Is Not Seen," 1849.		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>Generic for a human being, whether male or female.	<a href="#2r">Return</a>	<p><a name="3"><li>This is because early explorers--especially Columbus--	stumbled onto what is now known as the United States and thought	they had reached India, thus calling the natives "Indians."		<a href="#3r">Return</a><p><a name="4"><li>Remember, "expropriation" is a bureaucratic	euphemism for stealing or theft.		<a href="#4r">Return</a></ol><hr><p>Copyright &copy; 1996--WWMorgan</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server<sup>&copy;</sup> please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Property-and-Politics.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><p>	The subject of ethics is a very popular one these days, as illustratedby the quantity and variety of essays and books on the subject.  And,sadly, it is very misunderstood, with everyone providing an incorrectdefinition, and incorrect and improper examples.  How anyone can writean entire book on the subject, and even require a book to cover whatseems to be one aspect of ethics, such as "medical" ethics, defiesrationality and imagination.<p>	In order to understand the concept of ethics a person must havea proper understanding of property, which means they must have read myessay entitled <a href="Essays.html#PROP">The Concept of Property andthe Political State</a><p>	I can define "ethical" in five words.  A definition which is absolute(covering any situation in any time frame) and totally definitive. Then of course the word "ethics" would be defined as:</p><center>	<p><b>Anything that is ethical</b></center><p>	So, we have a very simple situation, do we not?  All we need dois define "ethical," with the definition covering any type of act inany area of knowledge or endeavor.  And it can only cover and beappropriate for acts  and not thoughts or ideas in the sense that theconcept of morality can only apply to acts.  Thoughts and ideas areamoral, meaning they have no morality content.  They can only have sucha content when the thought or idea is converted into action.  Anotherfact that confuses the majority of people, who view things such as theknowledge of atomic energy as being "immoral," which of course isridiculous--it is amoral.<p>	However, I don't want to pursue the concept of morality--and even ofdefinitions--in this essay.  They are fully covered in their own essays.<p>	Somewhat against my better judgment--as it requires a reader tothink clearly--I will give the definition of ethics forthwith, and thencarry on with a brief discussion, since that is all that is requiredfor the subject.</p><ul>	<p>Ethical<ul><p><b>Any act that is moral</b>.</ul></ul><p>What does this mean?<p>	It means any act which does not interfere in the property of anotherperson is ethical.  It means that if an act involves the property ofanother person, that you must have their prior, freely-given consent.<p>	It is as simple as that, as nature itself is very simple andnot deceptive.  I could stop writing now and, for the thinking person,would have said enough.<p>	This covers all aspect of ethics, whether it relates to medicine,business, psychology, the Internet, sheep ranching, art,computer-related matters, or anything else.  There is no such thing as"medical" ethics, or "business" ethics, or "computer" ethics.  There isonly ethics, and a rational, durable, and absolute definition of it,which applies to all areas of human endeavor.<p>	With one exception, I must admit.  And that is the subject ofso-called "legal" ethics.  The reason it does not apply to that area isbecause the area itself is immoral and irrational, and it approachesthe impossible to apply the concept of ethics to that subject.<p>	I had to pause and struggle for a number of minutes to decideon how to end that last sentence, as I could not say "profession," as Ido not consider the study of political law to be a profession.  Norcould it be called an "area of knowledge," unless you perhaps prefix"knowledge" with "pseudo."  If a person was involved in that subjectthe only ethical thing to do is to get out of it.<p>	The only thing that approaches rationality and morality in thatarea is in what would normally be called "corporate law," in which theperson is defending the property of the company from the onslaught ofthe political state, which would presume to control, confiscate, orotherwise interfere with it.<p>	But we are getting off the track here, and I have probably eliminatedmost all non-thinkers, and perhaps even a few thinkers who are victimsof the problem so elegantly illustrated by Thomas Paine when he said:<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficialappearance of being right... <a href="#1">[1]</a><p>	The definition clarifies the problem of what do about criticallyinjured or terminally ill patients.  Since, if the patient is consciousand able to make a rational decision, their request to terminatetreatment must be honored and complied with.  To do otherwise isimmoral.<p>	Of course there is still the question of whether the patient iscapable of a rational decision, but if someone to whom they havedelegated that task and the associated responsibility and authority isavailable, then their decision is acceptable and final.  And, again, tonot comply with it is immoral, and in fact a criminal act, as itrepresents property interference.<p>	It becomes almost pointless to discuss other areas of human endeavor,since with the proper definition there is no need to do so.  Unless itis to repetitiously illustrate the principle and definition for peoplewho have not understood the implications of the definition.<p>	With that in mind, we might go to the subject of the Internet,which has been a recent subject of contention.  Especially by thosewhose specialty is property interference, such as politicians.<p>	It is ethical and moral to put anything "onto the Internet," ormake it available through the medium known as the Internet.  It is notrational to put what is commonly called "pornography" in the Internet,but rationality and morality are two different concepts and subjects.To make such material available is certainly ethical, and in fact it isimmoral for anyone to interfere in the act of putting it on theInternet as long as it is not their property.  Clearly however, it ismoral for an "Internet Provider"--one who provides Internet services tocustomers--to refuse to accept such material on their computer system ornetwork.  On the computer system or network which they own.<p><a name="2r"></p><p>	With one exception, interference with this process is an immoralact.  This one exception is between parents and their own (but notowned<a href="#2">[2]</a>) children.  A parent has an implied contractual relationshipwith a child until the child reaches a stage when they are able todetermine right from wrong, and have reached what is generally called"maturity."<p>	In this situation, a parent may, as part of their contractualrelationship with a child, prohibit them from doing certain acts.  And,in fact, they have a responsibility to do so, and are derelict in theirresponsibilities if they do not do so.  The root of many problems inthe current societies on this planet.<p>	"Computer" ethics.  Again simple.  Anything can be done whichdoes not involve intentional interference in the property of another. This means that "hacking" into the computer of someone else is immoraland unethical (since they are the same).  And of course taking moneyfrom a bank by this means is unethical.<p><a name="3r"></p><p>	Notice I used the word "intentional" above, which was deliberate andintended.  Accidents can and do happen.  As my great and wonderfulteacher said, "To err is human.  To rectify is divine."<a href="#3">[3]</a><p>	People do make mistakes.  The really important thing then ishow it is handled.  If a person finds they have made a mistake andinterfered in the property of another, it is incumbent upon them tocontact the person, tell them what happened, offer them an apology, andrestitution.  For accidents which do not seriously or irretrievablydamage property, and there was no intent, often the apology is quitesufficient,  Although absolutely necessary.  I will not continue withthe subject of errors and restitution since, as usual, there is aseparate essay on this subject.<p>	Do we need more discussion on the subject of ethics?  I don'tthink so.  All that is required now is some thought on the subject, andthe application of the principles to your daily life.<p>	One thing I have not discussed and will do so only briefly here, andthat is the matter of ethics and the political state.  Rationality mustalso be discussed.  The reason being that almost everything thepolitical does or requires is immoral, and thus effects the subject ofethics.  Rationality is important because it is not rational to--byaction--oppose the political state.  They have a monopoly on policepowers, and make short work of anyone challenging them by action.  Theonly way to challenge them effectively and rationally is through thecreation of new and useful knowledge. The creation of an alternativeconcept to the coercion of the political state.<p>	If there is a question of doing something which is ethical, butwhich is illegal, rationality must be employed.  Sadly, many thingswhich are moral and therefore ethical, are also illegal.  And of coursemost things which are legal are in fact immoral.<p>	This presents a thinking person with a dilemma, but rationalitymust in this case take precedence over morality and ethics.  Notunlike--in principle--the situation of the Nürnberg Trials.  Where thedefense was that "I did it under orders," or--more appropriately--that"I would have been shot had I not done it."  Such it is with the lawsof the political state.  Rational or not, moral or not, they must befollowed.</p><hr><p>Something else to think about.

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><h4>Note:</h4>	<ul>		<p>		This essays was written as a dedicatory epistle to a calendar of		important people and events, and the associated database. I had		been putting a section called "This Day in History" on TFS, with a		few important events for each day of a month.  But there seemed		to be little interest in it, so I have stopped doing it regularly.		</p>	</ul><hr><p>	The subject of importance is central to the survival of man as aviable specie.  Of what and who is important.  The subject issignificant because--despite what some people have said--man the speciedoes learn from history.  But, since we have a false concept of what isimportant, we have learned the wrong things from history, which is theproximate cause of the pending and probable death of the specie.<p>	Yet if we can learn the correct things--right things--from history,we can end and reverse this decline.<p>	It is my contention that our society has the wrong "heroes."  We makeheroes of people whose main claim to "fame" is that they are destroyersof property.  And the more property they destroy, the more famous theyare in their own lifetime, and the more columns they rate in historybooks and encyclopaedia.<p>	Thus, a Napoleon has more columns than his contemporary Galois,when Napoleon's legacy was death and destruction to millions and theimpoverishment of France and Europe for decades.<p>	Galois did not live to reach the age of twenty-one, yet his legacy isstill being poured over by the greatest mathematical minds on thisplanet, who continue to learn from his work.<p>	It is said that man does not learn from history.  This is bothtrue and false.  In the area of natural science and technology man doeslearn from history, and he learns right things--things which work. Thisis why we have television, automobiles, electric toasters (and theelectricity to power them), jet-powered aircraft, the Sony Walkman, andelectric lighting to light the darkness.<p>	Unfortunately, in the area of knowledge concerning man's relationswith his fellow man--knowledge related to social structures--we do not,and have not, learned anything of positive value.  We repeat the oldmistakes and acquire new methods (negative knowledge) of doing thingswrong.<p>	In the non-scientific world we learn to emulate an Alexander ofMacedon (I will not dignify him by appending the usual "Great") andthus we have a Napoleon.  And then an itinerant painter fancies himselfas being another Napoleon, and we have an Adolf Hitler. Young peopleaspire to what they have been told is "greatness," while in fact theirheroes are great only at interference in, and the destruction ofproperty.<p>	How much different the world would be if children grew up in awe andadmiration of Archimedes, Aristarchus, Euclid, Copernicus, Galileo,Newton, Maxwell, the Wright Brothers, Eddington and Einstein.  Or MargotFonteyn, Schubert, Ketelby--even Emmet the Clown.  He was more importantin history than all the crowned ruffians and uncrowned rullers who havelived.<p>	These are famous names.  But what of Galois, Bruno, Chester Carlson,Julius Robert Mayer, Philipp Reis, Semmelweis, William T. G. Morton,Oberth, Tsiolkowski and others?<p>	All of these--and many others--who have lived honorable livesand have virtually never engaged in the destruction of property.  Andif they did on occasion destroy property it was usually unintentionaland not their main function in life.  In fact all they have done is tocreate property, usually intellectual property, which is subsequentlyused to generate enormous amounts of tangible property, and additionalintangible property--the concept of continuous creation of knowledge.The process enriching and saving the lives of millions of people. Andhaving the potential to do more of a positive value were it not for theinterference of the political state and politicians.<p>	These people, the property creators, should be the Heroes ofHistory--the people we honor and seek to emulate.<center><h4>Classes of Events & People</h4></center><h4>A.	Cosmological Innovators & Events</h4><p>This is the highest class of individual and event.</p>	It involves the creation of basic knowledge concerning the universe.Things such as the laws of thermodynamics and planetary motion; theknowledge concerning the birth, life and death of a star; the laws ofmotion and gravity.  And of course those two great milestones whichevery volitional specie must pass on the way to achieving a rationaland durable civilization whose time scale of existence will beconcomitant with that of its own universe--the integration of thenon-volitional sciences and the integration of the volitional sciences.		Examples of cosmological innovators are Archimedes, Aristarchus,Eratosthenes of Cyrene, Copernicus, Kepler, Galambos, Galileo, Newton,Darwin & Wallace, Maxwell, Boltzmann, Eddington, Wilbur Wright,Einstein and Galambos.<h4>B.	Technological Innovators</h4><p>	These are the people who fine-tune, expand and add to the knowledgecreated by the cosmological innovators.  They provide the necessaryconsolidation of one cosmological creation and lay the groundwork forthe next one.<p>	This also includes "engineers" who create the knowledge for thetechnological products which serve us and enrich and brighten our lives.<h4>C.	Preservers and Catalogers of Knowledge</h4><p>	These people are a very necessary part of the mechanism whichallows for the creation of knowledge.  The creation of a technology topreserve knowledge was itself a cosmological innovation.  Without theability to preserve and store knowledge there is nothing to expand--noway to create new knowledge.<p>	There was a time when man spent his entire life just learningto survive. And his children did the same for millions of years.  Forthousands of years after the evolution of language and writing therewas still no effective way to catalogue, store, and distributeknowledge.  Thus its expansion was painfully slow and susceptible toloss for centuries.<p>	The thing that changed this was the creation of paper and thenthe knowledge of printing, which not only allowed for the storage ofknowledge, but also its distribution.<h4>D.	Explorers & Navigators</h4><p>	One might think these would fit in with the technological innovators,and some of them actually do.  Yet they were basically a differentclass. Often they at least started out as adventurers, with thescientific knowledge and data they returned being more or less aby-product of their adventure, rather than an intention.<p>	Nevertheless, even when intent was missing or wrong, they oftenreturned valuable and needed knowledge of the world.  I have generallyleft out those who engaged in mistreatment of people they contacted,although it is not always easy to do so.  Also, the details of variousevents are sometimes too sparse to be able to separate defense fromaggression. Which is another reason to put these people into their owncategory.<h4>E.	Re-creation.</h4><p>	The heading for this category was difficult to select.  One thoughtwas "entertainment," but the present usage of the word is enough to putme off.  The hyphen is deliberate to provide for a separatepronunciation of "creation," and to insert a proper concept for theword "recreation."<p>	It is something which should come after achievement--after, andas a self-reward for doing something worthwhile.  In the long-term.<p>	I do not include what I would consider to be "sports figures"unless their activity was as an individual test against themselves oras an individual against a time, distance or some other such criteria.So-called "team sports" participants do not qualify.<p>Why this category at all?</p><p>	Man needs relaxation from his productive activities.  A "changeof pace," perhaps.  Often by doing something else a person's mind willgo into "free wheeling."  Or, as a computer, the subconscious engagesin "background processing," and the solution to the problem which waspreviously "unsolvable" suddenly pops into the mind.<p>	And what could promote that more than the sight of an iceskater gliding gracefully across the ice; a ballerina seeminglyfloating in the air--and even to beautiful music.  The contemplation ofa painting; the relaxation and laughter of a good cartoon "strip."  Andfor the ballerina we need a choreographer.  For the singer an orchestrahelps, although the orchestra can be very enjoyable by itself.  But itdoes need a conductor.  And a composer for the music.<p>	Sometimes in this world--as in all worlds--there are people whoare less worthy than others. I have left out many people; some deserveit, many do not.  All I can say is that this area is sometimes a littlemore difficult to select from.  Some people can lead disreputable andimmoral lives and still bring pleasure to the world. I have attemptedto leave out the truly immoral ones--as opposed to those who merelycontravened the culture of the time.  Others have been left out justbecause it takes more time to make selections.<p>	In the great scheme of things--man's striving to create a better lifeand world, this class--of "re-creationists"--make an enormous andworthwhile contribution.<center><h4>People & Events</h4></center><p>	With a very minor exception which will be explained, people whohave engaged in any sort of negative activities or the destruction ofproperty are not included in the database.<p>	Thus you will find only a few politicians, whether civil, military,or religious.  Military politicians are usually called generals, havingachieved this "exalted" rank.  Actually, the three generals listed donot deserve to be called politicians--even though they may have dabbledin it--and I will not do so.  Civil politicians have titles so numerousas to be impractical to list, and is no importance in long term history.<p>	Politicians as individuals are not necessarily bad.  It is the<b>system,/b> which is bad.  It is based on irrational and immoral preceptsand it corrupts the best of people.  Individuals who are basicallymoral and rational should see the internal contradictions of the systemand refuse to participate in it.  Many do, but many others heed the"siren call" of the pseudo-importance and imperial trappings of thisnon-profession.<p>The politicians and generals included are:</p><ol><li>Publius Cornelius Scipio - Scipio Africanus<li>Gen. Homer Lea<li>George Washington<li>Thomas Jefferson<li>Abraham Lincoln<li>Winston Spencer Churchill<li>Gen. Douglas MacArthur<li>Theodosius I</ol><h4>Scipio Africanus</h4><p>	It is with great affection, admiration and respect that Scipiois included.  The recognition due him as the greatest general inhistory is long overdue.  The great military historian, B. H. LiddellHart rescued Scipio from oblivion in our time by his book <i>A Greaterthan Napoleon</i>. Which went out of print almost as soon as it appeared,not to reappear again until forty years later, in 1971, through thecourtesy of Biblo & Tannen of New York City.<p>	Not only did Scipio defeat the man most people believe to bethe greatest general in history, but he did it while almost alwaysoutnumbered by his armies at least 2:1 up to 5:1.  Scipio defeated allof the members of the Barca family one by one until, finally, at theBattle of Zama on August 19th, 202 b.c., he met Hannibal directly forthe first and only time. There is some possibility that they may havemet personally just before the battle.<p>	One must remember that Scipio was fighting off the aggressor,defending his country. Carthage had attacked Rome and eventually killedScipio's father, also a general.  The Roman army in Spain was defeatedand in disarray, with the Carthaginians there getting ready to turntheir attention to the Roman heartland.  Then, when no one else wantedthe command--and while still in his early twenties--the Roman Senatereluctantly gave Scipio command of the Roman armies in Spain.  Reluctantlybecause he had no military experience, and was barely out of school.  Withinseveral years  he defeated both of Hannibal's brothers and broughtSpain back under Roman control.<p>	Then, against the "superior wisdom" of the Senate of Rome, andfinding and funding his own legions and ships since the Senate wouldnot help him, he went to Africa to meet Hannibal. Never mind thatHannibal was in Italy, and the Senate wanted Scipio to fight Hannibalthere. Scipio knew what he was doing.<p>	He went to Sicily where the disgraced 5th and 6th legions hadbeen exiled after their defeat at Cannae.  He spent months trainingthem and building up their moral, all the while have them constructships to take them to Carthage, since the Senate would not fund them.<p>	And in a one day battle near modern Tunis, with 20,000 troops against65,000 for Hannibal, Scipio defeated "the 'greatest' general inhistory."<p>	Yet his true greatness lay before him.  Both Hannibal and Scipio weredecent and honorable men as generals and human beings go, but all themore astoundingly so for their time in history.  Scipio did not razeCarthage, raping the women and enslaving the few male survivors.Rather, he appointed Hannibal--his defeated "enemy"--military governorof Carthage. The result was that within five years Carthage was moreprosperous than it had ever been.<p>	Yet this is still not the true greatness of the man--only aclue. Scipio was only thirty-five when he defeated Hannibal andreturned to Rome to a "Triumph" arranged by a grateful Senate andpeople at the head of the previously discredited 5th and 6th Legions. At this age he was offered what, in effect, was the rulership of "theknown world" for life. Previous to this, Rome was ruled by atriumvirate with one man being the committee-head for a year on arotating basis.<p>	Scipio was offered the chance to be a one man committee, andfor life.  To his everlasting credit he refused, saying that "...no manshould rule other men, and certainly not for life."  As to not insultan apparently grateful nation and the men who had served him so well,he eventually accepted for one year, during which time he did preciouslittle "ruling."<p>	I would like to repeat his entire story here, but you should dosome work on your own.  You will find Liddell Hart's book as excitingas any work of fiction and, with a little thought, one of the mosteducational books ever written.</p><hr><h4>Gen. Homer Lea</h4><p>	Gen. Lea is a bit of an odd-man-out in history.  He was an American,but was not a General in the American army, but the Chinese Army of SunYat Sen.  Because of physical deformities he was not consideredsuitable by the U. S. military.<p>	His significance lies not in military prowess but in a triumphof intelligence and perseverance over biological deformities, and hisunderstanding of the world.  And as an illustration of the fact thatthose who do not understand history and who are not intellectuallycurious are doomed by the past created for them, and the past they arecreating for future generations.<p>	Gen. Lea, in his book <i>The Valor of Ignorance</i>>, written in 1912(?), foretold with great accuracy the military expansionist activitiesof Japan.  He foresaw the attack on the Philippines and Pearl Harbor.Indeed, it appears the Japanese read his book and followed his invasionmaps.  And of course we know the Americans did <b>not</b> read his book.After all, he was a physical misfit, not suitable for military activities.</p><hr><h4>George Washington</h4><p>	Mr. Washington is included not for the traditional concept ofbeing "the father of our country,"--and certainly not for hisgeneralship--but because he refused to be King.  "Mr. President," whilenot the proper title for a significant person in history (unless it ispresident of a private company), is a slight step forward on the evolutionaryladder to a rational and moral social structure.<p>	He is also included  for this steadfast friendship with and supportof Thomas Paine, who earned virtually nothing from the massive sales of<i>Common Sense</i> and <i>The American Crisis</i>, which was a majorcausal factor of Washington's eventual defeat of the British. Upon receiptof a letter from Paine in December of 1781, Washington took steps torectify Paine’s deplorable financial situation.  For this Washington alsoacquires special merit.</p><hr><h4>Thomas Jefferson</h4><p>	The first five presidents of the United States were generallymen of great intellectual and moral stature, given their time and placein history and the knowledge available to them.<p>	Mr. Jefferson is included for his offer to send a warship toFrance to pick up his friend--and the intellectual father of the UnitedStates--Thomas Paine, who had been languishing in a French prison,barely escaping execution by the leaders of the rebellion against themonarchy. "Revolution," the usual word for the event, is not a correctterm to use for what was in fact the French Rebellion.<p>The world "revolution" implies a "turning around," or something new.Rebellions against a political ruler are not new.<p>	For this act, Jefferson earned the enmity of most Americans.Their gratitude toward Paine for his <i>Common Sense and The Crisis</i>had been short-lived, largely because of several intemperate lettersPaine had written to and about George Washington, and of course thealleged atheism of his <i>Age of Reason</i>.<hr><h4>Abraham Lincoln</h4><p>	While Abraham Lincoln was in a position of coercion, he was oneof the most decent persons in history to occupy such a position.  Assuch, we can forgive him his lack of knowledge concerning rational andmoral social structures.</p><hr><h4>Mr. Churchill</h4><p>	Churchill--whom I have elevated to Mr. from Sir--is included forperhaps one speech and the image he projected because of that:<ul><p>	"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landinggrounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shallfight in the hills; we shall never surrender."</p></ul><p>	His speech to Hitler and the world was that Britain would fightHitler down to the point of sticks and stones if necessary, but thathe--Hitler--could not and would not subdue Britain.<p>	This, and the inspiration it provided to the British people andthe RAF almost certainly caused Hitler to give up on Britain and turnhis attention to Russia.  Hitler would have turned to Russia eventuallyanyway, but if he had conquered Britain first and had an additionalyear or so to build his industrial and war capacity further, he mayvery well have conquered Russia.  And with his V-9 rocket, subdued theUnited States, his main obstacle to world domination<p>	After fifty years we tend to forget how desperate the situationwas in 1940 and 1941.  By his actions, Churchill may very well havesaved the world from another dark age.  For this, and this alone, hedeserves inclusion in the calendar and to be remembered in history.</p><hr><h4>General Douglas MacArthur</h4><p>MacArthur was probably the best general America has had, and one ofthe greatest since Scipio.  He was also--despite protestations to thecontrary--a very fine man.  Perhaps not nice, but fine.</p><p>From the way he conducted himself, from his actions in battle to those inpeace, it is obvious that he was a student of Scipio.  As with Scipio, thechances of surviving under MacArthur were much greater than with anyother general.  MacArthur, as Scipio, rarely if ever did the same thingtwice in battle.  And, if he could avoid a battle he did, as when he bypassedhundreds of thousand of Japanese soldiers on various islands, leaving them with nothing to do but grub for food.</p><p>Although he appeared to glory in war, that was because he hated it,wanted to win quickly, and get it over with.  He knew it was a terriblething, but one he was good at.  As history has shown, he was correct, andthe intellectual midget who was the Ruler of the United States--theformer bankrupt haberdasher and office boy for the Chicago bosses--waswrong about the Chinese in Korea.  They would <b>not</b> have doneanything had he gone ahead and bombed Manchuria.</p><p>He was obviously the student of Scipio for another reason--his handlingof the Japanese when he was the effective Viceroy of Japan.  He insistedthat Japanese soldiers hand in their arms to Japanese officers, and thatthey be allowed to keep their Emperor.  As with Scipio and Carthage, withina short time they were more prosperous than they had been before thewar.  To the discomfort of a complacent American political and businesscommunity.</p><hr><h4>Theodosius I</h4><center><p>* * the following is subject to further verification * *</p></center><p>	Whereas Churchill probably prevented the start of another darkage, Theodosius I deserves to be remembered for actually starting thefirst and only dark age to date on this planet.  How did he do this?<p>	He was the one who destroyed the Library at Alexandria, the greatestand most important repository of the magnificent and immense creationof the thinkers of antiquity.<p>	We have only a glimpse of what was destroyed, but that in itself isimmense.  A mere fragment of the knowledge represented by the books inThe Library has survived.  Yet it is this fragment, and thepreservation of this knowledge by the Arabs, which ended the dark agesand brought forth the renaissance.<p>	The destruction of people and tangible property is spectacularand tragic. The destruction of knowledge can go almost unnoticed at thetime.  In this respect it is very similar to the creation of knowledge. But the destruction--as the creation--has far reaching effects.  Onecan only imagine--and that with some difficulty--how our world would beif that knowledge had not been destroyed.  Can you project yourself1,000 years into the future?</p><hr><center><h4>Conclusion</h4></center><p>	In volitional societies, comprised of volitional beings, onlytwo things can occur.  One is that the civilization and its speciesurvives and thrives, or that it dies.  If the Library at Alexandriahad not been destroyed, our beautiful planet would either now be devoidof viable, volitional life forms, or members of our specie would longago have left earth to fulfill man's destiny: the exploration andcolonization of the universe on a moral basis.  I do not really want touse the word "colonize," except perhaps to restore it to a place ofhonor.<p>	And, we would be descendants of those who created a rationaland durable society in which coercion and property destruction wereconcepts known only to historians.<p>	The use here bears no resemblance to the traditional image ofthe word. A destruction of a beautiful word, brought on by man'sirrational social structure based on coercion.  The timelydisappearance of this phenomena--a social structure based oncoercion--determines whether a volitional specie survives to acquire atime scale of existence concomitant with that of its universe, or isextinguished.<p>	On this planet we are rapidly approaching a threshold--a pointof no return.  We can take a giant step toward avoiding this byelevating the men in the database of important people on this server--and others to be added--to the status of "hero."  Heroes and rolemodels which us and future generations can and must emulate for ourcivilization to survive.<p>	We have acquired the technological ability to destroy our owncivilization and lack the volitional knowledge (I will not use the wordsocial, and certainly not the phrase social science, which is acontradiction in terms and a travesty on the word <i>science</i>) to preventthis.  Without this knowledge, the life span of civilizations decreasesas their technical knowledge increases.<p>	The Egyptian civilization lasted 3,000 years or more.  The Romanone for 1,600 years when you include the "Eastern Roman Empire."  Thesun set on the British Empire in less than 900 years.  The NorthAmerican Empire is only slightly more than two hundred years old and isin an accelerating and probable terminal decline.<p>	We must emulate people such as Archimedes, Aristarchus, Eratosthenes,Euclid, Pythagoras, Scipio, Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton, Euler,Semmelweis, J.C. Maxwell, Einstein and Eddington and others to survive.Not Caesar, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin,Roosevelt, Kennedy or their predecessors and successors.</p><hr><h4>Notes:</h4><ol><li>	Dates in "Antiquity."	<p>	The exact dates of events in antiquity are often not known.

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><p>	What sort of Draconian political r&eacute;gime would decreesuch a thing? "Get a cat license or face the possibility of death." Surely this must be a Stalinist dictatorship or some other suchr&eacute;gime?<p>	The truth is, any political r&eacute;gime which wants to requireits citizens to have cat licenses, whether it be one characterized as atotalitarian r&eacute;gime, or a "democratic" r&eacute;gime.<p>	In other to understand the situation it is necessary to understandthe nature of political r&eacute;gimes, and--for the purpose of effectivecommunications--establish some definitions.<p>	First the matter of definitions.  Definitions are required andagreed upon by people so they can understand what each person meanswhen a subject is being discussed.  Without agreed definitions, therecan be no effective discussion and it is not possible to create new anduseful knowledge.  People may agree to a definition only for thefurtherance of the discussion.  They need not accept the definition asbeing final.<p>	Definitions may be already existing or, if new areas of knowledge arebeing explored, they may be created for the purpose of discussion andinvestigation of the subject.  A new definition is, by nature,arbitrary.  If it becomes useful for the purpose of discussion and thecreation of new and useful knowledge, then it become more solidlyestablished.<p>	I ask you to accept the following definitions for the purpose of thisdiscussion.  If you wish to discard them later or continue to use them,that is your decision.  Please remember that I am discussing principlesbased on rationality; emotion should be left out.   Whether thedefinitions have future value for you must be determined by your viewof what happens in the world around you.<p>	After each definition I will discuss it briefly to establish theepistemological thought process  behind the definition, and toanticipate possible reactions and objections.</p><p>Definitions:</p><ul>	<li>Political R&eacute;gime:     		<ul>     		<p>     		<b>A mechanism in which one group of people controls the     		property of all others without their permission</b>.     		</p><p>	In a so-called "<a href="Glossary.html#DEMOC">democracy</a>,"there is implied consent through the process of political <a href="Glossary.html#VOT">voting</a>.  Yetit is highly improbable that all people will agree to all aspects ofall laws or even one law.  Witness the raging debates over abortion,capital punishment, and firearms control.<p>	And the matter of taxation.  There may be vague general agreement byvirtually everyone that taxes are necessary, but near total disagreementon what should or should not be taxed, and how much the tax should be, howthe money should be spent, etc.<p>	Further, political laws and bureaucracies tend to have a lifeof their own.  Once created they are rarely, if  ever, totallyrescinded or eliminated.</p></ul>	<li>A Democracy:	<ul>     		<p>     		<b>A political r&eacute;gime wherein those controlled by the     		r&eacute;gime give their nominal consent to such control</b>.		</p>	</ul>	<li>A Dictatorship:		<ul>     		<p>     		<b>A political r&eacute;gime wherein those controlled by     		the r&eacute;gime need not give their consent to such control</b>.     		</p>     		<p>	It should be seen from the above definitions that there is no	difference in principle between dictatorships and democracies.  They	are both societies based on coercion.	</p></ul>	<li>Law				<ul>		<p>    		<b>A statement by a political r&eacute;gime stating what a    		person may or may not do, and often when and how it must be    		done or not done</b>	<p>	It should also be recognized that all proclamations of a politicalr&eacute;gime, whether they are termed laws, regulations, decrees,executive orders, or by some other term, must be obeyed or the personmust pay the prescribed penalty.<p>	For the purpose of this discussion I will use the word "law" tomean any such statement by a political r&eacute;gime.</ul></ul><p>However, and this is the principle statement of this essay:</p><ul>	<p>	<b>in every political law and under every political	r&eacute;gime--whether a dictatorship or a democracy--there is	an unmentioned concept and associated penalty. This is the fact	that any political law must be obeyed under penalty of death</b>.	</p></ul><p>	To illustrate this, let's take the case of a cat license in,say, the political entity known as "California."  In the "democratic"country of the United States of America, which is thought of as being a"humane" and "free" society.<p>	There are in fact certain local r&eacute;gimes in Californiawhich require that cats have licenses, just as dogs often must do so.<p>	In principle the way the system works in California is that aperson--assuming they had already had a license for their cat--wouldreceive a renewal notice in the post.  And routinely write a check andsend it with the required form. Suppose this time however the cat ownerdecides this is all unnecessary and that the cat--and the owner--do notreally want the license?<p>	After a period of time a relatively polite letter would arrivereminding the owner that perhaps they had forgotten the matter, andwould they please return the form and the associated fee.  When theowner does not comply there will probably be several more letters fromthe "animal regulation bureau," each becoming less polite and moredemanding.<p>	At some point, a letter will be sent indicating that if the owner doesnot comply within a certain number of days they must appear at the"animal regulation facility" to explain why they have failed to comply. And, in this letter or perhaps a following one, there will be anindication that failure to reply will cause the matter to be turnedover to the "court."<p>	When this happens the owner will receive something from thecourt ordering them to appear, explain why they have not paid (althoughthis may not be necessary), to pay the fee and probably a penalty. With the additional note that failure to appear at the appointed timeand place will result in a "bench warrant" being issued for the arrestof the owner.<p>	Issuance of a such an arrest warrant entitles the politicalr&eacute;gime to arrest the individual immediately.  Further, there areno more "niceties" involved.  The individual will go immediately tojail to await the decision of a political judge to decide what to donext.  The person will not be offered any chance to explain and toperhaps recant their sin and pay on the spot, thus avoiding jail.  Thepolitical police have only been empowered to arrest the individual andput them in jail and, according to the system, may not "negotiate" withthe individual.  Only a judge may do this, although it will appear tobe a one-sided "negotiation."  Political judges in almost all politicalr&eacute;gimes are the ultimate source of undisputed and undisputablepower, except by political judges at a higher level.  Except for consummatepoliticians such as a Hitler or Stalin, political judges have powersexceeding those of the ruler of the country.  As Mr. Nixon discovered.  Apolitician worthy of the non-profession would have had the judge(s)removed, incarcerated, or shot, but in a "democracy" they are the ultimatepower.<p>	The political police, normally being quite busy with prostitutes,drug dealers, and other such dangers to society, will not send a SWATteam to your house to arrest you.  However the warrant goes into thecomputer system of the r&eacute;gime and if the individual is stopped for apossible traffic violation or is questioned by the police for someother reason, their name will pop up in the computer.  They will beimmediately handcuffed and taken to jail.  If they are in their car,that will be towed away by the police and impounded.  With "storage"fees probably starting immediately.<p>	Whether they surround your house with a SWAT team or pick you up"accidentally," there are two possibilities.  Either you accept thesituation and go with them or refuse to do so.  Perhaps your cat hastold you it does not want or need the license, and you decide to defendyour friend.<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	The only reason the following scenarios do not happen is because aperson makes a <b>value judgement</b><a href="#1">[1]</a> as to whetherthey wish to pay for their cat license, or risk fine, imprisonment, anddeath.  Death?  Over failure to get a cat license?  Yes, that is thechoice.  Why?<p>	Let's suppose there is a scenario in which you are faced by thepolice, who wish to arrest you.  You do not wish to be arrested, andwill not allow it to happen under any circumstances.  Both you and yourcat see no reason for the license and will not submit.  What willhappen?<p><a name="2r"></p><p>	The political police<a href="#2">[2]</a> must and will useincreasing force to require you to submit to their wishes.  If you useevery means at your disposal to prevent them from taking you to jail,they must use increasing force to make you comply.  At some point theywill begin to understand that nothing short of over-powering force willbe required to make you comply.  Yet you resist this and in theprocess appear to be a threat to the police, since you are making itclear that their escalation of force will be met with escalatingresistance.<p>	Their threats toward you can be perceived as putting your lifein danger, and your resistance appears to put in danger the life of oneor more police personnel.  Since they presumably outnumber you and havegreat means of force at their disposal, the result is a foregoneconclusion.  You will go with them, or you will die resisting them. Itmust and will be this way.  Why?</p><h4>Consider the alternative.</h4><p>	At some point the police realize you and your cat are seriousabout not getting a license.  At this point, the person in charge ofthe police contingent steps back, thinks, and then speaks.  "Why didn'tyou tell us you <b>really</b> did not want a license for your cat?!  Thissheds a new light on things.  If you had told us that before, we wouldnot have had all this trouble.  Please, as long as you feel that way,continue on your way and we shant bother you again."<p>	Anyone who believes this fantasy, please stop believing it,as it puts you in great danger.  And, if it were true, the politicalstate would be in even greater danger.  If no one sees this, they arenot thinking.  What would happen if this were allowed to occur?<p>	You go home and explain this encounter to your neighbors.  Oneof them decides it is not necessary to have a license for their dog. Another, much more brazen individual, decides they do not need a permitfrom some bureaucracy to build their son a tree house in the tree inthe back yard.<p>	Even more daringly, someone decides they do not need a permitto modify their house.  Another person decides they don't need to paytheir property taxes.  A local store, with the approval of the parent,decides to offer a thirteen year old a job cleaning their store room,Or bagging groceries for older and infirm customers.  Another persondecides they will not pay the $1,000 import duty on their car,preferring to spend it with a neighborhood merchant rather than have itbe used to provide guns for friends of the r&eacute;gime to pursue awar with people who are not friends of the r&eacute;gime.<p>	As you probably realize, none of this can be allowed to happen. All political laws of all political r&eacute;gimes, whether democratic ordictatorial (no difference in <b>principle</b> of operation, only in style)<b>must</b> back up their laws by the threat of deadly force.<p>	Again, please do not be confused by the fact that you haven't recentlyread of a battle between police and someone who did not want a catlicense.  The reason of course is that the cat's friend values life andfreedom, and makes a value judgement.  We do this because we knowsubconsciously and implicitly what will happen if we resist.  It willdegrade the quality of your life.<h4>What is the purpose of writing this?</h4><p>	Before we can understand the basic cause of the problems facing thecivilization of man (the specie) on this planet, we must clearlyunderstand the basis principle of operation of our current societalmechanism.  Then, and only then, can we begin to think intelligentlyabout a solution to our societal problems.<p>	The solution will be explained in succeeding articles, but Iwill give you one clue immediately.  The solution does not involvecontesting force with force, nor any means that involve propertyinterference or destruction of any type.  It does not involve marchingor protesting for or against anything.<p>	And, what it does mean, is a solution that is personally profitableto each individual to any of the transactions involved in the process. Itmeans the solution is in greater knowledge of the true problem, so thatthe solution can be understood by the participants.  A solution which,like a raw and uncut diamond, is laying in the pages of history for usto recognize and to implement.  A solution that will increase thequality of life for all.<p>	Contrasted to all the present non-solutions, which bring usonly increased unemployment, disorder, the choice of inflation orrecession, and all the other products of societies based on coercion.<p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>All of life requires value judgements, dicriminating	or choosing between possible alternatives.

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><p>	What was it that the "founding fathers" of the United States wanted?What did they hope to achieve as expressed in the Declaration ofIndependence and the Constitution?<p>	Almost without exception they had with them the image of thecountries from which they came, which were largely those of GreatBritain and Europe.  The image of what is generically called a "feudalsystem," in which a feudal lord controlled all the property and peoplein his area.  To be more correct, it was the <i>system</i> that oftenprovided the control, rather than person, Whether this was a relativelysmall, local area, or whether it was a king or emperor controlling vastdominions.<p>	In this feudal system it was very clear that most people, exceptingonly the aristocracy and their minions, were essentially slaves of thearistocracy, represented by the dominant, local, feudal "Lord andMaster."  It was a system characterized by control by force, with onlyminor use of fraud.  The people were under no illusions that they were"free" men.  Even in Great Britain, where there was a designated,formal class of individual known as a <i>freeman</i>, these people also trodwith caution and respect for the rulers and their representatives.<p>	What was the main, operative factor of this system?  Control ofthe life and property of the individual--of all individuals under theircontrol.  The operative concept of being "under the control" of someone,or of a system.  Life and property is a redundant expression, as the lifeof each individual <i>is</i> their <b>sole</b> property.  It would be sufficient tosay only "property," by such is the sad state of semantic precision andabsolute definitions in what is euphemistically called the "socialsciences" that it is sometimes necessary to use redundant expressions.<p>	It was this they hoped to change.  How did they propose to dothis? They wanted to create a system in which the individual would havecontrol of their life, property, and individual destiny. The best thingthey could imagine, for which we can not fault them at that point inthe history of the specie, was a system in which all individuals wouldhave access to their ruler or rulers, albeit through a system ofrepresentatives.  With our vantage point several hundred years on, withmore knowledge of history available--and hindsight that the proposedsystem does not work--we have an advantage over our antecedents.<p>	One reason they wanted middlemen, rather than direct <a href="Glossary.html#DEMOC">democracy</a>,was their fear of the consequences of direct democracy.  Most of the"framers" and "founders" were men (and they <i>were</i> mostly men) with agreat knowledge of history.  They knew that direct democracy had neverworked, and probably would not work.  They still believed in a "class"system in the sense that there were those who were literate and welleducated, and those who were not.<p>	They were very correct in that understanding, as the large majorityof people were illiterate.  And, such people, although illiterate andwithout "formal" education were predominantly men of high principlesand moral integrity as well as they understood the concept.  Muchdifferent than the politicians of today.  They would undertake to bethe "moral guardians" of those who were less well educated.<p>	Although I don't know if it was explicit in their thinking,they obviously felt that only "the educated" should vote.  Only thosewho were producers and creators in society.  And they would then securethe property rights of those who were not formally educated orliterate, and thus did not vote.  In summary, it was a "republic"system, with:</p><ul>  <p>  <li>Government of the people, by the people, for the people  </p>    <p>  <li>One man, one vote, with each vote carrying the same weight as any     other.  But with voting limited to the "educated."     </p></ul><p>	With the exception of who is allowed to vote, the system is thesame as exists today in the United States and other so-called"democracies."  Which of course are not true democracies, although theeffect is the same.<p>	The problem that the "framers and founders" did not and couldnot foresee, is that their cherished "republic" would--overtime--become the functional equivalent of a "democracy," with all ofthe bad characteristics they feared.<p><a name="1r"></p><p>	How did this happen?  It happened over time because of Acton'sDisease.  "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<a href="#1">[1]</a> The same problem they thought they had eliminated byeliminating the king.  They thought that their class of educatedindividuals--people with an understanding of history and withindividual integrity--would continue in perpetuity.  They did notforesee that each "representative" or agent of the people would succumb toActon's Disease. And that--to stay in power--they would adopt the worstaspects of democracy.  Such as appealing to the masses and looking forthe lowest common denominator.  Of finding out what it is people "need"(please refer to the essay on this subject) and then offering toprovide it to them.  And that in order to do this, there would beincreasing control of individuals through increasing property controland confiscation.  And, when this is not popular, additional controls overindividuals and an increasing use of fraud to make sure they comply.<p>	This requires levels of taxation that would have caused anarmed rebellion and overthrow of the r&eacute;gime in the seventeenth andeighteenth centuries.  The proximate, "last straw" that caused therebellion against King George III.  And, as I said, the tax then wasminuscule compared to today.  Why doesn't it cause a rebellion now?<p>	Because fraud has replaced force in the American system.  Thefraud takes many forms:</p><ul>	<li>You are free when you are not 	<li>It is all for the "public good" 	<li>It is needed to support our position in the world 	<li>It is needed to keep foreign products out (Customs taxes) 	<li>It is necessary to place our goods in other countries (where they are		foreign goods) 	<li>It is necessary for a war to protect "democracy" and "the American		way of life" (Vietnam) 	<li>It is necessary to "fight" to eradicate poverty in America 	<li>It is necessary to "fight" to eradicate poverty in (your favorite		country) 	<li>It is necessary to assure an independent supply of oil, or make		America independent on oil (petrol taxes and control of oil		companies) 	<li>It is necessary to make the rich less rich (excise taxes, wealth		taxes) 	<li>It is necessary to make the poor more rich (money transfer) 	<li>It is necessary to support a nationalized industry (postal		services, etc.)	<li>It is necessary to prepare a nationalized industry for		"privatization," since the politicians are now wrong that such an		industry was needed for "the people," and therefore nationalized		by an earlier r&eacute;gime	<li>It is necessary to support a commodity price so that it can then		be sold at less than market price 	<li>It is necessary to pay farmers not to grow something 	<li>It is necessary to pay farmer to grow something else	<li>It is needed for education 	<li>It is needed to create space stations, and to satisfy the fantasies		of our "representatives" (see a following discussion on this		subject) 	<li>It is needed for a myriad of supplemental programs		for education, since the educational system does not work</ul><p>	Nor did they foresee the development of a truly Draconian legalsystem, in which there would be a myriad of laws which would not onlyprohibit or control almost everything, but even laws to permit things. The result being that unless something was expressly permitted, peoplewould begin to assume it was prohibited.  This is beyond even themadness that George Orwell could foresee.<p>	The thing the framers and founders were trying to avoid was theold system of laws so broad that--literally--almost any deed would becriminal or even seditious.  Sedition being the veiled threat behindstatements such as "...you must be against the 'American way of life'."Again, the thing they feared the most came in through a hiddenentrance.<p>	Something I did not see until several days ago (1995, August12) illustrates the formidable--and probably hopeless--task the framersand founders faced, and how they could not possibly have foreseen thetraps awaiting their best efforts at eliminating the tyrannies of thepast.<p><a name="2r"></p><p>	It occurred to me while doing sit-ups on a slant board, a dayor so after reading an otherwise innocuous press report (not a "news"article.)  Because this is fresh in my mind and very important, I willgive full credit to <i>Newsweek</i> magazine for this revelation.  In theirarticle "Pork Goes Republican,"<a href="#2">[2]</a> they discussed theso-called "space station" program of the regime, mentioning a notionalcost figure of US$30.4 billion.<p>	Please note that this is more than thirty million times the amount ofmoney expended by Wilbur & Orville Wright in the development,fabrication and testing which led to powered, controlled-flight.  It isalso more than 500,000 times the amount of money needed to create bothHewlett-Packard Corporation and Digital Equipment Corporation. It isalso interesting to note that, in connection with the invention of theairplane by the Wright Brothers, the U. S. Army paid Samuel LangleyUS$50,000 (fifty times what it cost the Wright Brothers) in a failedattempt to try to develop a flying machine <b>after</b> the Wright Brothershad successfully flown.<p>	They thought it would be simple to develop a flying machine. Just copy the appearance of the Wright <i>Flyer</i>.  Then they wouldn't needto deal with them.  They--the U.S. Army and their associated politicalmasters--would have "invented" their own airplane.  Even AlexanderGraham Bell, after successfully copying and stealing the idea for thetelephone from Philipp Reis and Elijah Grey, failed in his attempt to stealsufficient knowledge from the Wright Brothers with which--in collaborationconspiracy with Glen Curtis--he could build a successful flyingmachine.<p>	But, back to the space station.  It seems that there was a veryreal chance that this bit of pork was going to go off to the place fromwhich no pig returns.  Then, 'lo and behold, Melanie Griffith appearsbefore our salivating "representatives" in a tight-fitting, whiteVersace suit.  It now appears that out of the revelation, visions, anddreams of this visit, the pork is going to be alive and well. Our"representatives" may now be willing to spend the US$30.4 billion. There is only one problems with this.<p>	It is not their money.  Not money they have individually savedfrom moral employment in the creation of property.  Rather, it is moneythey propose to acquire through the mechanism of "voluntary compliance"of those they represent.  It would make this essay too long to discussthis travesty of justice further.<p>	What has now happened to the original intent of the framers andfounders to protect the property of individuals from control andconfiscation by the "Lord of the Manor"?  And what has happened to theconcept that the "vote" and "rights" of each individual are equal? And, that the "representative" will <b>truly</b> represent the wishes of <b>each</b> individual who entrusted them with their wishes?  And theirproperty?  There has been a total perversion of the concepts.<p>	The representatives in question are part of the same group thatproposes to protect young and immature minds from "prurient"influences.  From doing rash and immoral things when an attractiveperson of the opposite sex flashes their "attributes" before them. Thisagain begs the question of, "Who will protect us from our <i>protectors</i>"?	<p>	This is the failed system of regulating societies through coercionthat has been with us for millions of years.  Wherein the strongestindividual, or the one with the most coercive powers at his command,controls all others in the society.</p><p>We must ask ourselves several questions.</p><ul><p> <li> Does this system really work to the advantage of each individual     in a society?    </p>    <p><li> Has such a system ever really worked in history?  Or is the     dustbin of history filled with failed civilizations based on this     concept?     </p>     <p><li>Is this the system we want for ourselves, and to saddle future     generations with?     </p></ul><p>	If there were a system available which would guarantee that eachindividual had full control of their own property, and could do whateverthey wished as long as it did not involve interference with theproperty of another, would you be interested in thinking about such asystem?<p>	Bearing in mind that no societal system should be acceptedunless each individual believes that it will in fact improve thequality of their own individual life, and that of those who depend onthem. And, further, that the adoption of such a system can not result inproperty inteference.</p><p>We should think of two other things:</p><ul>  <p>  <li>We should have learned from history that property creation     based on prior property destruction is <b>not</b> a workable concept.     </p>     <p><li>Property must first be created before it can be destroyed.  And     which group in society does which?     </p></ul><p>If you are interested in thinking about such things, I encourage youto read the existing and forthcoming essays from The FreedomServer<sup>&copy;</sup></p><p>And then:</p><ul><p><li>Look at the world around you to see if there is a possibility that    the concepts will work;</p><p><li>think whether the existing concepts do and can achieve what you      want for yourself and your family;</p><p><li>decide if you want to do something to improve your individual      life, and that of others in our society;</p><p><li>think if you want to create a better world for those who come      after us.</p></ul><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>With credit to Lord Acton.	<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>"Pork Goes Republican," by Thomas Rosenstiel. 	<i>Newsweek</i> magazine, Aug. 14, 1995, p. 36        <a href="#2r">Return</a></ol><hr><p>Copright &copy;1995--Universal Salvage Corporation</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server<sup>&copy;</sup> please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Govt-Against-People.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

Morgan</h4></center><hr noshade><p>	In the article "Is America Marching to the Drum of 1896?" (<i>TheSunday Times</i>, 1996, 25 Feb., p. 3-5), the statement is made by the author(Andrew Sullivan) that, "But these are the wrong questions."  By thisMr. Sullivan is referring to such questions as whether there is an endto the Reagan-Thatcher coalition of socially liberal yuppies andconservative lower-middle classes.  Or a collapse of the post-warcentre-left of working-class voters and post-socialist elites.<p>	Mr. Sullivan then launches into what he believes are the correctquestions, which relate to the concept of American "populism" of 100years ago.  I don't like to disappoint Mr. Sullivan, but I am afraid hedoesn't have the correct question either.  But then he should not beupset, as no one ever does ask the correct question.<p>	The correct question is whether individual members of a volitional orthinking specie should be responsible for the conduct of their ownindividual lives, or whether--as political systems assume--they needsomeone to control most aspects of their life for them.  Presumablybeing incapable of doing this on an individual basis. And assumingthere is a group of people in such a specie who are especially endowedwith abilities to perform this function for individuals who areincapable of doing it for themselves.<p>	Even more basic--and central the solution to the problem offailed societal mechanisms--is the question of whether or not it isever moral and rational for someone to control the property of anotherperson without their permission.  And lest someone say that in aso-called "democratic" society the permission is granted through thevoting process, I say they are not thinking clearly.  It is alwaysmoral to appoint someone else to control your own property, but whatyou are doing through political voting is appointing someone to alsocontrol the property of others. Perhaps millions  or hundreds ofmillions of others.<p>	Mr. Sullivan also mentions that the appeal of a "simple solution" isvery great.  And, since this is a political system, he also invokes the"enemy."  Politics is a system of winners and losers, and of friendsand enemies. In fact, political elections seem to be more about makingthe opponent out to be an enemy rather than to state one's own policiesand position.  Which, in any case--since they involve interfering inand controlling the property of others without their permission--isimmoral. Such actions may appear to be rational in the short term, butare never rational in any period of time.  As millennia of failedpolitical societies attest.<p>	The simple solution--and the moral solution--is a situation inwhich each person is responsible for the conduct of their own life andnon-interference in the life and property of others.  This is bothmoral and rational.<p>	People say such a concept is "idealistic" or "Utopian," but itis neither of these.  The reasons they say this is because it isassumed that in a situation in which anyone can do anything they wishas long as it does not interfere in the property of another will resultin just that--everyone interfering in the property and lives ofeveryone else. Yet if that were so, could it be worse than today'ssituation?  Of course being only the same as today would not be animprovement, and hardly worth discussing.<p>	I think that many people would say that what is lacking today isa proper concept of justice and a situation in which justice prevails.And, in fact, a proper definition of justice can come from this conceptof interference in the property of others without theirpermission--which is the operative concept of "crime."  Justice mightbe defined as "lack of recourse from crime."  Of course the supremeconcept of justice would be a situation in which there is no crime.  Isthat possible?<p>	Yes, and it is not idealistic or Utopian.  In fact it is the currentsystem--which assumes that people will be content in a situation inwhich they are told what they may and may not do--is the one which ishopelessly idealistic.  Why?  Because it goes against the fundamentalnature of man, the specie.<p>	Every thinking being is an individual, with individual hopesand dreams.  An individual and unique concept of what will bring themhappiness.  Any system which presumes to over-ride this is doomed tofailure.  There will never be contentment with such a system, asindicated by the plethora of problems facing all the politicalsocieties of this planet.<p>	As political elections should show us, political societiesoffer their subjects nothing but unacceptable alternatives, and falsealternatives. The classic multiple choice examination question, inwhich you are presented, say, four possible answers, with one of thembeing "none of the above."  The problem is, that option is never reallyallowed in a political election.  You must select one of the choices,or just not vote at all. The problem is, one of the choices will end uprunning your life.  It is the system that is the problem, not theindividuals. Individuals come and go, but the system seems eternal.<p>	A classic statement of monarchy is that "The King is Dead; LongLive the King."  What people forget is that the King is only thetitular head of the system.  The name can be president, prime minister,shah, czar, or even the innocuous title of "first secretary."  Ageneralized version of the above would  be "The Ruler is Dead; LongLive the State."<p>	The one choice that is never offered or even thought of is: "Doyou wish to have a societal system in which someone will control mostof the aspect of your individual life?"  That is never asked because noone even conceives of the alternative as a possibility, since there hasbeen a state and someone to rule the tribe or state since timeimmemorial.   It is sort of a "macro version" of what happened in theUSSR; most people found it hard to cope with the fact that theParty--which had  been omnipresent and omnipotent in individual lifefor several generations--was no longer there.  "How will we functionwithout the Party telling us what to do?"<p>	Yet nothing in principle has changed in Russia.  There is stillsomeone telling people how to run most aspects of their life, althoughit does have a touch of the "Wild West" of the United States, in which"outlaws" also had their place in society.<p>	Yet the question returns: How do you control society if thereis no political state with its monopoly on police powers?  Won't"crime" just proliferate, and "lawlessness" reign supreme?  Never mindthat life is very chancy even now under the current system.<p>	How would you ensure that, in a society in which each could exploreand pursue there own concept of happiness, that it was not like thedays of the "Wild West"?<p>	Earlier I mentioned the very powerful concept of volitionallife which states that--as fingerprints and genetic makeup createunique individuals--each person has their own concept of happiness andhow to conduct the functioning of their life.<p>	There is another very fundamental aspect of volitional lifewhich balances that concept, and which is at the heart of the failureof political mechanisms.  It is actually the corollary of the previousstatement.<p>	It is the concept that--given an alternative--a volitional beingwill not willingly do that which has the potential of degrading thequality of their life.  That is, given the alternative to freely chosefrom various courses of action, an individual will not do that whichreduces or has the possibility of reducing their quality of life.<p>	This provides us with the answer to how a society or societiesof volitional beings can regulate their civilization without requiringan organization with police powers.  It is the system which allowspolitical regimes to survive until they become totally dysfunctionaland collapse from within.  The fact that people will chose to obeysilly, harmful, irrational and even immoral rules rather than gothrough the unpleasantness associated with disobeying a political law.Being fined, going to jail, perhaps even being murdered by thepolitical state.  Yet, if there is the opportunity and possibility,they may seek a "loop hole" if they believe the chance of gettingcaught is very small.<p>	Yet it is this desire to not do something that will have a negativeimpact on their quality of life that can be used to regulate a societywithout resorting to police powers.  To do this, you need only adoptthe concept of the credit mechanism.  But not in the narrow form offinancial credit as now used, but in the broader form of positivecredit for not interfering in the property of another, and negativecredit when an individual does interfere with the property of anotherperson.<p>	The only thing needed for this to work is a proper understanding ofproperty.  The concept that everything-- even intellectualproperty--has an owner.  Ownership is a moral concept, meaning thatproperty ownership cannot be acquired through immoral means.  Throughtheft of the property, or purchasing the property using stolen funds. If theft were a valid way to acquire ownership of property it wouldmean that if someone stole your car they thereby became the acceptedowner.  Such a system would produce chaos.  As does the current systemwhich allows so-called "public ownership."<p>	Such a concept is ludicrous.  The ability to freely sell a property isone evidence of ownership.  Yet if you and 200 million other people"own" a "public" park, can you reasonably expect to sell your 200millionth of it? Try it.  This means you do not truly own it.Furthermore, the ability to exercise control over your property isevidence of ownership.  Such as being able to get in your car and drivesomewhere whenever you wish to do so.  But can you enter "your" publicpark and use it as you wish?<p>	In a rational and durable societal structure all property wouldhave an identifiable owner or owners.  Which, according to theagreement under which the property was acquired, it could also be soldand used as specified by the purchaser(s) at the time of purchase.<p>	This means that streets and roads would be owned by individuals, justas telephone companies, food stores and associated other "public"facilities and/or services are owned now.  Albeit often bycorporations, empowered by their stockholders (owners) to operate, use,and dispose of the property as mutually agreed.<p>	For people who say that roads and streets and such things wouldno longer be "free," I must say again that anyone who believes in theconcept that such things are "free" now is living under a delusion.Roads and streets and their use are not free now.  They are constructedand maintained using money extracted from people in the form of taxesand only have the illusion of being free.  You have access to theseroads and streets by virtue of paying your taxes and remaining in goodstanding in your societal group.<p>	And you often pay a hefty surcharge for this.  Witness the manystate-controlled telephone companies, where service was poor and pricescontrolled and high.  Of course they are sometimes controlled with bothservice and usage cost being low, which provides a different illusion.With telephone service being a "requirement" of modern life, why isn'tit totally "free," as road and street usage is?<p>	The reason I contrast road and street usage with telephone services isthat it is part of the answer to the "credit mechanism" for controllingbehavior in a rational society without need for police.<p>	With everything having an owner, access to all property can becontrolled by the owner.  Just as the political state does, but in thiscase it is moral.  It is always moral for an owner to be in totalcontrol of their own property, but not of the property of anyone else(without that owner's permission).<p>	If someone interferes in the property of another, it would bemoral--and rational--to prevent access by that person to your property. If, for example, someone were a thief, why would you want to let themuse roads or streets you owned?  Or the use of telephone services youowned and provided.  Or to shop in a food market you owned?<p>	If a person who had committed a crime suddenly found that theycould not buy food, use roads and streets, have electrical andtelephone service, they might begin to think twice about what they haddone. About the consequences of their actions.  If they also knew theycould reverse this process, but admitting their mistake and offering toprovide restitution for their actions, there would be a powerfulincentive for them to do so and rejoin mainstream society.  Their"prison" would have been a lifestyle which had suddenly becomeunacceptable.<p>	No need to build a network of prisons which--it has been shown--neverreally stops crime.  And certainly never provides restitution to thevictim(s) of crime.  No need to have an ever-expanding police force totry vainly to counter ever-increasing crime.  With the expansion of thepolice force and associated laws representing ever-greater intrusionsinto individual life and liberty, degrading the quality of life forall.<p>	The foregoing is the answer to the question that is never asked:Is there something wrong with  the basic principle upon which allsocial structures on this planet are based?  The usual thought is that"… we need more and better laws.  And better enforcement of existinglaws." But we have been doing this for millennia, and things onlybecome worse.  The only thing that has changed for the better isincreasing technology, making life easier and better in a constantlydeteriorating social structure.  The why and how this occurs is anothersubject much to long for this short essay.<p>	This essay also indicates the solution to the current problemsof mankind through the application of the concepts of property sanctityand the credit mechanism<p>	By careful consideration of the foregoing it is possible to constructa rational and durable social structure to replace the one which is inwhat is probably a terminal decline.  It will be terminal if not soonreversed.</p><hr><p>Copyright &copy; 1989--WWMorgan</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><center><P>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation</p><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I></center><HR NOSHADE><p>For information on The Freedom Server<sup>&copy;</sup> please contact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">Administrator</a></p></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/The-Correct-Question.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>

An Overview of the Antidumping Laws</h4><p><a name="2r"><a name="3r"></p><p><a name="4r"><a name="5r"><a name="6r"></p><p>	The antidumping laws assess penalties if there is a reasonableindication that an industry in the United States is materially injured,or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment of anindustry in the United States is materially retarded because someimport is being sold in the United States for less than fair value.<a href="#2">[2]</a> One of the first antidumping laws was incorporatedinto the Revenue Act of 1916,<a href="#3">[3]</a> which was at timesreferred to as the Antidumping Duty Act of 1916,<a href="#4">[4]</a>but it is really the Tariff Act of 1930,<a href="#5">[5]</a> also knownas the Smoot-Hawley Tariff, and later amendments,<a href="#6">[6]</a>which serve as the basis for present-day antidumping law.<p><a name="7r"><a name="8r"></p><p>	The legal standard for a preliminary or final determinationin an antidumping investigation requires the U.S. International TradeCommission (USITC) to determine whether there is a reasonableindication of material injury or threat of material injury to adomestic industry because of the import under investigation, based onthe best available information available at the time of the preliminaryinvestigation.<a href="#7">[7]</a>  The USITC sometimes also looks atwhether the establishment of an industry in the United States ismaterially retarded.<a href="#8">[8]</a><p>	To determine whether there is a reasonable indication that a domesticindustry is materially injured because of the imported item beinginvestigated, the USITC is to consider:</p><ul>	<li> The volume of imports of the merchandise which is the subject of	the investigation,	<li>The effect of imports of that merchandise on prices in the United	States for like products, and	<li>The impact of imports of such merchandise on domestic producers of	like products, but only in the context of production operations	within the United States.<a href="#n9n">[9]</a></ul><p><a name="10r"><a name="11r"><a name="12r"></p><p><a name="13r"><a name="14r"><a name="15r"><a name="16r"></p><p>	It may also consider other relevant factors,<a href="#10">[10]</a>concerning the volume, price effects and impact of imports.  Thesefactors are to be evaluated in the context of the business cycle andcompetitive conditions that are distinctive to the affected industry.<ahref="#11">[11]</a>   The USITC may also consider other factors itdeems relevant, but if it chooses to evaluate other factors, it mustexplain why they are relevant.<a href="#12">[12]</a>  It may consideralternative causes of injury, but may not weigh causes.<ahref="#13">[13]</a>  It does not need to determine that imports are thesole, or even a principal or substantial cause of material injury butmust merely determine whether imports are a contributing cause of thematerial injury.<a href="#14">[14]</a>  It may also consider whetherfactors other than the less than fair value imports have made theindustry more vulnerable to the effects of the less than fair valueimports.<a href="#15">[15]</a> And while it may take the departuresfrom an industry into account, it must assess the condition of theindustry as a whole and not on a company-by-company basis.<ahref="#16">[16]</a><p>To determine whether there is a threat of material injury, theUSITC considers, among other things,</p><ul><p>	<li>If a subsidy is involved, such information as may be presented to	it by the administering authority as to the nature of the	subsidy,<p>	<li>Any increase in production capacity or existing unused capacity in	the exporting country that is likely to result in a significant	increase in imports of the merchandise to the United States,<p>	<li>Any rapid increase in United States market penetration and the	likelihood that the penetration will increase to an injurious	level,<p>	<li>The probability that imports of the merchandise will enter the	United States at prices that will have a depressing or suppressing	effect on domestic prices of the merchandise,<p>	<li>Any substantial increase in inventories of the merchandise in the	United States,<p>	<li>The presence of underutilized capacity for producing the	merchandise in the exporting country,<p>	<li>Any other demonstrable adverse trends that indicate the probability	that the importation (or sale for importation) of the merchandise	(whether or not it is actually being imported at the time) will	be the cause of actual injury,<p>	<li>The potential for product-shifting if production facilities	owned or controlled by the foreign manufacturers, which can be	used to produce products subject to investigation(s) under section	701 or 731 or to final orders under section 706 or 736, are also used	to produce the merchandise under investigation,<p>	<li>In any investigation under this title which involves imports of	both a raw agricultural product and any product processed from	such raw agricultural product, the likelihood that there will	be increased imports, by reason of product shifting, if there	is an affirmative determination by the USITC under section 705(b)(1)	or 735 (b)(1) with respect to either the raw agricultural product or	the processed agricultural product (but not both), and	<a name="17r"><p>	<li>The actual and potential negative effects on the existing	development and production efforts of the domestic industry,	including efforts to develop a derivative or more advanced version of	the like product.<a href="#17">[17]</a></ul><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><a name="ADMIN"><h4>II.  Administration of the Antidumping Laws</h4><a name="ADMIN"><h4>A. Overview</h4><a name="18r"><a name="19r"><p>	The structure and administration of the antidumping laws canbe criticized on a number of counts.  The present antidumping lawallows the Commerce Department and/or U.S. International TradeCommission to serve a massive discovery request (demand) for theproduction of documents and interrogatories.  The serving party alsohas the sole authority to set the time by which the response must bemade and the format of the response.  It can demand that a small,foreign producer translate everything into English,<ahref="#18">[18]</a> and can act as the sole judge of whether theresponse is adequate.  It can also act as the sole arbiter ofobjections regarding relevancy or burdensomeness of the request.  Itcan impose sanctions for failure to comply and can act as the ultimatedecisionmaker.  Such a system raises major questions of due process,not to mention fairness.  Yet such a system is allowed to exist underthe present rules.<a href="#19">[19]</a><p><a name="20r"><a name="21r"><a name="22r"></p><p><a name="23r"><a name="24r"><a name="25r"></p><p>	In addition to the administrative burden that target companies orindustries may be subjected to, the time for processing the request canbe extremely short, given the amount of information that must beprocessed and discussed.<a href="#20">[20]</a> The target company oftenmust provide detailed information about all of its U.S. sales as wellas home country sales for a six month period.  The information must beprovided on computer tape that is compatible with IBM systems.<ahref="#21">[21]</a>  And much of the information demanded isirrelevant, but is demanded anyway so that the petitioner cannotcomplain that the investigation is not sufficiently thorough.<ahref="#22">[22]</a>  There is no effective appeal if the target companythinks the demand for documents is too onerous because the CommerceDepartment decides what is required and when it must be produced.  Andif documents are not produced, the Commerce Department can make upnumbers<a href="#23">[23]</a>  using the "best information available"(BIA).<a href="#24">[24]</a> But in some cases, the information theCommerce Department uses is not even remotely accurate.  In manyinstances, it uses the information provided to it by the petitioningcompany, which has a high probability of being biased.  And because ofthe way the rules work, it is possible for the Commerce Department toconclude that a product was dumped even if the selling price for theproduct under investigation is the same worldwide.<a href="#25">[25]</a><p><a name="26r"></p><p>	If the target company does not provide exactly and completelythe information the Commerce Department demands, it can totallydisregard all that has been submitted and make up its own numbers.  Inone case, SKF, a Swedish manufacturer, supplied more than 150,000 pagesof information covering more than 100 million separate sales.  The datasupplied weighed more than three tons and included more than 4 billionpieces of information.  The information was delivered within about aweek of the Commerce Department's request, since that was all the timethe Commerce Department gave the company to respond.  About one percentof the data was in a form that was not acceptable to the CommerceDepartment, so it totally disregarded all three tons of information andmade up its own numbers.<a href="#26">[26]</a><p><a name="27r"><a name="28r"></p><p>	In another particularly outrageous case, the Commerce Departmentdemanded that Matsushita translate 3,000 pages of financial documentsfrom Japanese into English.  The request (demand) was made on a Fridayafternoon, and the project was supposed to be completed by thefollowing Monday morning.  Rather than comply, Matsushita decided toabandon its small business telephone system sales<a href="#27">[27]</a>to the United States, thus losing more than $50 million in exportsales.<a href="#28">[28]</a><p><a name="29r"><a name="30r"><a name="31r"></p><p>	A number of other criticisms could also be made about the way theantidumping laws are administered.  For one thing, the CommerceDepartment often examines just the numbers for the larger companies,then determines the antidumping margin that is to be assessed againstsmaller companies based on those numbers.<a href="#29">[29]</a>  Andalthough the smaller companies can offer their own data in theirdefense, the Commerce Department is free to reject their data for anyreason.  In one case, hundreds of Hong Kong textile companies wereassessed a penalty because one of the companies under investigationearned less than an 8 percent profit.<a href="#30">[30]</a>  And it isnot entirely clear which entity, the Commerce Department or the U.S.International Trade Commission, has the authority to do what, sincethey are both involved in the administration of the antidumping laws.<a href="#31">[31]</a> <a name="COMP"><h4>B. Computational Problems</h4><a name="CCP"><h4>1. Computing the Cost of Production</h4><p><a name="32r"><a name="33r"></p><p>	The Commerce Department looks at a company's cost of production inabout two-thirds of the cases it investigates.<a href="#32">[32]</a> Inorder to avoid a charge of dumping, foreign companies must charge aprice at least equal to the cost of production plus a "reasonableprofit," which it defines as 8 percent.<a href="#33">[33]</a>  A pricethat meets this standard is considered "fair." Any lower price isconsidered unfair.  So a company that has a profit of only 7.9 percentcan be found guilty of dumping even though it is making a profit.  Yetmany companies and many industries, both domestic and foreign, do notachieve an 8 percent profit level for many of their products, whichmeans that numerous products could be deemed sold at less than a "fair"price.<p><a name="34r"><a name="35r"><a name="36r"></p><p>	The cost of production is computed by estimating the materialproduction cost,<a href="#34">[34]</a> then adding 10 percent foradministrative overhead.<a href="#35">[35]</a>  Companies that have anadministrative overhead of more than 10 percent are not penalized, butthose that can keep their administrative overhead below 10 percentcould find themselves in trouble.  In other words, the more efficient acompany is, the greater is the probability that it will be penalized. Inefficiency is rewarded and efficiency is penalized.<a href="#36">[36]</a><p><a name="37r"></p><p>	Aside from the fact that assigning 10 percent to overhead istotally arbitrary, it is also possible that a company with overhead ofmore than 10 percent might be selling its product on the U.S. market ata loss, yet not be found guilty of dumping.  And the costing methods ituses are far from scientific.  In one case, it determined theproduction cost of red raspberries by taking a random sample of justten farmers.<a href="#37">[37]</a> But a USITC study found thatproduction costs for raspberries varied by almost 100 percent.<p><a name="38r"></p><p>	Another problem with the way the Commerce Department computesproduction cost is that it is not consistent in its methodology.  Ithas been known to shift its cost accounting methods from case to case,and even within the same investigation.  In one case involving someBrazilian companies, it used ten different methods to measure theircost of production, which makes it impossible for a company todetermine whether it might be guilty of dumping, since it has no way ofknowing in advance which of several cost accounting methods theCommerce Department might use.<a href="#38">[38]</a><p><a name="39r"><a name="40r"></p><p>	Another problem with the Commerce Department's methodology isthat it sometimes compares the price charged in one period with thecosts for another period.  This approach is questionable in even thebest of circumstances, but is especially flawed in cases like thesemiconductor investigations, where costs were dropping an a high rateof speed.  In one semiconductor case, the Commerce Department comparedthe current selling price to a cost of production figure that was threemonths old. <a href="#39">[39]</a>  But the average variable cost ofproducing semiconductors dropped by sixty-six percent between 1984 and1985 -- from $8.0313 to $2.7376. And costs dropped by another fifty-twopercent the following year -- from $2.7376 to $1.2989.<a href="#40">[40]</a>  So a three-month time lag between revenues andcosts can make a substantial difference, especially when a company isdealing with slim profit margins.  It could turn a profitable sale intoone that appears to be made at a loss, or at a profit of less than 8percent.<p><a name="41r"></p><p>	Allocating fixed costs can also be a problem.  If a companymanufactures several items, the fixed costs attached to those itemsmust somehow be allocated.  But any method of allocating fixed costs isarbitrary.  And a number of assumptions are inherent in any suchcalculation. The depreciation method used, the time period used todepreciate, and a number of other factors also enter into the picture. Yet fixed costs are a substantial part of a semiconductor company'stotal production cost -- perhaps as much as seventy-five percent.<a href="#41">[41]</a><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE>	<a name="PC"><h4>2. Price Comparisons</h4><p><a name="42r"><a name="43r"></p><p>	The Commerce Department has been accused on many occasions ofcomparing apples to oranges in the course of an antidumpinginvestigation.  This apples to oranges approach has taken severalforms.  It sometimes compares prices of products that are not similar,as when it compared one kind of pads for woodwind instruments sold inthe United States with another, larger kind of pad for instruments soldin Italy.<a href="#42">[42]</a>  It has considered the price of a freshflower in Amsterdam and a wilted flower in New York to be equivalent.<ahref="#43">[43]</a><p><a name="44r"></p><p>	Another criticism in the Commerce Department's methodology is thatit sometimes compares prices in dissimilar markets.  Some Koreancompanies were penalized for selling sweaters in the United States forone percent less than what they sold them for in Mexico, Canada and theUnited Kingdom.  The Commerce Department ignored the fact that therewere significant differences in the sweaters shipped to differentcountries and that each shipment was a custom order.  It also ignoredall cases where the sweater prices were higher in the United Statesthan in the third country.<a href="#44">[44]</a><p><a name="45r"></p><p>	The Commerce Department has also been known to compare wholesaleprices in the United States with foreign retail prices, which has atendency to distort price comparisons.  For example, in an antidumpingcase initiated by Motorola against Toshiba for selling cellular mobiletelephones and subassemblies for less than fair value, the CommerceDepartment did not take into account the fact that when Toshiba sold inthe Japanese market, it sold to small dealers directly, whereas when itsold in the United States, it sold to a single wholesaler, which thenresold to distributors.<a href="#45">[45]</a><p><a name="46r"><a name="47r"></p><p>	The price comparisons the Commerce Department makes sometimes donot take volume discounts into account, which can lead to anantidumping penalty when none is warranted.<a href="#46">[46]</a>  Andthe Commerce Department's method of classifying costs as direct andindirect has also been criticized, as has its practice of sometimessubtracting the sales costs a company incurs when it computes the U.S.sales price, but including similar sales costs when it computes theforeign market value, which results in having the U.S. priceconsistently understated when compared to the foreign price.<a href="#47">[47]</a> 	<a name="UAP"><h4>3. Using Average Prices</h4><p><a name="48r"></p><p>	Another major criticism of the Commerce Department's methodology isthe way it computes average prices.  As a result, it is sometimespossible for a foreign company to be hit with an antidumping penaltyeven when it sells its product for the same price in the United Statesand the home country.  This can happen when it computes average foreignprices over a six-month period and compares that average to individualdomestic prices.  A foreign company can run afoul of the antidumpinglaws if it sells any product in the United States for a price that isless than the average foreign price for the period underinvestigation.<a href="#48">[48]</a>  So if the company sells itsproduct at a range of different prices over some period of time, whichis the normal case, it is probable that about half of the sales will beat prices that are below the average price and half will be sold forabove the average price.  This is exactly what happened in one of theDRAM chip antidumping cases, as we shall see below. 	<a name="SER"><h4>4. Shifting Exchange Rates</h4><p><a name="49r"><a name="50r"><a name="51r"></p><p>	Problems sometimes result because of shifts in exchange rates. Inorder to compare the domestic price to the foreign price it isnecessary to convert the foreign currency into dollars.  But the methodthe Commerce Department uses to convert from one currency to anothersometimes results in a finding of dumping where none, in fact,occurred.<a href="#49">[49]</a>  And the Commerce Department has beenknown to use the official exchange rate even when it is much lower thanthe market exchange rate, which can result in a finding of dumpingwhere no dumping occurred.<a href="#50">[50]</a>  And companies incountries that are experiencing hyperinflation can also face exchangerate problems when the Commerce Department computes relative prices,<a href="#51">[51]</a> especially if it uses one rate to determine therevenue earned at the sale date and another rate to determine the costof production at the export date a few months later.<ahref="#52">[52]</a> 	<a name="AAC"><h4>III.  Antidumping Actions in the Computer Industry</h4><p><a name="53r"><a name="54r"></p><p>	Most antidumping and countervailing duty investigations inthe United States have involved the hardware end of the industry ratherthan the software end.  But software is not immune from prosecutionunder the antidumping and countervailing duty laws.  At least onecountervailing duty investigation concluded that software conveyed bycertain media can be considered merchandise (rather than services).<ahref="#53">[53]</a> So foreign software suppliers must be careful notto run afoul of the U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty laws.  ButU.S. software companies must also be careful not to run afoul of theantidumping and countervailing duty laws of other nations, especiallyin cases where their software development was subsidized by the federalgovernment.<a href="#54">[54]</a> This article will confine itself to adiscussion of the hardware end of the computer industry.	<a name="64K"><h4>A.  64 K DRAM Chips</h4><p><a name="55r"><a name="56r"></p><p><a name="57r"><a name="58r"><a name="59r"></p><p>	The USITC has investigated allegations of DRAM chip dumpingon at least three occasions.<a href="#55">[55]</a>  The firstinvestigation<a href="#56">[56]</a> was initiated by Micron<ahref="#57">[57]</a> on June 24, 1985.  This investigation coveredimports from Japan of assembled 64 kilobit<a href="#58">[58]</a> DRAMsof the N-channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) type.  The USITCreached an affirmative final determination in this case.<a href="#59">[59]</a> <HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><a name="256K"><h4>B.  256K DRAM Chips</h4><p><a name="60r"><a name="61r"><a name="62r"></p><p>	The second investigation was initiated by the USITC on December 11,1985 and covered Japanese imports of 256K and above DRAMs of both theNMOS and complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) varieties.<ahref="#60">[60]</a>  This investigation was suspended after theJapanese producers/exporters agreed with the Commerce Department toraise their prices.<a href="#61">[61]</a>   The agreement caused theprice of 256K chips to double within a month<a href="#62">[62]</a> andto increase from about $2 to more than $7 per chip by mid-1988.<a href="#63">[63]</a><p><a name="64r"><a name="65r"><a name="66r"><a name="67r"></p><p>	At the time this investigation was initiated, American memorychip producers were incurring tremendous losses -- about $2 billion for1985 and 1986 combined.<a href="#64">[64]</a>  They attributed theselosses to Japanese producers, who were dumping their integratedcircuits (ICs) on the domestic market.  Domestic producers also claimedthat the Japanese market was closed to them in spite of the fact thattheir prices were lower.  The worldwide market for memory chips at thetime was about $7 billion, out of a total semiconductor market of $32billion.<a href="#65">[65]</a> Although American firms had dominatedthe market, Japanese firms were gaining market share because they wereinvesting heavily in research and development while American firms werecutting back due to the economic downturn.<a href="#66">[66]</a> Japanese firms had captured 65 percent of the 256K market and 98percent of the 1MB market.<a href="#67">[67]</a><a name="68r"><a name="69r"><p>	The purpose of the 1986 U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Arrangementwas to stop the alleged dumping of DRAM chips in the United States andelsewhere.  In the then-existing "gray market," DRAM chips were beingshipped to third countries, which would then re-ship the chips to theUnited States.  The agreement<a href="#68">[68]</a> called for theJapanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) to gatherquarterly data on transaction prices and costs.  Japanese producerswere supposed to set their prices high enough to cover their costs plusan 8 percent profit margin.<a href="#69">[69]</a><a name="70r"><p>	But the gray market did not dry up.  It kept humming along nicely, aschip brokers smuggled DRAMs out of Japan, had them implanted into dummycircuit boards (which were not covered by the Agreement), then sold inthe United States for 20 to 40 percent less than the "worldwide" pricecalled for in the Agreement.<a href="#70">[70]</a><a name="71r"><a name="72r"><a name="73r"><a name="74r"><p>	Another provision of this Agreement called for an opening ofthe Japanese market.  In 1986, foreign producers had a 10.3 percentshare of the Japanese market, most of which was held by Americanproducers.<a href="#71">[71]</a>  By late 1987, the foreign-held shareof the market increased to slightly more than 12 percent.<ahref="#72">[72]</a>  One reason why American firms could not capturemore market share in Japan is because the 1986 Agreement, which raisedthe price of Japanese chips, caused the demand for them in the U.S.A.to drop drastically.  As a result, the Japanese market experienced aglut of chips, which made it impossible for American firms to increasetheir market share to any great extent.<a href="#73">[73]</a> And theglut in Japan produced some other side-effects, such as giving theJapanese even more incentive to sell their chips in other markets, thusgaining market share, or to purchase American companies.<a href="#74">[74]</a>  So the 1986 Agreement had detrimental effects onthe very people the Agreement was designed to protect.<a name="75r"><a name="76r"><a name="77r"><p>	Since most DRAMs are used by computer firms, and since thechips they use in their computers now cost much more than before,American computer companies are much less able to compute with foreignrivals, which can buy cheaper chips on the world market.<ahref="#75">[75]</a>   Japanese computer manufacturers were thus given acompetitive cost advantage as a result of this Agreement because theycould buy lower priced chips in the Japanese market.<ahref="#76">[76]</a>  American computer manufacturers had to buyhigher-priced chips.  According to one estimate, the 1986 Agreementcost American consumers $568 million a year.<a href="#77">[77]</a><a name="78r"><a name="79r"><p>	Another aspect of the 1986 Agreement that is often overlooked isthe effect it had on Japanese sovereignty and individual freedom. Ineffect, the Japanese government was forcing MITI to do what Americanproducers demanded.  Which basically means that the Japanese governmentwas dictating to Japanese companies.<a href="#78">[78]</a>  And forcingthe Japanese to set up a cartel worked against the interests ofAmerican consumers.<a href="#79">[79]</a>  Had such a cartel beenestablished by companies in the United States, they would have been inviolation of the antitrust laws.  So, by forcing the Japanese to form acartel to monitor chip prices, the United States was encouraging themto do something that would have been a crime if done in the UnitedStates.<a name="80r"><ul>	<p>	... there is the possibility that Japanese semi-conductor exporters	and their related parties in the United States will be exposed	to liability because Japanese exporters and their related parties	restrict sales at prices not less than company-specific fair value in	the United States market.  Such restrictions of sales are undertaken	by these exporters and related parties in response to measures	imposed by the Government of Japan in accordance with the Agreement. 	From the Japanese perspective, this is "multiple legal harassment". 	The exporter is under the control of the Japanese Government's	monitoring, and might also be liable to prosecution for violation of	United States anti-trust laws.<a href="#80">[80]</a>	</p>	</ul><a name="81r"><a name="82r"><a name="83r"><p>	And it is possible that Japanese courts might find compliancewith administrative guidance to be an invalid antitrust defense, whichmeans that Japanese producers might find themselves in violation ofJapanese antitrust laws if they comply with the 1986 Agreement.<ahref="#81">[81]</a>   The U.S. doctrine of sovereign compulsion<ahref="#82">[82]</a> might be a sufficient defense in U.S. courts, butwhether this defense would be recognized in the case of semiconductorsis not at all clear.<a href="#83">[83]</a>   In the case ofsemiconductors, not only are exporters involved, but so are relatedparties, and it is questionable whether it is the Japanese governmentor the exporters that are restricting sales.<a name="84r"><a name="85r"><p>	This Agreement has been compared to a Voluntary Export Restraintagreement (VER).<a href="#84">[84]</a>  But it should be pointed outthat voluntary export restraints are not voluntary.  They are betweengovernments and require some government to prevent a portion of itscitizenry (Japanese steel companies or auto manufacturers, for example)from selling to the citizens of some foreign country.<ahref="#85">[85]</a><a name="86r"><a name="87r"><p>	Another harmful side-effect of this Agreement has to do withthe relative reliability of Japanese versus domestic producers.Japanese firms are vertically integrated,<a href="#86">[86]</a> whichmeans that there is common ownership of the firms that make chips andthe firms that make computers.  The computer chip firms act assuppliers to the computer manufacturing firms, so the computermanufacturing firms are assured of a steady supply of computer chips. But American computer manufacturers are not assured of a steady supplyof computer chips.  Sometimes they have to cancel orders or are unableto meet deadlines because they cannot get all the computer chips theyneed.  Thus, Japanese computer manufacturers have acquired a reputationfor being more reliable suppliers, which hurts American firmcompetitiveness.<a href="#87">[87]</a><a name="88r"><p>	There is also a question of quality.  If quality is measuredby the number of chips that are rejected, then Japanese producersmanufacture higher-quality chips than American producers.  For everymillion semiconductors manufactured, the reject rate for Japanesesemiconductors is between 70 and 100.  For American-madesemiconductors, the reject rate is between 500 and 1,500.<ahref="#88">[88]</a>  So by making it more difficult or more expensivefor American companies that use DRAM chips to purchase from theJapanese, the law is putting pressure on them to purchase inferiorAmerican-made chips -- which helps to make American-made computersinferior as well.<a name="89r"><a name="90r"><a name="91r"><a name="92r"><p>	Halting the inflow of cheap chips also has an employment effect. One study estimated that the price increase in chips resulted inemployment gains in the semiconductor industry of 5,000 jobs, andemployment losses of 7,000 jobs in the industries that use computerchips, for a net employment loss of 2,000 jobs.<a href="#89">[89]</a> In other words, 1.4 jobs were lost for each job gained.<ahref="#90">[90]</a>  A more sophisticated analysis by the sameresearcher estimated job losses in the computer industry to be 11,300,for a job loss/gain ratio of nearly 2.3 to 1.<a href="#91">[91]</a> Another interesting side-effect of the U.S.-Japanese Semi-conductorArrangement is that it may well have accelerated Japanese and Koreanentry into the integrated circuit market, which was previouslydominated by U.S. firms.<a href="#92">[92]</a><a name="93r"><a name="94r"><p>	Another interesting aspect of this case has to do with themethod by which computer chips were priced.  Japanese companies usedwhat is called learning curve pricing.<a href="#93">[93]</a>   If thecost of producing a computer chip declines by 28 percent a year, whichwas the case before this Arrangement according to one estimate, it ispossible for a Japanese company to give a price quote that is belowcurrent cost and still make a profit, because delivery will not occuruntil three or eight months later, when the cost of production hasdeclined.  So, at the time of delivery, the cost of production isactually less than the price charged, even though the selling price washigher than the cost of production at the time the price quote wasgiven.<a href="#94">[94]</a><a name="95r"><a name="96r"><p>	For example, let's say that a Japanese chip manufacturer agrees tosell some chips for $5.00 a unit on January 2, when its costs ofproduction are $5.50.  It is agreed that delivery will be on June 30,six months later.  Based on these costs and revenue figures, theJapanese company is selling for $0.50 less than production cost.<a href="#95">[95]</a>  But by the time June 30th rolls around, productioncosts have declined to $4.73, so it is actually making a $0.27 profitby selling for $5.00.<a href="#96">[96]</a><a name="97r"><a name="98r"><a name="99r"><p>	Which cost should be used when attempting to determine whether thechips were dumped on the market for less than production cost?  If theJanuary 2nd cost of production is used, then the company is guilty ofdumping.  But if the June 30th cost of production is used, it is notguilty of dumping.  Since the revenue is earned on June 30, at the timeof delivery, the more rational choice would be to use the June 30production cost.<a href="#97">[97]</a>  But the Commerce Department andthe U.S. International Trade Commission do not always follow what isrational, or what is considered to be a generally accepted accountingprinciple, as was pointed out above.  So a company in this situationcould be found guilty of dumping when no dumping actually occurred.<a href="#98">[98]</a>  The 1986 Agreement did not address this issue,although a subsidiary agreement provided that costs should bedetermined on an average quarterly basis.<a href="#99">[99]</a><a name="100r"><p>	The 1986 Arrangement could have other unintended detrimentaleffects, too.  At present, the United States has a comparativeadvantage in the area of design and software.  But if this Arrangementreduces the benefits that Japanese manufacturers receive in the DRAMend of the business, it could cause them to shift more resources intothe design and software end of the business, which will put morecompetitive pressure on American designers and software producers.<a href="#100">[100]</a><ul><a name="101r">	<p>	... to the extent that any force has worked to produce monopoly	profits in the semiconductor industry it is the 1986 Semi-conductor	Agreement itself, which requires the Japanese to set world-wide	prices in accord with "fair" market levels to be determined quarterly	by Commerce.<a href="#101">[101]</a>	</p></ul><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><a name="1MB"><h4>C.  1MB DRAM Chips</h4><a name="102r"><a name="103r"><a name="104r"><a name="105r"><a name="106r"><a name="107r"><p>	The most recent USITC DRAM chip dumping investigation involvedKorean exports of computer DRAM chips of one megabit or more to theUnited States.<a href="#102">[102]</a>  The investigation wasinstituted in response to a petition filed on behalf of MicronTechnology, Inc. of Boise, Idaho<a href="#103">[103]</a> on April 22,1992.<a href="#104">[104]</a>  The petitioner alleged that dynamicrandom access memory (DRAM) semiconductors of one megabit<ahref="#105">[105]</a> or more<a href="#106">[106]</a> from the Republicof Korea were being, or were likely to be, sold in the United Statesfor less than fair value within the meaning of Section 731 of theTariff Act of 1930, and that these imports were materially injuring, orwere threatening to materially injure a U.S. industry.<a href="#107">[107]</a><a name="108r"><a name="109r"><a name="110r"><a name="111r"><a name="112r"><p>	Micron alleged that three Korean companies -- Hyundai, Goldstarand Samsung -- were selling their chips in the United States for lessthan the cost of production.<a href="#108">[108]</a>  It determined theU.S. price based on price quotes for DRAMs made by distributors in theUnited States.  It then subtracted the distributors' markup andmovement expenses from these quoted prices.<a href="#109">[109]</a>  Itused average market prices obtained from Dataquest and company-specifichome market price quotes from an unidentified firm to demonstrate homemarket price.<a href="#110">[110]</a>  Based on these calculations, thepetitioner alleged that the range of DRAM dumping margins, based on acomparison of constructed value to U.S. price, was: between 94.29% and170.89% (one meg) and 278.63% and 282.51% (four meg) for Hyundai;between 132.11% and 165.29% (one meg) and 273.25% (four meg) forGoldstar; and between 0.62% and 3.83% (one meg) and between 93.18% and97.39% (four meg) for Samsung.<a href="#111">[111]</a>   Courts haveheld that the USITC could consider dumping margins as a factor indetermining injury, since neither the statute not legislative historyspecifically prohibited the use of margin analysis as a factor indetermining injury.<a href="#112">[112]</a><a name="113r"><p>	One interesting aspect of this investigation is the manner inwhich the conclusion that the Korean companies were selling at lessthan fair value was determined.  One hundred comparisons were madebetween U.S. prices and Korean prices that export manufacturerscharged.  In 47 cases, U.S. prices were less than Korean prices, byamounts ranging from 0.1 percent to 28.0 percent.  In 48 cases, theKorean companies charged a higher price in the U.S. than in Korea, bymargins of between 0.3 percent and 69.2 percent.  In the other fivecases, the prices charged in the Korean and U.S. markets wereidentical.<a href="#113">[113]</a><p>	To most rational observers who are familiar with the way business isconducted, such a pricing pattern would indicate that there was nodumping, but merely competitive pricing.  If the Koreans were intent ondumping, then all, or at least the vast majority of prices, would beless in the U.S. market than in Korea.  But such was not the case.  Inabout half of the comparisons, the price charged in the United Stateswas actually higher than the price charged in Korea.<a name="114r"><p>	A comparison of prices charged in the franchise distributormarket and the value-added reseller/aftermarket reseller market wouldlead to the same conclusion -- that there was no dumping, but merelycompetitive pricing.  Sixty-seven comparisons between U.S. prices andKorean prices were made in the franchise distributor market.  In 23cases, the Korean product was sold for less than the U.S. product, bymargins ranging from 0.7 percent to 53.0 percent.  In 42 cases, theKorean product sold at a higher price than the U.S. product, withmargins ranging from 0.1 percent to 66.7 percent.  In the two othercases, the products were sold at the same price.<a href="#114">[114]</a><a name="115r"><p>	Six price comparisons were made in the value-addedreseller/aftermarket reseller market.  In one case, the Korean productsold for less than the U.S. product.  In four cases, the Korean productwas priced slightly higher than the U.S. product.  In one case, the twoproducts sold for the same price.<a href="#115">[115]</a><a name="116r"><p>	In all three markets, the price comparisons do not support theallegation that dumping occurred.  But, as was pointed out above, whatappears to be price competition to the average observer might bedumping to the USITC.  In fact, the preliminary investigation concludedthat dumping had indeed occurred.<a href="#116">[116]</a><a name="117r"><a name="118r"><a name="119r"><a name="120r"><a name="121r"><p>	In its preliminary determination,<a href="#117">[117]</a> theUSITC concluded that the weighted-average dumping margins for Goldstar,Hyundai, Samsung and Others were 52.41 percent, 5.99 percent, 87.40percent and 81.88 percent, respectively.<a href="#118">[118]</a>  Inits final determination, these dumping margins were reducedsubstantially, to 4.97 percent for Goldstar, 7.19 percent for Hyundai,0.74 percent for Samsung and 3.19 percent for all others.<a href="#119">[119]</a>  The percentages in the final determination werelater revised due to a clerical error that occurred in the originalcalculation of the dumping margins at the final determination level.The revised final determination percentages were 4.97 percent, 11.45percent, 0.82 percent and 3.89 percent.<a href="#120">[120]</a>  Thefinal determination also concluded that an industry in the UnitedStates was materially injured because of the Korean imports that weresold for less than fair value.<a href="#121">[121]</a>	<p>The dissenting opinion makes an interesting point regarding these pricecomparisons.</p><ul>	<p>	The fact that prices for domestic DRAMs decreased during the period of	investigation tells us nothing about whether the subject imports	caused price depression or suppression.... DRAM prices decline	as more firms progress along a learning curve, and so in the	later stages of the product life cycle, as more firms move down	the curve, DRAM prices will fall regardless of unfair trade	practices.  Later entrants will receive lower prices.  These	market forces, combined with the other factors discussed in	this opinion, lead us to conclude that the price depression or	suppression, if any, caused by the subject imports is not	significant.	</p>	<a name="122r">	<p>	Although the underselling/overselling	comparisons are almost evenly split, we do not place much weight on	evidence of underselling.... the confluence of demand for memory and	the point in the product life cycle largely explain the price	of DRAMs at any particular point in time.  As a result of these	market forces, price comparisons are only meaningful if they	are contemporaneous, i.e. at the same point in the DRAM product	life cycle.  In this investigation, the price comparisons between	domestic DRAMs and subject imports are not contemporaneous. 	Accordingly, the price comparisons do not constitute substantial	evidence that any underselling is significant.<a	href="#122">[122]</a>	</p></ul><a name="123r"><a name="124r"><p>	The dissenting opinion also concluded that the domestic DRAMindustry was not materially injured as a result of the less than fairvalue DRAMs from Korea,<a href="#123">[123]</a> and that theprobability of actual injury from future increased market penetrationis small.<a href="#124">[124]</a><a name="125r"><a name="126r"><a name="127r"><p>	Korean DRAM chip exporters do a large business in the UnitedStates. Their U.S. sales were $800 million in 1992.<ahref="#125">[125]</a>  So this USITC decision will have a large,negative impact on them.  But the USITC decision is likely to have anegative impact on others as well.  The most obvious victim of thisdecision will be any company that uses DRAM chips, since they will haveto pay more for the chips,<a href="#126">[126]</a> regardless ofwhether they use Korean or American chips.  The Korean manufacturerswill have to raise their price, which reduces the price competitiondomestic producers face.  Domestic producers will therefore be morelikely to raise their prices since the Korean companies will no longerbe as competitive pricewise.  And U.S. customers say that the Koreanchips are as good as or better than the Japanese chips, and the servicethey receive from the Korean suppliers is better than that received byJapanese, U.S. or European suppliers,<a href="#127">[127]</a> so thequality of both product and service will likely be adversely affectedby this decision, as U.S. customers shift some of their business tonon-Korean companies.<a name="128r"><a name="129r"><p>	Less obvious victims are the employees in unidentified industrieswho stand to lose their jobs as a result of this decision.  Severalstudies have found that protectionist policies destroy more jobs thanthey save, as was pointed out above.  So if this decision protects4,000 jobs (which is the number of jobs that Micron's vice presidentsays will be protected),<a href="#128">[128]</a> then perhaps 6,000 or12,000 jobs will be destroyed in other industries if the job loss/gainratio is 1.5 to 1 or 3 to 1.<a href="#129">[129]</a><a name="130r"><a name="131r"><a name="132r"><p>	AST Research Inc. of Irvine, California is particularly upsetwith this decision, for a number of reasons.  For one thing, it seesthe paperwork required to keep track of where the chips it buys comefrom as an administrative burden.<a href="#130">[130]</a>  And it mayhave to ship more of its manufacturing overseas to keep prices down,since the decision also applies extra duties to imported subassembliesthat use Korean chips. Seven hundred of AST's production jobs are thusin jeopardy.<a href="#131">[131]</a>   And AST is only one of manycompanies in the domestic computer industry that stand to be harmed bythis antidumping action.  Any company that makes computers will beharmed because of the increased price of computer chips, and chipsaccount for one-third of the total production cost of a computer, whichis a substantial percentage.<a href="#132">[132]</a><a name="133r"><a name="134r"><a name="135r"><a name="136r"><p>	Japanese producers, who had 53 percent of the U.S. chipmarket before this decision,<a href="#133">[133]</a> stand to be bigwinners.<a href="#134">[134]</a> Their market share is likely toincrease, as well as their profit margins, since prices are likely togo up.  Dataquest predicted that the prices of semiconductor chips inthe United States will rise between 10 and 15 percent as a result ofthe preliminary determination.<a href="#135">[135]</a>  And the factthat the Korean DRAM chip exporters will have to pay dumping chargeswill cause them to lose market share.  According to one estimate, anypenalty over 10-15 percent could cause the Korean companies to lose aconsiderable share of the U.S. market.<a href="#136">[136]</a><a name="137r"><a name="138r"><a name="139r"><a name="140r"><p>	Another problem the Korean manufacturers face has to do withthe accounting procedures they must use to compute their costs.  Theantidumping law requires them to include an 8 percent profit in theircosts.<a href="#137">[137]</a>  But computer industry sources doubtthat any DRAM chip maker is making that high a profit,<a href="#138">[138]</a> which means that, to be safe, the Koreans willhave to raise their prices to a point where they will not becompetitive with the Japanese and domestic producers.  And the Koreanaccounting rules for R&D, depreciation and facilities investments areless restrictive than U.S. accounting rules.<a href="#139">[139]</a>Forcing the Korean companies to use U.S. accounting rules could raisetheir costs of production (on paper, that is) considerably, thus makingthem even less competitive and more likely to run afoul of theantidumping rules unless they raise their prices to uncompetitivelevels.  And the fact that DRAM prices have been dropping will make iteven harder for the Korean producers to compete.<a href="#140">[140]</a> <HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><a name="FPD"><h4>D.

Theyobtained the prices from individuals at the petitioners' companies thathave contact with customers, independent market analysts, suppliers andother knowledgeable persons within the industry.  They then adjustedthe prices for foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, oceanfreight, U.S. duties, brokerage and U.S. inland freight.<a href="#145">[145]</a> After constructing values to arrive at foreignmarket value and comparing these values to domestic prices, theyalleged that the dumping margins ranged from 70 to 318 percent.<a href="#146">[146]</a><a name="147r"><a name="148r"><p>	The USITC was unanimous in its preliminary finding that "there is areasonable indication that an industry in the United States ismaterially injured by reason of imports from Japan of high-informationcontent (HIC) flat panel displays and subassemblies thereof that arealleged to be sold in the United States at less than fair value(LTFV).<a href="#147">[147]</a> The petitioner urged the USITC to findthat all HIC flat panel displays are one like product.  The respondentscontended that there are really four like products because there arefour principal technologies used to make HIC flat panel displays -- (1)passive matrix liquid crystal display (LCD), in which liquid crystalsact as optical shutters and allow the passage of light when a smallvoltage is applied; (2) active matrix LCD, similar to but far morecomplex than the passive form and containing a transistor at eachpixel; (3) plasma displays, in which voltage causes pixels of a gas toemit light; and (4) electroluminescent (EL) displays, in which voltagecauses pixels in a solid EL material to emit light.<a href="#148">[148]</a><a name="149r"><a name="150r"><p>	This threshold question was important because there are nodomestic producers of passive matrix LCDs, and so there cannot be aseparate like product consisting of passive matrix LCDs.<a href="#149">[149]</a>  In previous cases, the USITC rejected the notionthat a like product could be defined as a product not produced by aU.S. industry,<a href="#150">[150]</a>so separating the products intofour separate categories would make the Japanese producers less liable. What domestic company can allege injury when no domestic company makesthe product?<a name="151r"><a name="152r"><a name="153r"><a name="154r"><a name="155r"><p>	The USITC ruled that the four categories in question constituteone like product.

In another case, the Japanese price was lower in one-thirdof the quarters examined.  In a third category, Japanese prices werelower more than half of the quarters.

Some Harmful Effects of the Antidumping Laws</h4><p>[To be completed by Yeomin]</p><a name="TPA"><h4>V.  The Philosophy of Antidumping</h4><p>	Antidumping policy is irrational.  It cannot be supported by anyphilosophical (or even economic) argument.  Antidumping is basically aweapon to protect consumers from low prices.  It is a tool used bydomestic producers to protect themselves from foreign competition.  Itis an example of class conflict. But unlike the Marxist version ofclass conflict, which pits the proletariat (the good guys) against thebourgeoisie (the bad guys), antidumping laws pit producers againstconsumers.  Antidumping laws are tools in the weapons arsenal ofproducers to extract higher prices for their products, at the expenseof consumers.  It is a method producers use to obtain wealth by forcethat they could not get through voluntary exchange.  There are only twoways to obtain wealth -- by voluntary exchange or by force -- andantidumping laws take the road of force.  They use the force ofgovernment to prevent foreign competitors from doing business withcustomers that might otherwise be theirs, or to increase their sellingprices by putting a damper on price competition.<a name="195r"><p>	It might be argued that there must be some balancing of interests.The interests of the producers must be balanced against the interestsof consumers.  But such arguments do not hold up to analysis.  For onething, the balancing of interests is utilitarian at its base.  Andutilitarian arguments all suffer from the same weakness -- there is noway to measure gains and losses.<a href="#195">[195]</a> One mightargue that 100 million consumers stand to lose and 100,000 auto workersstand to gain as a result of some protectionist auto industrylegislation.  And one can even argue that the 100,000 auto workersstand to gain a lot, whereas the 100 million consumers stand to loseonly a little, if Congress passes some kind of protectionist tariff orquota.  But it still is not possible to determine whether the gainsexceed the losses.  Of course, economists can calculate deadweightlosses, but these losses do not account for all pieces of the piebecause they leave out qualitative factors, and they do not include theeffects that a particular policy would have on the hundreds of otherindustries that stand to be affected by the policy.<a name="196r"><p>	The argument can also be made that an antidumping policy is for thecommon good or is in the common interest.  But this argument also fallsapart upon analysis.  There is no such thing as the common good. Whatis good for one (a semiconductor company employee) may not be good foranother (a consumer of computer products). Individuals have their owninterests.  There is no common interest.  Individuals have competinginterests that sometimes conflict.<a href="#196">[196]</a>  One cannotarrive at a common interest by adding together the interests ofindividuals because their interests conflict.  Attempts to addconflicting interests merely degenerate into utilitarian, majoritarianarguments.  But majoritarian arguments are defective because someminority (or at times an unorganized majority) must sacrifice somethingso that the majority (or an organized minority) can prevail.<p>	The real issue is one of property rights.  A property rights approachis superior to a utilitarian approach because, under a property rightsapproach, there is no need to measure gains and losses.  All that needbe done is determine whether someone's rights are violated.  If apolicy would result in the violation of someone's rights, then it is abad policy.  If no one's rights are violated, then perhaps it is a goodpolicy.  If the purpose of government is to protect life, liberty andproperty and otherwise leave individuals alone to make their ownchoices, then a policy that sacrifices the rights of some individualsso that other individuals can have something they otherwise would notbe entitled to is a bad policy.  Frederic Bastiat, a nineteenth centuryFrench philosopher, had the following test for determining whether alaw was a good one or a bad one:<ul>	<p>	See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and	gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong.  See if the law	benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what	the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.	</p></ul><a name="197r"><p>	Then abolish this law without delay, for it is not only an evilitself, but also it is a fertile source for further evils because itinvites reprisals.<a href="#197">[197]</a><p>	How do the antidumping laws hold up to Bastiat's test?  Domestic DRAMchip producers, by using the antidumping laws, are getting protectionfrom competition at the expense of consumers.  They are using the forceof government to prevent willing buyers and willing sellers fromentering into voluntary exchange.  If they tried to prevent suchvoluntary exchanges by using force themselves, they would be guilty ofa crime.  So they let the government do the dirty work for them.According to Bastiat's test, such a law -- the antidumping law -- is abad one, and should be abolished immediately, before its enforcementleads to reprisals.<a name="198r"><a name="199r"><p>	Economists of the Public Choice School view the situation somewhatdifferently.  They would call those who stand to benefit by anantidumping law "rent seekers."  Rent seeking might be defined asseeking special privileges or protection from government or gettingothers to pay for your benefits.<a href="#198">[198]</a>  Rent seekingactivity is likely to appear wherever the costs are low and thepotential benefits are great. Almost all of the antidumping actionsthat have been filed were initiated by some company or group ofcompanies that stood to gain if a foreign competitor were forced toraise prices or incur the cost of complying with a Commerce Departmentrequest for information.<a href="#199">[199]</a><a name="200r"><p>	Using the antidumping laws is a very inexpensive way to harass acompetitor and to convince competitors to raise their prices.  All apetitioning company has to do is write a letter to the CommerceDepartment stating that some foreign competitor is selling some productfor an unfairly low price. The Commerce Department will take it fromthere and send its fleet of lawyers into the field to investigate attaxpayer expense.  The accused company or companies must expend perhapsmillions of dollars to defend themselves.  And even if they win thecase, they still lose because they must divert their resources awayfrom sales and production and into a defense of their actions.<a href="#200">[200]</a>  And any antidumping action has a chilling effecton future behavior. Foreign competitors that have been through anantidumping investigation will think twice about being aggressive pricecompetitors.  Some foreign producers may even decide that trying tocompete in the American market is just not worth it because of theharassment they might get from the Commerce Department. The loser, ofcourse, is the American consumer, who must be content with a reducedchoice of products that cost more than would be the case under a fullycompetitive system.<p>	Applying the antidumping laws to the computer industry can haveespecially detrimental effects on American competitiveness.  TheAmerican companies that manufacture computers need computer chips.  Ifthey must pay substantially more for them than what manufacturers inother countries have to pay, their costs will be higher, which willmake it difficult for them to sell their computers in the internationalmarketplace.  And any American company that uses computers -- and whichones don't these days -- will also incur extra costs because the costof the computer chips they have in their computers has been inflateddue to the antidumping laws and these inflated prices are reflected inthe cost of their computers.<a name="201r"><a name="202r"><p>	Some ethical issues also need to be discussed in connectionwith initiating antidumping actions.  One might legitimately askwhether it is ethical to initiate an antidumping action.  As a rule ofthumb, one might say that an action is ethical if no one's rights areviolated and unethical if rights are violated.<a href="#201">[201]</a>Which leads to the question: Are anyone's rights violated if a foreignproducer sells something in the domestic market for less than fairvalue?<a href="#202">[202]</a><a name="203r"><a name="204r"><p>	Assuming for the moment that something can be sold for lessthan fair value, it does not follow that someone's rights are therebyviolated. While it is true that some domestic producer stands to beharmed, being harmed is not the same as having one's rights violated. A mom and pop grocery store stand to be greatly harmed if a supermarketchain opens a store across the street.  But this does not mean thattheir rights are violated<a href="#203">[203]</a> because thesupermarket chain has every right to open a store wherever it wants.<a href="#204">[204]</a>  So just because a domestic producer stands to beharmed if a foreign producer is allowed to sell in the domestic marketdoes not mean that the domestic producer has any moral right to preventthe sale from taking place.  On the contrary, if a domestic producerdoes something to prevent an otherwise willing seller and willing buyerfrom entering into a voluntary exchange, the domestic producer isviolating their right to contract and their right to exchange theirproperty.  And by initiating an antidumping action, the domesticproducer is doing just that -- violating the rights of willing buyersand sellers to enter into contracts and exchange their property.<a name="205r"><p>	Yet the antidumping laws state that there is liability if "there is areasonable indication that an industry in the United States ismaterially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or theestablishment of an industry in the United States is materiallyretarded by reason of imports."<a href="#205">[205]</a>  There are at least three problemswith holding a foreign competitor liable under these conditions.  Forone thing, it is almost certain that some domestic producer will beharmed if a foreign competitor is permitted to sell in the UnitedStates, because the foreign seller is likely to take a sale that wouldotherwise go to a domestic producer.  So it then becomes a question ofwhether the injury is material, which is subjective.  The only way tobe sure that a domestic producer is not harmed is to prevent theforeign competitor from making any sales in the United States in thefirst place, which is a highly protectionist policy.  But the realissue should not be whether someone has been "harmed" but whethersomeone's rights have been violated.  With the present rule, punishmentcan be meted out even though no rights have been violated.  There isnothing wrong with harming someone in the marketplace if the harmresults from consumer choice.  If consumers decide to buy from aforeign producer rather than a domestic producer, that is their choiceand their right.<p>	The second problem with the present standard is that punishmentcan be meted out if there is merely a threat of material injury.  Inother words, a foreign producer can be punished even before it hascaused material injury.  A good case can be made that there is a threatof material injury if a foreign producer is permitted to make sales inthe United States.  The solution, then, is to not allow such sales,because they may result in material injury to some yet unidentifieddomestic producer.  The only way to insure that no material injuryresults is to close our borders to foreign trade.  The fact that therights of consumers to purchase the products of their choice isviolated by such a policy is totally ignored.<a name="206r"><a name="207r"><p>	The third problem with this policy has to do with the possibilitythat the establishment of an industry in the United States might beretarded because of an import.  Obviously, a domestic industry's growthmight be retarded if foreigners are allowed to compete for consumerdollars.  But so what?  Domestic industries have no inherent right tothe dollars of domestic consumers.  Yet this policy gives them such aright.  As Bastiat would say, this law "takes from some persons whatbelongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does notbelong."<a href="#206">[206]</a>  Thus, the law fits Bastiat'sdefinition of legal plunder and should be abolished immediately becauseconsumer dollars, which might otherwise go to a foreign producer, arechanneled into the coffers of a domestic producer because the lawprevents foreign producers from entering into voluntary exchange withdomestic consumers.  In a free society, consumers determine whichindustries grow and which shrink by their dollar votes.  Thoseindustries that receive the most dollar votes will prosper and thosethat receive few dollar votes will shrink.<a href="#207">[207]</a><a name="208r"><p>	Initiation of an antidumping action also causes foreign producersto incur a great deal of expense to defend themselves.  In a sense, thestockholders of the foreign company are having their resourcesdissipated due to the antidumping action that has been initiated by thedomestic producer.  Domestic producers that file antidumping petitionsare, in effect, destroying the wealth of the shareholders of theseforeign companies.  And destroying wealth is unethical,<ahref="#208">[208]</a> or at least it is unethical under certaincircumstances.<p>	One instance where destroying someone else's wealth is not unethicalis the case where a company gains market share by selling a betterproduct at a lower price.  Higher priced companies are harmed by doingso, and the value of their stock is likely to decline, thus destroyingwealth.  But selling a better product at a lower price is not unethicalbecause no one is forcing consumers to buy their product.  Buttriggering an antidumping investigation unleashes the force ofgovernment against a competitor.  And using force to destroy wealth, bycausing a competitor to spend millions of dollars to defend itself, isunethical.<p>	Another question also needs to be asked: What is wrong with sellingbelow fair value?  While it is true that domestic producers may beharmed by the practice, in the sense that they lose sales, being harmedis not the same as having your rights violated.  Willing buyers andwilling sellers should be able to exchange their property at whateverterms they agree on.  But antidumping laws, or the threat of bringingan antidumping action, prevent them from doing this.<p>	A more basic question is: What exactly is fair value, anyway? The antidumping laws define fair value as the cost of production pluseight percent.  But aside from the fact that eight percent is anarbitrary number -- not to mention a profit margin that is oftenabnormally high -- the cost of production is different for differentcompanies.  And the calculation of the cost of production is highlyarbitrary, especially when it must be decided how fixed costs are to beallocated.  This being the case, it logically follows that fair valuefor one company may not be fair value for another company.  Thus, fairvalue is gibberish, a meaningless term.<a name="209r"><p>	The only thing that can be said about fair value is that itis the price that a willing buyer and a willing seller agree on.  Andthat price is not uniform.  Many prices may be charged for the same canof beans in the same city on the same day.  There are a number ofreasons for this,<a href="#209">[209]</a> but it cannot be said thatsome cans of beans are selling for less than fair value and some areselling for more than fair value because, in each case, there is awilling buyer and a willing seller. To have some law revolve around theconcept of fair value is insane. Yet that is exactly what theantidumping laws do.<HR NOSHADE><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><a name="CR"><h4>VI.  Conclusions and Recommendations</h4><p>	A number of things can be said about U.S. trade policy in general, andas applied to the computer industry in particular.  For one thing,dumping, if it exists, is good for American consumers. It increases thesupply of products that American consumers want and it reduces theprices they must pay.  Subsidies that foreign governments provide totheir manufacturers also help American consumers by reducing the pricethey pay for foreign products.  In effect, foreign governments thatsubsidize their manufacturers are subsidizing American consumers.  Andwhile it is probably a breach of Japanese politicians' fiduciary dutyto their constituents to use Japanese yen to subsidize Americanconsumers, it is probably not something that the United States shouldtry to stop.<a name="210r"><p>	Any kind of protectionism is paid for by consumers.  Punishingforeign producers for receiving subsidies from their governments, orpunishing them for selling their products at low prices, is irrationaland stupid.  While the argument is often made that protecting Americanindustry saves jobs, numerous studies have shown that just the oppositeis true.  While some jobs may be saved as the result of someprotectionist policy, the job losses exceed the job gains -- sometimesby a ratio of more than three-to-one.<a href="#210">[210]</a><p>	But all these arguments are merely utilitarian.  For a utilitarian, apolicy is good if the gainers exceed the losers, or if the goodoutweighs the bad.  Utilitarians totally ignore the real issue, whichis one of property rights.  Whenever some government preventsconsenting adults from entering into contracts and trading what theyhave for what they want, it violates their right to property, sincethey cannot do with their property as they see fit. It is a violationof their human rights, since property rights are one of the most basichuman rights.<p>	The only conclusion that can be drawn, whether from a utilitarian orrights perspective, is that any law that punishes foreign producersfrom selling their products to American consumers at low prices must beabolished, the sooner the better.  The antidumping and countervailingduty laws must be abolished at once, not over some phase-out period. Rights will continue to be violated as long as these laws exist. American producers that cannot produce what American consumers want ata price they are willing to pay should not be able to use the force ofgovernment to squeeze out sales that they cannot get by voluntaryexchange.  American producers have no right to prevent Americanconsumers from buying the products of their choice for any reason.	<hr><p>	An earlier version of this Policy Analysis appeared in theTemple International and Comparative Law Journal, Vol. 8, No. 2 (1994),219-256.

For example, in 1993, the	Council of the European Communities determined that Korean DRAM	exporters caused material injury to the EC DRAM industry, and imposed	24.7 percent dumping margins on the offending companies.  the	EC decision mandated that the offending companies not sell DRAMs in	the European Community at a price that is less than the price	established pursuant to a minimum price based on each company's	lowest cost of production for five years.

The Present Japanese-American Trade Policy</h4><p><a name="1r"></p><h4>A.  Introduction<a href="#1">[1]</a></h4><p><a name="2r"><a name="3r"></p><p>	Hardly a day goes by that the national press does not have atleast one article about trade relations with Japan.  The articlesgenerally take a somber tone, and discuss things like trade imbalances,protectionism, Japanese unwillingness to compromise, and thepossibility that the United States (or Japan) might retaliate forsomething the Japanese (or United States) either did or failed to do.Japan has accused the United States of reneging on its pledge to lowertariffs on electronics and other goods, and has threatened to retaliateby narrowly targeting U.S. exports of computer components<ahref="#2">[2]</a>  A U.S. trade official said that the U.S. wastargeting items that are made almost exclusively in Japan so that othercountries would not be adversely affected by the U.S. policy<ahref="#3">[3]</a><p><a name="4r"><a name="5r"></p><p>	But even selective targeting can be harmful to U.S. interests.<ahref="#4">[4]</a> Domestic companies that use Japanese parts in theirproducts stand to be adversely affected if U.S. trade policy causes theprice of these parts to increase or, worse yet, to make Japaneseproducts unavailable. For example, Tech Data Corp., a wholesaledistributor of microcomputer hardware and software, sells products thatcontain as much as 30% Japanese parts.  Steven Raymund, its chairmanand chief executive officer, has said that "If we can't get their[Japanese] products anymore, it's going to bring our industry to itsknees."<a href="#5">[5]</a><p><a name="6r"></p><p>	What they often fail to point out is that American consumerslike Japanese products because they are often cheaper than Americanproducts and of a higher quality as well.  And they fail to discuss thereasons why Japan can undersell domestic companies.  These reasons,according to one commentator at least, include a lower cost of capital,differences in national savings rates and a lower level of governmentborrowing (Japan doesn't have massive budget deficits, so privateborrowing is not crowded out by government borrowing needed to financethe deficit.)<a href="#6">[6]</a><p><a name="7r"></p><p>	The tone of the press reports often makes it sound like tradeis war instead of voluntary exchange.  The Japanese have been accusedof "invading" American shores with their cheap (and high quality)products.  Their goods are "flooding" the market.  They are "dumping"their products on us.  Senator Donald Reigle has stated: "Thecontinuing Japanese attack on our basic industries is another PearlHarbor.  The time has come to close America's door to the flood ofJapanese imported products."<a href="#7">[7]</a>  This "trade as war"mentality might lead one to conclude that someone can win a trade war. But such is not the case.  All parties lose because of higher prices,reduced trade and selection of products.	<h4>B. The Trade Deficit Mentality </h4><p><a name="8r"><a name="9r"></p><p>	One of the most popular topics regarding trade policy with Japan isthe fact that Japan has a large trade surplus with the United States. Press reports usually take the position that an increase in Japan'strade surplus is something to be alarmed about, and a reduction iscause for celebration.  The popular press uses language such as: "Japansaid its trade surplus ballooned again in January, a development thatis likely to aggravate tensions with the U.S.<a href="#8">[8]</a>  Theobvious conclusion to be drawn is that Japan's trade surplus is goingto cause some kind of harm to the U.S. economy.<a href="#9">[9]</a></p><p><a name="10r"></p><ul>	<p>	The figures don't bode well for relations with Washington, coming on	the heels of the failed U.S.-Japan trade talks and U.S. charges	that Japan has violated a pact to open its cellular phone market.	Washington has said Japan may face trade	sanctions.<a href="#10">[10]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="11r"></p><p>	The press also occasionally points out that Japan has a tradesurplus with other Asian countries as well as the European Union, whichmay lead one to conclude that Japan is a worldwide trade bully.<a href="#11">[11]</a><p>	The belief that trade deficits are bad and trade surpluses aregood is based on the eighteenth century mercantilist philosophy.  Andalthough the view that trade deficits are bad has been refuted for morethan a hundred years, the belief is still will us, and has a stronginfluence on present-day trade policy.  Adam Smith has the followingcomment:</p><p><a name="12r"></p><ul>	<p>	Nothing ... can be more absurd than this whole doctrine of the balance	of trade ... When two places trade with one another, this doctrine	supposes that, if the balance be even, neither of them either	loses or gains; but if it leans in any degree to one side, that	one of them loses, and the other gains in proportion to its	declension from the exact equilibrium.  Both suppositions are	false ... that trade which, without force or constraint, is naturally	carried on between any two places, is always advantageous ...	to both.<a href="#12">[12]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="13r"></p><p>	It is unrealistic to expect Japan and the United States tohave a zero trade balance.  For one thing, Japan has about half thepopulation of the United States.  That means that, in order to have azero trade balance, every Japanese citizen would have to buy twice asmuch from the U.S., on a per capita basis, as U.S. citizens buy fromJapan.  That is not likely to happen regardless of what kind of tradepolicy we adopt.  And it is of no importance.  California residentsprobably buy more from Arizona, in total, than Arizona residents buyfrom California, since the population of California is much more thanthe population of Arizona.  Yet there is no movement in Congress toforce Arizonans to buy more California products.  I run a trade deficitwith the local grocery store because I buy more from it than it buysfrom me.  Yet we are both prospering.<a href="#13">[13]</a>  The wholeconcept of viewing a trade deficit as bad is sheer idiocy.  It is basedon the mistaken belief that trade is a zero-sum game.  If one partywins, the other must necessarily lose.  But trade is a positive-sumgame because both parties gain.  Otherwise, they would not trade.<p><a name="14r"></p><p>	Interestingly enough, part of the trade deficit the UnitedStates has with Japan is the result of short-sighted U.S. trade policy. Special interest groups such as the seamen's unions and domesticshipbuilding companies lobbied Congress to pass a law that requiresAlaskan oil producers to use high-cost American tankers to carry theircargo to uneconomic domestic ports first, before they can transport oilto a foreign country.  Japan produces no oil of its own.  Whatever oilit has it must purchase from some foreign oil producer.  But becauseAmerican oil is high-cost oil (due to this law), the Japanese find itcheaper to buy their oil from other countries that have lower transportcosts.  Had the Alaskan oil producers been allowed to ship their oildirectly to Japan instead of first shipping it to some other Gulf orwestern U.S. port, they could have sold enough oil to Japan to fullywipe out the trade deficit we have with Japan.<a href="#14">[14]</a><p><a name="15r"><a name="16r"></p><p>	U.S. policymakers also shot themselves in the foot when theyallowed domestic lumber interests to dictate lumber policy.  In 1968,Congress passed a law requiring that all logs harvested on federal land(65% of all logs) first be processed in an American mill before export. But Japan has its own mills and does not need processed lumber.  So itbuys raw lumber from Canada and other countries instead of the UnitedStates.<a href="#15">[15]</a>  Environmentalists like the ban becauseof the mistaken belief that limiting logging will preserve naturalresources (they forget that lumber is a renewable resource).  Lumbermills like the ban because they think it will induce Japan to havetheir logs processed in the United States.  Private forest owners likethe ban because they are not subject to it.<a href="#16">[16]</a><p><a name="17r"></p><p>	There are a number of other problems with allowing trade balancesto influence policy.  For one, it is not at all clear that a deficit isbad and a surplus is good.  Throughout much of the nineteenth centurythe United States had a negative balance of trade as well as more orless continuous rapid growth.  During the depression years of the1930s, we had a trade surplus.  One reason why a trade balance isnegative is because a rapidly expanding economy consumes more than itproduces.  It needs foreign products to continue its expansion.  Ratherthan being a sign of poverty, trade deficits can be a sign of healthand wealth, as economists have been pointing out for years.<ahref="#17">[17]</a><p>	Yet in spite of the evidence, and the logic, policymakers andthe press continue to talk about the trade deficit is though it weresomething that should be reduced.  One international economist whoshould know better says the following:</p><p><a name="18r"></p><ul>	<p>	We have an extraordinary nonmeeting of minds on the trade issue:	The Japanese don't feel they are responsible for the U.S. trade	deficit. The U.S. feels the Japanese are responsible.  But anybody	with experience in doing business with Japan knows their markets	aren't as open to us as ours are to them....One of the few levers the	U.S. can use to put pressure on Japan is to cause the dollar to	depreciate against the yen.<a href="#18">[18]</a>	</p></ul><p>	Ironically, much of what this economist says is true.  In asense, the Japanese are not responsible for the U.S. trade deficit.  Isit their fault that they have just half the population of the U.S.? Should they be forced to buy twice as much, per capita, from Americansas Americans buy from them?  On the other hand, Japan is partlyresponsible for the deficit because their markets are not as open asours.  But American manufacturers also manufacture products that theJapanese don't want, such as cellular telephones tuned to the wrongfrequency and gas guzzling cars that have the steering wheels on thewrong side.  But even if everything this economist says is true, itdoes not follow that we have to put pressure on the Japanese to reducethe deficit because the deficit is an irrelevant statistic.  All thatreally matters is that consenting adults be allowed to enter intovoluntary exchange.  And raising trade barriers prevents them fromdoing that.	<h4>C. Antidumping</h4><p><a name="19r"><a name="20r"></p><p>	The U.S. antidumping laws have been used on numerous occasions topressure Japanese companies to raise the prices they charge to Americanconsumers or to punish them for selling at prices that are deemed to betoo low.  In the last few years, antidumping or countervailing dutyactions have been initiated against Japanese makers of all-terrainvehicles,<a href="#19">[19]</a> aspherical ophthalmoscopy lenses,automobiles, benzyl paraben, bimetallic cylinders,  brass sheet andstrip, butt-weld pipe fittings, color picture tubes, commercialmicrowave ovens, copier toner, distribution systems, drafting machines,dry film photoresist, erasable programmable read only memories,flat-rolled carbon steel products, forged steel crankshafts, granularpolytetrafluoroethylene resin, gray portland cement and cement clinker,high-information content flat panel displays, industrialnitrocellulose, laser light-scattering instruments, light-dutyhydrostatic transmissions, malleable cast-iron pipe fittings,mechanical transfer presses, minivans, new steel rails, nitrile rubber,offshore platform jackets and piles, personal word processors,polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet and strip, professional electriccutting, sanding/grinding tools, salmon gill fish netting, silicafilament fabric, stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings,thermostatically controlled appliance plugs, probe thermostats, 3.5"microdisks and media, and unfinished mirrors.  This paper does notpermit a full discussion of the harmful effects that antidumping lawshave on an economy.  However, this topic has been explored elsewhere.<a href="#20">[20]</a></p><h4>D.  Auto Industry Protectionism</h4><p><a name="21r"><a name="22r"><a name="23r"><a name="24r"></p><p>	The Japanese Voluntary Export Restraint (VER) program of theearly 1980s added more than $1,114 to the options-adjusted price of anew Japanese car and transferred approximately $2 billion from Americanconsumers of Japanese cars to dealers and producers.<ahref="#21">[21]</a>  It also generated $166.4 million in efficiencycosts.<a href="#22">[22]</a>  All to protect at most 1,500 domesticauto jobs.<a href="#23">[23]</a>  That comes to more than $1.4 millionfor every job saved.<a href="#24">[24]</a>  It would have been muchcheaper to pay each displaced auto worker $50,000 or $100,000.<p><a name="25r"><a name="26r"><a name="27r"></p><p>	A Brookings Institution study found that voluntary exportrestrictions on automobiles cost American consumers about $14 billionin 1984, while U.S. auto manufacturers gained $9 billion in profits,for a deadweight loss of $5 billion.<a href="#25">[25]</a>  Anotherstudy estimated the annual cost to be $16.75 billion.<ahref="#26">[26]</a> Because the supply of autos was cut, the unit pricewas able to rise by almost one-third.<a href="#27">[27]</a>  Domesticauto dealers were able to raise their prices because of the reducedJapanese competition.<p><a name="28r"></p><p>	Another factor that affected auto prices was upgrading.  WhenJapan got hit with quotas, Japanese automakers increased the size,horsepower and amount of luxury equipment on the autos it sent to theU.S. market, which added $1,500 to the cost of the average Japanesecar.<a href="#28">[28]</a>  Another interesting effect of imposingquotas on Japanese autos is the effect it had on the domestic autoindustry.  Because of the quotas, Japanese auto manufacturers found itmore enticing to locate plants in the United States, thus avoiding thequotas and giving domestic automakers even more competition, which isthe exact opposite effect that the quotas were intended to have. 	<h4>E. Exchange Rate Manipulation</h4><p><a name="29r"></p><p>	Another tool of protectionism that the United States has used ismanipulation of the exchange rate.  A weak dollar makes foreign goodsmore expensive, thus making domestically produced goods more attractivepricewise.  One major difference between the exchange rate "tool" andthe other tools of protectionism such as tariffs, quotas and use of theantidumping laws is that exchange rate manipulation makes it moredifficult for all foreign producers to sell their goods in the UnitedStates, whereas use of the other tools can be more selective. Threatening to raise a tariff, reduce a quota or initiate anantidumping action can be targeted to a particular product, industry orcompany.  But shifting the exchange rate to make the dollar relativelyweak acts as a form of aggression against all foreign suppliers.  Manydomestic industries benefit, at least in the short-run, at the expenseof the consumers.<a href="#29">[29]</a><p><a name="30r"><a name="31r"><a name="32r"></p><p><a name="33r"><a name="34r"><a name="35r"></p><p><a name="36r"><a name="37r"><a name="38r"></p><p>	Using exchange rate manipulation to raise the prices of foreignproducts and punish foreign producers has been called the mostinsidious form of protectionism.<a href="#30">[30]</a>  TreasurySecretary Lloyd Bentsen has been leading the charge.<ahref="#31">[31]</a>  In December, 1992, the exchange rate was 124 yento the dollar.<a href="#32">[32]</a>  Since then, Secretary Bentsen hasbeen telling the financial press that he would like to see a strongeryen (which also means a weaker dollar).<a href="#33">[33]</a>  Currencytraders took the hint and started trading, which pushed up the value ofthe yen against the dollar. By April, 1993, the yen was trading atabout 113 to the dollar, which causes Japanese goods to rise in priceby 9 percent.<a href="#34">[34]</a>  Japanese trade officials becameextremely angry at the way Clinton administration officials had talkedup the yen.  Currency traders continued to sell dollars in theinternational market until the value of the dollar dropped to just over100 yen in August, 1993, which represented an 18% drop in just sevenmonths.  Some Japanese industry analysts estimate that barely one infifty Japanese exporters can make a profit in the U.S. market when theyen is trading at 115 to 117 to the dollar,<a href="#35">[35]</a> whichcomes as bad news for Japan's economy, which is already in arecession.<a href="#36">[36]</a>  Some of Japan's growing number ofbusiness bankruptcies are directly attributable to the manipulation ofthe yen.<a href="#37">[37]</a> For each of the first six months of1993, more than 1,000 Japanese firms have gone bankrupt.<ahref="#38">[38]</a> 	<p><a name="39r"></p><ul>	<p>	In a way, allowing the dollar to slide is the ultimate trade sanction,	affecting the Japanese economy indiscriminately.  Compared to	the stiletto of formal sanctions, the high yen is a sort of bomb in	the world of trade weapons. Auto makers stand to bear much of	the brunt.  Already, Japanese car makers are pricing their cars	some $2,000 more than U.S. models.  Mr. Toyoda and other auto	executives say that because of the yen's strength, there is no	end in sight to the gap.<a href="#39">[39]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="40r"><a name="42r"></p><p>	Secretary Bentsen is not the only U.S. official to be pleasedwith the dollar's slide relative to the yen.  Commerce DepartmentSecretary Ron Brown has also said that he is not displeased with theslide.<a href="#40">[40]</a>  And this recent case of dollar exchangerate manipulation is not the first time that rates have beenmanipulated for trade purposes.  The U.S. pulled a similar stunt in1987 to punish the Germans for their "sins."41  The result was a WallStreet crash. 	<p><a name="42r"></p><h4>F. Super 301<a href="#42">[42]</a></h4><p><a name="43r"></p><p>	The United States has decided to make use of Super 301 toforce Japan to open up its markets to U.S. products.<ahref="#43">[43]</a>  Super 301 is a weapon the U.S. can use to targetcountries that it deems are engaged in a pattern of unfair tradepractices.  If the targeted country does not change its ways within 18months, the U.S. could retaliate by imposing punitive tariffs ofJapanese imports.<p><a name="44r"><a name="45r"></p><p><a name="46r"><a name="47r"><a name="48r"></p><p>	Super 301 was passed by Congress in 1988 as part of the OmnibusTrade and Competitiveness Act<a href="#44">[44]</a> to force PresidentBush to get tough with countries that appeared to be unfair traders.<a href="#45">[45]</a>  The original targets of the law were Brazil, Indiaand Japan, each of which had its name placed on the Super 301 unfairtrade list.<a href="#46">[46]</a>  Brazil and Japan eventually gottheir names removed from the list and were not punished for theirprotectionist policies,<a href="#47">[47]</a> before the law expired in1990.<a href="#48">[48]</a><p><a name="49r"><a name="50r"></p><p>	Some trade experts claim that the President can get tough withintransigent countries through executive order without the need forCongress to pass another Super 301 law.<a href="#49">[49]</a>  But trade experts also pointout that such an approach could be counterproductive, since exercisingSuper 301, in whatever form, would cause nationalistic sentiment toincrease in Japan, thus undercutting the goal of reducing tradebarriers.<a href="#50">[50]</a><p><a name="51r"><a name="52r"><a name="53r"><a name="54r"></p><p>	Since 1974, when the original Section 301 became law, 78 cases havebeen brought against foreign governments by the United States.<a href="#51">[51]</a> Of these, only 13 have resulted in market openings,and those were generally minor.52  One of the more controversial Super301 cases launched against Japan involved Motorola, which went whiningto the U.S. government because it was not able to capture as large ashare of the Japanese cellular telephone market as it thought itdeserved.  Part of the problem was that the United States and Japan areon different frequencies.  The Japanese companies that export to theUnited States change the frequencies to meet U.S. specifications. Motorola ships phones that do not meet Japanese specifications.<a href="#53">[53]</a>  But that fact was totally ignored when the U.S.government threatened to slap sanctions on several hundred milliondollars worth of Japanese imports if the Japanese  didn't stop"discriminating" against foreign companies.<a href="#54">[54]</a><p><a name="55r"><a name="56r"><a name="57r"></p><p>	Another 301 case involved Japanese citrus quotas.  The Floridacitrus industry estimated that Japanese consumers could enjoy pricesthat were one-third lower if only Japan would remove its unfair tradebarriers.  The fact that the United States imposes a 40% tariff on theimportation of Brazilian orange juice was totally ignored.<ahref="#55">[55]</a>  In 1985, the United States forced Japan to controlits prices for semiconductors both in the U.S. and in other countries. As a result, semiconductor prices in the United States jumped by up to300%, creating a disaster for the U.S. electronics industry and leadingto the loss of as many as 11,000 domestic jobs at companies that usedsemiconductors.<a href="#56">[56]</a>  In 1985, the U.S. concluded acase to remove Japanese leather import quotas.  As part of the deal,the U.S. raised its tariffs on Japanese leather imports from 12% to40%.<a href="#57">[57]</a> 	<h4>G. The Hypocrisy of the United States Position</h4><p><a name="58r"><a name="59r"></p><p>	This "Super 301" mentality, aside from being irrational (cuttingoff one's nose to spite the face), is also hypocritical.  The UnitedStates is far from being a free trade bastion.<a href="#58">[58]</a> We erect numerous trade barriers ourselves, such as tariffs, quotas and"voluntary" trade restraints.  One commentator has said that our tradelaws "are simply a lynch law for foreign businesses."<ahref="#59">[59]</a>  Furthermore, we don't give foreign consumers whatthey want.  For example, Japanese cars have the steering wheel on theright side.  But American auto manufacturers don't make cars with thesteering wheel on the right side.  All the cars they ship to Japan havethe steering wheel on the left side.  And most of the cars we do shipto Japan are gas guzzlers compared to Japanese cars.  Furthermore,Consumer Reports shows that Japanese cars have a consistently lowerdefect rate. It is any wonder that the Japanese won't buy Americancars?<p><a name="60r"><a name="61r"></p><p>	Where U.S. companies make products that Japanese consumerswant, they do buy our products.  American music and tee-shirts sellwell in Japan. So do a wide range of products, including M&Ms,Snickers, Hall's cough drops, Clorets, Wrigley's gum, Polident,Kentucky Fried Chicken, Wendy's, McDonalds, Domino's Pizza, Johnson &Johnson products, Q-Tips, Band-Aids, Pampers, Colgate toothpaste,Gillette razors, Kleenex, Pedigree, KalKan and Gaines dogfood, Denny's,Shakey's Pizza, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway, Famous Amos, Mrs. Fields'cookies, Coke, Jolly Green Giant products, American tobacco products,Visa, MasterCard and American Express.<a href="#60">[60]</a>  Americantobacco companies have more freedom to advertise in Tokyo than they doin New York.<a href="#61">[61]</a><p><a name="62r"><a name="63r"><a name="64r"><a name="65r"><a name="66r"></p><p>	Six of the last eleven Japanese public supercomputer bids have beenawarded to American companies.<a href="#62">[62]</a>  But U.S. agencies"rarely, if ever, buy foreign supercomputers, partly because they knowsuch purchases will cause them political grief."<a href="#63">[63]</a>"U.S. government agencies have been called before congressionalhearings simply for inviting Japanese firms to bid on supercomputerwork."<a href="#64">[64]</a>  And U.S. hypocrisy is not limited tosupercomputers.  Various "Buy American"<a href="#65">[65]</a> and"domestic content"<a href="#66">[66]</a> laws require governments atall levels to give preference to U.S.-made products, even if thequality is lower or the price is higher.  If Japan had a Super 301 ofits own, it would find the United States guilty.<p><a name="67r"><a name="68r"><a name="69r"></p><p>	Various U.S. administrations have resorted to protectionistpolicies to protect a wide range of domestic industries from foreigncompetition.  President Reagan imposed a 100% tariff on certainJapanese electronics products in 1987 to punish the Japanese forselling their products to American consumers at low prices.<ahref="#67">[67]</a>  The Japanese were punished for failing to keeptheir microchip prices high, as they had promised.<ahref="#68">[68]</a>  The Reagan administration also slapped anadditional 45% tariff on Japanese heavy motorcycles as a favor toHarley Davidson.<a href="#69">[69]</a><p><a name="70r"><a name="71r"><a name="72r"></p><p>	Various "voluntary" restraint agreements, which are not voluntarybecause they require the Japanese government to restrict the exports ofcertain Japanese companies, have been used to protect the domesticauto,<a href="#70">[70]</a> textile<a href="#71">[71]</a> and steel<ahref="#72">[72]</a> industries over the years, at the expense ofconsumers, who must pay higher prices for both foreign and domesticproducts as a result.<p><a name="73r"><a name="74r"><a name="75r"></p><p>	U.S. trade hypocrisy is not limited to trade with Japan.  Itextends to all trading partners.  In 1990, the U.S. initiated a Section301 case against Canada for placing high tariffs and other restrictionson U.S. beer exports, ignoring the fact that many of our states andlocal governments place their own restrictions on alcohol shipments andsales.<a href="#73">[73]</a>  The U.S. forced Canada to impose a 15%export tax on its lumber because the Canadian government was supposedlysubsidizing the lumber industry.  But Canadian provincial governmentswere merely following many of the same practices as the U.S. ForestService.  The tax destroyed up to 16,600 U.S. jobs and added more than$1,000 to the cost of building a house in the United States.<ahref="#74">[74]</a>  In 1988, the U.S. launched a Section 301 caseagainst Korea for having quotas on beef imports, while ignoring thefact that the U.S. has its own beef import quotas that cost Americanconsumers $873 million annually in higher prices, according to aDepartment of Agriculture estimate.<a href="#75">[75]</a><h4>2. The Present Korean-American Trade Policy</h4><h4>A.  Introduction</h4><p><a name="76r"><a name="77r"><a name="78r"><a name="79r"></p><p>	Since the end of World War II, South Korea and the UnitedStates have had a special relationship.  At first, the U.S.-Korearelationship was dominated by their common military and foreign policyinterests, but in recent years, the trade relationship between the twocountries has gained more importance.  Korea is the USA's eighthlargest trading partner and the USA is the largest trading partner ofKorea.<a href="#76">[76]</a>  The trade relationship has grown inimportance primarily because of the rapid growth experienced by theKorean economy.  As one of the four newly industrialized countries inAsia -- the so-called "four Asian tigers" -- Korea has experienced inthe past quarter century extremely rapid economic growth on the basisof export-oriented industrialization.  Because of this growth, percapita GNP rose to $7,000 in 1992, compared to $80 per capita GNP in1961.<a href="#77">[77]</a>  In 1988, when South Korea sponsored a16-day, $3 billion festivity -- the 24th Summer Olympic Games --Fortune magazine called Korea "tomorrow's power house."<ahref="#78">[78]</a>  Korea's industrialization was so rapid andremarkably successful that it was proclaimed as "Asia's next giant" byAlice H. Amsden, a noted American economist.<a href="#79">[79]</a><p>	Much of Korea's economic growth is attributable to very rapidgrowth in its exports. The United States has been instrumental inKorea's export-led growth because the United States has been the singlemost important market for Korea's exports.  Korea's rapid economicgrowth has, in turn, produced a burgeoning demand for imported goodsand services, including those produced in the United States.	<h4>B. U.S. Trade Barriers to Korean Exports</h4><p><a name="80r"></p><p>	Although the United States is one of the world's most openeconomies ,<a href="#80">[80]</a> it still impeded trade in a number ofindustries through high tariffs and/or import quotas.  In addition tothese more traditional forms of protection, the United States has beenemploying administered production more frequently and with greaterimpact over the past decade. 	<h4>C. Tariffs</h4><p><a name="81r"><a name="82r"></p><p>	While the average U.S. tariff is quite low and now stands atabout 5%, tariffs remain quite high in a several industries, especiallythose with labor intensive production, such as textiles, apparel,footwear, and leather products.  The average U.S. textile tariff is 11%while the average apparel rate is 20% (and ranges up to 35%).<ahref="#81">[81]</a>  Footwear tariffs vary between 10% and 40%. Leather goods such as gloves, handbags and luggage have tariffs rangingfrom 12% to 16%.<a href="#82">[82]</a>  Unfortunately for Korea, itscomparative advantage vis a vis the United States lies at least in partin the production of these types of goods.  Its apparel, textile,footwear, and leather product exports accounted for nearly 40% of itstotal U.S. exports in 1991.  There can be little doubt that these highrates impede Korean exports to the U.S. significantly. 	<h4>D. Quantitative Restrictions</h4><p><a name="83r"><a name="84r"></p><p>	The United States also limits imports with quantitativerestrictions such as the Multifiber Arrangement (MFA) and voluntaryrestraint agreements (VRAs).  The MFA is used by the developedcountries to limit developing country textile and apparel imports.  TheUnited States and Korea have negotiated several bilateral agreementssince the inception of the MFA in 1974.  Under the bilateralagreements, Korea's exports of textile and apparel to the United Statesare allowed to grow at an annual one percent rate.<ahref="#83">[83]</a>  Korea's share of textiles and apparal exports tothe United States has declined as a result, because exports of othercountries to the United States are allowed to grow more rapidly. Between 1989 and 1991, Korea's share of all U.S. imports subject to theMFA has declined to 8.5% from 11%.<a href="#84">[84]</a><p>	The second quantitative restraint involves Korea's steel industry. In the mid-1980s, the United States negotiated "voluntary" restraintagreements (VRAs) with the major steel exporting countries, includingKorea.  Before the expiration of these VRAs in March, 1992,negotiations began on a multilateral steel agreement (MSA) that wouldapportion global steel trade.  As of this writing, MSA negotiationshave been unsuccessful.  In the absence of an agreement, morerestrictive measures are likely to be taken, thus impeding the world'ssteel trade.	<h4>E. Antidumping and Antisubsidy Duties</h4><p><a name="85r"></p><p>	Other non-tariff barriers deployed by the United States to restrictimports are antidumping and antisubsidy duties.  Antidumping andantisubsidy duties are imposed against imports that are determined tobe dumped (i.e., sold at "less than fair value") or subsidized.  Thereis a widespread view among international trade experts that the purposeof antidumping and antisubsidy duties imposed by the United States isto protect domestic industries from import competition.<ahref="#85">[85]</a>  This is particularly true of antidumping duties. In theory, dumping by foreign firms should be penalized if its purposeis to limit competition by driving other producers out of the domesticmarket. Under this circumstance, antidumping duties are welfareimproving because they help maintain competition.  In practice,however, it is widely recognized that dumping rarely occurs and thusantidumping duties are welfare reducing rather than welfare enhancing.<p><a name="86r"></p><p>	Over the past decade, a number of Korean industries have been hitwith antidumping actions for allegedly selling their products in theUnited States at prices that are too low.  Products that Koreaallegedly dumped on the United States market include automotivebatteries,<a href="#86">[86]</a> ball bearings, brass sheet and strip,cast-iron pipe fittings, cold-rolled carbon steel,  color picturetubes, computer chips, flat-rolled carbon steel, industrial belts,motorcycle batteries, nitrocellulose, offshore platform jackets andpiles, photo albums, polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet and strip,stainless steel butt-weld pipe fittings, steel pipes and tubes, sweaters, telephone systems and subassemblies, tubular goods, andwelded stainless steel pipes.<p><a name="87r"></p><p>	A major question to be answered is whether these antidumping actionswere justified, and if not, what should be done to prevent thecontinuation of an improper antidumping policy. Space does not permit afull discussion of this point.  However, this question has beenaddressed in depth elsewhere.<a href="#87">[87]</a>	<h4>F.  Korean Protectionism</h4><p><a name="88r"></p><p>	While the United States trade policy toward Korea is protectionist,the same can be said of Korean trade policy toward the United States.Korea has also been guilty of a number of protectionist trade policiesthat affect trade both with the United States and other countries.<a href="#88">[88]</a><p>	The U.S. trade deficit with Korea was $1.6 billion in 1994, anincrease of more than $700 million over the previous year.  And whiletrade deficits don't matter, the fact that they have been increasing asled policymakers in the United States to become concerned, and to focusmore attention on trade with Korea.<p>	In early 1994, Korea concluded its five-year autonomous tariffreduction, which resulted in reducing its average tariff rate to 7.9%,compared to a previous average of 12%.  However, tariffs on manyhigh-value agricultural and fishery products continue to be high, asmuch as 25% or more.  Imports of distilled spirits are subject to atariff of 15% or 30% plus an "education tax."   This tax, which is 120%as of 1995, is scheduled to be reduced to 100% in 1996.<p>	U.S. producers continue to complain that the combination of Korea'stariffs and non-discriminatory value-added taxes for agricultural andmanufactured products are often sufficiently high to either keepimports out of the Korean market or raise import prices touncompetitive levels.  Although the Uruguay round of GATT will reducethese tariffs eventually, more than half of the tariffs supposedlyreduced by GATT will not go into effect for ten years, which provideslittle consolation for foreign producers that want to do business inKorea (or numerous other countries, for that matter).<p>	However, there is also good news.  Korea abolished all tariffson many or all products in the paper, toy, semiconductor, steel andpharmaceutical industries in early 1995.  It also reduced tariffs onchemicals and scientific equipment.  The less than good news is thatKorea is harmonizing its tariffs on textile and apparel products withU.S. rates, which can be as high as 35%.  This puts American textileand apparel producers in the curious position of accusing Korea ofbeing protectionist when these same U.S. producers support identicaltariffs rates for similar U.S. products.<p>	Korea also imposes import quotas on certain products, especially inthe agricultural and fishery industries.  Some items are banned fromimportation completely.  Some of these barriers are being liberalized. However, a GATT panel ruled in 1989 that Korea's quantitativerestrictions on beef imports were not in compliance with its GATTobligations.  The United States and Korea have since concluded a seriesof bilateral agreements on the importation of beef to remedy thissituation.  These agreements call for increasing minimum access levelsannually, guaranteeing direct commercial relations between Koreanretailers and distributors and foreign suppliers, and guaranteeing thatgrowing volumes of beef will be sold in the private sector rather thanthrough a government corporation.  By the year 2001, Korea is supposedto remove all non-tariff barriers to the importation of beef, includingstate trading.<p>	The Uruguay Round also requires Korea to start phasing out itsimport restrictions on a number of agricultural items of interest toU.S. exporters, including beef jerky and offals, frozen pork, frozenchicken, oranges, orange juice, dairy and whey products, apples andapple juice, grapes and grape juice and other fruit juice. Restrictions remain on a number of other agricultural products,however.  Korea is also required to lift its import ban on rice.  The1995 quota of 51,307 tons is to rise to 205,228 tons by 2004.  Itsorange quota of 15,000 tons in 1995 is to rise to 25,000 tons in 1997,and will increase by 12.5% per year thereafter.  Korea has more than 18laws that allow various government ministries to ban or place quotas onvarious products.  Korea has agreed to phase-out these laws as part ofthe Uruguay Round.<p>	Korean import clearance procedures have been criticized forbeing slow and arbitrary.  It often takes considerable time to getimported items out of port.  Timeliness is especially critical foragricultural products, since long delays can result in making the goodsunmarketable.  It does little good to liberalize import restrictions ifthe products rot in port before clearance.  Agricultural imports inKorea take between two and four weeks to get clearance, compared to aclearance time of three to four days in other Asian countries. "Luxury" goods such as chocolate products, cosmetics and electronicstake as long as three to five weeks to get clearance even though theyare not subject to any restrictions under Korean law.  The Ministry ofHealth and Welfare and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry andFisheries impose numerous barriers to entry that effectively prohibitaccess or inhibit port clearance.<p>	Another oft-cited secondary barrier involves Korea's policiesconcerning standards, testing, labeling and certification.  Regulationsthat are supposedly intended to protect health and safety often deviatesubstantially from international practices in both method andsubstance.  These practices do not appear to be based on any riskassessment or scientific basis, and are often drafted in ways thataffect only imported goods.	<h4>3. Concluding Observations</h4><p>	Numerous studies have found that protectionist policies resultin a deadweight loss -- there are more losers than winners.  But somegroups do gain by the passage of a protectionist policy.  And it isthese gainers who have the ear of the legislature.  Economists pointout that this phenomenon can exist because the benefits areconcentrated but the costs are diffused.  This fact makes it profitablefor the special interests who stand to gain or lose by a particularpolicy to concentrate their efforts on persuading the legislature tosee things their way.  For example, protectionist policies might causethe price of a shirt to be $5 higher than would be the case undertotally free trade, requiring millions of consumers to pay $5 more forevery shirt they buy.  But such a small cost does not make itworthwhile to organize a consumer march on Washington because the cost,in terms of time, effort and out-of-pocket dollars, just is not worthit.  Consumers are acting rationally when they do not protest the factthat some protectionist policy causes them to pay $5 more for a shirt. Indeed, the vast majority of consumers probably do not even know thatgovernment policy results in higher shirt prices.<p><a name="89r"><a name="90r"><a name="91r"></p><p>	But domestic producers know.<a href="#89">[89]</a>   And itis in their interest to make sure that such policies are continued,since abolishing tariffs, quotas or other trade regulations would costthem money and jobs, at least in the short run.  So special interestshave a built-in advantage when it comes to influencing trade policy andconsumers have a built-in disadvantage.  This tendency to use the forceof government to feather one's own nest at the expense of the generalpublic is called rent-seeking.<a href="#90">[90]</a>  But"rent-seeking" is really a misnomer.  A better term might bebooty-seeking, since it is really an attempt to gain at the expense ofsomeone else rather than by voluntary exchange.<a href="#91">[91]</a><p><a name="92r"><a name="93r"><a name="94r"></p><p>	Protectionism can take many forms.  Tariffs act like salestaxes in that they raise the price of imported goods.  But tariffs havea disparate impact because they are levied only on imports, which givesdomestically produced products a built-in advantage.  Quotas have asimilar effect.  In the sense that they prevent goods from crossing theborder, they cause prices to be higher than would be the case underfree competition.<a href="#92">[92]</a>  Economists would describe thisphenomenon by pointing out that the supply has been cut back, therebyleading to an increase in price.<a href="#93">[93]</a>  Antidumping andcountervailing duty laws also have been used to protect domesticproducers from foreign competition.<a href="#94">[94]</a><p><a name="95r"></p><p>	Protectionism also has nonmonetary costs. Adopting a protectionistpolicy to aid this industry or that actually destroys more jobs than itsaves.  For example, President Reagan's voluntary restraint agreement,which was aimed at reducing steel imports from 26 percent to 22 percentof domestic sales, caused employment in the steel industry to increaseby 17,000.  But this policy caused some adverse effects as well.Employment in the industries that used steel declined by 52,000 becausethe higher prices they had to pay for steel cut into their profitmargins, forcing them to lay off employees and reduce the number of newjobs that would otherwise have been available.<a href="#95">[95]</a> Thus, about 3.1 jobs were destroyed (or never permitted to come intoexistence) for every job saved by the restraint policy.<p>	Present trade policy in countries that adopt protectionist policiesis a form of class conflict because it pits the special interestsagainst consumers.  Special interests such as the steel industry, DRAMchip industry, and so forth, are using the force of government tofeather their own nests at the expense of consumers and the generalpublic, which tears at the fabric of government.  Rather than being aservant of the people, government is being used as a tool of specialindustrial interests to reduce competition and raise prices.  Thismisuse of governmental power reduces social harmony.<p>	Another nonmonetary cost that consumers must bear is the reduction inchoice that results when quotas or dumping duties are imposed offoreign goods like Korean DRAM chips or steel.  If goods are preventedfrom entering the country, consumers might have to settle for theirsecond or third choice, which reduces their utility.  This cost isintangible, but it is real.  The loss in utility is the differencebetween the utility they would gain by purchasing their first choice ofproduct and the utility they receive by settling for their second orthird choice.<p>	The arguments put forth so far have been mostly utilitarian. Consumers stand to lose utility and reduce their standard of livingbecause protectionist trade policies raise the cost they must pay forgoods or reduces their consumer choice by preventing certain productsfrom entering the country.  We have also argued that our protectionisttrade policies are bad because they destroy more jobs than they save,which is also a utilitarian argument.<p><a name="96r"><a name="97r"></p><p>	But the utilitarian approach suffers a fatal flaw because itignores individual rights.<a href="#96">[96]</a>  A utilitarian wouldapprove of a policy if the good outweighs the bad.  If the evidenceshowed that protectionism saves more jobs than it destroys, autilitarian would conclude that the protectionist policy is good andwould advocate its adoption, while ignoring the fact that such a policyprevents consumers from buying the products of their choice.  By whatmoral right does some government prevent consenting adults fromentering into contracts or prevent them from trading the fruits oftheir labor?  In effect, protectionist policies serve to transferwealth from consumers to domestic producers. Consumers have theirproperty and contract rights violated whenever they are prevented fromtrading their property as they see fit.  Their rights are beingsacrificed so that domestic producers, who would not otherwise be ableto make a sale, can make a sale.  Protectionist policies are merelyforms of redistribution.<a href="#97">[97]</a>  But whereas wegenerally think of redistributionist policies as transferring wealthfrom the rich to the poor, protectionist redistribution transferswealth from consumers to producers.<p>	Rather than argue that a particular policy is good if the beneficialeffects outweigh the detrimental effects, as a utilitarian would do, wesuggest that a better approach to use to determine whether a particularpolicy is good or bad is to determine whether anyone's rights areviolated.  A policy that violates property or contract rights ismorally bankrupt even if the good outweighs the bad because it uses theforce of government to allow one individual or group to live at theexpense of another.  It allows some individual or group to act as aparasite by using the force of government, which is an immoral andillegitimate use of governmental power.<p>	The only proper trade policy is one of total, immediate andunilateral free trade.  The economic literature is clear that a policyof free trade -- even if it is unilateral -- benefits the vast majorityof the population.  Free trade expands the quantity of goods availableto consumers and keeps prices low, thus increasing the standard ofliving for practically everyone.  The studies that have been madeindicate that a policy of free trade also results in a net employmentgain, as free trade allows more jobs to be created than those that aredestroyed.  But more importantly, a policy of free trade is the onlypolicy that does not violate the rights of consenting adults to enterinto contracts and trade the fruits of their labor -- their property --for the property of others.  Free trade is the only policy that doesnot use the force of government to reduce social harmony.<p>	Some commentators take the position that free trade is the bestpolicy, but that we cannot afford to open our borders unilaterally. But such arguments are off the mark.  Domestic consumers will benefitimmediately under a unilateral free trade regime because the absence oftariffs, quotas and the chilling effect of the antidumping andcountervailing duty laws will result in price declines, thus resultingin an increase in the standard of living.  While it would be nice ifother nations followed our lead, it is not necessary.  Unilateral freetrade will result in an increase in the standard of living no matterwhat other nations do.  And waiting for other nations to agree toreduce their trade barriers -- or worse yet, to threaten retaliation ifthey do not reciprocate -- will only postpone the fall in prices thatwould result from a unilateral free trade regime.  Taking the positionthat we cannot afford to drop our trade barriers until others do isakin to arguing that we must continue to shoot ourselves in the foot aslong as other nations shoot themselves in the foot.  Any nation thatadopts protectionist policies shoots itself in the foot, or ratherreduces the standard of living for the vast majority of its people. The fact that they do does not mean that we have to, too.<p>	An earlier version of this Policy Analysis appeared in theInternational Journal of Korean Studies, Vol. 2 (1995), 45-74.

Rent	is a contract between consenting adults, and there is nothing evil or	vicious or depraved about rent.  Yet, when we use the phrase	"rent seeking" and apply it to what we do, we demean the word	"rent" and lose its meaning.  Let's call it "booty seeking" or	"theft seeking" or "loot seeking" or something else of this sort to	distinguish it from legitimate forms of "rent seeking."  I am	trying to save the word "rent" from this association with what	is really, in effect, theft.

When you add the indirect costs that are incurred in order toavoid liability -- needless testing, excessive liability insurancecosts, etc. -- the total could reach as much as $300 billion a year<ahref="#4">[4]</a> -- the combined gross national products of Austria,Luxembourg, the Philippines, Portugal and Switzerland.<a href="#5">[5]</a>  Yet a major study by the Brookings Institution foundthat litigation does not lead to increased product safety.<a href="#6">[6]</a>  While safety has increased over the past twodecades, it is because of market pressures and government regulations,not litigation.<a href="#7">[7]</a>  And the potential costs oflitigation are causing some companies to halt research and theintroduction of new products and manufacture products abroad, whichdestroys jobs, stifles economic growth and causes America to lose itscompetitive edge.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Liability costs in the UnitedStates are fifteen times higher than in Japan and twenty times higherthan in Europe.<a href="#9">[9]</a>  How can America compete with thiskind of drag on the economy?<p><a name="10r"><a name="11r"><a name="12r"><a name="13r"></p><p>	As a result of this system, consumers lose in several ways.They can't  always get the products they want because some products aretaken off the market because of excessive litigation risks.  Forexample, WEPCO had to close because it could not get liabilityinsurance to insure the driving aids that it manufactured for thehandicapped.<a href="#10">[10]</a>  And even when products areavailable, manufacturers pass the litigation costs on in the form ofhigher prices when they can get away with it.  It is as if thegovernment placed a product liability tax on every product.  In thecase of the DPT vaccination, for example, 40 percent of the cost goesto cover liability costs.<a href="#11">[11]</a> And some products areactually less safe as a result of the present product liability laws. For example, Volvo will not sell its cars with built-in safety seats inthe USA because it might open itself up to liability, although thissafety feature is available in the cars it sells in other countries.<a href="#12">[12]</a>   One reason why health care costs are goingthrough the roof is because some medical specialists have to pay up to$250,0000 a year in malpractice premiums.<a href="#13">[13]</a><p><a name="14r"><a name="15r"><a name="16r"></p><p>	But what is really outrageous is what happens to the moneythat defendants have to pay.  According to a study by the GeneralAccounting Office, more than half of it goes to attorneys rather thanvictims.<a href="#14">[14]</a> For complicated cases like asbestoslitigation, the lawyers' slice can be two-thirds.<a href="#15">[15]</a> For Superfund pollution cases, they get up to 80%.<ahref="#16">[16]</a><p><a name="17r"><a name="18r"></p><p>	There are several reasons for the high legal costs.  For one,it takes years to get a case through the legal system.  The averagesuit takes more than a year, and in Chicago, the civil case backlog iseight years.<a href="#17">[17]</a>   And all the while, the legalmeters are running.  One partner in a large law firm bragged to a lawschool audience that, for one long case, "My firm's meter was runningall the time -- every month for 14 years."<a href="#18">[18]</a><p><a name="19r"><a name="20r"><a name="21r"><a name="22r"></p><p>	It is in the best interest of lawyers to keep the meter runningand they use several means to do it.  One of the most effective ways toprolong a trial and wear down the opposition is by the abuse of"discovery," the rule that allows courts to demand practically everydocument that a company has on file that has anything remotely to dowith the case.  Courts have asked auto companies to submit everycomplaint about faulty headlights that they have ever had, forexample.<a href="#19">[19]</a>  In one IBM antitrust suit, discoveryproduced 64 million pages of documents and took five years.<ahref="#20">[20]</a>   There are practically no limits to discovery, andlawyers often use it not to get at the truth but to use it as a weaponto wear down the opposition and prolong the trial.  In fact, discoveryaccounts for 60% of the time and money that is spent on lawsuits.<ahref="#21">[21]</a>  In 1988, a Louis Harris poll of lawyers found thatalmost one half of those surveyed admitted that they use discovery todrive up their own fees.<a href="#22">[22]</a>  Attempts have been madeto limit discovery, but those attempts have failed because of the veryvociferous efforts of the plaintiff's bar.<p><a name="23r"><a name="24r"></p><p>	Litigation costs are high for other reasons as well.  Contingencyfees,<a href="#23">[23]</a> which allow lawyers to take a percentagerather than get paid on an hourly basis, encourage lawyers to takecases they would never consider on a straight fee basis.  And clientsare much more apt to let a lawsuit proceed if they are liable to payonly if they win.  And in the American system, each side pays its ownlegal fees, which encourages frivolous suits because there is nodownside risk for plaintiffs.  Attempts have been made to limit oreliminate contingent fees and make lawyers charge by the hour, butthese attempts have failed.  Attempts to adopt the "English rule,"<ahref="#24">[24]</a> by which the loser pays for all legal fees of boththe winner and the loser, have also failed.<p><a name="25r"><a name="26r"></p><p>	The potential awards for winning a lawsuit also make suingmore appealing.  The system of joint and several liability makes ittempting to go after "deep pockets," companies that have a lot of cash,even though they may be responsible for only a small portion of thedamage. And the possibility of receiving punitive damages also providesincentive to go forward with a lawsuit, since the award received may befar in excess of the amount of damages actually suffered.  With allthese factors working together, it is no wonder that the number ofproduct liability suits has exploded.  In the federal court system, thenumber of such suits jumped 1,183% between 1974 and 1990 -- to about19,000.<a href="#25">[25]</a>  And that is only the tip of the iceberg. About 95-96% of all product liability cases are settled out of court,and thus are not included in these statistics.<a href="#26">[26]</a>And each of the 50 state court systems also hear product liabilitycases -- and they each have different sets of rules.  As a result,litigators engage in forum shopping, the practice of looking around forthe court system that is most likely to give them the result they want. Efforts to establish a standard federal rule have failed, againbecause of the efforts of the plaintiff's bar.  Attempts to limitpunitive damages and replace the joint and several liability rules withproportional liability also have failed because of the efforts of thispowerful group.<p><a name="27r"><a name="28r"><a name="29r"></p><p>	But such litigation is not exploding on a worldwide basis, just inthe United States.  Britain has less than 500 product liability cases ayear.<a href="#27">[27]</a>  Holland has had just five cases since1940.<a href="#28">[28]</a> Malpractice insurance premiums cost lessthan 10% as much in Europe as in the United States.<ahref="#29">[29]</a><p><a name="30r"><a name="31r"></p><p>	Who are these people who are resisting tort reform, and whyare they doing it?  One might guess without much effort.  It is aclassic case of what Public Choice economists call rent-seeking, theuse of government to feather one's own nest at the expense of someoneelse.<a href="#30">[30]</a> In this case, it is the plaintiff's barthat is feathering its own nest, and it is at the expense of everyoneelse, consumers as well as producers.  The present tort liabilitysystem is retarding economic growth and destroying jobs, not to mentionlives.  Yet the plaintiff bar insists that the present tort system isin the public interest, protects the little guy and costs nothingbecause insurance companies are picking up the tab, and that is whatinsurance companies are in business for.  Yet they don't explain why,if insurance companies are making a killing by charging high premiums,so many of them are pulling out of some risk areas.<ahref="#31">[31]</a>  And they fail to point out that little guys -- momand pop businesses -- can be driven out of business by a singlelawsuit.  Even if they win the suit, five or more years down the road,they still have to pay the lawyers, and that can be enough to bankruptthem.<p><a name="32r"><a name="33r"><a name="34r"><a name="35r"><a name="36r"></p><p><a name="37r"><a name="38r"><a name="39r"><a name="40r"><a name="41r"></p><p>	The plaintiff bar, led by the Association of Trial Lawyers ofAmerica (ATLA) and various Ralph Nader groups, wants the system to stayjust the way it is.  If a Coca-Cola delivery truck collides with aschool bus, like it did in Alston, Texas a few years ago, they want tobe able to take $25 million of the $67.5 million settlement forthemselves -- that amounts to between $10,000 and $40,000 an hour -- inthe name of protecting the little guy.<a href="#32">[32]</a>   Yet, aslaw professor Lester Brickman points out, "These lawyers are stealingmoney for doing nothing more than getting clients to sign on theline."<a href="#33">[33]</a>  According to Brickman's estimate,<ahref="#34">[34]</a> plaintiff's attorneys earn a whopping $10 billionon personal injury suits alone.<a href="#35">[35]</a> With that kind ofvested interest, it is no wonder that they are pouring money intoCongressional campaigns so that those members of Congress who supportthe status quo will be re-elected.  One lawyer in Florida paid $600,000for an ad campaign to defeat a referendum to cap medical malpracticeawards.<a href="#36">[36]</a>  More than a dozen California lawyers andlaw firms each contributed $100,000 to $300,000 to defeat a ballotinitiative to curb a plaintiff's ability to collect.<a href="#37">[37]</a>  Shortly aftervice president Dan Quayle blasted the tort system at the American BarAssociation convention in 1991, California lawyer William Lerachinvited the San Diego trial lawyers to attend a $1,000 a plate dinnerat his home (at which seven U.S. Senators would be present) to raisefunds to fight tort reform.<a href="#38">[38]</a>  According to WalterOlson, an expert on the liability crisis, "In some states they [triallawyers] constitute the entire fund-raising arm of the Democraticparty."<a href="#39">[39]</a>   According to one estimate, the ATLAPolitical Action Committee, various law firm PACs and individualattorneys gave the Democratic party and individual candidates perhapsas much as $10 million or more for the 1989-90 election cycle.<ahref="#40">[40]</a> If true, that might make trial lawyers the largestsingle-issue giver in national politics.<a href="#41">[41]</a><p><a name="42r"><a name="43r"><a name="44r"></p><p><a name="45r"><a name="46r"><a name="47r"></p><p>	In 1989, Ohio Senator Howard Metzenbaum received $123,000from personal injury law firms as far away as Albany and Houston <ahref="#42">[42]</a>.  At the state level, the trial bar raises money tofinance the campaigns of candidates to oppose advocates of no-faultlaws.<a href="#43">[43]</a>  When Jim Florio was elected governor ofNew Jersey, somewhere between $700,000 and $1 million of his campaignwar chest came from the trial bar, in a campaign where total spendingwas limited to $1.7 million.<a href="#44">[44]</a>  The Louisiana TrialLawyers Association spent at least $1.2 million on the 1991 electionsthere and bragged to its membership that 30 of the 39 members of thenew state Senate got there with LTLA backing. And in the LouisianaHouse, 22 LTLA candidates won and seven lost.<a href="#45">[45]</a> And the Louisiana legislature is now pushing through a bill that willlegalize the awarding of punitive damages.<a href="#46">[46]</a>  Yetthey insist they are defenders of consumer rights and aren't in it forthe money.<a href="#47">[47]</a><p><a name="48r"><a name="49r"></p><p>	Ralph Nader has been especially good at camouflaging theself-interest of trial lawyers.  It is more than mere coincidence thatNader never endorses any consumer causes that conflict with theinterests of trial attorneys.  Nader has been getting large sums ofmoney from the trial bar since at least the early 1970s.<ahref="#48">[48]</a>   Yet he continues to deny it.  According to RobertJoost, who was the Senate Commerce Committee's chief counsel during theno-fault auto insurance debates in the 1970s, trial attorneys regularlypay tithes to Nader, the national ATLA PAC and the state ATLAorganization out of their cut of court settlements.<ahref="#49">[49]</a><p><a name="50r"><a name="51r"><a name="52r"></p><p>	Nader and company do not hesitate to use their influence tokill consumer legislation when it would reduce the plaintiff bar'sincome.  Numerous consumer groups supported Senator Robert W. Kasten,Jr.'s 1986 amendment that would have required plaintiff's attorneys tooffer to work on an hourly basis and to disclose their hours worked.But Public Citizen and Congress Watch -- both Nader groups -- opposedit.<a href="#50">[50]</a>  Nader has even resorted to smear campaigns(such as calling Senator Kasten a drunk)<a href="#51">[51]</a> whendoing so would help the plaintiff bar. Every election year, he blastsRep. Donald L. Ritter, one of the strongest proponents of tort reformin Congress, and has accused him of being anti-consumer because hetakes contributions from nuclear energy interests.  Ritter calls thisapproach dishonest, since he comes from a coal and steel district.<ahref="#52">[52]</a><p><a name="53r"><a name="54r"><a name="55r"></p><p>	The plaintiff bar can bring much pressure to bear against membersof Congress who don't see things their way, and they don't hesitate touse it.  ATLA threatened to raise $500,000 in PAC money to defeatSenator Russell B. Long if he continued to support no-fault.  And itmade the threat public in order to intimidate other no-faultsupporters.<a href="#53">[53]</a>  Yet it never threatened SenatorErnest F. Hollings, who bragged that his contingency case winnings madeit possible for him to finance his own campaigns for office and that hewasn't going to let anyone put limitations on it.<a href="#54">[54]</a> When the no-fault vote was taken, six moderate Republicans quicklychanged their votes and opposed the bill. Coincidentally, they changedtheir positions shortly after receiving contributions from the ATLAPAC.<a href="#55">[55]</a><p>	From the mounds of evidence that have accumulated over the pastfew decades, it is clear that the plaintiff bar is the majorbeneficiary of the present tort system -- as well as its creator.  Theybenefit at the expense of the rest of us -- consumers as well asproducers.  The plaintiff bar has been able to accumulate the bestlegislators that money can buy to hold back the floodgates of reform. And they have the audacity to say that they are doing it to protect thelittle guy.  In fact, they are feathering their own nests, and it istime that they stopped.  A fair system would compensate victims fortheir wrongs without treating them like lottery winners, and would notpunish producers of goods and services when they have done no wrong. It's time to restore justice and fairness to the tort system inAmerica.<p>	An earlier version of this paper was published by the WashingtonLegal Foundation in August, 1992.

In the USA, statesprovide a free government (public school) education to students for thefirst twelve years, and subsidize tuition at state universitiesthereafter.  As a result, government education has become a nearmonopoly (Everhart, 1982), especially at the primary and secondarylevel because privately provided education finds it difficult tocompete on price.  Where private education exists, it can compete onlybecause of nonprice advantages.<p>	This near monopoly position with regard to education exhibits many ofthe attributes of monopolies in general -- the price (total cost) ishigher than would be the case in a market system and the quality islower (Fitzgerald, 1988; Bennett and Johnson, 1981; Poole, 1980; Savas,1982).  This phenomenon has been recognized, and some economists andothers have advocated breaking up this monopoly by the use of a vouchersystem whereby parents can purchase education for their children bypresenting these vouchers to the appropriate authority (Friedman, 1962;Kirkpatrick, 1990).  Vouchers inject choice and competition into thepublic education system, which, it is thought, will overcome thedisadvantages of the present near-monopoly situation.  The funds forthese vouchers would be provided by taxation, just as the governmentschool system is presently funded by taxation, except that parentswould have some power to decide where the tax proceeds flow.<p>	While the use of vouchers would trigger markets, and would cause theprice of education to decrease while improving quality of service,vouchers are only a half-way measure because they ignore somefundamental issues, such as whether government should be in thebusiness of providing education in the first place.<p>	This paper explores the possibility of privatizing educationand attempts to answer questions such as:</p>	<ul>	<p>	<li>How would education be funded if government didn't do it?	</p>	<p>	<li>How would a privately funded education system provide for those who	couldn't pay?	</p></ul><center><h3>1.0  The Problem With Government Education</h3></center><p>	There are many problems with government-provided education.  Itcan be a means to indoctrinate rather than teach.  Indeed, one of themain reasons why John Dewey and others pushed for a free system ofgovernment schools in the USA was so that the children of immigrantscould be indoctrinated with American values. Plato, Hitler, Mussolini,King Frederick William I of Prussia and others favored education as ameans of instilling loyalty to the state.  John Calvin Martin Lutherand others have urged that the school be used to indoctrinate childrenwith certain religious values (Richman, 1994; Plato; West, 1970;Spring, 1983). Modern attempts at indoctrination take different forms,such as culturally diverse curriculums and the adoption of textbooksthat are politically correct.<p>	Some parents would like to indoctrinate their children with certainvalues, so it cannot be said that all indoctrination is bad per se. Such judgments are subjective.  Different consumers have differentvalues and preferences. Problems arise when the schools indoctrinatechildren with values that their parents do not approve of.  But in agovernment monopoly school situation, parents have little choice but toaccept whatever programs the local school offers because there are noother options.<p>	Because government schools are free, they maintain a near-monopolyposition, making it difficult or impossible for private educationalinstitutions to compete. Education monopolies are not any differentthan other monopolies.  They have the same attributes that mostmonopolies have -- high cost and low quality. In Newark, New Jersey,for example, it costs about $10,000 to educate one high school studentin the inner-city for a year, whereas private schools in Newark can doa better job for about half as much.  Many graduates of Newark's highschools are barely literate.  Yet the government school system allowsthem to graduate anyway.  And Newark is not a special case.  The samecould be said for many inner-city government schools (Boaz, 1991).<p>	If educational consumers have no options regarding where tosend their children, what incentive is there for schools to providehigh quality education?  What incentive is there to cut costs iftaxpayers are picking up the tab anyway and they cannot take theirbusiness elsewhere?<p>	Government educational systems have a tendency to become bloated inthe absence of market forces.  The New York City school system, forexample, has more administrators than it has teachers.  Privateschools, on the other hand, run a much leaner program.  Many Catholicgrade schools, for example, may have just a principal and one or twoadministrators.<p>	Government education can be, and often is, a one-size-fits-allsystem, which must necessarily lead to suboptimal results.  Programsare more or less standardized.  Decisions regarding what to offer andwhat policies to adopt are made politically, by bureaucrats andpoliticians, rather than by consumers and entrepreneurs. There are notmany options.  Parents generally must send their children to the schoolthat is geographically closest to their home.  They are not free toshop around for the school that offers the best mix of offerings andpolicies according to their own subjective preferences.  Indeed, mostgovernment schools offer similar or identical programs, although thequality of those programs tends to be better in the suburbs than in theinner city.<p>	Below is a partial list of the choices educational consumerswould have under a private system:</p><ul>		<li>Length of school day: 5 hours; 6 hours; 8 hours; 9 hours	<li> Length of school year: 183 days; 200 days; 240 days	<li>Saturday classes or not	<li>Sports programs: strong programs; weak programs; no programs	<li>Emphasis on academics; emphasis on socialization	<li>Course offerings: many electives; few electives	<li>Should schools be co-ed or should boys and girls go to separate	schools?	<li>Should the schools provide condoms?	<li>Should children from outside the neighborhood be bused in or out to	achieve some sort  of racial balance?	<li>Should admission criteria be different for different ethnic and	racial groups?	<li>Should school employees be hired or promoted partially on the basis	of race or ethnic  background (affirmative action)?	<li>What should graduation requirements be?	<li>Should school officials be able to expel disruptive students?	<li>Who determines which textbooks are used?

Of course, if the school day or school year isincreased in length, the cost of providing the education would alsolikely increase. Criticisms have been made of the school system in theUSA because children in government schools have classes about 183 daysa year, whereas children in other countries go to school 200 days ayear or more.  Parents don't have any options about the time theirchildren spend in school. That choice is taken from them by the localbureaucrats or government officials.  Under a private system, parentswould likely have more options.<p>	Some parents have strong preferences about the kind of education theywant their children to receive.  The problem is, they don't all havethe same preferences. Some parents would prefer to send their childrento a school that has a strong academic program, one that emphasizesmath, science or languages and prepares their children for college. Others would rather send their children to a school that places moreemphasis on socialization or that teaches a trade.  Some parents prefera school that hammers western civilization into their children's heads. Others prefer a curriculum that includes exposure to diverse cultures.Some parents would like to have their children exposed to gay andlesbian lifestyles, and have condoms distributed free to students,while other parents abhor the very idea.  Some parents want theirchildren to be exposed to religion in school and others think thatreligion be best taught at home (or not at all).<p>	Because of various accreditation standards, laws and regulations, itis often not possible to hire the best teachers.  For example, ifsomeone wants to learn a language, it may be best to have a teacher whois a native speaker of that language.  But schools are pressured tohire people who have taken the requisite number of courses even if theybarely know how to speak the language.  And because the supply ofqualified teachers is artificially pinched as a result of these rules,the cost of the teacher you can get is higher than would be the case ina free market.  A recent college graduate who took a few Spanishcourses would cost more, and would know less Spanish, than an immigrantfrom a Spanish-speaking country.  Yet accreditors would prefer that aschool hire the college graduate even though he or she is lessqualified than the native speaker.  Thomas Edison would not be able toget a job teaching high school science under present accreditationrules because he never graduated from grade school.<p>	A totally privatized system would find ways to deal with theseblockages to market entry.  Schools would be free to hire the bestpeople they could afford without regard to arbitrary regulatoryrestraints.  A privatized system would also offer more options than agovernment school system.  From the above list of more than two dozenoptions and preferences, it is obvious that it is highly improbablethat most parents would be able to find a government school that offersall of their preferred options.  Government schools tend to offerstandardized curricula and uniform standards.  Private schools, on theother hand, could cater to a particular segment of the market that hasspecific preferences.<p>	The problem with any democracy, even where elected officialsand unelected bureaucrats actually serve the needs of the majority--which is not always the case -- is that some minority -- perhaps ashigh as 49 percent -- must settle for something less than what theyprefer because the majority rules.  In a privatized, competitivesystem, what the majority wants becomes less relevant because consumershave more choices.  If 51 percent of all parents in some localcommunity want to send their children to a school that emphasizessocialization, political correctness and free condoms over strongacademics, western civilization and prayer, the other 49 percent arestill free to send their children to a school that offers differentpreferences.  In a one-size-fits-all government system, the 49 percentmust either be content to send their children to a suboptimalgovernment school, or pay to send their children to a private schoolwhile continuing to pay taxes to support the government school systemthat they do not want to use.</p><center><h3>2.0  The Voucher Solution </h3></center><h4>2.1  The Benefits of Vouchers</h4><p>	The main benefit of vouchers is that they serve to break-up, orat least water down, the government school monopoly (Coons andSugarman, 1978).  Even where vouchers may only be used to pay forgovernment schools, vouchers allow market forces to operate, thusinjecting a degree of competition where none previously existed. Voucher systems that allow their use for private schools do an evenbetter job of breaking up the government school monopoly because itgives educational consumers the opportunity to send their children toprivate schools, an option they could not always afford withoutvouchers.<p>	Thus, some voucher systems are better than others.  A vouchersystem that permits parents to use vouchers only for government schoolsis an improvement over the present system because any kind of vouchersystem injects some choice and competition into the education industry. Having some options is better than not having any options.  But asystem that allows vouchers to be used only for government schools isinferior to one that allows parents to use vouchers for any school oftheir choice because the government-school-only approach limits bothchoice and competition.<p>	Numerous papers and several books have been written about variousvoucher systems.  The purpose of this paper is not to summarizeprevious work, or to suggest a new and improved version of the vouchersystem.  The remainder of this paper will summarize the deficienciesinherent in any voucher system, and will explore options for providingeducation without any government involvement.	<h4>2.2  The Problems With Vouchers </h4><p>	The main problem with vouchers is that they are paid for out oftax funds. Taxpayers are forced to pay for the education of otherpeople's children.  Tax supported education is really just a form ofspecial interest legislation, since the general public (taxpayers) areforced to pay for benefits received by a minority of the population(those who have children in government schools).  At any particulartime, there are more people paying taxes to support government schoolsthan there are users of government schools.  Thus, there is an inherentdegree of unfairness in any tax-supported educational system becausepeople who do not utilize the service are forced to pay for it.<p>	Another problem with vouchers is that it does not cut off governmentinvolvement.  Where government pays the bill, it also regulates(Lieberman, 1989; Richman, 1994; Lee, 1986).  There is nothing toprevent legislators or government bureaucrats from setting standardsthat schools must meet in order to qualify for vouchers.  If thestandards are good ones, standard setting would not be a problem.  Butthe history of regulation, in the USA at least, is full of exampleswhere regulators have made things worse rather than better (Howard,1994).  Not only is there no guarantee that government involvementwould improve things, there is a high probability that governmentinvolvement would make things worse.  While the market does not alwaysoperate perfectly, there is much evidence to show that government doesnot do a good job of serving taxpayers in the field of education.  Oneneed only look at the history of the last few decades to see increasingcosts of government schools and declining test scores (Bennett andJohnson, 1981; Richman, 1994; Gatto, 1992).  Literacy rates in the USAwere actually higher in the mid-1800s, before the advent of publicschools, than they are today in many communities (Gatto, 1992; Richman,1994).<center><h3>3.0  Financing a Totally Private System</h3></center><h4>3.1  Financing Education Without Government</h4><p>	The main question to be answered is how a totally private educationalsystem can be financed if there is no government involvement.  Theobvious answer is user fees.  Those who use the service should be theones who pay for it.  The user fee approach is the only moral solution,because it is the only one that does not rely on force.  Under anyother system, education is paid for by taxes, which involves theforcible transfer of property from those who own it to those who don't.<p>	Unfortunately, most economists and other policymakers do nothold moral solutions in high regard when it comes to financing specialinterest programs such as education.  They quickly give up the highmoral ground by debating the merits of various second-best solutions,such as whether education could best be financed by property taxes,income taxes or sales taxes, or which mix of the various coercive formsof financing is optimal in a given situation.  They start from thepremise that some form of taxation is needed to finance education.<p>	User fees would probably be the main source of financing a totallyprivate educational system.  But it need not be the only one.  Privatebusinesses might also pay for part of the cost through voluntarycontributions.  Schools could solicit funds from corporations, andcorporations could set aside part of their earnings to support schools. Many corporations already have a policy of giving a portion of theirprofits to good causes.  All they would have to do is add education totheir list of potential recipients.  Many corporations already give toeducational institutions, although much corporate giving is presentlyrestricted to colleges and universities.  Corporate charity could beexpanded or shifted to provide for primary and secondary schools in theneighborhoods where its employees live.<p>	Corporations could include education as a fringe benefit in oneway or another. Large corporations could sponsor their own school,which would be available to the children of employees.  It wouldprobably cost a medium-sized or large corporation less money to fundits own school than to pay local property taxes. Corporations couldalso offer their own tuition vouchers as a fringe benefit to employees. Corporations that have a sufficient number of employees could havetheir own school on corporate premises.  They could provide a freeeducation for the children of employees and could admit the children ofnonemployees if their parents could pay the requisite fee.  Smallerbusinesses that cannot afford to have their own school for employees'children could pool their resources, just like small businesses now dofor health care coverage.<p>	The schools themselves could generate some of the revenue theyneed by providing services.  Some private schools rent out theirclassrooms at night to various community groups.  The Learning Annex inNew York City, for example, rents space several evenings a week from alocal Catholic high school so that it can run its adult educationprograms.  Private schools can also run their own adult educationprograms to help defray the cost of their daytime program.  Studentscan hold bake sales or walkathons to raise money for books or schooltrips.  The number of money-generating activities is limited only bythe creativity of the school's employees and students.<p>	The USA has a history of strong private religious education inspite of the near monopoly position of government schools.  Althoughtheir importance has dwindled over time, many Catholic primary schoolsstill provide a free or low-cost education to children in thecommunity.  In some cases, parents are asked to pay some nominalmonthly fees.  In other cases, the education is completely paid for bythe individual church, which holds summer festivals and weekly bingo todefray the cost.  Discounts are offered to large families. Scholarships are given to needy students.  In many cases, schools areable to provide  religious education whether students are able to payor not. Other religious groups also have their own schools.<p>	Religious high schools also exist.  These schools usually charge sometuition. Part of the cost of obtaining a religious high schooleducation is often defrayed by the local religious group.  In the caseof some Catholic high schools, for instance, each parish is assessed acertain fee for each of its students who attend a Catholic high school. The diocese also pays part of the cost of the school system.  Thetotal cost of providing a religious school education, at whateverlevel, if often far less than the cost of a government schooleducation.  In many cases, the cost is about half (Fitzgerald, 1988).<p>	An often overlooked option is home schooling.  More than 300,000students in the USA are educated at home by their parents (Richman,1994).  An extensive network of homeschoolers has evolved through themarket process to provide information about home schooling andeducational materials for a wide range of subjects. One of the moreprominent products of home schooling is Sandra Day O'Connor, a justiceon the U.S. Supreme Court.<p>	Home schooling can take many forms.  The simplest form involvesone parent (usually the mother) teaching one or more of her ownchildren in her home.  But, in the absence of government interventionand regulation, there would be nothing to prevent one of theneighborhood moms from taking in a few of her friend's children andeducating them as well.  Home schooling is an attractive option from apublic finance perspective because there is no "public" financeinvolved.<p>	While some home schools are better than others, the same can besaid for any other school.  Many products of home schooling receive abetter education than their government school counterparts, partlybecause of the flexibility and choice their parents have in determiningtheir curriculum and partly because home schooling includes much closerparental involvement and participation than is possible to receive in agovernment school.	<h4>3.2  What About the Poor?</h4><p>	Another important question is how would students from poor families beable to obtain an education if their parents could not afford to payfor a private school and there were no government funding available? At the philosophical level, this question is a non sequitur.  Ineffect, it could be re-worded to say: Poor people can't afford aprivate education, therefore, someone must be forced to pay for one forthem.  Of course, it does not follow that one person or group should beforced to pay for the education of someone who cannot afford it.  Yetthis presumption is usually implicit in any argument in favor ofgovernment schools in spite of its moral bankruptcy.<p>	Those who have no qualms about taking morally bankrupt positions suchas this insist on utilitarian-based answers.  Fortunately, the historyof private school financing offers some solutions.  As was previouslymentioned, religious schools have traditionally admitted studentswhether they could pay or not.  Many religious schools offer theirprograms at little or no cost to the student, and provide scholarshipsfor those who cannot pay.<p>	One criticism that can be raised at this point is "What aboutnonreligious students?  While religious schools may be able to providefor their own, what about students who do not have a religiouspreference?  Who will provide for them?"  For one thing, many religiousschools will admit students regardless of religious preference.  Buteven if they don't, it does not follow that someone else must be forcedto pay for the education of these students.  Nonreligious students canstill go to nonreligious private schools.  Their parents can paytuition.  They can obtain scholarships or receive charity.<p>	Furthermore, if all education were private -- if the governmentschool monopoly were broken -- the cost of education would be much lessand the quality would be higher.  Poor students who attend privateschools would be getting a better education than they could havereceived in many government schools, and the cost of providing thateducation would be much less.  If the cost of a private education couldbe cut in half, which seems likely (Fitzgerald, 1988), and taxes couldbe reduced, most parents even of modest means would be able to sendtheir children to a private school.<p>	If, for some reason, some school-age children did not attend school,they may not be any worse off than if they attended a government schoolin the inner city.  Many high school graduates of inner-city schoolscannot read well enough to fill out an employment application form(Blumenfeld, 1988).  How much worse off would they be if they droppedout of formal education and got an entry-level job that would give themthe opportunity to learn some job skills? A good on-the-job trainingprogram may be more beneficial for them than a government school thathas drug and violence problems yet cannot teach its students to read.<p>	If taxpayers did not have to pay thousands of dollars in property,income and sales taxes each year to pay for government schools, most ofthem could afford to send their children to a private school.  Theywould also have more money available to contribute to educationalcharities.  Thus, the pool of funds available for scholarships wouldincrease.  The schools themselves could also provide scholarships. Private schools currently provide scholarships based on either need ormerit.  There is no reason to expect that this situation would changeunder a totally privatized system.  The provision of scholarships mighteven increase as a larger number of private schools have to compete fora small pool of good students.<p>	The argument has been made that living off charity is demeaning. Students who have their education financed through charity are thoughtto be psychologically burdened because of the perception that they arefreeloaders.  Regardless of whether such students are actuallyfreeloaders or not, isn't it better that their educations be financedby voluntary means -- charity -- rather than by the force ofgovernment, which extracts taxes from the general public?  Isn't itbetter to have your education paid for by voluntary contributions thanwith money that is confiscated from taxpayers?  Noncoercive solutionsare better than coercive ones, and charity is noncoercive, whereastaxation is coercive.  Thus, charity is always morally superior totaxation as a means to finance any worthwhile program.</p><center><h3>4.0  Summary and Conclusion</h3></center>	<p>	<li>Private education costs about half as much as government	education.	</p>	<p>	<li>Taxpayers would save thousands of dollars a year in property, income	and sales taxes if the government school system were abolished.	 </p>		<p>	 <li>They could then spend the thousands of dollars they save on private	education or other goods and services and charities of their	choice.	</p>		<p>	<li>The quality of private education is higher than that of government	school education.	</p>		<p>	<li>Educational consumers would have more choices under a totally	private system.

Private education isto be preferred to government education because it is better andcheaper.  But the real issue is not utilitarian but moral.  If therewere a total separation of education and state, the general public(taxpayers) would not be forced to pay for the education of a specialinterest group (students).  Those who receive the benefits would alsopay for the benefits or, in the case of charity, would have thebenefits provided to them in a noncoercive manner.  Property would nolonger be confiscated for the purpose of providing a governmenteducation.<p>	Not only is it possible to totally remove government from theprovision of education, it is also the only moral solution, since it isthe only solution that does not involve coercion.</p>	<hr><h4>References</h4><ol><li>Albon, Robert and Greg Lindsay, editors (1984).

Introduction</h4><p>	<a name="aa">Antidumping laws, which penalize or prohibit foreignproducers from selling their products in domestic markets for less thanthe cost of production or for less than the price they charge in theirhome market (Dolan and Lindsey, 1994), have been around for severalgenerations in one form or another.  In the United States, one of theearliest antidumping laws was included in the Revenue Act of 1916(Knoll, 1987),<a href="#1">[1]</a> although some authors (Dale, 1980)point out that the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Wilson Tariff Act of1894 could have been applied to antidumping situations.<p>	<a name="bb">Although more antidumping investigations havebeen initiated in the United States than in most other nations, therest of the world is catching up (Boltuck and Litan, 1991; Messerlin,1990; Nivola, 1993; Horlick, 1993).  In recent years, more countrieshave adopted antidumping laws of their own, and they have stepped upthe pace of initiating antidumping investigations.  The recentlyconcluded Uruguay Round, rather than abolishing antidumping laws,<ahref="#2">[2]</a> strengthened them (Uruguay, 1993).  In 1992, morethan 40 countries had antidumping laws (Schott, 1994).  More than 120countries took part in the Uruguay Round negotiations, which adoptednew antidumping rules. Presumably most, if not all, of the GATTsignatories will use these antidumping laws to a certain extent.  Andsince the Uruguay Round reduced tariffs and repealed most quotas, theantidumping laws will rise in importance over time, since they are nowthe most powerful tool that protectionists can use to keep out foreignproducts. 	<h4>II. Theoretical and Practical Problems with All	Antidumping Laws</h4><p>	One of the main theoretical problems with all antidumping lawsis the premise that antidumping laws can remedy situations where thereis unfair trade (Nivola, 1993).  But where individuals --willingbuyers and willing sellers --are able to trade what they have for whatthey want at a mutually agreed upon price, there can be no unfairtrade.  Unfair trade can occur only where willing buyers and willingsellers are not free to make deals without price, quantity or otherrestraints (Bovard, 1991; McGee, 1994).  "Fair" trade has come to mean"the right to protection" (Finger, 1991; Salvatore, 1993).	<p>	One of the main arguments that has been put forth to justifyantidumping laws is that they prevent predatory pricing (Boltuck andLitan, 1991; Kenen, 1994). Yet anyone familiar with the antitrustliterature over the past few decades would find this to be a curiousargument, indeed, since studies show that predatory pricing either doesnot exist, or if it does, it benefits consumers (Armentano, 1986, 1990;Koller, 1971; J. McGee, 1958; R. McGee, 1991; Nivola, 1993), which theantitrust laws are supposed to do anyway.  Bovard (1991) points outthat there are no known cases in the last hundred years where a companyhas dumped its products on the U. S. market, bankrupted domesticproducers, then driven up prices and squeezed consumers for a longperiod of time.	<p>	Any antidumping law encourages foreign suppliers to increasetheir prices, since by doing so it may be possible to avoid triggeringan antidumping action. The mere threat of an antidumping action chillsprice competition, since foreign suppliers will hesitate to compete tooaggressively on price for fear of triggering an antidumpinginvestigation.  But no matter how hard they try to avoid such anaction, they are not able to totally eliminate the possibility of anantidumping investigation even if they sell their product for the sameprice worldwide.	<p>	The existence of antidumping laws also makes it possible for domesticproducers to charge higher prices than would otherwise be possible.That's because antidumping laws make it dangerous for foreigncompetitors to engage in aggressive price competition.  As a result,domestic producers can raise their prices with little fear of beingunderpriced by foreign suppliers.	<p>	Any antidumping law is inherently protectionist because suchlaws benefit domestic producers at the expense of consumers by limitingforeign competition. There is no way to structure an antidumping lawthat is not protectionist. Discussions and debates about howantidumping laws should be changed, amended or reformed are thereforesenseless.  Yet the new rules adopted in the Uruguay Round attempted todo just that.	<p>	There are also a number of practical problems with antidumpinglaws.  The basic problem is trying to determine when dumping hasoccurred.  The rules are not at all clear and there is much room tomaneuver.  Exchange rate shifts can subject companies to penalty evenwhere the same price is charged worldwide. Computing the cost ofproduction involves many problems under both the new and old rules. Which foreign market prices to compare with which domestic prices canalso be a problem, especially when the products being compared are onlysimilar but not identical.  Numerous antidumping actions have comparedprices of dissimilar products.  Sometimes these price comparisons takeaccount of the differences and sometimes they don't.  Price comparisonsinvolving different markets are also not always good matches.  Whetherto classify certain costs as direct or indirect is not always clear,and the application of the allocation rules is not always consistent.Volume discounts and custom orders have not always been considered andthe methodology the Commerce Department uses to compare foreign anddomestic prices results in a consistent bias that tends to increasedumping margins (McGee, 1993). 	<h4>III.  The New Antidumping Rules</h4><p>	<a name="cc">The antidumping provision incorporated in the UruguayRound GATT agreement, if not repealed very soon, will restrict andregulate trade well into the next century.  While the new antidumpingrules have made some procedural improvements over existing rules, theyhave done little or nothing to alleviate the "process protectionism"that is inherent in all antidumping laws.<a href="#3">[3]</a>Overzealous bureaucrats or domestic producers in need of protection canstill use these laws to the detriment of the general public, althoughit may now cost them a little bit more to do so.<p>	While some industries will find it easier to find import reliefunder the new rules, others will find relief more difficult. Somecommentators think that the overall effect of the new antidumping ruleson the ability to obtain import relief will not be much different thanunder the old rules.  But there is really nothing in the new rules toprevent domestic producers from abusing the antidumping laws torestrict competition.	<p>	The new antidumping rules add a layer of arbitrary rules to theexisting framework.  The standards for the review of disputes, thesales-below-cost test and the cumulation rules draw heavily on EU andUS practices.  One important change is in the computation of dumpingmargins.	<p>	Profits, administrative and selling costs would be based onactual data pertaining to production and sales in the ordinary courseof trade if such data is available.  If not available, figures shouldbe based on actual data from producers or exporters of similarproducts, the weighted average of other exporters' profits and costsfor the same product, or any other reasonable method.  This "any otherreasonable method" gives bureaucrats a great deal of flexibility (andopportunity for abuse), since some methods used in the past that havebeen criticized have been considered by the government to bereasonable.	<p>	The effect that the new antidumping rules will have on dumpingmargins and injury determinations is unclear.  On the one hand, marginscould be reduced if the calculation is based on a comparison of theweighted-average normal value home market price to the weighted averageof all comparable export prices, or comparing transaction totransaction.  But the new rules could also cause dumping margins to behigher than before.  The U.S. rule required constructed value toinclude an 8 percent profit margin plus 10 percent overhead.  While thenew rules arguably eliminate this requirement, there is apparentlynothing to prevent domestic producers in the U.S. from arguing thatthese calculations should continue to be used where it is the bestinformation available.  Using the EU's approach of ignoringthird-country or home country sales when they are below cost and basingthe profit percentage only on profitable sales could cause dumpingmargins to actually be higher than those that would result under theold U.S. 8 percent and 10 percent rules.  There is a new rule fordetermining costs for start-up operations but it is unclear how thisrule will affect practice and the determination of dumping margins.	<p>	Dumping margins could be doubled in cases where the exporterand importer are related.  That's because the new rules adopt thepractice followed by the EU whereby dumping duty deposits aresubtracted from the export price.  Thus, the difference between theexport price and the normal value increases, as does the dumpingmargin.  But dumping duties do not have to be deducted from the exportprice if there is conclusive evidence that certain changes arereflected in later selling prices. Commentators think that this rulewill increase dumping margins.	<p>	In the event that only some exporters are examined, the dumpingmargin from firms that are not examined will be the weighted average ofthe margin established for those exporters that are examined.  Zeromargins, de minimis margins and margins computed on the bestinformation available (BIA) are excluded from the computation.  Thefact that BIA is excluded will tend to reduce the margin, since BIAusually consists of inaccurate, inflated information supplied by thedomestic producers, who have a vested interest in seeing that themargin is as high as possible.	<p>	The new rules require the magnitude of the dumping margin to beconsidered when determining injury.  Previously, in the USA at least,the International Trade Commission generally only considered the volumeof imports without regard to the dumping margin, although some ITCcommissioners have stated that they have the authority to look at themagnitude of the dumping margin as well.  The effect of this new ruleis unclear, although it appears that it might make it more difficultfor domestic producers to convince the authorities that they have beeninjured if the dumping margin is small.	<p>	The new GATT rules add some de minimis parameters.  Cases willbe terminated where the dumping margin is determined to be less than 2percent of the export price, which is four times as high as the U.S.Department of Commerce's 0.5 percent rule.  Another rule wouldterminate an antidumping action if the imports in question for aparticular country are less than 3 percent of the importing country'stotal like-kind imports.  However, if the total imports from countriesaccused of dumping total more than 7 percent, the dumping investigationmay not be terminated even if the amount from any particular country isless than 3 percent.  While some commentators say that this provisionwill reduce the abuse that now exists when domestic producers are ableto aim the antidumping weapon at foreign competitors, it is unclear howmuch abuse will be reduced.  That is because antidumping margins arenot computed until well into the investigation, after mountains ofstatistics, sales and cost data are gathered by the target of theinvestigation.  The cost and hassle of providing this information muststill be borne even if the investigation is later terminated becausethe dumping margin is deemed to be de minimis.	<p>	The new rules have a provision that places qualifications on who mayfile a petition.  Previously, the U.S. Commerce Department assumed thata petition filed by a particular domestic producer was filed on behalfof the industry unless most members of the industry objected.  Now,dumping petitions must actually be filed "on behalf of" an industry. The relevant national authority must now, presumably, determine theamount of industry support for the petition, which has the effect ofincreasing the petitioner's burden, since petitioners must now get thesupport of at least 25 percent of their industry. Otherwise, theinvestigation cannot be initiated.  Previously, all that was needed toinitiate an antidumping investigation in the USA was a letter from anydomestic producer to the Commerce Department.	<p>	How much of a burden it will be to get 25 percent of an industry toco-operate is unclear.  This provision will give domestic producers invarious industries an excuse to collude in order to knock foreigncompetitors out of the domestic market.  It is not inconceivable thatone domestic producer will merely ask other domestic producers to signa joint letter asking the U.S. Commerce Department to investigate somegroup of foreign competitors for dumping.	<p>	A sunset provision requires that antidumping duties will beterminated five years after they are imposed, or five years after thelast sunset review, unless it is determined that the expiration of theduty would be likely to lead to a recurrence or a continuation of thedumping and injury.  Exactly how this will work or how it will bedetermined whether the dumping duties should be continued are unclear.Those who say that adding a sunset provision will reduce current abuseshave not been able to put forth strong arguments to support theirposition. Although a sunset provision may reduce abuses in some cases,it is far from clear that the effect will be dramatic, since the sunsetprovision can be overridden if it looks like dumping may resume at theend of the sunset period. Besides, much of the abuse that occurs withthe antidumping laws takes place long before the sunset date.	<p>	The new antidumping rules add levels of bureaucracy and complexity,and adopt practices that have a tendency to inflate antidumpingmargins.  It will also be more difficult to ignore or appeal an adverseruling through the World Trade Organization dispute settlement process.There is nothing in the new rules to reduce the amount of abuse thathas been going on for years.  In fact, as the number of countries thatadopt antidumping laws increases, it is likely that abuses willincrease, as the antidumping weapon becomes available to domesticproducers in more countries.  The many ambiguities in the law will alsoincrease the number of trade disputes, at least until the ambiguitiesare clarified. 		<h4>IV.  Human Rights Violations</h4>	<p>	Although the economic arguments that have been put forth in favor ofantidumping laws do not hold up under analysis, the real problem withall antidumping laws is not economic, but moral.  The only legitimatefunction of government is to protect life, liberty and property(Nozick, 1974). Governments that go beyond this basic function must,necessarily, violate human rights because they feather the nests ofsome special interest at the expense of the general public (Jouvenel,1952; McGee, 1994; Bastiat, 1968).  Yet the human rights aspect oftrade regulation is almost never mentioned by commentators.	<p>	Perhaps the reason why the human rights aspect of trade isnever mentioned is because most commentators do not see that there is ahuman rights element. Yet the human rights element is inescapable.  Asfar back as 1690, John Locke pointed out that the body is property, andthat the fruits of one's labor are mere extensions of the body (Locke,1986).  If individuals are not able to trade the fruits of their laborwithout restriction, their property rights -- their human rights -- arebeing violated.  Yet that is exactly what happens when some governmentrestricts peoples' ability to buy and sell, either through antidumpinglaws or with quotas, domestic content laws or other trade barriers.	<p>	Antidumping laws are weapons used by domestic producers topunish foreign competitors.  The mere threat of an antidumping actionplaces a chilling effect on trade and forces foreign producers to raisetheir prices lest they be punished for offering their products todomestic consumers for low prices.	<p>	Those who support the concept of antidumping laws either consciouslytake the position of special interests against that of the generalpublic, or merely fail to distinguish the difference between competinginterests and competing rights (Curtis 1994).  Domestic producers andforeign producers who want to sell in the domestic market havecompeting interests.  If a foreign producer makes a sale in thedomestic market, it is likely at the expense of a domestic producer,who loses a sale.  It is a zero-sum game, since one's gain is theother's loss.	<p>	But there is no such thing as a zero-sum game when it comes torights. Rights, properly understood, can never conflict.  A foreignproducer who makes a sale in the domestic market does not violate therights of some domestic producer to make the sale because domesticproducers are not entitled to sell to consumers who would rather buyfrom a foreign producer. Domestic producers have no claim, no propertyright, to the incomes of domestic consumers.  Using the antidumpinglaws to limit consumer choices or to force them to pay higher prices asa condition of doing business is immoral and a violation of humanrights.  Forcing consumers to pay higher prices is like stealing theirlabor, since they must work more hours to earn the money to pay thehigher prices that result from antidumping laws. 	<h4>V.  The Solution</h4><p>	As the twenty-first century approaches, antidumping laws seem tobe gaining ground.  More nations are adopting them, and the nationsthat have adopted them are using them more frequently (Schott, 1994). Yet, as was shown, all antidumping laws violate human rights.  Theyalso reduce overall welfare, since the losses exceed the gains (McGee,1993). The only solution, then, is to abolish these laws.  Those whoadvocate merely reforming the antidumping laws are speaking gibberish. In effect, they are taking the position that human rights violationsand deadweight losses should be allowed to continue as long as therules of the game are refined.	<p>	Rules that allow human rights violations to continue should berepealed.  The only way to avoid human rights abuses in the area oftrade is to allow individuals to trade what they have for what theywant without restriction. Any antidumping law, no matter how wellformulated, that prevents individuals from entering into contracts,associating with the sellers of their choice, and trading theirproperty as they see fit, violates basic human rights.  Thus, allantidumping laws must be repealed, the sooner the better.</p><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>Revenue Act of 1916, chap. 463, §§ 800-1, 39 Stat. 798,	codified at 15 U.S.C. §72.		<a href="#aa">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>For an exposition on the case to abolish antidumping	laws, see McGee, 1993.		<a href="#bb">Return</a><p><a name="3"><li>Much of the material relating to the Uruguay Round	antidumping law changes was taken from  Cobb 1994, Kamarck	1994, Palmeter 1995, Schott 1994, and the U.S. General Accounting	Office 1994.		<a href="#cc">Return</a></ol><hr><h4>References</h4><p>Armentano, Dominick T., Antitrust and Monopoly: Anatomy of a PolicyFailure, second edition, New York: Holmes and Meier, 1990.<p>Armentano, Dominick T., Antitrust Policy: The Case for Repeal,Washington, DC: Cato Institute, 1986.<p>Bastiat, Frederic, The Law, Irvington-on-Hudson, NY: Foundation forEconomic Education, 1968.<p>Boltuck, Richard and Litan, Robert E., editors, Down in the Dumps:Administration of the Unfair Trade Laws, Washington, DC: BrookingsInstitution, 1991.<p>Bovard, James, The Fair Trade Fraud, New York: St. Martin's Press,1991.<p>Cobb, Joe, A Guide to the New GATT Agreement, Heritage FoundationBackgrounder No. 985, May 5, 1994.<p>Curtis, Philip J., The Fall of the U.S. Consumer Electronics Industry:An American Trade Tragedy, Westport, CT: Quorum Books, 1994.<p>Dale, Richard, Anti-dumping Law in a Liberal Trade Order, New York: St.Martin's Press, 1980.<p>Dolan, Edwin G. and Lindsey, David E., Economics, seventh edition,Orlando: Harcourt Brace College Publishers, 1994.<p>Finger, J.M., The Meaning of "Unfair" in U.S. Import Policy, World BankWorking Paper, WPS 745, July, 1991.<p>Horlick, Gary N., How the GATT Became Protectionist, Journal of WorldTrade, 27, October, 1993, pp. 5-17<p>Jouvenel, Bertrand de, The Ethics of Redistribution, Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1952.<p>Kamarck, Lynn, Uruguay Round Agreement Makes Substantial Changes ToAntidumping Code, East Asian Executive Reports, 16, March 15, 1994, pp.6, 15-18.<p>Kenen, Peter B., The International Economy, third edition, Cambridge:Cambridge University Press, 1994.<p>Knoll, Michael S., United States Antidumping Law: The Case forReconsideration, Texas International Law Journal, 22, 1987, pp.265-290.<p>Koller, Ronald H., The Myth of Predatory Pricing: An Empirical Study,Antitrust Law and Economics Review, 4, Summer, 1971, pp. 105-123.<p>Locke, John, The Second Treatise on Civil Government, Buffalo:Prometheus Books, 1986.<p>McGee, John S., Predatory Price Cutting: The Standard Oil (N.J.)

McGee</h4></center><hr noshade><p>	The Uruguay Round of GATT was touted as a major advance for freetrade and a death blow for protectionists.  But a close analysis of theactual agreement reveals something far different.  Indeed, any tradeagreement that is more than 22,000 pages in length might lead one toquestion why an agreement that demolishes trade barriers has to be solong.<p>	While the new GATT agreement does reduce tariffs and eliminatesmost quotas, the long-phase out period in many cases guaranteesprotected markets for as long as a decade or more—and that means higherprices for consumers.  The tariffs that were abolished outright were onproducts that don't account for much trade anyway.  The"liberalization" of textile quotas is almost a joke.  Quotas werelifted immediately on products that accounted for only 16% of the totalvolume of 1990 imports.  Quotas on the remaining 84% of products willbe lifted over a ten-year phase-out period—17% after 3 years, 18% moreafter 4 more years, and the remaining 49% three years later, or tenyears after the GATT agreement was signed.<p>	For agriculture, nontariff barriers are converted into tariffs,which are then added to existing tariffs.  These tariffs are then cutby 6% a year for 6 years (or 24% over ten years in the case of adeveloping country).  But most import-sensitive products are subjectonly to a 15% reduction over six years.  New negotiations, which are tobegin by the year 2,000, could slow the pace of change.<p>	Tariffs on industrial products are reduced an average of 38%. The five-year phase-in started January 1, 1995.  But tariffs ontextiles and apparel will remain at above-average levels.<p>	Perhaps the most protectionist component of the new GATT roundis the expansion of antidumping laws.  Before GATT, only about 40countries had antidumping laws.  Now, all 123 signatories to the GATTagreement can use antidumping laws to punish foreign producers.<p>	The theory behind the antidumping laws is simple.  A foreign producerthat sells its product in a domestic market for less than the cost ofproduction can be found guilty of dumping.  Likewise, a foreignproducer that sells its product in the domestic market for a lowerprice than it sells for in some foreign market can also be found guiltyof dumping.  The reason for these rules is to prevent predatorypricing—the practice of selling far below cost with the intent ofdriving competitors out of business, then raising prices to recoupprior losses.<p>	The problem with this theory is that it never works that way inpractice.  Numerous studies over the past few decades have attempted tofind predatory pricing.  For the most part, they have found none.  Inthe few cases where predatory pricing might have existed, it alwaysbenefitted consumers, the group that is supposedly protected by theantitrust laws.<p>	Predatory pricing just doesn't make economic sense.  It isirrational.  That's why it doesn't exist.  Producers that try to drivetheir rivals out of business by selling below cost lose money on everysale.  As they gain market share, their losses accelerate.  Even ifthey are successful in driving every competitor out of the market, theonly way to keep them out is by keeping prices so low that newpotential competitors are not tempted to enter the market.<p>	That's not to say that companies never sell their productsbelow cost.  Sometimes they have to.  The fresh flower market is aperfect example.  We import fresh flowers from Latin America and Europein vast quantities.  They arrive fresh, but after some time they startto wilt.  When that happens, the flower mongers sell them for whateverthey can get.  It's better to sell a wilting flower for somethingrather than nothing.  But when they do sell at a deep discount, itlooks like they are dumping because they are selling below cost.  Yetselling below cost is the rational thing to do in this case, since thealternative is to throw the flowers away and get nothing for them.  Fordumping purposes, though, the Commerce Department treats a wiltingflower in New York as the equivalent of a fresh flower in Amsterdam. And since the wilting New York flower sells for less than a freshAmsterdam flower, the foreign producer is guilty of selling for lowerprices in the United States than in a foreign market, and is thusguilty of dumping, even though there was no predatory intent.<p>	The burden of proof in antidumping cases is much less than inantitrust cases involving a charge of predatory pricing.  Whereas in anantitrust case, the plaintiff must generally prove predatory intent, inan antidumping case the plaintiff (the Commerce Department) need onlyfind that the domestic price was lower than the price charged on someforeign market, or that the domestic price was lower than the cost ofproduction.<p>	Over the last decade or so, more than 90 percent of the antidumpingcases that were brought in the United States resulted in a finding ofdumping.  That's because it's easy to find at least a few cases wherethe foreign producer sold its product on some foreign market for morethan it charged in the U.S. market.  In fact, it's possible to be foundguilty of dumping even if the foreign producer charged the same pricein all markets, because of exchange rate fluctuations.  For example, ifa German producer makes something for 2DM in January, when the exchangerate is 2DM = $1, and sells it in the United States in June, when theexchange rate is 2DM = $0.90, it is selling below cost, since the costof production was $1 and the selling price in the domestic market wasonly $0.90.<p>	Foreign producers can be found guilty of dumping whenever theysell in the United States for less than the average worldwide sellingprice, too.  Let's say that a certain foreign product sells for a rangeof prices between $8 and $12, with the average price being $10.  Anyproducts sold in the United States for less than $10 are considereddumped, because the Commerce Department compares average foreign pricesto specific domestic prices.  Sales above $10 are ignored.  So if theaverage price in the United States is identical to the $10 averageworldwide price, about half of the sales in the United States will bebelow the average worldwide price, and thus subject to dumpingpenalties.<p>	From a consumer perspective, there is nothing wrong with dumping. Dumping, were it does exist, results in lower prices, which benefitsthe general public.  Yet the present antidumping laws, which are beingspread as the result of GATT, penalize foreign producers when they sellat low prices in domestic markets.  Thus, the law places a chillingeffect on price competition.  Foreign producers tend to keep theirprices high in order to avoid or minimize a charge of dumping.  Studieshave estimated that the antidumping laws cost U.S. consumers billionsof dollars each year.  The new GATT agreement not only did nothing tocorrect this situation, but made things worse by spreading theantidumping laws to the 123 countries that signed the GATT agreement. As other countries apply the antidumping laws, American companies willoften find themselves on the receiving end, since the United States isone of the largest exporters in the world.<p>	At best, antidumping laws benefit a few domestic producers atthe expense of the general public.  At worst, they can be used as aweapon against American companies that try to sell their productsabroad.  Antidumping laws merely protect consumers from low prices. Thus, they should not be reformed.  They should be abolished, thesooner the better.</p><hr><p>Nothing written here is to be construed as necessarily reflecting theviews of the Dumont Institute or as an attempt to aid or hinder thepassage of any bill before Congress.

Introduction</h4><p><a name="1r"><a name="2r"></p><p>	Most legal and political philosophers take the position thateven the most fundamental rights such as the freedom of speech, press,assembly, contract and association<a href="#1">[1]</a> are not absolutebut must be balanced<a href="#2">[2]</a> against other rights. Thispaper challenges that position by seriously addressing the issue ofwhether the freedom of association should be absolute.  But the paperdoes not dwell so much on the freedom of positive association--the rightto associate--as with the right of negative association--the right to notbe compelled to associate. Part II reviews the present state of the lawand discusses some recent cases that limit the freedom of negativeassociation and the legal reasoning behind each decision.  Part IIIdiscusses some philosophical issues, such as the purpose of government,the nature of rights, the public policy argument and the balancing ofrights argument.  Part IV concludes that the reasons given for limitingthe freedom of negative association do not hold up under analysisbecause the reasons for placing limitations on this basic right arebased on faulty premises. The author proposes a constitutionalamendment that would guarantee this precious freedom in a way that thepresent First Amendment does not.  The paper concludes by speculatingabout the practical benefits such an amendment would have on thegeneral population.<h4>II.  The Present State of the Law</h4><center><h4>A.  Overview</h4></center><p><a name="3r"><a name="4r"></p><p>	The freedom of association consists of two separate but relatedfreedoms--the right to associate with whomever you want and the right tonot associate with whomever you do not want.<a href="#3">[3]</a>  Inits broadest sense, the freedom of association also includes the rightto transact or not transact.<a href="#4">[4]</a>  Basically stated, thefreedom of association means that acts (including transactions) betweenconsenting adults should be legal and unrestricted. But it means morethan that, because such a right also includes the possibility of notacting with adults who do not consent.<p><a name="5r"><a name="6r"><a name="7r"></p><p><a name="8r"><a name="9r"></p><p>	At present, citizens (and residents) of the United States donot have this basic right fully protected.<a href="#5">[5]</a>  Whilecourts have determined that the freedom of association is protected bythe First Amendment, they have totally ignored the possibility that itmight also be protected by the Ninth<a href="#6">[6]</a> and TenthAmendments.<a href="#7">[7]</a> Indeed, the Ninth Amendment has becomepractically meaningless.<a href="#8">[8]</a>  The Tenth Amendment hasbeen all but ignored or emasculated almost to the point ofnonexistence.<a href="#9">[9]</a><p><a name="10r"><a name="11r"></p><p>	Numerous laws prevent consenting adults from associating ina number of ways. Consenting adults cannot engage in anal or oral sexin some jurisdictions without facing potentially severe penalties. Insome places, sex between individuals of the same sex is illegal. Dwarfscannot rent their bodies for tossing purposes.<a href="#10">[10]</a>Individuals cannot rent their bodies for purposes of prostitution orsurrogacy in many jurisdictions, nor can they sell body parts such asblood or organs.<a href="#11">[11]</a><p><a name="12r"><a name="13r"><a name="14r"></p><p><a name="15r"><a name="16r"></p><p>	The freedom of association includes the right not to associate<ahref="#12">[12]</a> if at least one adult is not consenting.<ahref="#13">[13]</a> This right is presently restricted in the UnitedStates in a number of ways. Affirmative action laws pressure employersinto hiring individuals on the basis of race, sex or ethnicbackground.<a href="#14">[14]</a> Restaurant owners must serve anyonewho walks in the door.<a href="#15">[15]</a>  All-male clubs mustsometimes admit women.<a href="#16">[16]</a><p><a name="17r"><a name="18r"><a name="19r"></p><p><a name="20r"><a name="21r"><a name="22r"></p><p>	There is also the problem of uneven enforcement of the law.All white fraternities at state universities<a href="#17">[17]</a> mayface being disbanded if they do not admit blacks, whereas blackfraternities and other all black campus groups face no such threat.<ahref="#18">[18]</a>  There is the feeling in some circles thatgovernment should force men's clubs to admit women, but women'sorganizations should not be forced to admit men.<a href="#19">[19]</a>This hypocrisy only exacerbates the problem of racial and sexualdisharmony because individuals get the distinct impression that thetreatment they receive is based on racial, sexual or ethnic backgroundrather than the content of their character.<a href="#20">[20]</a> It isbad enough when individuals discriminate in this fashion;<ahref="#21">[21]</a> it is intolerable when government does it.  Yetgovernment discriminates systematically in favor of some groups and atthe expense of others.<a href="#22">[22]</a><p><a name="23r"><a name="24r"><a name="25r"><a name="26r"><a name="27r"></p><p><a name="28r"><a name="29r"><a name="30r"><a name="31r"></p><p>	Governments feels justified in limiting the freedom of associationwhere there is a compelling state interest,<a href="#23">[23]</a> butmust restrict this right using the least restrictive measures inachieving its end.<a href="#24">[24]</a>  The law or regulationrestricting the freedom of association must not be overbroad.<ahref="#25">[25]</a>  Courts have ruled that certain activities orgroups such as adulterers,<a href="#26">[26]</a> gamblers,<ahref="#27">[27]</a> civics associations,<a href="#28">[28]</a> andhomosexuals,<a href="#29">[29]</a> are not protected by the FirstAmendment<a href="#30">[30]</a> freedom of association in some cases. Courts also have sometimes held that persons may not be forced toassociate.<a href="#31">[31]</a> </p><center><h4>B.  Private Clubs</h4></center><p><a name="32r"><a name="33r"><a name="34r"></p><p>	Traditionally, individuals have been able to join privateclubs that exclude certain categories of individuals on the basis ofrace, religion or sex without interference from the State.<ahref="#32">[32]</a>  This approach is in keeping with the belief thatindividuals should be able to associate with whomever they want andshould not be compelled to associate with people they don't want.However, this right has been eroded by several recent court cases.Courts now seem to look at the freedom of association either asexpressive association<a href="#33">[33]</a> or intimate association<ahref="#34">[34]</a> and employ a balancing test to determine whetherthe right should be constitutionally protected.<p><a name="35r"><a name="36r"></p><p>	In <i>Roberts v. United States Jaycees</i>,<a href="#35">[35]</a>theUnited States Jaycees, a national nonprofit membership organization(National), notified two of its local Minnesota chapters (Local) thattheir charters would be revoked because they admitted women tomembership, in violation of their bylaws, which limited fullmembership<a href="#36">[36]</a> to males between the ages of 18 and35.  Local then filed discrimination charges with the MinnesotaDepartment of Human Rights, claiming that the rule excluding women fromfull membership was in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act,which states that it is an unfair discriminatory practice:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="37r">	</p>	<p>		[t]o deny any person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods,	services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of a	place of public accommodation because of race, color, creed,	religion, disability, national origin or sex.<a href="#37">[37]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="38r"><a name="39r"></p><p>	Before the hearing, National sued state officials to preventenforcement of the law, claiming that forcing National to accept femalemembers would violate the male members' constitutional rights of freeassociation and speech.<a href="#38">[38]</a> National later alleged that the MinnesotaSupreme Court's interpretation of the law rendered itunconstitutionally vague and overbroad.<a href="#39">[39]</a><p><a name="40r"><a name="41r"><a name="42r"></p><p>	The United States Supreme Court held that the application ofthe Minnesota law to compel National to accept women members  did notabridge either the male members' freedom of expressive or intimateassociation.<a href="#40">[40]</a> The local chapters were neithersmall nor selective. They did not have rigid membership requirementsother than age (18 to 35) and sex (men only). Many of their mainactivities involved the participation of many nonmembers of both sexes.The local chapters lacked the distinctive characteristics that wouldhave afforded them constitutional protection in their decision toexclude women.<a href="#41">[41]</a>  The Court held that Minnesota hada compelling interest in eradicating discrimination against women, andthat this interest justified applying the law.  Furthermore, admittingwomen would not impede National's ability to engage in its civic,lobbying, charitable, fundraising and other activities or todisseminate its views. Even if there was some abridgment of National'sfree speech rights, the abridgment was no greater than necessary toaccomplish Minnesota's legitimate purposes.<a href="#42">[42]</a><p><a name="43r"><a name="44r"><a name="45r"></p><p><a name="46r"></p><p>	In <i>Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Clubof Duarte</i>,<a href="#43">[43]</a> a local Rotary chapter and two femalemembers filed a complaint, arguing that Rotary International'srevocation of the club's charter and termination of its membership inRotary International for admitting females violated California's UnruhCivil Rights Act.<a href="#44">[44]</a> Membership was limited to men,which enhanced male bonding and made it easier to operate in foreigncultures that had varied cultures and social mores.<ahref="#45">[45]</a>  And although women could not be members, theycould attend meetings, give speeches and receive awards.<ahref="#46">[46]</a> Women who were relatives of Rotary members couldform their own associations and could wear the Rotary lapel pin. Womencould also engage in a number of Rotary activities.<p><a name="47r"><a name="48r"><a name="49r"></p><p>	The U.S. Supreme Court held that: (1) The Unruh Civil RightsAct did not violate the First Amendment by requiring California RotaryClubs to admit women,<a href="#47">[47]</a> (2) application of the Actto local chapters did not unduly interfere with the club members'freedom of private association,<a href="#48">[48]</a> (3) or expressiveassociation.<a href="#49">[49]</a><p>	In arriving at the conclusion that the Act did not unduly interferewith members' right of private association, the Court looked at thedegree of intimacy or privacy involved and the extent to which intimacyand privacy needed to be constitutionally protected. It consideredfactors such as size, purpose, selectivity, and whether others areexcluded from critical aspects of the relationship.  It felt thatconstitutional protection was not warranted because the size of thelocal clubs is potentially large (smaller size would have called formore protection), there was a high turnover among members, and thelocal clubs encouraged the participation of strangers in many of theircentral activities. Rather than being a closed organization, the Rotarybasically opened its doors to the public, in a sense. It also looked atthe inclusive nature of each club's membership and the purpose behindthe club's service activities.<p><a name="50r"></p><p>	The Court also found that admitting women would not affect inany significant way the ability to carry out the Rotary's serviceactivities. Although the Act might infringe of members' rights, thatinfringement was slight, and the Court felt slight infringement wasjustified because of the State's compelling interest in eliminatingdiscrimination against women and assuring them equal access to publicaccommodations.<a href="#50">[50]</a>  This interest in access topublic accommodations included the acquisition of leadership skills andbusiness contacts as well as tangible goods and services.<p><a name="51r"></p><p>	In <i>New York State Club Association, Inc. v. City of New York etal</i>.,<a href="#51">[51]</a> a consortium of 125 private clubs andassociations (Association) sought to have a New York City lawprohibiting discrimination by clubs declared unconstitutional. The lawprohibited discrimination by clubs that provided benefits to businessentities and to persons other than their own members. The rationalebehind the law was that such clubs are sufficiently public in characteras to forfeit the "distinctly private" exemption under the law.<p><a name="52r"><a name="53r"></p><p>	The law prohibited discrimination based on race, sex, creedand other grounds by any "place of public accommodation, resort oramusement."<a href="#52">[52]</a>  However, it exempted institutions,clubs and places of accommodation that were distinctly private bynature. An amendment stated that institutions, clubs or places ofaccommodation other than benevolent orders or religious corporationswould not be considered distinctly private by nature if they had morethan 400 members, provided regular meal service and regularly receivedpayment from nonmembers in the furtherance of their trade orbusiness.<a href="#53">[53]</a><p><a name="54r"><a name="55r"></p><p><a name="56r"><a name="57r"><a name="58r"></p><p>	After the law became effective, the Association sued to havethe law declared unconstitutional on its face under the First andFourteenth Amendments. All three New York state courts that heard thecase found the law to be constitutional.  The U.S. Supreme Court heldthat the law could not be declared unconstitutionally invalid on itsface because that would require that it be invalid in all itsapplications, which was not the case.<a href="#54">[54]</a>  Accordingto the holdings in <i>Jaycees</i><a href="#55">[55]</a> and <i>Rotary</i>,<a href="#56">[56]</a> some large clubs are not protected under the FirstAmendment. Some of the Association's clubs had large memberships,provided regular meal service and received regular nonmember payments"for the furtherance of trade or business."<a href="#57">[57]</a> Since many of the large clubs would be able to effectively advancetheir desired viewpoints without confining their membership to personshaving, for example, the same sex or religion, it could not be saidthat the Law infringed upon every club members' right of expressiveassociation.<a href="#58">[58]</a>  Association could not prove thatthe Law was overbroad or that the equal protection clause of theFourteenth Amendment was being violated.  The rationale for the lawgiven by the New York City Council is similar to the rationale givenfor prohibiting discrimination in other places of so-called publicaccommodation: </p><ul>		<p>	<a name="59r">	</p>	<p>	It is hereby found and declared that the city of New York has a	compelling interest in providing its citizens an environment	where all persons, regardless of race, creed, color, national	origin or sex, have a fair and equal opportunity to participate	in the business and professional life of the city, and may be	unfettered in availing themselves of employment opportunities.	Although city, state and federal laws have been enacted to eliminate	discrimination in employment, women and minority group members	have not attained equal opportunity in business and the professions.	One barrier to the advancement of women and minorities in the	business and professional life of the city is the discriminatory	practices of certain membership organizations where business	deals are often made and personal contacts valuable for business	purposes, employment and professional advancement are formed.	While such organizations may avowedly be organized for social,	cultural, civic or educational purposes, and while many perform	valuable services to the community, the commercial nature of some of	the activities occurring therein and the prejudicial impact of	these activities on business, professional and employment	opportunities of minorities and women cannot be	ignored.<a href="#59">[59]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="60r"></p><p>	Thus, the City Council determined that "the public interest inequal opportunity" outweighs "the interest in private associationasserted by club members."<a href="#60">[60]</a></p>	<h4>III.  Philosophical Issues</h4><center><h4>A.  The Purpose of Government</h4></center><p><a name="61r"><a name="62r"><a name="63r"><a name="64r"></p><p>	What is the purpose and function of government in a free society?One view is that government should provide the goods and services thatare not provided by the market. Economists call this the "public goods"argument or the market failure argument.<a href="#61">[61]</a>  Anotherview is that the role of government is "to provide a means whereby wecan modify the rules, to mediate differences among us on the meaning ofthe rules, and to enforce compliance with the rules on the part ofthose few who would otherwise not play the game."<a href="#62">[62]</a>This view takes a utilitarian<a href="#63">[63]</a> approach.  Itdiffers from the natural right, minimal (nightwatchman) state theory ofgovernment in that it does not necessarily limit the legitimatefunctions of government to the defense of life, liberty and property,whereas the natural rights approach does.<a href="#64">[64]</a><p><a name="65r"></p><p>	"Government is an apparatus of compulsion and coercion.  It has thepower to obtain obedience by force.<a href="#65">[65]</a>  In a freesociety, the goal is to minimize force and maximize voluntarycooperation.  Individuals are free only insofar as they are not forcedinto doing things they do not want to do. Yet government in thetwentieth century in all western democracies has become a tool ofplunder, a tool by which some groups seek to live at the expense ofothers.  Frederic Bastiat, the French political philosopher andeconomist, summed up the idea of legal plunder when he said: </p><ul>	<p>	<a name="66r">	</p>	<p>	Under the pretense of organization, regulation, protection, or	encouragement, the law takes property from one person and gives	it to another; the law takes the wealth of all and gives it to	a few—whether farmers, manufacturers, shipowners, artists, or	comedians. Under these circumstances, then certainly every class will	aspire to grasp the law, and logically so.<a href="#66">[66]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="67r"><a name="68r"></p><p>	What Bastiat described is the modern welfare state,<ahref="#67">[67]</a> where everyone tries to live at the expense ofeveryone else.<a href="#68">[68]</a>  Modern governments take taxesfrom everyone and give it to special interest groups, either directly,in the form of subsidies (like farmers or Chrysler bailouts) orindirectly, in the form of import quotas on Japanese cars (whichbenefits the Big-3 U.S. automakers at the expense of Americanconsumers). Congress passes laws requiring certain shipments to go onU.S. flag carriers (subsidies to shipbuilders), pays artists to createpornographic art, and subsidizes renters at the expense of landlords(rent control laws).<p>	How is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply, accordingto Bastiat:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="69r">	</p>	<p>	See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and	gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law	benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what	the citizen himself cannot do without committing a	crime.<a href="#69">[69]</a>	</p></ul>	<p>	Where is this argument leading and what does it have to do withthe freedom of association?<center><h4>B.  Two Views of Rights</h4></center><p><a name="70r"></p><p>	There are two basically different and diametrically opposedviews of rights in the modern western democracies. Negative rights holdthat individuals have the right to life liberty and property —thoushalt not kill or steal.  Positive rights go beyond that and hold thatindividuals have a right to food, clothing, a job, good medical care,and so forth.<a href="#70">[70]</a> The basic difference between thenegative and positive theory of rights is that negative rights resultin "win-win" situations, whereas positive rights result in "win-lose"situations. Under a negative rights regime, you get to keep what youearn and I get to keep what I earn. Property rights are inviolate.Under a positive rights regime, "society" has a claim on my pocketbookand yours. One individual gains at the expense of another. If oneindividual is entitled to good health care, another individual (orgroup of individuals) must provide it, whether they want to or not.Government takes a portion of someone's property, in the form of taxes,and distributes it to someone else in the form of health care. Oneperson's property rights are violated so that someone else can enjoygood health care.<p><a name="71r"></p><p>	But the forcible transfer of property does not have to take theform of direct taxation. It can also take the form of regulation. Whenlandlords must, because of rent control laws, charge only $400 a monthfor an apartment that would go for $900 in a free market, theirproperty is being confiscated to the tune of $500 a month. Such apolicy is a clear taking of property, which should be in violation ofthe Constitution's takings clause.<a href="#71">[71]</a><p>	Property rights are violated whenever individuals cannot dowith their property as they see fit. Of course, this does not mean thatindividuals can push their fists into other people's noses, or that arailroad can allow its trains to shoot out sparks, which result insetting an occasional barn on fire.  Under a negative theory of rights,individuals can do with their property as they see fit as long as theydo not violate anyone else's rights. So it then becomes a question ofwhen are someone else's rights being violated? Also, under a negativerights regime, there is no place for a balancing concept, since rightsnever conflict. I have a right to life and property and so do you. If Itransfer property to you, it is because we have entered into avoluntary exchange, not because government is forcing me to make thetransfer.<p><a name="72r"><a name="73r"><a name="74r"><a name="75r"></p><p>	One reason why the right of negative association has not beenregarded as absolute by the courts is because judges mistakenly adhereto the theory of positive rights.  If a restaurant owner does not wantto serve blacks, he does not have to under a negative rights regime. Ifblacks insist on coming into his restaurant, they are trespassing. Theyhave no right to be served, since, under a negative rights regime, theywould first have to violate the rights of the restaurant owner bytrespassing on his land, not to mention the fact that they would beforcing him into involuntary servitude by forcing him to serve them.<ahref="#72">[72]</a> By pressuring government into enactingantidiscrimination laws, they are, in effect, plundering the restaurantowner, since they are using government to do something that they couldnot do themselves (trespassing) without committing a crime.<ahref="#73">[73]</a> While it is unfortunate that some restaurant ownersmay be prejudiced,<a href="#74">[74]</a> that does not change the factthat restaurant owners have their property and associational rightsviolated if they are forced to serve (and associate with) anyone whowalks through the door.<a href="#75">[75]</a><p>	One reason courts have seen fit to force clubs to admit everyone isbecause of the belief that not allowing women or minorities tosocialize and congregate with other business-types short-circuits theircareer growth. While this may very well be true, it is also beside thepoint.  This argument is an extension of the positive rights theorythat everyone is entitled to a job, which is not the case. If everyoneis entitled to a job, that means that someone else must be obligated toprovide it, which is not the case. And if no one is entitled to a job,how can their rights be violated if their career growth isshort-circuited?<center><h4>C.  The Public Policy Argument</h4></center><p>	Another line of reasoning that has been advanced for not recognizingthe right of negative association as absolute is that doing so would beagainst "public policy" or "the public interest."  But what exactly is"public policy" or "public interest?"</p><ul>	<a name="76r">	<p>	Since there is no such entity as "the public," since the public	is merely a number of individuals, any claimed or implied conflict of	"the public interest" with private interests means that the interests	of some men are to be sacrificed to the interests and wishes of	others. Since the concept is so conveniently undefinable, its	use rests only on any given gang's ability to proclaim that	"The public, c'est moi"--and to maintain the claim at the point	of a gun.<a href="#76">[76]</a>	</p>	<p> 	All "public interest" legislation (and any distribution of money	taken by force from some men for the unearned benefit of others)	comes down ultimately to the grant of an undefined undefinable,	non-objective, arbitrary power to some government officials.	</p>	<a name="77r">	<p>	The worst aspect of it is not that such a power can be used	dishonestly, but that <i>it cannot be used honestly</i>. The wisest	man in the world, with the purest integrity, cannot find a criterion	for the just, equitable, rational application of an unjust,	inequitable, irrational principle.<a href="#77">[77]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="78r"><a name="79r"></p><p>	Can a pluralist society have a common good? I think not.<ahref="#78">[78]</a>  The only values such a society can hope to have incommon are the protection of life, liberty (in the negative sense ofthe term) and property.  Every other value is optional, sinceindividuals have different values. We cannot determine the common goodor the public interest by adding up all the values of all members ofsociety, since they have different, conflicting values.  And someindividuals feel stronger about their values than others, yet we cannotassign a weight to such values to compute some weighted value. Forexample, 57% of a certain community might favor the "right" toabortion, while 43% oppose this "right." Does that mean that the publicpolicy should be to make abortion legal? What if the 43% who opposelegalized abortion are strongly opposed, whereas the 57% who approveare only mildly supportive? What if the percentage changes next week,so that only 49% favor legalized abortion? Public policy in such a caseshould have nothing to do with majority rule or sentiment. Either thepotential mother has rights or the fetus does. Any decision regardingthis issue must be based on rights, not public policy, since publicpolicy is just a question of majority rule, at best, and at worst, therule of a concentrated, highly vocal minority.<a href="#79">[79]</a> </p><ul>	<p>	People speak of "the public interest." But what is the public	interest? Strictly speaking, there is no such thing. There is	only the interest of each individual human being. There are interests	that many or all people share, but these are still the interests of	individuals. When politicians say that something is "to the	public interest," they usually mean that it serves the interests of	some people but goes against the interests of others--and usually the	interests of the people with the most political pull win out.	Is it to the public interest for some to be forced to die so	that others may be saved? Is it to the public interest for a hundred	crazed men to lynch one man in the public square? It is to the	public interest for all the citizens of the nation to be taxed	to pay for a federal dam in one section of it? In Sweden it takes a	couple eight to ten years on the average before they can obtain	an apartment of their own (owned by the government, rented by	them); but they are not supposed to complain, because "it's in	the public interest."	</p>			<p>	<a name="80r">	</p>	<p>	...Just as there are only individual rights, so there are only individual	interests.<a href="#80">[80]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="81r"><a name="82r"><a name="83r"><a name="84r"><a name="85r"></p><p>	The public interest/public policy argument has been used anynumber of times to benefit one group at the expense of the generalpublic. Legislatures are convinced that passing antimerger legislationis in the public interest when, in fact, it tends to benefitentrenched, inefficient management at the expense of shareholders,consumers and the general public.<a href="#81">[81]</a>  Specialinterest groups convince legislatures to pass protectionist trade billsthat protect one industry at the expense of consumers, who must payhigher prices for lower quality products as a result.<ahref="#82">[82]</a> Special interests such as the farm lobby pressureCongress into passing laws that protect and/or subsidize some segmentof the farm industry because it is alleged to be in the publicinterest, when in fact the result is higher farm prices.<ahref="#=83">[83]</a> Dominant members of an industry pressure Congressto pass antitrust or trade legislation to prevent them from continuingto lose market share to smaller, more efficient competitors.<ahref="#84">[84]</a> Doctors, lawyers, accountants, beauticians,electricians, barbers, pharmacists, opticians, morticians, automechanics, speech therapists, tattoo artists, sex therapists and anynumber of other professions and occupations pressure variouslegislatures into passing strict occupational licensure laws to protectthe public from some perceived danger, when most studies show thatloosening or abolishing a particular licensure law would result inhigher quality service at lower cost.<a href="#85">[85]</a>  Moraliststry to have victimless crimes like prostitution, gambling, scalping anddwarf tossing outlawed even though they have no right to interfere withacts between consenting adults.<p>	In the area of freedom of association, the public policy argument isused to violate the rights of property owners who do not want to serveor hire members of certain groups. While it would be nice if everyonecould go into a restaurant and be served, there is no right to do so.The public policy argument, in effect, says that it is in the "public"interest that the property rights of some be sacrificed for theconvenience of others. This position views rights as positive, sincethere is a winner and a loser.  And as was pointed out above, anyargument based on the concept of positive rights is prima facieinvalid.<a name="86r"><p>	The public policy argument is also used to support the viewthat women and minorities should be admitted to private clubs.  Theproperty and association rights of some must be sacrificed because someindividuals think that the public would benefit by forcing unwantedmembers down their throats. But "the public" cannot benefit from anyaction, since "the public" is just a collective term for a group ofindividuals. As Bastiat pointed out,<a href="#86">[86]</a> if a law hasthe effect of helping someone at the expense of someone else, it islegal plunder, an illegitimate object of government. 	<center><h4>D.  The Balancing of Rights Argument</h4></center><a name="87r"><p>	Perhaps one of the best points that has been made against thebalancing of interests doctrine was made by Justice Douglas in hisdissenting opinion in <i>Scales v. United States</i>:<a href="#87">[87]</a></p><ul>	<a name="88r">	<p>		In recent years we have been departing, I think, from the theory	of government expressed in the First Amendment.  We have too	often been "balancing" the right of speech and association against	other values in society to see if we, the judges, feel that a	particular need is more important than those guaranteed by the	Bill of Rights<a href="#88">[88]</a>... This approach, which treats the	commands of the First Amendment as "no more than admonitions	of moderation" (see Hand, <i>The Spirit of Liberty</i> (1960 ed.), p. 278),	runs counter to our prior decisions.	</p>		<p>	...It also runs counter to Madison's views of the First Amendment as	we are advised by his eminent biographer, Irving Brant: 		"When Madison wrote, 'Congress shall make no law' infringing	these rights, he did not expect the Supreme Court to decide, on	balance, whether Congress could or could not make a law infringing	them... 	</p>		<a name="89r">	<p>	" 'If they are incorporated into the Constitution, independent	tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar	manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an inpenetrable	bulwark against every assumption of power in the Legislative or	Executive; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment	upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the	declaration of rights.'<a href="#89">[89]</a>	</p></ul>	<p><a name="90r"><a name="91r"></p><p>	Once it is seen that the balancing argument is just anotherpositive rights argument,<a href="#90">[90]</a> it quickly falls apart.I have the right to life and so do you. I have the right to propertyand so do you. If you violate my right to property, you are actingunjustly. It cannot be said that an unjust act, such as violating myproperty rights, can be balanced against your right to take myproperty, because you have no right to take my property.  The publicaccommodation argument, that you have a right to trespass on myproperty, is invalid because you have no right to set foot on myproperty without my permission.  The fact that you might have to eatsomewhere else or might have your career advancement short-circuited isnot an issue, since you have no right to force me to serve you oradvance your career at my expense.<a href="#91">[91]</a>  The argumentthat my right not to associate with you must be balanced with yourright to associate with me is ludicrous because you have no right toassociate with me unless I agree to the association.</p>	<h4>IV.  Conclusion</h4><p><a name="92r"></p><p>	The freedom of association consists of the freedom to associate andthe freedom to refrain from associating.  This right is a negativeright, in the sense that government should neither prevent consentingadults from associating nor compel them to associate.  This right isnot presently being adequately protected either by the courts or by thevarious legislatures. Part of the problem is that most judges andlegislators do not recognize this right as absolute. Nor do mostopinion leaders and citizens. And even if they do see the freedom ofassociation as absolute, there is a hesitation to say so for fear ofbeing labeled a racist, sexist or whatever.  Thus, the probability ofpassing a constitutional amendment to protect this right seems slim, atleast in the near future.<a href="#92">[92]</a>  However, unless thedebate is started, the present situation will never change.  It is timefor the debate to begin. 	<p>	What would such a constitutional amendment look like?  The wordingmight be as follows:	<ul>	<p>	Individuals shall have the right to associate or transact, or	not associate or transact, with anyone they want for any reason	they want. No government shall make any law or regulation or	adopt any public policy that restricts this right.	</p></ul><p>	Frances Kendall and Leon Louw, two South African political theorists,make a similar suggestion with regard to the South Africanconstitution. The language they would use is as follows:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="93r">	</p>	<p>	Any person may associate or transact with any other person or	refuse to associate or transact with any other person for any	reason.<a href="#93">[93]</a>	</p></ul><p>	This suggestion has gained much popularity in South Africa, a countrythat has much ethnic and racial diversity.  Many whites do not want tobe forced to associate with blacks or members of mixed races. Manyblacks do not want to be forced to associate with whites. And blacksfrom one tribe do not want to be forced to associate with blacks fromother tribes.  From a utilitarian perspective, having this basic rightprotected constitutionally would enhance social harmony becauseassociation would be voluntary rather than coerced. From a naturalrights perspective, individuals are entitled to associate or notassociate, as they see fit, without being hassled by government.<p>	Recognizing this basic right of association would lead to a number ofinteresting results because it would legalize all acts betweenconsenting adults. For example, such an amendment would legalize aplethora of victimless crimes such as prostitution, gambling, ticketscalping, drug selling, tobacco advertising, surrogacy, the selling ofbody parts, dwarf tossing, nude dancing, polygamy and smuggling.  Lawsthat restrict the rent a landlord may charge (rent control), the pricesomeone may accept for his or her services (minimum wage laws), whereone may live or work (zoning laws), with whom one may have sex, wouldall be illegal per se.  Individuals would be able to buy Japanese carsif they choose, without having the price artificially jacked up becauseof import quotas that restrict the quantity that may be imported intothe United States. The antidumping laws, which prevent foreignproducers from selling their products at very favorable prices, wouldbecome unenforceable, which would raise the standard of living for thevast majority of people.<p><a name="94r"></p><p>	Would the adoption of a constitutional amendment protecting thefreedom of association be sufficient to protect this basic right?Having rights guaranteed in writing and having them protected inpractice are often two quite different things. The United StatesConstitution is a case in point. The first amendment, for example,states that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom ofspeech, or of the press .."<a href="#94">[94]</a> Yet over the last 200 years, there havebeen numerous cases where the freedoms of speech and press have beenabridged. Although some of our founding fathers interpreted the firstamendment to be absolute, courts and governments have treated freespeech as having limits.  As Justice Black stated in Mishkin v. NewYork:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="95r">	</p>	<p>	I think the Founders of our Nation in adopting the First Amendment	meant precisely that the Federal Government should pass ‘no	law' regulating speech and press but should confine its legislation	to the regulation of conduct. So, too, that policy of the First	Amendment made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth, leaves the	States vast power to regulate conduct but no power at all, in	my judgment, to make the expression of views a	crime.<a href="#95">[95]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="96r"><a name="97r"><a name="98r"><a name="99r"></p><p>	Black was of the view that the First Amendment guaranteed completefreedom of expression for all ideas, not just those that were of apolitical nature or that had some socially redeeming value.<ahref="#96">[96]</a> Justice Douglas agreed that the Founding Fathersintended the First Amendment to be absolute.<a href="#97">[97]</a>Other legal commentators have also come to the conclusion that theFirst Amendment is absolute.<a href="#98">[98]</a>  Yet courts andgovernments have often treated free speech as having limits.<ahref="#99">[99]</a>  For example, in 1961, Justice Harlan stated in<i>Konigsberg v. State Bar of California</i>: </p><ul>	<a name="100r">	<p>	At the outset we reject the view that freedom of speech and	association, ... as protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments,	are "absolutes," not only in the undoubted sense that where the	constitutional protection exists it must prevail, but also in	the sense that the scope of that protection must be gathered	solely from a literal reading of the First Amendment. Throughout its	history this Court has consistently recognized at least two ways in	which constitutionally protected freedom of speech is narrower	than an unlimited license to talk. On the one hand, certain forms of	speech, or speech in certain contexts, has been considered outside	the scope of constitutional protection .... On the other hand,	general regulatory statutes, not intended to control the content of	speech, but incidentally limiting its unfettered exercise, have	not been regarded as the type of law the First or Fourteenth	Amendment forbade Congress or the States to pass, when they have been	found justified by subordinating valid governmental interests,	a prerequisite to constitutionality which has necessarily involved a	weighing of the governmental interest	involved.<a href="#100">[100]</a>	</p></ul><p>	Justice Murphy expressed a similar view a few decades earlier in<i>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire</i>:</p><ul>		<a name="101r">	<p>	Allowing the broadest scope to the language and purpose of the	Fourteenth Amendment, it is well understood that the right of	free speech is not absolute at all times and under all circumstances.	There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of	speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been thought	to raise any Constitutional problems. These include the lewd	and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or	"fighting" words—those which by their very utterance inflict	injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It	has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of	any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as	a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them	is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and	morality.<a href="#101">[101]</a>	</p></ul><a name="102r"><p>	Justices Black and Douglas, among others, have denounced thebalancing test when applied to free speech and press cases.1<ahref="#102">[102]</a>  In their view, any balancing that needed to bedone was already done by the Founding Fathers when they wrote the FirstAmendment, which cast the First Amendment as absolute and not subjectto subordination by any other rights.<p><a name="103r"><a name="104r"><a name="105r"><a name="106r"></p><p>	The erosion of the First Amendment is only one of several examplesthat could be cited to illustrate that what is written is not alwayswhat is guaranteed. For example, the Takings clause<ahref="#103">[103]</a> states that private property shall not be takenfor public use without just compensation. Yet private property issystematically taken without just compensation, both for public andprivate use, without being declared unconstitutional.<ahref="#104">[104]</a>  The Contract clause<a href="#105">[105]</a> saysthat "No State shall ... pass any ... Law impairing the Obligation ofContracts," yet states and municipalities pass such laws all the timewithout being declared unconstitutional.<a href="#106">[106]</a>  TheNinth Amendment has become practically meaningless.  The TenthAmendment has been all but ignored.<p>	The "bottom line" is that the freedom of association is absolutebecause no government has the right to tell individuals with whom theymay associate, nor may it compel them to associate without violatingtheir rights. This right is constitutionally protected by the First,Ninth and Tenth Amendments, yet courts do not treat the right asabsolute. Indeed, the Supreme Court does not even recognize that theright is protected by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. Were the UnitedStates to adopt another Amendment to protect the freedom ofassociation, it would be a step in the right direction. But, judgingfrom past case law, it would not be enough, because courts could chipaway at this basic right, like they have done with the freedom ofspeech, the takings clause and the contract clause. It seems like thebest protection against encroachment of the state is eternal vigilance.</p><hr noshade><p>	Nothing written here is to be construed as necessarily reflecting theviews of the Dumont Institute or as an attempt to aid or hinder thepassage of any bill before Congress.

However, the	Contract Clause has been whittled away at, especially since 1937, to	the point where there is now very little left, and governments	at all levels systematically impair contract or do not permit	contracts to come into existence.

However, it should be pointed out that this argument	suffers from a number of weaknesses. For example, it might be	said that just because the market does not provide a good or service	does not mean that the government should provide it. The argument	that the government should provide what the market does not is	a non sequitur.   For a detailed discussion of the theory of	market failure, see  The Theory of Market Failure: A Critical	Examination (T. Cowen ed. 1988).  For a devastating critique	that completely dismantles the public goods argument, see D.	Schmidtz, The Limits of Government: An Essay on the Public	Goods Argument (1991). Another argument that does not hold up	to analysis is that government can provide goods or services cheaper	than the market.  If that were the case, governments all over	the world would not be rushing to privatize government functions. 	The many studies that have been done indicate that the market	can provide just about any good or service cheaper than government --	up to 100% cheaper in some cases.  For details, see Privatization &	Development (S. Hanke ed. 1987); R.

For	instance, they tend to ignore or discount minority rights.  If	the majority decides on a certain rule, the minority must comply or	face the consequences. If the majority decides to elect a Hitler, the	minority has no recourse other than to live with it, move or	assassinate. Also, it is impossible to measure utility, since utility	is subjective and changes from person to person. There are a	number of other weaknesses inherent in the concept of utility.	For a good summary of these weaknesses, see M.

Likewise, the state university system in California	(which practices race norming) should not be able to admit	blacks when more qualified whites and orientals are refused	admittance.

At the turn of the century, railroad magnates	came to Congress, hat in hand, to ask for legislation to prevent	competitors from cutting rates because the competition was wiping out	their profit margins.  Leaders in other industries did the same	thing. The result was the Interstate Commerce Commission and a	plethora of other federal agencies, which were created to regulate	rates and keep them high enough so that small, aggressive companies	would not be able to reduce the profit margins of the big,	long-established companies in a particular industry. The result, of	course, was that consumers had to pay higher prices, since government	regulation kept prices artificially high, all in the "public	interest." For more on this point, see G.

In	newly emerging states having a high degree of ethnic diversity	and animosity, such a move might be regarded as highly favorable to	the vast majority of the population.		<a href="#92r">Return</a><p><a name="93"><li> F.

Some commentators point to the famous example that no one has	the right to falsely yell "fire" in a crowded theater as evidence	that the right of free speech is not absolute. But, as Rothbard	points out in Rothbard, For a New Liberty 43-44 (1978) [45-46	of the 1973 edition], this argument is a false one because it	confuses free speech with property rights. Rothbard's position	is that there are no human rights that are separate from property	rights and that the right of free speech is merely the property	right to hire an assembly hall from someone or to own one oneself.	The right of free speech is not an extra right apart from the	property rights that can be enumerated in a given case. In the	theater example, anyone who falsely shouts "fire" is violating	someone's property rights. If the theater owner falsely shouts	"fire," he is breaching his contract with the patrons to let them see	the performance they have paid for. He has, in effect, stolen	their money. If a patron is the one who shouts fire, the property	rights of both the owner and the patrons are being violated. As	Rothbard says at page 44 of the 1978 edition:	<p>	There is no need, therefore, for individual rights to be restricted in	the case of the false shouter of "fire." The rights of the individual	are still absolute; but they are property rights. The fellow	who maliciously cried "fire" in a crowded theater is indeed a	criminal, but not because his so-called "right of free speech"	must be pragmatically restricted on behalf of the "public good"; he	is a criminal because he has clearly and obviously violated the	property rights of another person.	</p>	<p>	Rothbard discusses the same point in The Ethics of Liberty 113-17	(1983) and Power and Market 177 (1970). Justice Black agrees	with Rothbard on this point. See One Man's Stand for Freedom	477-78 (Irving Dillard ed. 1963), cited in Rothbard, The Ethics	of Liberty 114-15, 119 n. 6 (1982). Black points out that the	issue is not whether one has a right to shout "fire" in a crowded	theater but whether one has a right to shout at all.	</p>		<a href="#101r">Return</a><p><a name="102"><li>Konigsberg v.

McGee and Walter E. Block</h4></center><hr noshade><center><h4>I.  Introduction</h4></center><p><a name="1r"><a name="2r"><a name="3r"></p><p>	The concept of marketable pollution permits (MPP)<ahref="#1">[1]</a> has become an increasingly popular topic ofdiscussion for environmentalists in recent years, although the idea hasbeen around since at least 1968, when J.H. Dales published a book onthe issue.<a href="#2">[2]</a>  This approach was given addedcredibility when the Congress passed the Clean Air Act of 1990,<ahref="#3">[3]</a> which made the concept an official part ofenvironmental regulatory policy.<p>	A typical solution in this regard is for the government to mandatethat a certain kind of pollutant in a specified geographic area bereduced by a defined target percentage within a certain time period.Basically, such nostrums are based on a centralized command systemrather than the market place.<p>	Establishing a market in tradeable pollution permits triggers"quasi" market forces. This leads to a more efficient allocation ofresources than command and control alternatives and makes it possibleto achieve the goal of reducing emissions at less cost. Firms thatcannot achieve the targeted level can purchase a permit from the personwhose reduction exceeds the mandated amount. There is an incentive foreach person to reduce pollution below the legally required level sothat the permits not being utilized can be sold.<p><a name="4r"><a name="5r"><a name="6r"></p><p>	However, this solution has encountered some problems. Excessiveregulations and regulator attitudes have practically destroyed theevolution of a well-functioning permit market. And the system, aspresently advocated and applied, is structurally unsound, since itplaces reliance on command rather than market incentives -- which isreally just a form of market socialism, a system that Mises<ahref="#4">[4]</a> and Hayek<a href="#5">[5]</a> criticized in the 1920sand 1930s.<a href="#6">[6]</a> 	<p>	This paper applies market theories to the problem of pollution. It maintains that while market socialism (e.g., tradeable emissionrights) is preferable to central commands, a system of fully protectedprivate property rights is superior to both.	<center><h4>II.  The Pollution Trading Permit Approach</h4></center><p><a name="7r"><a name="8r"><a name="9r"></p><p>	Strictly speaking, there are only two economic systems, themarket and socialism.  Capitalism relies on voluntary exchange and therecognition of property rights.  The socialist alternative relies onforce or the threat of force, and necessarily entails the violation (ornonrecognition) or property rights.  The market system has been shown<ahref="#7">[7]</a> to be more effective in allocating scarce resourcesfor a number of reasons.  For one thing, it relies on a price system,which acts as a signalling mechanism to convey information to  marketparticipants.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Socialism, on the other hand, relieson centrally directed command. But because information is dispersed, itis impossible for a central authority to gather and digest thenecessary information and to make decisions that result in theefficient allocation of resources.  Yet free enterprise performs thisfunction automatically. A number of commentators have discussed thisphenomenon in depth, so there is no need to repeat it here.<ahref="#9">[9]</a><p>	Until recently, the command system was used almost exclusivelyto control pollution.  As a result, the problem is still with us.  Butin recent years, researchers have been trying to find ways to injectmarket forces into the area of pollution abatement, in recognition ofthe fact that it works better at solving problems than does centralplanning.<p>	One way to unleash market forces is by the use of tradeable emissionsrights (TERs), which are permitted under the 1990 Clean Air Actamendments.  Whereas under a command system, all businesses andcommunities would have to collectively and individually meet whatevertests and pollution reductions government commanded, under a marketpermit trading system, reduction goals could be achieved more flexibly. For example, let's say that some law required all electric powerplants to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by 30% over a two-year periodand that the decrease would have to be achieved by using smokestackscrubbers.  Under the command system, every power plant would have toachieve the 30% reduction regardless of cost.  Plants with oldertechnology might find it very difficult and expensive to meet thetarget.  Newer ones might achieve it at much smaller cost.<p><a name="10r"><a name="11r"></p><p>	But under a market-driven system, the goal could be achievedmore efficiently.  Here, the goal could still be a 30% overallreduction, but individual plants would have more flexibility in tryingto meet it.  They could each try to find the least costly way toachieve the goal.  Assume that there are ten power plants of equal sizein the region that produce a total of 100 million tons of emissions, or10 million tons each.<a href="#10">[10]</a>  Under a permit tradingregime, plants have several options.  While the total emissionreduction must be 30 million tons, the individual plants do notnecessarily have to use scrubbers to achieve their allocable share ofthe reduction.  They can use other means if they can find a better way. For example, they might be able to switch from burning coal to usingnatural gas, electricity or water power.  Or they might find ways toburn their coal more efficiently. The price system will send them thesignals they need to make the correct decision.<a href="#11">[11]</a><p>	Each plant does not have to achieve a 30% reduction.  Efficientones could find ways to reduce their emissions by 40%, and could selltheir excess 10% to one that is having difficulty achieving its 30%required reduction.  In effect, efficient plants could sell pollution"rights" to their inefficient colleagues.  And because of this marketincentive, efficient plants might find it profitable to reduceemissions in their facility by more than that required by law so thatthey could sell their right to pollute to someone else.  For example,if a plant could reduce its emissions by an extra ton at a cost of $300and could sell this pollution right for $1,000, the incentive to reduceemissions would result in turning liabilities and expenses into assetsand revenues.  If the price of MPPs becomes sufficiently attractive,some polluters may find it more profitable to shut down their facilityand sell their permits than to remain open.  This is a furtherincentive that does not exist under a command system.<p><a name="12r"></p><p>	Pollution could also be reduced by another market force. Environmental groups could use the funds they now expend on litigation,public relations and advertising to purchase some emission rightsthemselves.  If such groups bought 10% of the total permits in an areaand then just sat on them, so to speak, total pollution could bereduced by that amount.  These organizations might even be able toincrease the amount of private funding they receive (thus making morefunds available for buying yet additional trading permits) if theyengaged in this kind of activity, since some individuals hesitate tocontribute to them now because the motives of some environmental groupsare suspect.<a href="#12">[12]</a><p><a name="13r"></p><p>	If it appears that MPPs are a good investment, speculatorsmight enter the market and purchase some permits in the hope that theprice would rise.  While they are waiting, the permits lie dormant,which also would serve to reduce discharges.<a href="#13">[13]</a><p><a name="14r"></p><p>	Once these quasi market forces are allowed to function, mutuallybeneficial exchange will trigger the free enterprise system to find newways to achieve goals at minimum cost.  Specialization and division oflabor, coupled with the unanticipated discovery of more efficientproduction methods, will expand the market, causing benefits toincrease and costs to fall.  According to one conservative estimate,adopting the trading permit approach to sulfur dioxide emissions in theUSA may lead to as much as a 20% decline in electric utility costs overwhat would have been the case under a command system.<ahref="#14">[14]</a><p><a name="15r"></p><p>	Several studies have found that changing from commands to markets canproduce dramatic cost reductions.  Below are summaries of someempirical studies of air pollution control.<a href="#15">[15]</a></p><center>	<table border width="100%">	<tr>		<th>Pollutant</th>		<th>Industry</th>		<th>Percent Cost Reduction</th>	<tr>		<tr>		<td>Paritulates</td>		<td>Power</td>		<td  align="center">83%</td>	</tr>		<tr>		<td>Sulfur Dioxide</td>		<td>Power</td>		<td  align="center">50%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Sulfates</td>		<td>Steel, Petroleum, Power</td>		<td  align="center">9%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Nitrogen Oxide</td>		<td>Steel, Chemicals, Oil</td>		<td  align="center"d>83%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Hydrocarbon</td>		<td>DuPont Chemical</td>		<td  align="center">76%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Particulates</td>		<td>All Sources</td>		<td  align="center">76%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>CFC</td>		<td>Refrigeration (Plastics)</td>		<td  align="center">50%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Nitrogen Oxide</td>		<td>Power, Steel, Oil</td>		<td  align="center">93%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Sulfur Dioxide</td>		<td>Power, Steel, Oil</td>		<td  align="center">44%</td>	</tr>	<tr>		<td>Particulates</td>		<td>Power, Steel, Oil</td>		<td  align="center">95%</td>	</tr>	</table></center><p>	Another advantage for markets vis a vis command concerns the behaviorof managers.  Rather than spending their time and energy dealing withgovernment bureaucrats and trying to manipulate the system to theiradvantage, they can plow their resources and energy into finding moreefficient ways to run their businesses.  Whereas a command systemrewards politically gifted managers, the market rewards production andresults.  Over time, this difference in incentives produces a newbreed.  Entrepreneurial managers tend to take the place of bureaucratsand bureaucrats tend to change into entrepreneurial managers.	<center><h4>III.  A Property Rights Approach</h4></center><p><a name="16r"><a name="17r"><a name="18r"><a name="19r"><a name="20r"></p><p><a name="21r"></p><p>	While marketable trading permits are a definite improvementover commands, they can be criticized on a number of counts.<ahref="#16">[16]</a>  One fault is that government dilutes theeffectiveness of the permit trading system through regulation,<ahref="#17">[17]</a> which replaces the market with a bureaucraticcommand structure.  As a result, whenever there is a "failure," it islabeled a "market failure," when in fact it is a government failure.<ahref="#18">[18]</a> Another difficulty is that if we took the Project88 approach<a href="#19">[19]</a> in a world of pervasiveexternalities, there would be a need for thousands ofgovernment-created and monitored markets for specific pollutants suchas SO<sub>2</sub>, CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, particulates, NO and NO<sub>2</sub>, not to mention the hundredsof "toxics" that are regulated one way or another.  Also, at presentthere are no proposals to allow cross-trading of various pollutionpermits and there will be great restrictions on the marketability ofrights of the same sort by geography.<a href="#20">[20]</a>  Thus,great rigidities would be introduced into the process.  We could nottake advantage of a drop in the seriousness of acid rain, for example,because the political process moves too slowly.  The result is animposition of an increasing series of side constraints on an economywith massive potential benefits of cross-trade (such as more NOX andless ozone) but no ability to handle these.<a href="#21">[21]</a>  Such government failures are endemic to the system.<p><a name="22r"></p><p>	To state this criticism in Coasian terms, the problem is thatmarkets have more to do with the terms of trade, with the opportunityof creating new linkages and new tradeoffs than with the production ofa rigid bundle of nontradeable goods. Coase's "problem of socialcost"<a href="#22">[22]</a> is relevant to all this debate and has yetto be understood by the market socialist school -- most andenvironmentalists.<p>	But perhaps the major fault with trading permits is that, whilethey allow market forces to allocate resources, they involve a basicand pervasive violation of property rights.  Basically, MPPs arelicenses to pollute, licenses to violate property rights.  Thus,trading permits are a form of market socialism because they allowmarket forces to operate, yet ignore property rights.  Martin Andersonexpresses the following view: Fortunately, there is a simple, effectiveapproach available -- long appreciated but underused.  An approachbased solidly on ... private property rights.</p><ul>	<p>	At its root all pollution is garbage disposal in one form or another. 	The essence of the problem is that our laws and the administration of	justice have not kept up with the refuse produced by the exploding	growth of industry, technology and science.	</p>		<p>	If you took a bag of garbage and dropped it on your neighbor's lawn, we	all know what would happen.  Your neighbor would call the police and	you would soon find out that the disposal of your garbage is	your responsibility, and that it must be done in a way that does not	violate anyone else's property rights.	</p>		<p>	But if you took that same bag of garbage and burned it in a backyard	incinerator, letting the sooty ash drift over the neighborhood,	the problem gets more complicated. The violation of property	rights is clear, but protecting them is more difficult. And when the	garbage is invisible to the naked eye, as much air and water	pollution is, the problem often seems insurmountable.	</p>		<p>	We have tried many remedies in the past. We have tried to dissuade	polluters with fines, with government programs whereby all pay	to clean up the garbage produced by the few, with a myriad of	detailed regulations to control the degree of pollution. Now	some even seriously propose that we should have economic incentives,	to charge polluters a fee for polluting -- and the more they pollute	the more they pay.  But that is just like taxing burglars as an	economic incentive to deter people from stealing your property,	and just as unconscionable.	</p>		<p>	The only effective way to eliminate serious pollution is to treat it	exactly for what it is -- garbage. Just as one does not have	the right to drop a bag of garbage on his neighbor's lawn, so	does one not have the right to place any garbage in the air or	the water or the earth, if it in any way violates the property	rights of others.	</p>		<p>	What we need are tougher clearer environmental laws that are enforced	-- not with economic incentives but with jail terms.	</p>		<p>	<a name="23r">	</p>	<p>	What the strict application of the idea of private property rights will	do is to increase the cost of garbage disposal. That increased	cost will be reflected in a higher cost for the products and services	that resulted from the process that produced the garbage. And that is	how it should be. Much of the cost of disposing of waste is already	incorporated in the price of the goods and services produced.	All of it should be. Then only those who benefit from the garbage	made will pay for its disposal.<a href="#23">[23]</a>	</p></ul><p>	A true market system would include both components -- a pricesystem and recognition of property rights.  Thus, TERs are a half-wayhouse.<p><a name="24r"><a name="25r"></p><p>	Is there a true market solution, one that depends on theprice system yet does not violate property rights?  There is. The firststep that must be taken in this direction is to establish a system ofclearly defined and enforceable property rights.<a href="#24">[24]</a> Once clearly defined, market forces will take over to determine whatlevel of pollution is optimal.  If firms pollute first, before enteringinto an agreement, the court system could be used to assess damages ifthe parties could not agree to a price. Such a system would provideincentives for companies to reduce the amount of discharge because theywould have to pay the full cost of their actions.<a href="#25">[25]</a><p><a name="26r"><a name="27r"><a name="28r"></p><p><a name="29r"><a name="30r"></p><p>	Such a system was in use in the USA until the nineteenth century.<ahref="#26">[26]</a> But then, in a series of cases, individuals'property rights were taken away when the courts sided with the propertyrights violators in a number of nuisance cases.<a href="#27">[27]</a> For example, if sparks from a passing train caused a farmer's field orbarn to burn, judges started to hold that the company that owned thetrain should not be liable for the damage for public policy reasons,<ahref="#28">[28]</a> the view being that it is better that a few farmersgo uncompensated than that trains stop running or be forced to pay thefull cost of their actions.<a href="#29">[29]</a>  This position, ofcourse, results in a basic violation of property rights, becausefarmers were being damaged but not compensated.  It is a classicexample of what Public Choice economists call rent-seeking,<ahref="#30">[30]</a> since some groups (farmers, in this case) areforced to pay for the benefits of other groups (railroad owners).  Ifcourts had held in favor of the farmers instead, railroad owners wouldhave been forced to find a way to reduce the amount of sparks theirtrains emitted, or pay the full cost of their activity.

Nor can these cases be got rid of as extreme cases, becausesuch cases are properly used for testing a principle.  Nor can it besaid that the jury settle such questions by finding there is nonuisance, though there is .... There must be, then, some principle onwhich such cases must be excepted.  It seems to me that that principlemay be deduced from the character of these cases, and is this, viz.,that those acts necessary for the common and ordinary use andoccupation of land and houses may be done, if conveniently done,without submitting those who do them to an action .... It is as muchfor the advantage of one owner as of another; for the very nuisance theone complains of, as the result of the ordinary use of his neighbour'sland, he himself will create in the ordinary use of his own, and thereciprocal nuisances are of a comparatively trifling character.

But where it is more than slight, orwhere there is measurable or detectable damage, the courts shouldrecognize liability and define the method by which the perpetrator isto be dealt with (pay damages, cease and desist, etc.). The importantthing is that the legal system clearly define property rights and howviolations of property rights are to be dealt with.

Where the emissions arecaused by just one person and the trespass is committed against justone person, the solution is simple.<a href="#38">[38]</a>  The perpetrator and the victimcan be clearly identified and they can trade.  The polluter can perhapsagree to pay the victim some mutually agreed upon price.  If theparties cannot agree, the pollution cannot occur.  But what about themany situations where the solution is not so simple?<a href="#39">[39]</a><p><a name="40r"><a name="41r"><a name="42r"></p><p>	Much pollution is the result of the "tragedy of the commons."<ahref="#40">[40]</a> In cases where ownership is in common, such aslakes, streams and air, nobody owns it.  Transferring these commonlyowned properties to private ownership<a href="#41">[41]</a> could go along way toward solving these externality problems.  While it may notbe politically feasible to privatize the Pacific Ocean in the nearfuture,<a href="#42">[42]</a> it is possible to privatize smallerbodies of water.  Government-owned lakes could be sold to the highestbidder, or could be given to the natural homesteaders: whoever owns theland at the shoreline.  In cases where such a lake is owned by morethan one owner, they could form a cooperative or corporation todetermine how the lake shall be used -- for boating, fishing,recreation, and so forth. They could collect fees in exchange forallowing nonowners to use their lake.  If someone wanted to dump wasteinto this holding, they could determine the amount they wished toaccept and the price.  If environmental groups do not want anyone todump any waste into a particular lake, they could enter into anagreement with the owner to pay a certain amount in exchange for theowner's promise not to allow such activity.  Or they could purchase thelake themselves.  In the case of streams, similar arrangements could bemade.<p><a name="43r"><a name="44r"><a name="45r"></p><p>	Property rights in water has evolved over many years and ismost highly developed in the Western United States, where water isscarce.<a href="#43">[43]</a>  Much of the property law that hasevolved in this area could be adapted to a private property regimeinvolving pollution.<a href="#44">[44]</a> Unfortunately, in the caseof water allocation in the Western United States, the state has oftenstepped in to prevent the market from functioning.  Government oftendecides how water rights should be allocated on the basis of interestgroup pressure rather than sound economics.<a href="#45">[45]</a><p><a name="46r"></p><p>	A similar system of property rights could be allowed to evolve inthe area of auto emissions.  At present, nearly all roads and highwaysare owned by government, another tragedy of the commons.  Yetgovernment ownership is by no means necessary.  Highways and roadscould be turned over to private parties,<a href="#46">[46]</a> whocould then establish rules for the use of their roads.  Autos that spewforth too much pollution could cause neighboring households to sue theowner of the road for nuisance.  It is easier to sue one of hundreds ofroad owners in the country than one of millions of drivers. This wouldprovide the proper incentive to the owners to regulate the amount offumes permitted on their property.  Autos that pollute too much simplywould not be allowed to use the road.<p><a name="47r"><a name="48r"></p><p>	The introduction of property rights has proven to be beneficial toconservation in a number of other cases.  For example, there is someworry among environmentalists and others that elephants will becomeextinct if something is not done to prevent their slaughter.  Thesolution was to ban the ivory trade.<a href="#47">[47]</a>  Yet such asolution does not make economic sense. If ivory is banned, it willbecome more rare, making trade in ivory more lucrative.  Prohibitingthe ivory trade will tend to actually increase rather than decreaseincentives.  The fact that such trade is illegal will attractindividuals who have few scruples.  If elephants were privatized, thatis, owned by individuals and private corporations, the danger of theirbecoming extinct would be vastly reduced.  But such a solution is notmere utopian polemics. There is empirical evidence to support it. InKenya and other East and Central African countries, governmentsresorted to a common property management strategy, whereas elephantswere owned by no one. As a result, the elephant population in that partof the world has declined by more than 50% in the last decade.<ahref="#48">[48]</a>  But in Zimbabwe, elephants are privately owned byregional tribal councils, who take an ownership interest.  As a result,the elephant population has increased. Further, Asian elephants, whichhave been domesticated for many years, are not in danger of extinction.<p>	A comparison might also be made between cattle and bison.  Inthe "wild west" period of U.S. history, bison (buffalos) were owned byno one.  They were hunted down and killed indiscriminately.  They werenot protected because they had no owners.  In contrast, cattle wereprivately owned by ranchers. As Americans became more wealthy, theystarted to eat more meat which, coupled with advances in technology andtransportation, greatly increased the demand for beef.  Although therewas poaching of cattle, just as in the case of buffalo, cattle werenever in danger of extinction.  Because cattle were always privatelyowned, their owners took an ownership interest by branding, fencingtheir herds, guarding them and shooting rustlers.  The law was on theirside because it was illegal to steal cattle.  Government protected theproperty rights of the cattle owners who exercised them.  The tragedyof the commons that applied to buffalo (and still exists today for someelephants) was avoided in the case of cattle because they wereprivately owned.  Could it be that there is some relationship betweenprivate property rights and the danger of species extinction?  Why isit that privately owned animals such as chickens, dogs, cats and cattleare not in danger of extinction, but wild animals like whales and baldeagles are?  It is clear that the solution to saving animals fromextinction would be to privatize them.<p><a name="49r"><a name="50r"></p><p>	While such a solution might be relatively easy to implementfor some species, such as bison, the privatization solution might bemore difficult for others like whales, dolphins, tuna and othermigratory sea animals.<a href="#49">[49]</a>  But even privateownership of these species is not impossible.  In the short run,portions of some bodies of water could be privatized so that only theowner would be permitted to harvest water-based animals in a certainwell-defined location.   Selling the continental shelves, rivers andlakes might be feasible in the short-term.  If lakes can be sold toprivate parties, can the Mediterranean Sea be far behind? In thelong-run, as technology improves, it might be possible to fence-offsome larger areas, perhaps by laser or sonar technology, so thatanimals from one sector would not travel onto another.  Once propertyrights are established, the market would tend to find solutions to suchproblems.<a href="#50">[50]</a>  But in the absence of property rights,there is no incentive to even attempt to find solutions because thereis no payoff.</p>	<center><h4>IV.  Additional Comments</h4></center><p><a name="51r"><a name="52r"></p><p>	Why is it that economists who usually favor pure or full freemarkets opt instead for TERs when it comes to pollution?<ahref="#51">[51]</a>  In some cases, it is because they cannotvisualize, or imagine, how a full private property rights free marketregime could actually function.  At least this is an implication thatemerges from reading works that do not even mention such analternative. In others, the market is rejected after what can best bedescribed as a superficial coverage, almost an afterthought.  But thereis at least one case where the market is considered in full detail --and then rejected outright in an intensive and exhaustive analysis. This is true of Dolan,<a href="#52">[52]</a> in a paper which we shallnow scrutinize.<p><a name="53r"><a name="54r"></p><p>	Dolan begins by describing what he takes to be the operationof a private property system in its confrontation with acid rain.  Atrue Coasian, he offers two scenarios, one in which "... it weredetermined that density of the pollution source did not convey theright to send clouds of noxious gases into the neighboring forest"<ahref="#53">[53]</a> and one in which it did.  We need not concernourselves with the second system of law, for despite the Coasiancontention that absent transactions costs and wealth effects eitheralternative will imply the same allocation of resources, this latterscenario would be anathema to a Lockean-oriented private propertyrights system.<a href="#54">[54]</a>  (If the pollution sourcehomesteaded the factory, and the forest owner in similar manner "mixedhis labor" with the forest, the former would never obtain the right tosend airborne pollutants to the latter.)</p><p>	In the words of Dolan,</p><ul>		<p>	<a name="55r">	</p>	<p>	The forester would begin by demanding that emissions cease.  In	response, the polluter might stop the offending activity or install	control equipment that allowed production to continue without further	emissions. Instead, the polluter might offer a payment to the	forester in exchange for allowing continued emissions. If a payment	less than the cost of abatement turned out to exceed the forester's	evaluation of the damage, a deal would be struck along these	lines. As still another alternative, the polluter might offer	to buy the forest outright and decide what to do about future	emissions on the basis of internal benefit-cost	calculations.<a href="#55">[55]</a> 	</p></ul>	<p><a name="56r"></p><p>	But our author rejects this market model (not "market-based model,"as he contends).<a href="#56">[56]</a>  In the terminology we are employing, the demandthat emissions cease is a pure or full free-market solution.  Dolan'sown proposal, TER, in contrast, is characterized as being"market-based," or a "quasi-market" alternative.	<p>	Why does Dolan reject the market? There are four reasons. First, scientific uncertainties.  Says Dolan,</p><ul>		<p>	<li>The causes of Mount Mitchell's dying trees, New York's and Canada's	dead lakes, and Vermont's summer haze are not known with	certainty.	</p>		<p>	<li>Even if air pollution is accepted as the culprit, no one area's	pollution can be traced to a particular source.	</p>		<p>	<li>The property rights of the owners of pollution sources, the owners of	damaged properties, and other parties indirectly affected are matters	of dispute, and:	</p>		<p>	<a name="57r">	</p>	<p>	<li>Even if the first three points were resolved, the transactions costs of	private negotiations between numerous source owners and numerous	owners of damaged property would appear to be	prohibitive.<a href="#57">[57]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="58r"><a name="59r"></p><p>	Let us consider these four objections each in turn.  In thefirst case, the uncertainty is due, our author informs us, to threefactors.  On the one hand, more than one pollutant, in combination, mayhave caused the problem, and assessing the damage caused by each"becomes difficult."<a href="#58">[58]</a>  Yes, difficult, but this is no reason to throwthe baby out with the bath water.  Why should this complication, on itsown, serve as a justification for rejection of a private propertysystem upon which our entire western civilization may be said to bebased? Surely, our jurisprudence is set up to deal with the challengeof combined causes, and does so in a myriad of other contexts. Inautomobile accidents, for example, there is contributory negligence. Toeach person is apportioned a part of the blame, and the penalty isbased on this allocation.<a href="#59">[59]</a><p><a name="60r"></p><p>	On the other hand, there are "non linearities and thresholdeffects."<a href="#60">[60]</a>  It is worth quoting him in full on this:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="60r"><a name="61r">	</p>	<p>	One such non-linearity concerns the formation of acid rain.  The	rate of formation depends not only on the presence of precursors --	the oxides of nitrogen and sulfur emitted by pollution sources	-- but also on the presence of oxidizing agents, which promote	acid formation, and alkaline substances, which retard acid formation.	 Depending on the presence of oxidizing and alkaline agents, an	increment of pollution might add greatly, slightly, or not at	all to the acidity of precipitation.  Another threshold effect	involves the 'buffering' properties of soils in areas where	acid precipitation falls. Buffering compounds in the soil may	for years prevent acid rain from doing environmental damage.  At some	point, however, cumulative acid deposition exhausts the buffering	capacity and damage rapidly escalates.<a href="#61">[61]</a>	</p></ul><p>	Alkaline substances and buffering compounds need not trouble us. They are an irrelevant complication.  They reduce the effect of thenoxious airborne chemical, so the profit seeker can have no realcomplaint about them. Oxidizing agents, in contrast, are a completelydifferent matter. These exacerbate the harmful effects of the trespass,and in Dolan's view, presumably, it is improper for the court to blamethe polluter since he created only some of the harm, the rest beinglaid at the door of the oxidizing agent.<p><a name="62r"></p><p>	However, there are already legal precedents on the books thatare fully capable of dealing with this objection. In order to see this,let us consider the case of ordinary (human) trespass, not theintrusion of pollutants onto the property of the victim. In the moreusual case, let us say, a second story man breaks into the premises ofthe homeowner. Unbeknownst to the intruder, the victim has a weak heartand is easily frightened (the analog of the oxidizing agent, in thatthis personality characteristic amplifies the harm committed by theperpetuator of the crime.) As a result of the trespass, the homeownerdies. Is the trespasser guilty of manslaughter? Yes, because of thedoctrine of "you take your victim as you find him."<ahref="#62">[62]</a> Similarly, if the mugger commits assault andbattery upon a heart attack proven victim who dies as a result, he isor should be considered guilty of manslaughter no matter how light thebodily contact.<p>	To return to the polluter, he should be forced to "take theatmosphere as he finds it." If oxidizing agents worsen the harm of hisemissions, he should, in like manner, be held responsible for theentire damages, both that part created by his pollution, and that addedto this by the oxidizing agents in the air.		<p>	On the third hand, Dolan points to the fact that	</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="63r">	</p>	<p>	Acid rain does not kill trees directly. The mechanisms involved	may be quite complicated. To give one example, Lee Klinger, working	with the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder,	Colo., sees a link between forest diebacks and certain mosses	that are nearly always present in dying forests. The mosses produce	organic acids that mobilize aluminum naturally present in the	soil, forming compounds toxic to the feeder roots of trees. Although	the mosses are naturally present in most forests, their growth	appears to be greatly promoted by acid	precipitation.<a href="#63">[63]</a>	</p></ul><p>	But we have already answered this objection. Here, the mossesbecome the catalytic agents, increasing the harm.<p>	Next, our author considers the transportation problem, and again isworthy of quotation at length.</p>	<ul>	<p>	Even if the available evidence linking environmental damage to	pollution is accepted, there remains the problem of tracing the	acid rain at a given site to a particular source of pollution.	To date, research on transportation models for pollution has	been able to give only general, probabilistic answers.  In general,	pollution is known to travel from west to east, which is unfortunate	in that the largest concentrations of emission sources are in	the midwestern United States, and the most vulnerable environments	along the eastern seaboard. Some pollution is thought to cross	the U.S. -- Canadian border, often from south to north, but in	some cases of some emitters in Ontario, it travels from north	to south.  Pollution from sources in the east is often blown	out to sea, where the resulting acid precipitation is thought	to be relatively harmless.	</p>		<p>	Incomplete knowledge of pollution transportation pathways is a	significant complication in devising regulatory solutions to the acid	rain problem. It is an even more serious barrier to implementing	market-based pollution control efforts.  Unless it is known where the	pollution from a given source travels, there is no way to know	who is entitled to enjoin whom, who should negotiate with whom,	or who should compensate whom.	</p>		<p>	<a name="64r">	</p>	<p>.	....It has been suggested that major pollution sources could be	required to tag their emissions with distinctive combinations	of isotope markers that could be read at downwind sites subject	to acid precipitation. If technically feasible, that would certainly	clarify some of the transportation issues. However, the problem	would remain that shifting atmospheric currents would mix pollutants	and deposit them in constantly changing and unpredictable patterns,	so that a system of compensation founded on the transportation	pathways of a base period would not necessarily remain valid	for subsequent periods.<a href="#64">[64]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="65r"></p><p>	The first problem here is the short shrift Dolan gives to theisotope solution. One is tempted to reply, "So what" that changing windconditions will deposit pollutants in "constantly changing andunpredictable patterns." Criminals first rob people in neighborhood A,then in B, then in C in "constantly changing and unpredictablepatterns." Does this mean that our society should not pursue criminals,wherever they operate?<a href="#65">[65]</a>  Such would seem to be theimplication of the Dolan analysis. If so, it is problematic.<p>	But there is a second difficulty as well -- the virtually completefailure of the discipline of environmental forensics to emerge.Forensic medicine, in contrast, is a growing and healthy science.  Theforces of law and order are now able to trace perpetrators based on thetiniest bit of their blood, semen, saliva or flesh (as under thefingernails) left on the bodies of their victims. But suppose that wenever had laws against murder. It is unlikely in the extreme that anysuch capabilities would have been developed.<p><a name="66r"></p><p>	Something of this sort seems to have occurred with regard toairborne pollutants. Ever since the 1830s,<a href="#66">[66]</a> it hasnot been illegal to trespass soot particles onto the property of otherpeople for reasons compatible with, although by no means the same asoffered by Dolan.  Is it any wonder that environmental forensics hasnot only atrophied, but died stillborn? Now reverse this situation, atleast in the form of a mental experiment. Suppose, that is, that thejurisprudence in effect until the 1830s (a more or less rigid system ofproperty rights, where polluters were subject to fines, injunctions,and so forth) had instead continued up to the present day.<p>	Is there any doubt that we would have long since been blessedwith a robust and accomplished industry dedicated to environmentalforensics, which would have been fully capable of discharging theobligations Dolan "regrets" we can not now accomplish? In those earliertimes, the chemical and atmospheric difficulties posed by this authorwould have been easier to deal with -- matched by the lesser scientificcapabilities of that epoch. The present challenges look so dauntingbecause we are berift of the some 150 years of R&D that would havetaken place had the law upheld the victims' property rights in thatbygone era.<p><a name="67r"><a name="68r"></p><p>	Dolan's third objection to the free enterprise system is perhapshis weakest. It consists solely of the claim that there are disputes asto the property rights of the polluters. The implication is that untilthese disputes are resolved (perfectly? to the satisfaction of allconcerned parties?) we cannot go ahead and implement the law oftrespass. He admits that the common or natural law view is that peoplehave a right "to exclude pollutants from their air space"<a href="#67">[67]</a> but asserts that "counterclaims can be made thatare difficult to dismiss out of hand."<a href="#68">[68]</a><p>	There are many difficulties with this view. Even if it were true, itby no means follows that the usual structures concerning privateproperty rights could not be implemented with regard to acid rain;there are "disputes" about practically everything -- as anyone canattest who has read a recent issue of any law review. Were we to allowdisputatiousness to cancel law, we would be in a very sorry stateindeed. In any case, it by no means follows that aweakened-by-disputations common law -- even if Dolan could show this --would be inferior to the TER scheme.<p>	Fortunately, we need not press on to a benefit-cost analysis ofthese two alternatives. For it is reasonably easy to "dismiss out ofhand" all of the disputations created, manufactured or discovered byDolan. Let us now consider them.</p><p>First, we are told that:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="69r">	</p>	<p>	Midwestern utilities are joined by producers of Appalachian high	sulfur coal. The coal interests point out that they have made	long-lived investments and entered into long-term contracts to	supply fuel to utilities. These contracts met all environmental	regulations in force at the time they were entered into. To	change the rules of the game now would impose job and revenue	losses that should not go uncompensated.<a href="#69">[69]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="70r"><a name="71r"></p><p>	But it is easy to dismiss this argument "out of hand" sinceit is identical, in logical form, to the one used by the slave ownersof the Confederacy, after they lost the Civil War.  The plantationowner, too, argued that his initial purchases of slaves, and laterdominion over them "was … in accordance with all federal and state …standards in force at the time (that these events occurred).<ahref="#70">[70]</a>  And Dolan is as correct in his argument as are the"midwestern utilities" in theirs.<a href="#71">[71]</a> Slavery, afterall, was perfectly legal in the United States, up until the time of theemancipation proclamation.  In like manner, if the utilities hold"first in time" rights, then so do the enslavers. If the midwesternpolluters "should be compensated" for the pollution abatement costs,"then this privilege should (have been) extended to" the owners ofblack human beings as well.<p><a name="72r"></p><p>	Put in this way, however, it is easy to see the fallacy ofthe argument. Just as in the case of the slave owners, the utilitieswere given "rights" which clearly did not belong to them as a matter ofnatural law.<a href="#72">[72]</a>  It is gross legal positivism of theworst sort to insist, as does Dolan, that because a legislature saw fitto enact certain rules, that they have any proper force. This sort oflegal positivism can be used to justify not only slavery, but Naziconcentration camps, Soviet gulags, and any and all other atrocitiesthat man has perpetrated on other men under the guise of a spuriouslegality.<p>	As for the second part of this argument, that concerning thecomplaints of the producers of Appalachian high sulfur coal, there werefactors complementary to the slave holding plantation system, too, theowners of which were rendered out-of-pocket upon its demise. Thehandcuff manufacturers, whip makers, runaway slave chasers, and soforth, had also "made long lived investments, and entered intolong-term contracts to supply" factors of production to the slavesystem. When that rascal, Lincoln, freed the slaves, he "change(d) therules of the game ... and impose(d) job and revenue losses that shouldnot go uncompensated."<p>	Bosh and tosh. Rather than being compensated, the slave ownersand their allies in the whip business should have been subjected to theseverest penalties of the law.  This also applies to the case of theNazi concentration camp guards, the oven builders, and the CommunistEast German border guards who quite "legally" shot to death hundreds oftheir countrymen whose only "crime" was to attempt to escape that vastprison. Similarly, for the midwestern utilities and Appalachian coalinterests. Their claims for compensation are an outrage, and should be"dismissed out of hand." The real issue is whether, and to what extent,they should be penalized.<p>	Dolan's fourth and last point concerns transactions costconsiderations. Again, we allow him to speak for himself:</p>	<ul>	<p>	Consider a simple example. Suppose I am looking for a piece of land on	which to build a drag strip. In doing so, I must face the possibility	that although some people would consider a neighbourhood drag	strip an amenity, others are likely to consider it a nuisance.	Fortunately, there are many possible sites for the strip. Some	will be large enough that noise from the strip will not carry	beyond the property line, although, of course, it will be costly to	buy so much acreage. Alternatively, there will be smaller, less	expensive sites where I can first negotiate an option to buy,	and then negotiate with the neighbours regarding compensation for the	noise. Through a process of competitive bargaining in which I	simultaneously negotiate with owners of various drag-strip sites and	with the neighbours of those sites, I finally settle on the	alternative that is least costly to me. Because all externalities	have been internalized through the competitive bargaining process,	that will also be the most efficient solution from the point of	view of the community as a whole.	</p>	<p>	Regrettably, quite aside from the scientific and legal uncertainties,	the drag-strip model is not workable in the case of acid rain.	Two features of the acid rain case enormously raise the transaction	costs of a privately negotiated agreement. One is the fact that	the number of parties involved is far greater -- dozens of electric	utilities, thousands of smaller industrial pollution sources,	and millions of downwind property owners. The other is the fact	that the pollution sources that cause the greatest concern are	already in place, as are their sources of fuel supply, their	customers, and their work forces. Thus, in place of the ex-ante	competitive bargaining of the drag-strip model, the acid rain	issue involves ex-post bargaining among parties who are already	locked into inflexible relationships with one another by virtue	of non-redeployable, site-specific investments. These circumstances	encourage individual parties to play the free-rider if they are	on the paying side or to hold out for a greater share of the	potential gains from any agreement if they are on the receiving	side. If free-riders, holdouts, and the sheer problem of numbers	inflate transaction costs to the point where they exceed the	potential gains from an agreement, nothing will be done.	</p>	<p>	<a name="73r">	</p>	<p>	What is meant by "doing nothing" depends, it should be noted, on how	property rights issues are resolved. If utilities' claims to free use	of the airshed are upheld, then doing nothing means letting pollution	continue unabated, even if the marginal gains from pollution	abatement exceed the marginal costs of abatement. If the claims	of downwind landowners are fully upheld against the polluters,	then "doing nothing" means no pollution. Sources must either	shut down or install equipment that will reduce pollution to an	imperceptible level, even if at that opposite margin, marginal	abatement costs exceed the marginal benefits of abatement. Neither	extreme is optimal, viewed apart from transaction	costs.<a href="#73">[73]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="74r"></p><p>	This is perhaps the strongest of his four arguments, but it,too, is flawed. First of all, Dolan severely underestimates the abilityof the market to internalize externalities, or, in his own terminology,to convert the acid rain situation into one at least approximating thatof the "drag strip." An alternative way of stating this is that heunduly minimizes the effects of socialistic acts of government in othersectors of the economy in rendering problems in this part moreintractable. A case in point is the large numbers of contractingparties, for example, millions of automobile owners, who pollute theatmosphere. However, if government were to allow private ownership ofstreets, roads and highways,<a href="#74">[74]</a> the numbers would bereduced -- at one fell swoop -- from several million to perhaps severaldozen.<p>	The point is that, under private ownership, no one would suethe individual automobile owner-drivers.  Instead, one would holdresponsible the highway corporation, for running, as it were, a"pollution bawdy house."  One of the reasons the legal scenario isdismissed out of hand is that it is difficult to see how it would bepractical to sue millions of people.  But privatization renders theobjection less telling.<p>	As we have seen, the common law tradition, on the basis of which weare writing, would interpret "doing nothing" not as "letting pollutioncontinue unabated." But it would not require "no pollution," either,the only other option offered by Dolan. More precisely, natural lawwould allow no pollution that violates the property rights of victims,but it would allow any and all emissions that do not amount totrespass.<p>	How could emissions into the air be justified on this basis,given large numbers of transactors (although not as many as per Dolan),hold outs, free riders, and so forth. Our author himself has mentionedor suggested several options:scrubbers, isotope marker emission tags,cleaner burning fuels.<p><a name="75r"></p><p>	In addition, property rights themselves can come to the rescue,paradoxically, from the perspective of the "first in time" concept wehave rejected above. We did so, before, because the "rights" given outby the government to the utility polluters were illegitimate. They wereestablished by arbitrary state edict. There is, however, a legitimatesource of these rights: the Lockean homesteading principle.<ahref="#75">[75]</a><p>	How would this work? Suppose, for example, that a factory hadbeen polluting an area of nine square miles, while claiming ownershipover only a central core of this area of one square mile, while otherpeople had moved into the additional eight square miles after thefactory emissions had begun. Under these circumstances, the firm wouldown the property rights to its one square mile, but the pollutionrights to the other eight square miles. This would not be, as perDolan, due to legislative legerdemain; on the contrary, it would flowfrom the Lockean insight that he who first uses a previously non-ownedresource, by that fact alone arrives at a legitimate ownership rightover it. This, after all, presumably, is how the firm established itstitle over the one central square mile it physically occupies.<p>	Under these conditions, the amount of pollution that wouldensure under a property rights regime would be far greater than thezero level or "no pollution" claimed by Dolan, if "the claims ofdownwind landowners are upheld against the polluters." One might evenclaim, as we do, that the optimal amount of emissions would ensue underthese institutional arrangements.<p>	Another point is that the problem of the "holdout" as is depicted inthe Dolan analysis is unsatisfactory. Indeed, the very terminologyemployed here implies that the holdout doesn't "really" value hishomestead, or peace and quiet, or clean air, at all, let alone at theelevated level he says he does. He is merely "holding out" for greaterfinancial remuneration. But how can this author, or any other outsideobserver, know this? On the contrary, if preferences are subjective, wecannot treat the holdout differently than any other market participantwith a reservation price for his property.<p>	That being said, it must also be mentioned that it is by no means asimpossible to solve the problem of possibly strategic behavior asclaimed by Dolan. In order to see this, we have only to reflect uponthe concept of options. A factory is attempting to locate in a placewhere there will be hundreds, if not thousands, of pollutees. It neednot commit to that one area. Instead, it could purchase options to buysmoke emissions rights, at stipulated prices, at some half dozenplaces. Then, if holdouts are discovered, in two or three of theseareas, they can be played off one another.<p>	But there is a further difficulty with this author's position.In his view, the main barrier to markets is unacceptably largetransactions costs. His solution is not a market in property rights,but instead a "quasi market" scheme of TERs. Transaction costs,however, like all other costs, are amenable to being reduced. But thiscan occur if and only if markets are allowed to function.<p>	Historically, computer costs, television costs, automobilecosts, were all very high, indeed, exceedingly so, when these productswere first introduced. They were priced out of the reach of the middleclass; they were playthings of the rich.  But then, however, thanks tospecialization, division of labor, investment, and so forth, thesecosts were all markedly reduced. If transaction costs are ever tofollow this pattern, a result Dolan must at least implicitly favorsince he mentions it as a prime obstacle to markets, we must allowproperty rights, not ride rough shod over them as in the MPP proposal.<p>	This author's public policy recommendation, then, must be viewed as arecipe for the very market failure it decries. For without upholdingthe claims of downwind landowners as against polluters (who do not ownthe requisite pollution rights) a market in these rights is renderedall the less likely.<p><a name="76r"></p><p>	Dolan<a href="#76">[76]</a> is mired in a static model notonly with regard to transaction costs, but also as far as smokeabatement technology is concerned. Consider the open ended smokestack.Open ended, that is, to the air and thus to the property of otherpeople. Is it so difficult to imagine that if in the 1830s the legalregime of property rights had not been overturned, that we would bylong before now have enjoyed a nonpollution intensive technology wherethere were no open ended smokestacks? Where these pipes would have leadback to chemical cisterns, the latter to capture otherwise errant sootparticles?<p>	Dolan ends his analysis with an obeisance to cost benefit analysis.And yet, as we have seen, this concept is fundamentally.  Utility ofdifferent people is simply incomparable.  How does this author knowthat at the "opposite margin (upholding victim-landowner rights)marginal abatement costs exceed the marginal benefits of abatement." He cannot know, nor can he adduce any evidence for this conclusion.<p>	The beauty of the property rights approach, in contrast, is that itneed not become mired in these subjectivist quicksands. It assignsproperty to its rightful owners, and places the burden of purchase onthose who could alter these allocations.</p>	<center><h4>V.  Conclusion</h4></center><p>	The introduction of marketable trading permits into environmentaleconomics is a major innovation in that permits allow "market" forcesto be unleashed into what would otherwise be a command system. Marketable trading permits result in a much more efficient allocationof resources, which makes it possible to have both less pollution andlower operating costs.  Yet they suffer from a major structuraldeficiency because trading permits are, in effect, a license topollute, a license to violate property rights.  A true market regimerecognizes rather than ignores property rights.  The problem withrecognizing property rights in the area on environmental economics isthat air, water, roads, many forests, and so forth, are publicly owned,which really means owned by no one.  As a first step towardimplementing a true market regime, we must find ways to privatize these"commons" so that market forces will be able to operate to reducepollution and costs.  Much research needs to be done in this area, butnow that the problem has been identified, we at least know in whichdirection research should proceed.</p>	<hr>	<p>	The authors would like to thank Vivian Lugo and John Tortorafor their research assistance.

Webster's New World Dictionary of the American Language,	College Edition (1964).  If the market fails to do something	that someone thinks it should do, it is called a market failure.

For examples of government failure in the area of the	environment, see The Yellowstone Primer: Land and Resource Management	in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (John A.

But this solution suffers	from several defects, the most important one being that  taxation	does not compensate the victims.  While it can alter behavior,	any funds that are raised go to the government, not the victims. And	taxing the perpetrators does not necessarily reduce the amount	of effluents, it merely raises the cost, while permitting them	to continue to violate the property rights of the victims.

Ludwig von	Mises, Epistemological Problems of Economics 165(1976). So it	makes no sense to speak about externalities that generate a	divergence between private and social costs.  Yet that is the	argument economists often make for imposing an excise tax on energy. 	While negative externalities should concern policymakers, it is	not because they cause private and social costs to diverge, but	because they impose private costs on nonconsenting parties. 	Thus, there is no way to arrive at Pareto optimality.  But even	if it were possible, it would be possible only for an instant because	conditions and knowledge change over time, rendering even a	temporarily optimal tax inefficient.  Roy E.

Kantians would be	quick to point out that to hold the individual good to be subservient	to the common good is immoral because individuals would then be	means rather than ends.  Hitler and Stalin would disagree with	that position.  Richard N. Langlois makes some of these points	in Cost-Benefit Analysis, Environmentalism, and Rights, 2 Cato	J. 279-300 (1982).  See also Walter Block, Coase and Demsetz on	Private Property Rights, 1 J. Libertarian Stud. 111-115 (Spring,	1977).		<a href="#29r">Return</a><p><a name="30"><li>"Rent-seeking" might be defined as seeking special	privileges or protection from government or getting others to pay for	your benefits. For example, cable television companies are	rent-seekers when they attempt to obtain a government-protected	monopoly. Chrysler is a rent-seeker when it asks Congress to	pass legislation that prevents Japanese autos from entering the	United States.  Railroads are rent-seekers when they ask government	to absolve them from liability for the damage their locomotives'	sparks have done to farmers. For detailed analyses of rent-seeking,	see Towards a Theory of a Rent-seeking Society (James M. Buchanan,	Robert Tollison and Gordon Tullock eds. 1980); The Political Economy	of Rent-Seeking (Charles K. Rowley, Robert D. Tollison and	Gordon Tullock eds. 1988).	</p>	<p>	However, there are problems with using the phrase rent-seeking	to indicate what is in effect theft. First, it impunes the ancient	and honorable practice of paying and collecting rent. The landlord	has been under enough unjustified attack; we do not need to add	to it further. Second, rent-seeking has an alternative meaning,	the attempt to gain as much of the consumers' or producers' surpluses	as possible from commercial activity. For what is wrong with	that?  We all do it in the marketplace, where it is mutually	beneficial.  It is a mutually beneficial enterprise. But when	the government becomes involved, it becomes an attempt to seize	resources from others against their will. We should call a spade a	spade.  This is booty seeking, or stealing or theft. It has nothing	to do with rent in either the economic or legal commercial sense. For	further on this, see Freedom, Democracy and Economic Welfare,	Proceedings of an International Symposium 207-10 (Michael A.	Walker ed. 1988).	</p>		<a href="#30r">Return</a><p><a name="31"><li>Ryan v.

State, 7 Baxt., Tenn.,	151 (1874) (where there was a slaughterhouse near a highway). 	But the major questions to be answered are when is the harm "slight"	and when is the conduct "reasonable"?  To be in keeping with	the principle of corrective justice, these answers must be based on	individual rights, not on utilitarian or public policy grounds.	 The balancing of interests doctrine has no place here.

He hasauthored or edited more than 40 books and monographs and has writtenmore than 300 articles and reviews for a variety of professional andscholarly journals.</p><hr noshade><p>This article originally appeared in the Northwestern Journal of InternationalLaw & Business, Volume 14, No. 3, Spring, 1994, pp. 549-565</p><hr><h4>I.  Introduction</h4><p>	The vast majority of articles and books that have been writtenabout trade and trade policy--nearly all--look at trade from autilitarian perspective. Utilitarians take the position that if freetrade is a good policy, it is good because the vast majority benefits. Free trade gives consumers more choices. It gives them lower prices. It creates more jobs than it destroys.  It is a positive-sum game.  Anunderlying assumption of most utilitarian-based trade arguments is thatgovernments have some inherent right to regulate trade.	<p>	<a name="1r">This article looks at trade policy from a differentperspective. While utilitarian approaches to trade have some value, andwhile utilitarian arguments ofte--and rightly--conclude that free andunrestricted trade is the best policy, they do so for the wrong reason.This article points out that the real reason why totally free andunrestricted trade is good is because it is the only trade policy thatdoes not violate individual rights.  While governments have theauthority to regulate trade,<a href="#1">[1]</a> they do not have theright to do so. It is possible to have the authority to do somethingeven though one does not have the right.  An extreme example toillustrate this point would be the situation in Nazi Germany, whereHitler's death camp goons had the authority to murder Jews, gypsies andPoles.  Although they had the authority to do so, they did not have theright.  The same is true of governments and trade policy.  Governmentshave the authority to regulate trade, and they have the power, but theydo not have the right, because the regulating of trade betweenconsenting adults violates property and contract rights and goes beyondthe legitimate scope of government..<p>	<a name="2r"><a name="3r"><a name="4r">Of course, this positionassumes that governments have a limited role.  If one begins with thepremise that the legitimate role of government is restricted to theprotection of life, liberty and property,<a href="#2">[2]</a> and thatindividuals should otherwise be free to regulate their own affairs,then the role of government does not include trade regulation (orrather trade restriction),<a href="#3">[3]</a> because such activity isbeyond the legitimate scope of government.  When government goes beyondthese basic functions of protecting life, liberty and property, itbecomes a redistributive state.<a href="#4">[4]</a> In order to givesomething to some individuals or groups, it must first take somethingfrom others.  That is because governments have no resources of theirown.  Whatever resources they have they must first take from someone.	<p>	Frederic Bastiat, the nineteenth century French economist andphilosopher, had the following view of what determines whether a law isa good one or a bad one:</p>	<ul>	<p>	See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and	gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong.  See if the law	benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what	the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.	</p>		<p>	<a name="5r">	Then abolish this law without delay, for it is not only an evil itself,	but also it is a fertile source for further evils because it invites	reprisals. If such a law--which may be an isolated case--is not	abolished immediately, it will spread, multiply, and develop	into a system.<a href="#5">[5]</a>	</p></ul><a name="6r"><a name="7r"><a name="8r"><a name="9r"><a name="10r"><p>	Such laws constitute legal plunder for Bastiat because theyallow some individuals to use the force of government to rob others.<ahref="#6">[6]</a>  And that is what trade laws like NAFTA, GATT and theothers do.<a href="#7">[7]</a>  These agreements are not true freetrade agreements, although they do contain elements of free trade.NAFTA,<a href="#8">[8]</a> GATT<a href="#9">[9]</a> and the other tradeagreements that are hundreds or even thousands of pages long are notreally about free trade.  They are about how the plunder gained fromprotectionism is to be divvied up.  In the case of NAFTA, for example,protectionist policies in some areas are allowed to exist for 15 moreyears.<a href="#10">[10]</a>  So those who benefit by protectionistpolicies have the legal authority to fleece consumers for anotherdecade and a half.  If NAFTA were a true free trade agreement, it wouldonly require one sentence, not hundreds of pages.  That sentence mightread something like this: "As of January 1, 1994, all trade exclusivelyinvolving Mexico, the United States and/or Canada will be treated thesame as trade involving New Jersey and Kansas."  But NAFTA (and thenumerous other trade agreements that could be named) do not have suchlanguage.  They go into great detail describing which special interestis protected for how long.  Farmers, the steel industry, the autoindustry, the textile industry, and countless other special interestgroups all receive special deals in many of these so-called "free"trade agreements.  These free trade laws have developed into thesystems that Bastiat warned us about.	<p>	Part II of this article reviews utilitarian approaches to tradepolicy and points out the weaknesses of the utilitarian approach.  PartIII presents the rights approach to trade policy, which is superior tothe utilitarian approach for several reasons.  Part IV summarizes thearticle and presents conclusions.	<h4>II.  Utilitarian Approaches To Trade Policy</h4><h4>A. Free Trade Results in Lower Prices</h4><a name="11r"><a name="12r"><a name="13r"><a name="14r"><p>	The free trade literature<a href="#11">[11]</a> is repletewith examples of how free, unregulated trade results in lower prices.<ahref="#12">[12]</a>  But such empirical evidence is not needed to provethe point.  This conclusion can be reached a priori.<ahref="#13">[13]</a>  It just makes sense that prices are lower wherethere is competition than where there is not. Economists would say thatthe supply curve shifts to the right when competitors are permitted toenter a particular market.  And as any student of price theory knows,when the supply curve shifts to the right, the price declines.<ahref="#14">[14]</a>	<p>	Monopoly has just the opposite effect on prices.  Where thereis monopoly, prices tend to be higher than where there is competition. Trade policies that restrict competition give a partial or totalmonopoly to the supplier(s) that are presently in the market.  Andtheir incentive to reduce price to gain market share is reduced ornonexistent because they already have the market to themselves.  IfGeneral Motors were the only auto manufacturer allowed to sell cars inthe United States, it would reduce prices only because it wanted to puttwo cars in every garage, not because it wanted to compete with foreignauto producers.  Because if it were the only company permitted to sellcars in the domestic market, there would be no foreign competition tobe concerned about.	<p>	Free trade also means the absence of tariffs.  And tariffs aretacked on to the prices that consumers must pay for foreign products. So this tacking will not take place in a truly free trade regimebecause tariffs will be zero.  So whether a protectionist policy takesthe form of a tariff or a trade barrier that prevents foreign producersfrom competing in the domestic market, a policy of free trade leads tolower prices.  Either the supply is increased because foreign producersare allowed to sell in the domestic market, or tariffs are zero.	<a name="15r"><a name="16r"><p>	Using the antidumping laws to beat up on foreign competitorsalso has a tendency to raise the prices consumers must pay forproducts.<a href="#15">[15]</a> Antidumping laws put a chilling effecton price competition.  The only way that foreign competitors caninsulate themselves from being hit with an antidumping investigation isto keep their prices relatively high, and even then they are not fullyprotected.  It is possible for a foreign producer to be found guilty ofdumping even if it charges the same price for its product everywhere ithas sales.<a href="#16">[16]</a><h4>B. Free Trade Increases Consumer Choice</h4><p>	A policy of free trade also increases consumer choice.  Protectionistmeasures such as quotas permit only a limited supply of a foreignproduct to be sold in the domestic market.  So consumers that want topurchase a product that is subject to a quota may be precluded fromdoing so because there just aren't enough units of the product to goaround.	<p>	If the restrictive trade policy takes the form of a tariff instead ofa quota, consumer choices are still limited because the tariffincreases the price they must pay.  Having a high price serves to limitconsumer choices because not all consumers can afford to pay the higherprice.	<a name="17r"><a name="18r"><p>	If the protectionist policy takes the form of an antidumpinginvestigation, some foreign producers will decide not to do business inthe United States rather than comply with the administrative burdensthat come with an antidumping investigation.  Matsushita, for example,decided to abandon its small business telephone system sales<ahref="#17">[17]</a> to the United States, thus losing more than $50million in export sales,<a href="#18">[18]</a> because the CommerceDepartment demanded that Matsushita translate 3,000 pages of financialdocuments from Japanese into English.  The request (demand) was made ona Friday afternoon, and the project was supposed to be completed by thefollowing Monday morning. Being found guilty of dumping can alsopreclude a foreign company from doing business in the United States, orcan force a company to raise its price to the extent that its productsare priced out of the market.<h4>C. Protectionism Destroys More Jobs Than It Saves</h4><a name="19r"><a name="20r"><a name="21r"><a name="22r"><a name="23r"><a name="24r"><a name="25r"><a name="26r"><p>	Numerous studies have found that protectionist trade policiesdestroy more jobs than they save.  One study found that a certainprotectionist policy would save 36,000 apparel manufacturing jobs butdestroy 58,000 jobs in the retailing end of the apparel industry.<ahref="#19">[19]</a>  That equals a job loss/gain ratio of 1.6 to 1.<ahref="#20">[20]</a>  A study of the effects of the 1984 voluntaryrestraint agreement on steel imports found that the agreement saved16,900 jobs in the steel industry but destroyed 52,400 jobs in theindustries that use steel,<a href="#21">[21]</a> for a loss/gain ratioof 3.1 to 1.<a href="#22">[22]</a> Another study of steel importrestraints estimated that a particular protectionist policy would save27,072 jobs and destroy 40,927 jobs,<a href="#23">[23]</a> for a ratioof more than 1.5 to 1.<a href="#24">[24]</a>  Another study determinedthat a 15 percent import quota in the steel industry would save 26,000jobs in the steel industry and destroy 93,000 jobs in the industriesthat import steel,<a href="#25">[25]</a> for a loss/gain ratio of 3.6to 1.<a href="#26">[26]</a><h4>D. Problems With Utilitarian Approaches To Trade Policy</h4><p>	There are several problems with taking a utilitarian approach totrade issues. The fatal flaw is that the utilitarian approach ignoresproperty and contract rights.  But there are other weaknesses as well.	<a name="27r"><p>	One weakness with the utilitarian approach is that it is notpossible to accurately measure gains and losses.<a href="#27">[27]</a> So if the goal is to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number,one must work with estimates.  Economics textbooks present theirexamples of the application of marginal utility theory in terms ofunits, which they call utils.  Each util is assigned a numerical value. And with each additional purchase, the marginal utility declines. 	<a name="28r"><a name="29r"><p>	For example, let's say that Jane is very hungry.  She goesinto a fast-food restaurant and orders a hamburger for $1.  Since sheis very hungry, the value of the hamburger, to her, is 10 utils.  Andsince $1 is worth only 3 utils to her,<a href="#28">[28]</a> hersatisfaction is increased by surrendering the $1, worth 3 utils, for ahamburger that is worth 10 utils.<a href="#29">[29]</a>  She has gainedto the extent of 7 utils. After finishing the first hamburger, she mustdecide whether consuming a second hamburger would increase herhappiness.  If she values the second hamburger at 6 utils and the nextdollar in her purse at 3 utils, she will decide to purchase a secondhamburger because doing so will increase her satisfaction. So sheexchanges a dollar, worth 3 utils, for the second hamburger, worth 6utils.  After consuming the second hamburger, she must decide whetherto buy a third hamburger.  If the value of a third hamburger to her isonly 2 utils, she will decide not to buy, since she is better offkeeping her dollar, which is valued at 3 utils, rather than exchangingit for something that has a value to her of only 2 utils. 	<p>	The problem inherent in using this approach is that utils are definedin terms of definite, measurable units, whereas choices are actuallyranks.  We can say that she prefers two hamburgers to $2, but we cannotsay that she gains 6 utils by making an exchange.  Economics textbookwriters use utils to illustrate how the marginal utility theory works. But utils actually do not exist.	<p>	Attempting to apply the marginal utility theory to internationaltrade presents some problems. For example, if a certain protectionistmeasure is applied to a particular product, we cannot determine byprecise measurement whether the gains received by the domesticproducers exceed the losses incurred by domestic consumers?  And itshould also be pointed out that domestic producers and consumers arenot the only ones affected by protectionist policies. Foreignproducers, their employees, the companies that would otherwisetransport the foreign product to the domestic market, the domesticimport companies and their employees, and the businesses that wouldotherwise receive a portion of the import companies' employee salariesare also affected.	<p>	Let's say that a particular protectionist measure causes the price ofthe average shirt to be $5 higher than would be the case under freetrade.  So millions of consumers have to pay an extra $5 for a shirt,and domestic producers of shirts gain as a result.  But they do notnecessarily gain the same total amount as the loss that domesticconsumers incur because some of the shirts consumers buy will bemanufactured by foreign producers.  So an induced cost increase alsomight benefit foreign producers (especially if the induced costincrease is the result of a quota rather than a tariff).  The presenceof a quota will reduce the number of shirts that a foreign producer cansell in the domestic market, but it will increase the unit price theforeign producer can charge, this increasing foreign producer profitmargins.	<p>	Fewer foreign shirts will be purchased as a result.  Which means thatthe domestic import companies that would otherwise bring the shirtsinto the United States will lose business.  So they will need feweremployees.  And the money that these employees would otherwise earncannot flow into the purchase of autos, clothing, and so forth becausethese employees do not have jobs as a result of the protectionistmeasure.	<p>	There is really no way to accurately measure the total gainsand total losses that result from a particular protectionist measurebecause it is impossible to predict where the money will flow in theabsence of protectionism.  But it can be concluded, a priori, thattotal satisfaction will decrease if consumers have to settle for theirsecond or third choice because some protectionist measure prevents themfrom buying their first choice.	<a name="30r"><p>	Another way to look at the effect of a protectionist measure,in an attempt to determine whether the measure is good or bad, is topredict who would gain and who would lose if the particular policy wereimplemented.  In the case of a protectionist measure on textiles, forexample, millions of consumers stand to lose because they would have topay higher prices.<a href="#30">[30]</a> But a few domestic textilecompanies stand to gain by the passage of the measure.  Based on thisapproach, it might be concluded that the protectionist measure is badbecause many individuals (consumers) stand to lose something, whereasonly a few stand to gain (domestic textile manufacturers).  But thisanalysis is superficial because the unit gains and unit losses are notequal.  The domestic textile producers stand to gain much if themeasure becomes law, whereas the millions of consumers who losesomething would only lose a little bit, perhaps $5 per shirt. 	<p>	Another fact to consider is that the textile manufacturers arehighly organized special interests, whereas the majority, theconsumers, are unorganized.  It is in the textile manufacturers' bestinterest to expend large sums of money to lobby Congress to pass thepiece of protectionist legislation. But it is rational behavior for themillions of unorganized consumers not to organize to petition Congressnot to pass the bill.  The cost of organizing, in terms of time, effortand money expended, is just not worth it.  It is better to pay an extra$5 a shirt than to try to counterbalance the special interest that hasthe ear of the legislature.	<a name="31r"><p>	This phenomenon is present regardless of which industry isinvolved. The steel industry, auto industry, farm lobby and every otherproducer of domestic goods stand to gain, in the short-run at least, ifthey can convince Congress to protect them from foreign competition. So it pays them to organize.  And it is rational behavior for theconsumers of these items not to organize because the cost of doing soexceeds the benefits to be gained by organizing.<a href="#31">[31]</a> Thus, the special interests have a built-in advantage over consumers.<a name="32r"><p>	The Public Choice School of Economics has been discussingthis point for several decades. Wherever the costs of lobbying are lowand the potential benefits are high, special interests will run togovernment for protection or special favors.  Public Choice economistscall this phenomenon rent-seeking--the seeking of special privileges orprotection from government or getting others to pay for yourbenefits.<a href="#32">[32]</a>	<a name="33r"><p>	Another basically utilitarian argument is the public policyor common good argument.  If a policy of free trade is good, it is goodbecause it is in the public interest or it is for the common good.  Thefatal flaw in this line of reasoning is that there is no such thing as"the public."  The public is just a collective term to describe thegeneral citizenry.  The public does not eat, sleep and breathe. Onlyindividuals do these things.  Only individuals have interests.  And ina pluralist society, these interests conflict.<a href="#33">[33]</a> Auto manufacturers (their stockholders and employees, actually) have aninterest in seeing protectionist legislation passed to protect themfrom foreign competition.  And the millions of individuals who purchaseautos have an interest in having low prices and a wide variety ofchoices. Foreign auto producers also have an interest in selling theirproducts on the domestic market. While it might be concluded that thepublic interest is in free trade, this conclusion is reached onutilitarian grounds --the consumers who stand to gain by free tradeoutnumber the auto company stockholders and employees who stand to gainby protectionism (the interests of the foreign auto producers, theirstockholders and employees are usually ignored in arriving at thisdetermination).	<p>	Ayn Rand has the following point to make about the concept ofthe public interest:<ul>	<a name="34r">	<p>	Since there is no such entity as "the public," since the public	is merely a number of individuals, any claimed or implied conflict of	"the public interest" with private interests means that the interests	of some men are to be sacrificed to the interests and wishes of	others.  Since the concept is so conveniently undefinable, its	use rests only on any given gang's ability to proclaim that	"The public, c'est moi" -- and to maintain the claim at the point of	a gun.<a href="#34">[34]</a></p></ul>		<a name="35r"><a name="36r"><p>	Aside from this inherent weakness in the public interest argumentis the fact that the argument is sometimes used to protect specialinterests at the expense of the general public.  It has been arguedthat the passage of antimerger legislation is in the public interest,when in fact such legislation often serves to protect entrenched,inefficient management at the expense of shareholders, consumers andthe general public.<a href="#35">[35]</a>  The farm lobby argues thatit is in the public interest to have a strong farm sector, so Congresspasses legislation to subsidize the farm industry and protect if fromforeign competition at the expense of the general public.<ahref="#36">[36]</a><a name="37r"><a name="38r"><a name="39r"><p>	Industry leaders whose companies are losing market share fromforeign or domestic competition petition Congress to regulate theirindustry to prevent cutthroat competition, in the public interest.<ahref="#37">[37]</a>  But the effect of such legislation is to keepprices abnormally high, compared to what they would be in a freemarket.  Most antitrust actions are initiated not by government, but bycompetitors who see their market share eroded by more efficientcompetitors.<a href="#38">[38]</a>  Members of various professions andoccupations such as doctors, lawyers, accountants, hair dressers,electricians, opticians, pharmacists, morticians, auto mechanics,speech therapists, tattoo artists, and so forth petition thelegislature to pass licensure laws to protect the general public fromquacks, when research shows that the loosening or repeal of such lawsresults in higher quality service at lower cost.<a href="#39">[39]</a><a name="40r"><p>	Another, related argument is the balancing of interests argument,or the balancing of rights argument.  This argument takes the positionthat the rights of some individuals or groups must be balanced againstthe rights of other individuals or groups.  But this argument is justanother variation of the basic utilitarian argument.  It is grounded inpositive rights theory, which we have already seen is fatally flawed.<ahref="#40">[40]</a><a name="41r"><p>	The balancing of rights argument, when applied to trade theory,argues that the rights of foreign producers to sell their products onthe domestic market must be balanced against the rights of domesticproducers to be protected from dumping or unfair competition.  Thereare several weaknesses with this line of reasoning.  For one thing, therights of consumers to buy the products of their choice from thesellers of their choice is often ignored.  But more importantly, thisargument assumes that domestic producers have some right to sell theirproducts even though consumers do not want to do business with them.Domestic producers do not have their rights violated when a foreignproducer "dumps" products on the domestic market.<a href="#41">[41]</a> Although they may be harmed by foreign dumping, their rights are notviolated because they have no property rights in transactions thatconsumers do not want to enter into with them.<a name="42r"><p>	If a supermarket opens up across the street from a mom andpop grocery store, there is no doubt that the mom and pop store will beharmed by the competition. It may even be driven out of business. Butit cannot be said that their rights are violated by having thesupermarket set up shop across the street.  The supermarket has everyright to open a store across the street (not to mention the fact thatconsumers will benefit by lower prices and a larger selection) and momand pop have no right to prevent consumers from taking their businessacross the street if they want to.  Government has no right to preventthe supermarket from opening because there are no rights to "balance."Although the interests of mom and pop are diametrically opposed to theinterests of the supermarket, government has no business balancingthese interest in one direction or the other.  The real issue isrights, not interests.  When people speak about balancing "interests,"what they really mean is balancing "rights." But in a negative rightsregime,<a href="#42">[42]</a> rights can never conflict.  You have theright to property and so do I.  You have the right not to be killed orconfined and so do I.  It is only in a positive rights regime thatrights can conflict because the right of one individual or group mustbe sacrificed so that another individual or group can gain something. Thus, the balancing of interests argument suffers from severalstructural weaknesses.<h4>III.  The Rights Approach</h4><p>	A major problem with any utilitarian argument is that it is impossibleto precisely measure the total gains and the total losses.  So it isnot possible to determine in many cases whether a particular policyresults in the greatest good for the greatest number.  But the fatalflaw in any utilitarian approach is that utilitarian approaches ignoreindividual rights.  If the good outweighs the bad, a utilitarian wouldnot be concerned that someone's rights have to be violated to implementthe policy.	<p>	To illustrate this point, let's take an example.  Let's say that Johnis, and always has been, a sex-craved maniac.  He has just beenreleased from prison after ten years of incarceration. During that timehe has not had sex.  And he is prowling the streets with the goal ofmaking up for lost time.  He comes upon a prostitute who is lying onthe sidewalk in a drunken stupor. He drags her into an alley and rapesher.  While he is ripping off her clothes, she protests by mumblingthat he should stop.  But she does not put up any resistance andactually falls asleep while he is committing the crime.	<p>	She has experienced almost no discomfort or disutility as a result ofJohn's act.  But John has experienced a great deal of pleasure.  Hassociety benefitted by the act?  A utilitarian would conclude that ithad.  One person gained and one person lost as a result of the rape. So it appears to be a zero-sum game.  But the person who gained, gaineda great deal, whereas the person who lost, lost only a little.  So thegains exceed the losses, even if John's utility gain and theprostitute's utility loss cannot be measured precisely, and the act canbe declared to be good on that account.	<p>	The example is outrageous, but the thought process a utilitarian usesto arrive at a conclusion cannot be faulted on utilitarian grounds. The reader may be quick to point out that the prostitute's rights wereviolated in a very personal way by John's action.  But rightsviolations are of no concern to a pure utilitarian theorist.  All thatmatters to a utilitarian is whether the gains exceed the losses.  Theidea that someone's rights might have to be violated to achieve thegoal is not worthy of consideration.	<p>	But violating someone's rights is never necessary to achieve aworthy goal. If someone's rights must be violated to achieve a goal,the goal is not a worthy one in the first place. Utilitarian approachesall begin with the premise that the end justifies the means.  Rightsapproaches begin with the premise that it is the process that isimportant, not the destination.  A trade policy based on utilitarianismcan have protectionist elements if it is determined that the gainersfrom the policy exceed the losers, or if it is determined that"society" benefits as a whole. Under a rights approach to trade policy,"society" is not even at issue.  The issue is whether someone's rights,properly defined, are violated by the policy.  If rights are violated,then the policy is a bad one.  If no one's rights are violated, thenthe policy is not a bad one.	<p>	Which brings us to another important question: What exactly arerights, anyway? Philosophers over the centuries have viewed rights fromtwo different and diametrically opposed perspectives.  Negative rightsinclude the rights to life, liberty and property.  Stated in negativeterms, they would be the right not to be killed, the right not to beinvoluntarily confined, and the right not to have your property takenfrom you without your consent. Negative rights are inherent.  They arenot rights that are granted by government.  They are rights that comebefore government.  Governments are instituted to protect these rights.	<p>	Positive rights advocates view rights from a different perspective. Examples of positive rights include the right to medical care, theright to subsidized rent, and so forth.  Positive rights are rightsthat are granted by government. They are not inherent.  And they arerights that are gained at someone else's expense.	<p>	Under a positive rights regime, the rights of some must be sacrificedso that others may have rights.  In the case of medical care, forexample, those who claim a right to medical care gain this right at theexpense of others, who must provide it.  Free medical care does notmean that medical care is costless.  Someone (the taxpayer) has to pay. But it is free to the recipient because the recipient incurs no out ofpocket costs.	<p>	Rent control laws also work in this manner.  If the law prevents alandlord from charging $800 a month (the market rate) for an apartment,the difference between the actual rent and the market price for theapartment is, in effect, a forceable transfer of property from thelandlord to the tenant.  If the maximum rent that can legally becharged is $500 and the rent that could be charged in a free market is$800, then the landlord is, in effect, having $300 of his propertyconfiscated each month and having it transferred to the tenant.  Thetenant's "right" to affordable housing comes at the expense of thelandlord. If the tenant lives in a government subsidized housingproject, the result is the same, except that it is the taxpayer ratherthan the landlord who has to pay for the tenant's right to affordablehousing.	<p>	Losses always exceed gains under a positive rights regime iffor no other reason than the fact that there are transaction costs. The landlord will not voluntarily write out a $300 check to the tenanteach month.  There has to be an enforcement authority around the cornerthat is ready to enforce the law if the landlord does not want tocomply.  And an army of bureaucrats has to be retained to see that thevarious redistributive laws are properly administered and enforced. Soit cannot be said that a positive rights regime is a zero-sum game,because the losses do not exactly offset the gains.  The landlord loses$300 a month and the tenant gains $300 a month, but the cost ofmaintaining the enforcement authority must also be counted, which leadsto a negative-sum result.  Economists call this net loss a deadweightloss.	<p>	But whether this policy or that is a zero-sum game, a negative-sumgame or a positive-sum game is really beside the point.  Discussionsabout whether a policy is a negative-sum or positive-sum game areutilitarian because the object is to determine whether the gains exceedthe losses.  In a rights regime, gains and losses are irrelevant.  Allthat matters is whether rights are violated--in the negative sense ofthe term.<h4>IV.  Summary and Conclusion</h4><a name="43r"><p>	NAFTA, GATT and all other trade agreements are fatally flawedbecause they begin (at best) from a utilitarian premise.  If a tradeagreement is indeed intended to be pro-consumer rather thanprotectionist,<a href="#43">[43]</a> advocates take the position thatthe trade policy should be implemented because it benefits themajority, or that it benefits consumers, or that it is in the publicinterest. But a proper position to take is that a trade policy shouldbe implemented or adopted if it does not violate anyone's rights.  Thepublic interest, public policy or other majoritarian arguments aretotally beside the point and do not address the real issue.  Whethersome policy benefits the majority is irrelevant, not to mention notalways easy to determine.	<p>	Arguments about the gains and losses involved in adopting NAFTA, GATTor other trade agreements are off the mark and only lead the debatersastray from the real issue.  Whether a trade agreement should beadopted or not should be determined solely on the basis of whetheranyone's rights are violated.  If a trade agreement would violateanyone's contract or property rights, the policy should not be adopted. And if an existing trade policy violates anyone's contract or propertyrights, it should be abolished immediately.  The proper function ofgovernment is to protect life, liberty, property and contract rightsand to otherwise leave people alone to seek their happiness in theirown way.  These are the only functions that a government can rightlyperform in a pluralist society where individuals have differentinterests and goals. Governments that prevent consenting adults fromentering into voluntary exchange are going beyond their legitimatescope.</p><hr><h4>Footnotes</h4><ol><p><a name="1"><li>The United States Constitution, for example, gives	Congress the authority to regulate trade in Art.

Deliberately manipulating a	currency's exchange rate also has the effect of keeping foreign	products from crossing borders.  The U.S. policy of deliberately	weakening the dollar in comparison to the yen, for example,	caused the dollar to drop by 18 percent in the first part of	1993, which made it possible for barely one in fifty Japanese	exporters to be profitable in the U.S. market.   During the	1930s, monetary nationalism of this kind was a factor that set	the stage for World War II.  For more on these points, see Judy	Shelton, A Yen to Manipulate, WALL STREET J., January 28, 1994,	at A14. </p>	<ul>		<p>	It might also be pointed out that, while manipulating exchange	rates can be protectionist, this tool differs from the other tools of	protectionism -- tariffs, quotas and antidumping laws -- because	manipulating exchange rates is more pervasive.  Whereas tariffs,	quotas and antidumping laws can target a particular industry or	company, manipulating exchange rates can cause all foreign products	to become more expensive in the domestic market.	</p>	<p>	The goal of such a policy is to reduce trade deficits.  Yet	reducing trade deficits is not a worthy goal.  The relationship	between a trade deficit and economic growth is nebulous, at	best. Throughout most of the nineteenth century, the United	States had a negative balance of trade.  Yet the nineteenth century	was a period of rapid and prolonged economic growth.  The	United States had a positive balance of trade during the Great	Depression of the 1930s, one of the worst periods the U.S. economy	ever faced.  For more on the irrationality of the balance of	trade philosophy, see Robert W. McGee, Trade Deficits and Economic	Policy: A Law and Economics Analysis, 11 J.

A	rich person may place a value of 0.005 utils on one dollar, whereas a	poor person may assign a value of 20 utils to one dollar.  And	the number of utils' value for a dollar may change with the	same individual.  As the individual spends more dollars, thereby	reducing the supply of dollars, the value of the next dollar --	the marginal dollar -- may change. So the value of a dollar to	a particular individual can change.  It is not necessarily constant.	It should also be pointed out that a rich person does not necessarily	derive fewer utils of benefit from a dollar than does a poor person. 	This relationship is often assumed by economists (the graduated	income tax is based on the validity of this assumption), but	this assumption may be invalid.		<a href="#28r">Return</a><p><a name="29"><li>It should be pointed out that these values are	subjective.

Is Tax Evasion a Sin?</h4></center><p><a name="3r"><a name="4r"></p><p>	The Roman Catholic Church recently issued a revised catechism—thefirst since 1566—that provides about 700 pages of moral guidance forcatholics.<a href="#3">[3]</a>  It puts catholic doctrine inlayperson's language and is intended to act as a guide to good moralconduct.  One major aspect of the new edition is the listing of somenew, modern-day sins, such as paying unfairly low wages to employees,appropriating a company's assets for personal use, drunk driving, drugabuse—and tax evasion.<a href="#4">[4]</a> This article will focus onthe question of whether tax evasion is a sin.<p><a name="5r"><a name="nnr"><a name="nnr"></p><p>	Perhaps the most comprehensive treatise on this subject, froma catholic perspective at least, was done by Martin Crowe in 1944.<ahref="#5">[5]</a>  This 177-page treatise raises most of the majorissues concerning the morality of tax evasion.  But even here, Crowedistinguishes "just" taxes from other kinds of taxes.  One mightconclude from the title of Crowe's work that one is morally obligatedto pay just taxes and not morally obligated to pay taxes that areunjust.  So it then becomes a question of what is a just tax?<p>	Is tax evasion ever justified on moral grounds?  If your taxesgo to finance Hitler's war machine, it seems clear that there isnothing immoral about tax evasion.  Indeed, it might even be arguedthat one has a moral duty to evade such taxes where possible.  But theissue becomes less clear for less extremist cases.  Is it ethical toevade taxes when the proceeds are used to feed the hungry, house thehomeless or clothe the poor?  Or what if the proceeds are used toprovide services that you use, such as police protection, health care,education, and so forth? What if your taxes go toward the support ofactivities that you do not use, such as the welfare system?  What abouttaxes that are used to pay for "porkbarrel" legislation?  In otherwords, does the use to which the proceeds are put have anything to dowith the ethics of tax evasion, or is the end use irrelevant?<p><a name="6r"><a name="7r"><a name="8r"><a name="9r"><a name="10r"></p><p>	Crowe<a href="#6">[6]</a> and others<a href="#7">[7]</a> divide thetaxing power into three categories: fees, such as licenses, franchisesand permits; special assessments, such as an assessment to pave a road;and taxes proper, such as the income tax, where those paying the taxhave no special claim on any of the proceeds.  In the case of fees andassessments, those paying are entitled to some right.  Those who payfor an automobile license are entitled to drive.<a href="#8">[8]</a> Those who pay for a business permit are entitled to operate abusiness.<a href="#9">[9]</a>  Those who pay to have their road pavedare entitled to have it paved.  But in the case of taxes, those who paydo not have any automatic right to any of the proceeds.  New Yorkresidents who pay a federal income tax may have their money used toconstruct a bridge in California, even though they derive no directbenefit for their tax dollars. And they have no right to demand that abridge be built in New York.  All the taxes the government collects gointo a common pool and are distributed as the government sees fit.Taxpayers have an obligation to pay, but they have no specific right toany of the proceeds.<a href="#10">[10]</a><p>	Crowe refers to these three sources of revenue as noncontractualrevenue sources.  Then there are contractual revenue sources, such asuser fees.  This article will concentrate on taxes proper, althoughmany of the same arguments can be used for the other two forms ofnoncontractual revenue.</p><p>	Crowe defines a tax as follows:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="11r">	</p>	<p>	A tax is a compulsory contribution to the government, imposed in	the common interest of all, for the purpose of defraying the expenses	incurred in carrying out the public functions, or imposed for	the purpose of regulation, without reference to the special benefits	conferred on the one making the payment.<a href="#11">[11]</a>	</p></ul><p>	This definition is fairly comprehensive.  It includes not only chargesthat are imposed to raise revenue but also charges that are imposed toregulate, such as tariffs, liquor and tobacco taxes. And the definitionseparates those who pay from those who benefit, since those who pay maynot be the same ones who benefit.<p><a name="12r"></p><p>	But his definition could be improved.  He states that taxesare compulsory contributions that are imposed in the public interest. But what about compulsory contributions that are used to benefitspecial interests?  Many present day government expenditures are usedto benefit special interests, often at the expense of the generalpublic. Tariffs on foreign clothing, for example, protect domestictextile manufacturers from foreign competition at the expense of themillions of consumers who would otherwise pay less for clothes.<ahref="#12">[12]</a>  Tariffs, import quotas and domestic content lawsbenefit domestic auto manufacturers at the expense of the millions ofpeople who buy automobiles.  Social Security taxes benefit retiredpeople at the expense of those who work for a living.  None of theselevies can be said to be in the public interest because they benefitspecial interests at the expense of the general public.  Yet theyshould be considered taxes because that is what they are.  But whetherthey are just taxes is another question.<p><a name="13r"><a name="14r"><a name="15r"></p><p>	A more comprehensive, and accurate, definition of taxes might bethe compulsory taking<a href="#13">[13]</a> of property by government,without regard to whether the proceeds are used to further public orprivate interests. But even this definition does not cover all thecosts imposed by government on private individuals because it excludesthe cost of regulation.<a href="#14">[14]</a>  For example, ifgovernment imposed a regulation that required a business to incur aparticular cost, property is, in effect, being taken, in the sense thatthe individual no longer has use of the property.  But it is not a taxin the strict sense because the transfer is not from the taxpayer tothe government. If the local rent control board forbids a landlord fromcharging more than $400 a month for an apartment that would rent for$700 in a free market, is it any less of a compulsory taking than ifthe landlord charged $700 and had to pay $300 as a tax?  In eithercase, the landlord has $400 instead of $700.<a href="#15">[15]</a> Taxes, in the broad sense of the term, should include these kinds ofcompulsory behavior modifications imposed by government.<p><a name="16r"><a name="17r"><a name="18r"></p><p><a name="19r"><a name="20r"><a name="21r"></p><p>	What makes a tax just?  Crowe sets out three criteria.<ahref="#16">[16]</a>   For Crowe, a tax is just only if it is imposed bylegitimate legislative authority;<a href="#17">[17]</a> for a justcause;<a href="#18">[18]</a> and where there is just distribution ofthe tax burden.<a href="#19">[19]</a>   Thus, in countries where thereis no legitimate legislative authority, no tax can be just.  And wherethe cause is not just, as where a tax is imposed on Mass wine for thepurpose of hindering or hampering its use, there seems to be noobligation to pay.<a href="#20">[20]</a>  But just taxes, for Crowe,would include taxes that are imposed to fund spiritual, cultural andmoral welfare, such as concerts, monuments and art museums.<ahref="#21">[21]</a><p><a name="22r"></p><p>	And what about the just distribution of the tax burden?  Thosewho have no income pay no income tax.  And those who have high incomesoften (but not always) pay a large income tax. Those who have lowerincomes may pay a higher percentage of their income for sales taxesthan those who have higher incomes. But so what?  Is there anythingunjust about this relationship?  If so, what makes it unjust?  If poorpeople receive more government benefits than rich people, should thepoor be required to pay a higher percentage of their income for taxes? If not, could it be said that the poor (which are in the majority) areexploiting the rich minority?  Should taxes be based on the ability topay, or on the amount of benefit received? Are these two approachesmutually exclusive, or can they somehow be reconciled?  Is one approachjust and another unjust?   Or could it be that both approaches areunjust?  If so, what determines whether a tax is just?  We shalladdress these questions later. Suffice it to say for now, though, thatCrowe takes the position that "moralists are unanimous in theirteaching that the ultimate basis of apportioning a tax is the abilityof the citizen to pay."<a href="#22">[22]</a><p><a name="23r"></p><p>	Crowe examined the views of a number of religious and secularwriters on the topic of the moral obligation to pay taxes.  Angelus ofClavisio,<a href="#23">[23]</a> for example, when discussing the moralobligation to pay the tax that the sovereign imposed for those whopassed through his territory, said:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="24r">	</p>	<p>	... When those who impose these taxes do not provide for the	common good, for example, in caring for roads, bridges, the safety of	people and other things, according to their ability as they are	bound to do, the subjects do not sin if they evade the tax without	lying and perjury, nor are they bound to restitution...Nor do I	believe that those sin who defraud taxes, even when the aforesaid	(i.e., those who impose the tax) do provide for the common	good.<a href="#24">[24]</a>	</p></ul><p>	Based on this view, it would seem that Angelus would consider ita sin if the taxpayer had to resort to perjury or lying to evade a taxthat is not morally owed.  It must be assumed that in such cases it isthe lie or perjury and not the tax evasion that is the sin.  But howcan it be a sin to lie to someone who is not entitled to the truth inthe first place?  It would not be a sin to tell a Gestapo agent thatyou are not hiding a Jew in your basement when in fact you are.  And itis not a sin to tell a thief that you have given him all of your moneywhen in fact you have not. So how can it be a sin to lie to a taxauthority when you do not morally owe the tax?  Lying is not a sin, perse.  It depends on the circumstances.<p>	Berardi, a later thinker on the subject, takes the positionthat there is probably no moral duty to pay a tax even if lying anddeceit are involved.<p><a name="25r"><a name="nnr"><a name="nnr"></p><p>	What therefore about subjects who have found a way to avoid paying atax? … probably there is no obligation of restitution after the tax hasbeen evaded. For the duty of paying taxes probably does not arise froma tacit pact by which the subjects bind themselves to pay the princewhatever is necessary for the public expenses—each one contracting topay an allotted percentage of the debt; but this duty arises ratherfrom the law of the prince who determines how that sum of money whichis necessary shall be raised.<a href="#25">[25]</a><p>	Basically, Berardi is saying that where there is no contract there isno obligation, and there is no contract between the prince and thetaxpayers. This view becomes complicated when one tries to apply it toa modern democracy, since, in theory at least, some sort of contractdoes exist between the people and the sovereign.  This contract theoryapproach raises some interesting questions, which we shall examinelater.<p><a name="26r"><a name="27r"><a name="28r"></p><p>	An early twentieth century scholar takes the position that partialevasion is justified on the grounds that the government does not have aright to the full amount, and that it would be unfair to impose heaviertaxes on conscientious men while wicked men usually pay less.<ahref="#26">[26]</a> Crolly takes the position that there is noobligation to pay taxes, but that there is an obligation to pay whenevasion would result in violence.<a href="#27">[27]</a> Othertheologians takes the position that confessors should not makepenitents make restitution for unpaid taxes if the penitents themselvesdo not feel bound to do so.<a href="#28">[28]</a><p><a name="29r"></p><p>	… the confessor should not oblige a penitent to make restitution ifthe penitent certainly or probably has persuaded himself that in themultitude of taxes which he has paid there were some unjust taxes, orthat the number of taxes itself is too great and excessive, or that,having regard for his state in life and his business, the penitentjudges that he has sufficiently contributed to the publicnecessities.<a href="#29">[29]</a><p>	This is in keeping with the view that something is a sin onlyif you think it is a sin.<p><a name="30r"><a name="31r"><a name="32r"><a name="33r"></p><p>	Scholars over the centuries have debated the morality of evadingtaxes from other perspectives as well.  Some would argue that one isobligated to pay only those taxes that are not wholly penal innature,<a href="#30">[30]</a>  but others have argued that all taxesshould be paid regardless of whether the purpose is wholly penal,partially penal or not penal at all.  Others would debate the relativemerits of paying or evading direct taxes such as per capita taxes,inheritance, land, building, or income taxes, as compared to indirecttaxes, such as customs, duties, imposts and sales taxes.<ahref="#31">[31]</a>  Others have argued that the morality of paying atax has nothing to do with whether the tax is direct or indirect. Somescholars over the last two thousand years have taken the position thatit is a sin to evade a tax only if payment is refused after the taxcollector has demanded payment.  Others have said that payment isrequired even if no demand for payment has been made. Some scholarshave taken the position that it is a sin to break any law.<ahref="#32">[32]</a> Some theologians take the position that the stateis like a servant, and just as a servant is entitled to wages, so isthe state entitled to taxes.<a href="#33">[33]</a><p><a name="34r"></p><p>	Another question debated over the centuries has been whethertax evasion is a mortal or venial sin.<a href="#34">[34]</a><p><a name="35r"></p><p>	Subjects who without the consent of the prince use fraud andother means to evade just taxes due because of a pact or from ancientand legitimate custom, or even those recently imposed ... sin mortallyby committing the sin of theft and are bound to restitution.<ahref="#35">[35]</a><p><a name="36r"><a name="37r"><a name="38r"><a name="39r"><a name="40r"></p><p>	Assessing mortal sin for tax evasion seems a bit severe, especiallyin cases where the amount involved is small, and it is unlikely thatmany theologians would classify all tax evasion as mortal sin.<ahref="#36">[36]</a>  Voit takes the position that it is probable thatone commits a grave sin for tax evasion even if payment is notdemanded, and that those who fail to pay must make restitution.<ahref="#37">[37]</a>  There seems to be no clear cutoff point betweenwhat constitutes a mortal sin and what is merely a venial sin, at leastin the case of theft.<a href="#38">[38]</a>  Where a theft is of apenny, the sin would likely be venial, but where the theft is a milliondollars, it might be mortal.  Where the amount stolen is $100, the sinis more grave if the victim is poor than if the victim is rich.  Andthe severity of the sin is affected by the circumstances of the personwho is evading the tax. "Those who defraud taxes imposed on thenecessities of life (pro usualibus) probably can be excused from mortalsin and from the obligation of making restitution."<ahref="#39">[39]</a>  Bonacina takes the position that it is not a sinto evade taxes  if the burden is too large.<a href="#40">[40]</a><p><a name="41r"><a name="42r"><a name="43r"></p><p>	What does the bible have to say about taxes?  Taxes are mentionedin several places.  In the Old Testament, it says that the Pharaohtaxed the people according to their ability to pay.<ahref="#41">[41]</a>  But it does not say whether this practice wasconsidered just.  In the New Testament, when Jesus was asked whether itwas legal to give tribute to Caesar, he said, "Render therefore untoCaesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that areGod's."<a href="#42">[42]</a>  But all this means is that individualsshould give people what they are entitled to have.  It says nothingabout whether Caesar (the State) is entitled to anything.  This pointis reiterated by Paul: "Render therefore to all their dues: tribute towhom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honourto whom honour."<a href="#43">[43]</a><p><a name="44r"></p><p>	But not all scholars have interpreted the scriptures in thisway.  Beia, for example, interprets the passage from Romans 13 to meanthat justly imposed taxes are due to the prince by divine law becausethey are the ministers of God.<a href="#44">[44]</a>  But he does notconsider whether taxes are required by divine law to be paid to evilprinces.  And he does not question whether atheists should be made topay a tax under divine law.<p>	According to some interpreters of Jewish law, there is an obligationto pay taxes.<p><a name="45r"></p><p>	Anyone who cheats on income taxes transgresses the law prohibitingrobbery, whether the king (government) be Jewish or non-Jewish; for the<i>law of the country is the Law</i>.  Some scholars held that this lawimplied no more than the obligation to pay taxes and to help thecountry against enemies, but the majority opinion holds that conformityto all laws imposed by a legally constituted government iscompulsory.<a href="#45">[45]</a><p>	There are several problems with this view.  For one thing, ittakes the position that what is legal is moral, and what is illegal isimmoral, at least where the government is legally constituted.  Whenone considers that the governments of the Third Reich and fascist Italywere legally constituted, in the sense that Hitler and Mussolini wereboth  elected by a plurality of the votes, one must question whetherthere are exceptions to this rule.  Another problem with this view isthat it cites majority opinion as authority.  But majorities havenothing to do with right. Something is either right or wrong regardlessof majority opinion.<p><a name="46r"></p><p>	Another argument that has been put forward in justificationof taxation is that if some people don't pay their "fair share," thenothers must pay more than their fair share.<a href="#46">[46]</a>  Ifthis is true, then it would appear that tax evasion is immoral, sinceyou are forcing someone else to pay for your benefits.  You are actingas a parasite, since you are receiving benefits that others are beingforced to pay for.<p><a name="47r"></p><p>	But this line of reasoning suffers from several weaknesses. For one thing, it is not easy to determine what is one's fair share. The problem is complicated by the fact that governments often squanderlarge sums of money. Should one pay only the fair share of the moneythat is not squandered, or should one pay a portion of the funds thatare squandered as well?   A corollary to the fair share argument thattheologians over the centuries have made, which supports the practiceof partial evasion, is that " ... the state does not seem to have aright to the whole tax, and that it would be unjust to burdenconscientious men with heavier taxes while wicked men usually payless."<a href="#47">[47]</a>  Davis expresses a similar view.<p><a name="48r"></p><p>	It appears unreasonable to expect good citizens, who certainly arein the minority, to be obliged in conscience to pay taxes, whereas somany others openly repudiate the moral obligation, if there is one. Itseems unjust that good people should feel an obligation to be mulctedand to pay readily, in order to balance the evasions of many.<ahref="#48">[48]</a><p><a name="49r"><a name="50r"></p><p>	Another variation of the fair share argument is that one hasa moral duty to pay if benefits are received.  But this line ofreasoning also suffers from many defects.  What if the governmentprovides benefits but you did not ask for them?  For example, what ifthe government provides free abortions but you do not believe thatabortion is morally permissible?   Or what if the government requiresthat you contribute to a Social Security system, but a private pensionsystem—which you cannot invest in because Social Security taxes havetaken all of the income that would have been available for thispurpose—would have been a much better investment?<a href="#49">[49]</a>Is there any moral duty to pay a Social Security tax if you are beingforced to pay for what amounts to a bad investment?<ahref="#50">[50]</a><p><a name="51r"><a name="52r"><a name="53r"></p><p>	In a broader sense, is there any relationship between what you areasked (forced) to pay and what you receive in return?  As a generalrule, taxpayers receive less than what they pay for because of theadministrative costs of government.<a href="#51">[51]</a>  Economistscall this phenomenon a deadweight loss.  And the deadweight lossincreases as the distance between the tax collection agency and thetaxpayer increases. For example, taxpayers who pay a local tax, onaverage, only get back 80% or 90% of what they have paid in the form ofservices.<a href="#52">[52]</a> Only perhaps 70% of state governmenttaxes are returned in the form of services. Only perhaps 30% or 40% ofthe taxes paid to the federal government are returned in services,depending on the service.<a href="#53">[53]</a>  The farther away thecollecting agency is from the source, the lower the return. In the caseof some federal welfare programs, the cost of administering the programfar exceeds the amount that is actually spent on the target recipients.And residents of some states get less back from the federal governmentthan others.  Some senators and members of Congress are more skilled atgetting federal funds for their state than others.<p><a name="54r"><a name="55r"></p><p>	It is as though the federal government took your automobileto satisfy your tax liability and gave you a bicycle in return.<ahref="#54">[54]</a>  True, you are receiving some benefits from thegovernment. But does that mean that you have a moral duty to give themyour car?  Does the fact that you may have another car in your garagechange the answer?  Or the fact that the car the government took fromyou was given to someone who had no car? Or two cars?<ahref="#55">[55]</a>  Or does the disposition of the property havenothing to do with the moral duty to pay a tax to a government that hasbeen elected, in theory at least, by a majority or plurality of theeligible voters who voted in the last election.<p>	If there is a moral duty to pay the government something in exchangefor the benefits received, what amount is justifiable?  If you receivea bicycle from the government, are you morally obligated to give thegovernment whatever it demands in return, including your car? Or wouldyou be justified in giving just a tire or two?  Where the tax isextracted by force, or the threat of force, as in the case of theincome tax, there seems to be no moral duty to give anythingwhatsoever, since the recipient is a robber.  But there may be somecases where there is a moral duty to pay something to government forbenefits received.<p><a name="56r"></p><p>	For example, nonprofit organizations receive exemptions fromthe payment of property taxes.  Yet they still receive local police andfire protection, city water and sewage treatment, and so forth.  Astrong case can be made that there is some duty to pay for the value ofthe services received (not what the government would charge to ataxpayer, which may be different from the value of the servicesprovided).<a href="#56">[56]</a>  This situation is different from thatwhere the government forcibly takes the tax because the government, inthis example, is not legally entitled to assess any tax, although itmust provide certain services.  So in cases where there is no forceinvolved, and where services are provided, there may be a duty to paysomething for the services, if the services have some value to therecipient.  But if the services provided by government have no value,or where the person does not use the service, as in the case of anexempt organization that has the option of contributing for the supportof the local school system that it does not use, there is no moral dutyto pay for the support of such services.  In fact, there may be anethical duty not to contribute to the support of such services, sincethe people who contributed to the support of the exempt organizationwant their money to be used for other purposes.  Otherwise, they wouldhave contributed to the local school system themselves.<p><a name="57r"><a name="58r"></p><p>	The question of legitimacy also needs to be raised here.  Howlegitimate is the average government?  In the United States, forexample, perhaps half of the eligible voters tend to vote in nationalelections.  Even fewer vote in purely local elections, and inprimaries.  And not all individuals over the age of 18 (the legalvoting age) register to vote.  And many of those who do vote, do notreally vote for the candidate of their choice.  They vote for the leastbad candidate who is on the ballot.<a href="#57">[57]</a>  And it is acommonly recognized fact in political science texts that all countries,whether democratic or otherwise, are actually run by political elites,not "the people."<a href="#58">[58]</a> So how legitimate aregovernments?  It could be argued that, if a government falls below somedegree of legitimacy, there is no longer a duty to pay taxes.  Indeed,this position is taken in the U.S. Declaration of Independence, whichsupports the view that, at some point, the people have the right towithdraw their support from the government. The exact cutoff point,however, is difficult to define, since all governments are illegitimateto some extent, because they do not do just what every citizen wantsand nothing else.<p><a name="59r"><a name="60r"></p><p>	Another argument that has been used to support the positionthat tax evasion is unethical is based on Kant's categoricalimperative.<a href="#59">[59]</a> Kant's categorical imperative asksthe question, "What would happen if everyone did it?"  Kant wouldconclude that if the universal practice of some act results insomething bad, then the act is unethical.  If nothing bad results fromthe universal practice of the act, then it is not unethical.  Theweakness of this line of reasoning is highlighted when applied to thequestion of tax evasion.  If taxation is theft—the taking of propertywithout the owner's consent—one might ask, "What would happen ifeveryone refused to allow their property to be taken without theirconsent?"  One result would be a marked decline in the amount of theftand an increase in the amount of justice.  Another result would be avast shrinking in the scope of government, since it would no longer beable to maintain the level of spending it now enjoys.<ahref="#60">[60]</a>  It would no longer be able to force fundamentalistChristians, Moslems and Jews to support abortion clinics. It would nolonger be able to force pacifists to pay for national defense.  Itwould no longer be able to subsidize farmers or enforce protectionistlegislation, which means that consumers would be able to purchaseproducts at lower prices.<p>	But all these arguments are, at their base, merely utilitarian—thegreatest good for the greatest number.  Even if it would benefit thegeneral population if government were to get out of the wealth transferbusiness, the real question is whether someone's rights are beingviolated by the government's tax policy.  It is not a question ofwhether the good outweighs the bad, it is a question of whether rightsare being violated.<p><a name="61r"></p><p>	A more difficult question arises in the case of user fees, thecharge that the government places only on those who use a particulargovernment service. Examples include entrance fees to government parksand fees for using toll roads.  Is it ethical to sneak into agovernment park without paying or to go through a toll booth withoutpaying?<a href="#61">[61]</a><p><a name="62r"></p><p>	Morality involves choice.  Where there is no choice, there isno morality. If one must either use the government's roads or stay athome, there is not much of a choice.  One must go to the grocery store,to work, and so forth, and the government has a monopoly on roads, soindividuals do not have a choice of whether to use the government'sroads or a road that is privately owned.<a href="#62">[62]</a> Thatbeing the case, there appears to be no moral duty to pay the toll,although there is a legal obligation.  But if the road is privatelyowned, that may be a different matter, because in the case of aprivately owned road, failure to pay the fee for the use of the roadviolates the owner's right to property.  In the case of using aprivately owned road, there is an implied contract that if you use theroad, you agree to pay the price for using the road. But where the roadis owned by some government, no such implied contract exists.  For onething, the government holds a monopoly position.  For another, thegovernment obtained the road by confiscating someone'e property, eitherby the process of eminent domain or by taxes, the proceeds of whichwere then used to purchase the land and hire the construction workers,material, and so forth needed to build it.<p><a name="63r"></p><p>	The argument for sneaking into a government-owned park withoutpaying is not quite as strong, especially in cases where the park issupported 100% by user fees, because the necessity argument does notapply.  Whereas individuals must use roads in order to have a normallife, such is not the case with government parks.  Although privatelyowned parks are generally in better shape than government parks andcost less to maintain,<a href="#63">[63]</a> individuals still have achoice of whether to use the facility or not, so there is a moraldimension.  And there is a strong argument that all parks should beprivately owned rather than government owned.  But exploring thisquestion goes rather far afield from the subject of this article, whichis tax evasion.<center><a name="ITT"><h4>II.  Is Taxation Theft?</h4></center><h4>A.  The Question of Consent</h4><p>	Those who take the position that tax evasion is unethical or asin often do so because they view tax evasion as theft—the taking ofproperty that does not belong to them or the failure to give upproperty that belongs to someone else, namely, to some government.  Ifyou are supposed to render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and you do not,then you are depriving Caesar of his property.  But can that argumentbe turned around?  Could it be argued that taxation is theft, and thattax evasion is merely an attempt to prevent a theft from taking place?<p><a name="64r"></p><p>	Theft is generally defined as the taking of property withoutthe owner's consent.  But when it is some government that does thetaking, it is called taxation.  But there is a difference betweentaxation and robbery because robbery is a one-time thing, whereastaxation is something that occurs at regular intervals, which makes itmore akin to exploitation or slavery.<a href="#64">[64]</a>  Does itmake any substantive difference whether some government takes one-thirdof your income or merely forces you to work for it without pay for fourmonths out of the year?  Could it be argued that it is the taxcollectors rather than the tax evaders who are the sinners since it isthey who are taking property that does not belong to them?<p>	If a robber wants to raise $1,000 and forces you and your friendsto empty your pockets, is it unethical not to tell the thief that youhave $20 in your shoe, even if the failure to declare the $20 resultsin having your friends pay a larger share, because you are paying less?Is the argument any different when the robber is government?  Themorality of the failure to pay does not revolve around whether theeffect of nonpayment might result in a more severe burden on others,but whether you have a moral duty to pay in the first place. Iftaxation is theft, then the fact that others might be forced to paywhat you do not is of no consequence.  Robbery is in no way morejustified if the robber takes equal portions from all of the victims.But is taxation really theft, or do taxpayers consent to be taxed?<p><a name="65r"></p><p>	It might be argued that taxation is not really coercive becausevoters, somewhere along the line, have consented to be taxed.  Butthere are a number of flaws in this line of reasoning.  For one thing,the voters who consented to be taxed did so sometime in the past.  Inthe case of the individual income tax in the United States, forexample, they gave their consent in 1913.<a href="#65">[65]</a> Many ofthe people who gave their consent then are now dead.  And many of thosewho were alive and of voting age back then did not give their consent.<p>	It is a fundamental principle of both common law and basic justicethat one person cannot be held for the contract of another, so even ifconsenting to be taxed is viewed as a contract between citizens and thestate, the contract is null and void as far as those who did notconsent are concerned.  So taxation cannot be said to be noncoercivejust because some group of voters agreed to be taxed sometime in thepast.<p>Thomas Jefferson makes the following point:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="66r">	</p>	<p>	We may consider each generation as a distinct nation, with a right, by	the will of its majority, to bind themselves, but none to bind	the succeeding generation, more than the inhabitants of another	country.<a href="#66">[66]</a>	</p></ul><p>Jefferson elaborates on this point as follows:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="67r">	</p>	<p>	The question Whether one generation of men has a right to bind	another, seems never to have been started either on this or our	side of the water.  Yet it is a question of such consequences	as not only to merit decision, but place also, among the fundamental	principles of every government...no such obligation can be	transmitted ... the earth belongs ... to the living...<a href="#67">[67]</a>	</p></ul><p><a name="68r"><a name="69r"><a name="70r"></p><p>	By reviewing statistics of his time (1789), Jefferson determinedthat the average life expectancy of those still living at age 21 was55.<a href="#68">[68]</a>  He reasoned that, since the majority ofthose twenty-one year-olds who belonged to a particular generationwould be dead nineteen years after entering into a social contract withthe state, the contract becomes null and void after nineteen years.<ahref="#69">[69]</a>  This rule applies to constitutions, public debtand all laws.  Every law and constitution expires naturally at the endof that time, and any law or constitution that is enforced beyond thattime is done so by force and not because of right.<ahref="#70">[70]</a>  Thus, there is a strong philosophical argumentthat even laws that are passed by majorities—or unanimously—expireafter some period of time because one generation cannot bind another.So even if one subscribes to some social contract theory, by which somemajority can bind everyone, the contract has a limited life.  Onegeneration cannot bind another.<p><a name="71r"><a name="72r"></p><p>	Another problem regarding the obligation of citizens to thestate involves the concept of majoritarianism.  Under majoritarianism,if 51% vote some item into law, the other 49% must go along with itwhether they want to or not. Majoritarianism is a basic weakness ofdemocracy, but it is endured so that democracy can function.  It is apragmatic compromise.  If unanimous consent were required foreverything, governments would not be able to pass many laws (which somesay is not such a bad idea).<a href="#71">[71]</a>  But the fact that alaw is passed by a majority does not mean that it is not coercive,because a large minority might disapprove of the law. Government isforce, regardless of how many individuals might have been in favor ofpassing a particular law.<a href="#72">[72]</a>   And in cases wheredemocracy is representational rather than direct, it sometimes happensthat the peoples' representatives pass a law of which the majority ofcitizens does not approve.<p><a name="73r"></p><p>	The concept of majoritarianism is tied in with the concept ofa social contract, the view that some group of people have somehowentered into a contract with the state and that they can bind theentire population.  They give up a part of their freedom in exchangefor certain benefits which the state can provide.  Some social contracttheorists (like Hobbes) would argue that individuals give up all oftheir rights in exchange for protection by the state.  Others (likeLocke) would argue that individuals give up some of their rights, andthat they can reclaim these rights if the state fails to do its job.<ahref="#73">[73]</a><p>	Some commentators would go farther than Jefferson and Locke andassert that there is no such thing as a social contract, and that suchagreements, even if they did exist, are not binding on anyone who didnot agree to their terms. For example, Spooner states that:</p><ul>	<p>	<a name="74r">	</p>	<p>	The Constitution has no inherent authority or obligation.  It	has no authority or obligation at all, unless as a contract between	man and man.  And it does not so much as even purport to be a	contract between persons now existing. It purports, at most, to	be only a contract between persons living eighty years ago. 	And it can be supposed to have been a contract then only between	persons who had already come to years of discretion, so as to	be competent to make reasonable and obligatory contracts.	Furthermore, we know, historically, that only a small portion even of	the people then existing were consulted on the subject, or asked, or	permitted to express either their consent or dissent in any	formal manner.  Those persons, if any, who did give their consent	formally, are all dead now.  Most of them have been dead forty,	fifty, sixty, or seventy years.  <i>And the Constitution, so far	as it was their contract, died with them</i>. They had no natural	power or right to make it obligatory upon their children.  It	is not only plainly impossible, in the nature of things, that	they <i>could</i> bind their posterity, but they did not even attempt	to bind them.  That is to say, the instrument does not purport	to be an agreement between any body but "the people" <i>then</i> existing;	nor does it, either expressly or impliedly, assert any right,	power, or disposition, on their part, to bind anybody but	themselves.<a href="#74">[74]</a>	</p></ul><p>	So it appears that those who would say that taxation is not coercivebecause "the people" consented to it are standing on shaky ground,philosophically. Taxation is coercive whenever it forces people to partwith their property without their explicit consent.<p>	In a society where freedom and private property are valued, voluntaryforms of revenue raising are superior to coercive forms.  If governmentis viewed as the servant rather than the master of the people, thencoercion is to be minimized and the possibilities for voluntaryexchange maximized.  Forms of revenue raising (like lotteries and userfees) that do not depend on coercion are to be preferred to forms ofrevenue raising that rely on coercion.<p>	One argument that has been made against voluntarism in the areaof government finance is that the government cannot raise all the fundsit needs through voluntarism.  Coercion is necessary for the state tofunction.  While it would take a book to explore this issue, a fewpoints can be made here.  For one thing, this line of reasoning ispragmatic rather than philosophical or ethical.  This pragmatic viewbasically holds that coercion is necessary to raise the necessaryfunds, therefore coercion must be used.  Fairness, equity and propertyrights are totally absent from this line of reasoning.<p><a name="75r"></p><p>	Even if one concedes the point that coercion is needed to raise the"necessary" funds, one must still ask "how much is necessary?"  If thegoal of a free society is to minimize coercion and allow maximum roomfor individual choice, then government expenditures must be kept at aminimum, so that the amount of coercion needed to raise funds isminimized.  Thus, the role of government must be minimized.<ahref="#75">[75]</a><h4>B.	Ability To Pay or Cost-Benefit?</h4> <p><a name="76r"></p><p>	There is an obligation in justice for all the subjects to contributeto the expenses of the state according to the ability and means ofeach.<a href="#76">[76]</a><p><a name="77r"></p><p>	There are two basic and diametrically opposed views of taxation. Those who favor the ability to pay approach view the state as a master,who extracts tribute from its subjects on the basis of how much theyare able to pay.  Those who take this first approach often also viewthe state as a benevolent father figure, who distributes tax benefitson the basis of need.  In Karl Marx's words, "From each according tohis abilities;  to each according to his needs."<a href="#77">[77]</a><p><a name="78r"></p><p>	Those who take the cost-benefit approach view the state as theservant of the people. Government provides services and taxpayers payfor the services.  Those who benefit the most from the services shouldpay the most.  And those who do not use a particular government serviceshould not be forced to pay for it.<a href="#78">[78]</a><p><a name="79r"><a name="80r"></p><p>	A corollary to the cost-benefit principle is that there should besome maximum tax, an amount above which no one should have to pay.Leona Helmsley, for example, who went to prison for tax evasion,<ahref="#79">[79]</a> would not have been punished if the U.S. tax systemwere set up under a cost-benefit principle.because the amount of taxesshe paid—more than $100 million— exceeded the benefit she received. Under the cost-benefit principle, she would have been entitled to arefund.  But because she paid a few million dollars less than she"owed" under the graduated, ability to pay system, and because sheresorted to illegal means to prevent the government from assessing the"proper" amount, she was sentenced to prison.  It is difficult tobelieve that she received more than $100 million in services from thefederal government over the years.  It seems like a clear case of thegovernment exploiting one of its more productive citizens.<ahref="#80">[80]</a><p>	The ability to pay principle involves exploitation.  The governmentexploits the producers— the wealth creators—and redistributes a portionof their income to wealth consumers—those who use the variousgovernment programs.  In that sense, it is a parasitical system.  Thecost- benefit principle, on the other hand, attempts to match costswith benefits.  Those who use government services pay for them, andthose who do not use the services are not forced to pay. Thus, thecost-benefit principle appears to be more fair than the ability to payprinciple because it is based on principles of equity rather thanexploitation.  So a tax that is based on the cost- benefit principle isto be preferred to a tax that relies on the ability to pay principle,all other things being equal.  But even a system based on cost-benefitdoes not eliminate the deadweight loss question or the fact that someof the services provided are services that some taxpayers do notwant—or the fact that the money is being taken without the owner'sconsent.  So if there are degrees of badness, one might say that a taxsystem based on the cost-benefit principle is less bad than one basedon the ability to pay because one is based on exploitation and theother is based on recouping money for services rendered.  But bothsystems are bad, in the sense that they rely on coercion and the takingof property without the owners' consent.<h4>C.	Conclusions and Implications </h4><p><a name="81r"><a name="82r"></p><p>	Is tax evasion a sin?  Is it unethical?  The arguments thathave been put forth over the centuries do not support the position thattax evasion is a sin. Taxation is the taking of property without theowner's consent, which makes it the equivalent of theft, with somegovernment as the robber.  But unlike normal theft, the perpetrator isthe State rather than an individual.  And the taking is continuousrather than a one-time thing, which likens taxation to exploitation orslavery rather than robbery.  The fact that a majority of eligiblevoters who voted in some previous election<a href="#81">[81]</a> doesnot change the substance of the transaction.  And the fact thattaxpayers receive some benefits from government does not alter themorality of the matter either.  The fact that nonevaders may have topay more as a result of the act of evasion does not alter the moralityof the act because taxation is based on theft rather than paying eachwhat one is morally required to pay.  While theologians and others haveoften argued that there is a duty to pay a just tax, the fact is, thereis no such thing as a just tax.<a href="#82">[82]</a>  All taxes arethe taking of property without the owner's consent, so there is nojustice about it, even if some of the proceeds are used for goodcauses. Theft is wrong regardless of whether the thief uses theproceeds of the theft to distribute food to the poor or to gamble,drink or go wenching.  It is the act itself that is either good or bad,not what happens afterward.  Rather than regarding tax evaders assinners, it might be more accurate to say that it is the tax collectorswho sin because it is they who facilitate the taking of propertywithout the owners' consent.<p>	If there is nothing ethically wrong with tax evasion, it seemsto follow that attorneys, accountants and financial planners should notbe penalized for advising their clients to evade taxes, or even forhelping them to evade taxes. Yet it is probably safe to assume that thevast majority of professional codes of ethics for attorneys,accountants and financial planners— perhaps all—would consider any kindof activity that aids in tax evasion to be unethical and subject tosanction.  This prohibition also has some First Amendment implications,since the freedom of an advisor to advise a client to evade taxes isbeing impinged.  Counsellors cannot tell their clients to evade taxes,or show them how to do it, or help them to do it, without openingthemselves up to punishment, which has a chilling effect on freespeech.  While suggesting that these codes of ethics remove anyprohibition on the advocacy of tax evasion is extremely controversial,perhaps it is time that someone at least raised the question.  If theadvocacy of tax evasion is not unethical, and it appears that it isnot, then a code of ethics that punishes individuals for advising theirclients to evade taxes may itself be perpetrating an injustice, sinceit is punishing someone for advocating something that is not unethical.</p><hr><h4>End Notes</h4><ol><p><a name="2"><li> For references that cite discussions of the concept	of sin throughout the ages and from many differing perspectives, see	the Index volume of DICTIONARY OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS 409-10	(1974).		<a href="#1r">Return</a><p><a name="2"><li>A sinful act is not necessarily an unethical act. 	A distinction must be made between what is unethical and what	is sinful.  Unethical conduct is conduct that involves more than one	person, whereas sinful conduct need not involve more than one	person.,  For example, the Catholic church regards as sinful	the taking of the Lord's name in vain, having impure thoughts	and masturbation.  But such conduct would not be considered unethical	because it does not involve more than one person.  Another	distinction that could be made is that an unethical act is something	committed against another human being, whereas sin is a transgression	against God.  W.L.

For example, in	1881, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the income tax was an indirect	tax.  Springer v. U.S., 102 U.S. 586 (1881).  But in 1895, it	reversed its position and held that the income tax is a direct	tax.  Pollock v. Farmers Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429; 158	U.S. 601.  Does that mean that anyone who evaded the U.S. income tax	before 1895 was not committing a sin, but those who evaded it	thereafter were sinners?  But in France, certain income taxes	are legally classified as indirect taxes, which means that evaders do	not commit a sin, which leaves one in the curious position of being a	sinner if one evades the U.S. income tax but not the French	tax.

In effect, the poor are	subsidizing the rich.		<a href="#55r">Return</a><p><a name="56"><li>The author knows of one exempt organization that	takes this position.  For years, it did not apply for tax	exempt status because it felt it had some moral duty to pay for	the government services it received.  But when property taxes	became outrageously high, it decided to apply for a tax exemption,	which it received.  It then started to make voluntary contributions	to the local government each year, based on the value of the services	the government provided.		<a href="#56r">Return</a><p><a name="57"><li>A number of commentators over the years have	speculated as to why the best individuals do not run for political	office or gravitate to positions of authority in government.

HAYEK, THE ROAD TO	SERFDOM 134-52 (1944).		<a href="#57r">Return</a><p><a name="58"><li>Another point might also be made here.  The Public	Choice School of Economics, founded by James Buchanan and	Gordon Tullock, has been pointing out for several decades that	government officials are motivated by the same things that motivate	the rest of us -- self-interest.  They act in their own interest, not	the public interest.		<a href="#58r">Return</a><p><a name="59"><li>Kant's categorical imperative permeates his works. 	For some discussions and examples of it, see IMMANUEL KANT, THE	METAPHYSICS OF MORALS (1797); IMMANUEL KANT, ETHICAL PHILOSOPHY	(1983); W.L.

A few roads are	privately owned.  A number of studies take the position that at	least some roads should be privatized -- turned over to private	owners -- because privately owned roads are better maintained	at a much lower cost.  Thus, government ownership of roads results in	the squandering of resources, relatively speaking.

A systemI call Being There. When considered on this basis it makes no sense. Further,our current system of compensation for innovation -- and the associatedattitude toward intellectual property -- makes even less sense. <BR><BR>In this article I illustrate the flaws of the current system and presenta simple, elegant solution, creating a system in which the natural motivationalinterest of the individual provide for continuous gains in productivityand quality. A system in which production errors can not get into finishedproducts. <BR><BR>Lastly a system that will create a veritable deluge of innovation. Basicinnovation, and process and product innovation. <BR><BR>As must be true with all new knowledge, you will see concepts that havebeen tried in the past and did not work. This was not a fault in the principle,but rather in the implementation. It is the old system -- the system ofcompensation based in Being There -- that can not withstand the scrutinyof logical examination. <BR><BR>The system described is one used in all advanced, volitional societies.The question is not if it will be adopted on this planet, but when. Nothingelse makes sense. <BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> |</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><H3><CENTER><A NAME="BAC"></A>BACKGROUND</CENTER></H3><H4>The book, The Virtual Corporation</H4>The Virtual Corporation by Davidow and Malone1 has begun to tie togethermany of the technological and managerial solutions to today's business problems.Yet there remain basic flaws with the way companies are structured and theway people are compensated, both for production and innovation. The bookdoes not address these basic problems. <BR><BR>Because of these flaws, almost all of the tampering with the current businessstructure and methods is nothing more than Band-Aid therapy. It is liketrying to repair a Rube Goldberg machine for which the drawings have beenlost, and there has been no configuration control. It is possible to tinkerwith it and improve things here and there, but there can be no dramatic,overall improvements on a system that needs replacing rather than repair.<BR><H4>Historical background of business structure</H4>Just as there has been no change in principle in so-called governments sincethe dawn of history, with man continuing to be ruled by a combination offorce and fraud, so there has been no real change in business structures.<BR><BR>The business structure has been based on two concepts: <BR><UL>  <LI>a hierarchy of bosses, whether it is a two-level system or one withtwenty or more levels;   <LI>a system of production compensation based on the concept of what Icall <B>Being There</B>. <p>People are paid based on their presence in theworkplace, almost regardless of the quantity or quality of production.</p></UL><H4>Problems of the old system</H4>Discussing the fact that something is terribly wrong with our economy andthe way business is done, Davidow and Malone say, &quot;The uneasiness comesfrom the intuition that the problem cannot be solved simply by another taxreform or shift in monetary policy. Working harder and longer does not appearto be the solution to individuals either unable to find work or alreadyholding down more than one job.&quot;2 <BR><BR>The old system, <B>&quot;Being There&quot;</B>, creates a number of problems,but they can all be traced back to two basic things: People are not heldaccountable for their errors, and the system does not motivate people. Ifyou were trying to design a system that had a negative effect on motivationyou could not do better than the current business structure. <BR><BR>And if you are thinking of disagreeing with me on the subject of error accountability,let's look at the situation more closely first. I agree that for large errorsa person may be demoted or terminated, but this is not what I am reallytalking about. <BR><BR>The errors I am most concerned about are the ones just above &quot;the noiselevel.&quot; They are recognizable as errors, but they are not terriblybad errors. Just &quot;routine&quot; errors. Yet recognizable as errors,and something that costs the company money or loss of image. Such as anerror that gets to the customer. These errors are much more significantthan the ones that are recorded and for which a person is disciplined. Why?<BR><BR>Because it is recognized as an error even by the person who made the mistake,although he may not admit it to others, and perhaps hardly even to himself.And it is &quot;swept under the carpet.&quot; He does not pay for it, sincethe company absorbs the cost and passes it along to the hapless consumerin the form of a higher price and perhaps even a product with a defect.<BR><BR>This creates two potentially devastating consequences. One is the loss ofself-esteem caused by &quot;getting away with&quot; the error. The otheris loss of opportunity to learn from the error. <BR><BR>Both of these are bit like radiation damage. The effect is cumulative, withthe person passing up countless opportunities to learn and becoming moreand more incompetent as time passes. The damage to the ego and self-esteembrings on an increasing sense of hopelessness. Of having lost control ofone's life and destiny. It is this loss of self-esteem and the feeling ofhaving lost control of one's life that is the root cause of most of theproblems of society today. Whether it comes from the underemployment ofthe Being There system, or actual unemployment. <BR><BR>A favorite buzzword these days is empowerment. Essentially it means to passdecision-making responsibility and authority down to the lowest levels.When this is not done individuals lose interest in their jobs and have noincentive. Not only the incentive to do what is right, but even to the extentof not having any interest when they see things being done wrong or notin the best, most efficient way. The current hierarchial system mitigatesagainst empowerment. <BR><BR>Attempts are made to correct the problem by another hot concept, benchmarking.In principle this is a good idea, yet because of the business organizationthere are serious potential problems. The concept is often used as a toolto monitor people and demand higher performance in a system in which theyare not, and can not be properly compensated for the additional output.The end result is heightened confrontation between labor and management.<BR><BR>As Jude Rich of Sibson & Company says, &quot;The old motivational toolshave lost their magic. The great challenge that lies before us is to restructurehow we do work and reward people.&quot;3 <BR><BR>Another major problem with the current business system is innovation. Whilethe United States has been the world leader in innovation virtually sinceits founding, other countries are catching up as the US flounders. Evenwhile the other countries use the same defective business system as theUS. <BR><BR>And, as Frank R. Lichtenberg has noted, &quot;... analysis indicates thatthe rate of return on such intangible investments [investment in research& development] actually exceeds the return on expenditures for plant andequipment by a factor of as much as 7 to 1. That is, a dollar of privateR&D investment appears to be seven times more potent in facilitating productivitygrowth and higher per capita income than a dollar of conventional capitalinvestment.&quot;4 <BR><BR>And, as Davidow & Malone state, &quot;Inventions and their interactionswill be the engine of the virtual corporation.&quot;5 Innovation is theengine of industry. Without it there are no products and no process to producethem. Yet the way we compensate people for innovation is appalling. Oftenthe compensation is even negative in the sense that the idea is stolen fromthe person and they spend years trying to get proper compensation ratherthan engaging in further innovation. Even in the best of cases the rewardis often minuscule. <BR><BR>All of these create a situation in which there is no real, deep-seated motivationtoward productivity, quality, and innovation. Where cost control and qualityseem like abstract concepts that must be imposed on an organization andits uninterested and unwilling people. Where products are designed by themarketing and engineering departments according to their view of the world,rather than what the consumer might want. <BR><BR>The system creates a &quot;winner-loser&quot; mentality. A circle of confrontationthat can not be truly broken by traditional methods. Management trying tokeep ahead of labor and vice-versa, and internal company organizations againsteach other. Because of emphasis on cost controls, and rigid company structures,promotions and pay increases are in danger of extinction. In a sense businessis becoming almost like the film industry. In the film industry as the storygoes, you can not become a member of Screen Actors Guild until you havebeen in a film. And you can not be in a film unless you are a member ofSAG. It is becoming increasingly more difficult for school-leavers to findjobs because they don't have experience. Yet how are they expected to haveexperience if they have been in school all their life? <BR><BR>All of these problems of the current business and compensation structurebreed frustrations. Employees feel they have lost control of their livesand destiny. Employers feel they have lost control of everything. It iswhen this feeling becomes deeper that people begin to think of escape intoharmful behavior. The feeling of loss of self-control of one's life anddestiny is in fact the root cause of both juvenile and adult delinquency.<BR><BR>In summary, the problems of the current system are: <BR><UL>  <p>  <LI>it pays people almost regardless of the quantity and quality of theirproduction;</p> <p> <LI>people work and produce as a group rather than as individuals. Productionoutside of the norm of the group presents a problem with no real solutionunder the present scheme of compensation;</p>  <p> <LI>being compensated as part of a group, virtually all individual incentiveis lost. Work Teams do not truly solve this problem;</p> <p> <LI>all levels of worker have not only a fairly rigid cap on their income,but also a cap on any so-called &quot;merit&quot; increases;</p> </UL><p>Yet there is a simple, elegant solution to all these problems.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> |</CENTER><HR NOSHADE><H3><CENTER><A NAME="SOL"></A>THE SOLUTION</CENTER></H3><H4>Concept</H4>My concept of the virtual corporation is different than that of Davidowand Malone. Theirs is &quot;virtual&quot; more by the nature of the productsand the implementation of technology. With respect for their studious collectionof current Band-Aid therapy, their system is still the same old tired, worn-outstructure, even if individuals have been empowered to do more things. <BR><BR>This concept does not consist of companies in the current concept of suchthings. My concept of a virtual corporation is an entrepreneur orchestratingthe activities of a number of independent contractors brought together tocreate a product, whether tangible or intangible. The independent contractorsand the project on which they are working will change from time to time.They may work on more than one project for him or on projects for otherentrepreneurs. Yet this is not the independent contractor or piece-worksystem of old. <BR><BR>The independent contractors may themselves be entrepreneurs, orchestratingtheir own product or service for one or more entrepreneurs. What binds themtogether is the abilities required for a project, integrity, and a cost-effective,quality service. Again this may be a tangible product or an intangible service.Creating a physical part or service, or providing an intellectual product.<BR><BR>While abilities and other things are crucial, it is integrity that is theglue which will hold everything together. As Davidow and Malone say, <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The virtual corporation is built upon unprecedented levelsof trust. Between the company and its suppliers and customers. Between managementand labor. Between senior and middle management.&quot;6 </BLOCKQUOTE>The only thing I would disagree with in that statement is the concept ofmanagement and labor, and senior and middle management. Those concepts cannot exist in the true virtual corporation. <BR><BR>My concept of a virtual corporation is: <BR><BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;An organization existing at any one time for the purposeof creating one or more products, whether tangible or intangible. It isorganized by an entrepreneur and consists of Production Associates, eachoperating under contract as individual companies, each responsible for thecompletion of one or more error-free tasks, for which they are compensatedbased on the market value of the task(s). <BR><BR>&quot;For innovation, whether basic, product, or process, royalties arepaid to the individual innovator(s) for the life of the innovation on amutually agreed basis between innovator and user. Such royalties are paidonly by those who use the innovations of others in the creation of a product(tangible or intangible), and not by end-users of a product. <BR><BR>&quot;The relationship between the entrepreneur and each Production Associatebegins, continues, and ends at mutually agreed times and on a mutually agreed,mutually profitable basis. <BR><BR>Production Associates acquire their contracts either directly or throughagencies or clearing houses based on mutually profitable relationships withtheir clients, both the entrepreneurs and the Production Associates.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> | <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H3><CENTER><A NAME="IMP"></A>IMPLEMENTATION</CENTER></H3><H4>General</H4>There is one important, all-encompassing, over-riding concept that mustbe observed if any attempt is to be successful in solving the problems ofproductivity and innovation. This is that the solution must be personallyprofitable to each and every participant. The company, the individual, andthe consumer. <BR><BR>Implementation of my concept of the virtual corporation, in which peopleare compensated solely on the basis of their error-free production, is simplein a manufacturing-type environment. This is because manufacturing costaccounting concepts are well defined and extensively used. The concept isless easy to apply in a &quot;white collar,&quot; &quot;overhead,&quot;or &quot;exempt&quot; environment for the reason that cost accounting andperformance benchmarks are often less well defined. Yet all that is requiredto apply the concept to all areas of production (which includes services)is more thought, imagination, and experience. <BR><BR>For this reason I would say it is even more important to implement the performancestandards of the virtual corporation in this environment. Like all otherproblems in our universe, it only requires more knowledge and we will havethe answers. <BR><BR>The thought of converting to the compensation concepts of the virtual corporationwill produce a certain amount of anxiety in people. Therefore, it is importantto smooth the transition by basing compensation on existing cost accountingstructures. Thus, assuming the person performs as before, they will be makingthe same amount of money. However, this will no longer be guaranteed. Onthe other hand, when a person can produce better and faster, they can earnmore. There is no arbitrary cap on income. <BR><H4>Implementing A Production Compensation System</H4>The basic inputs for the compensation system of the virtual corporationcome from standard cost accounting systems. The system that defines thetasks that go into a product or service and the amount of time requiredto do the tasks for people with certain assumed levels of education, experience,and ability. <BR><BR>To create a proper compensation system for the virtual corporation it isonly necessary to create standard cost accounting figures for the processesof the organization. If it is a new company or a new process within an existingorganization you must then acquire people with the appropriate skills. Thesame as you would do if they were to be compensated on the basis of BeingThere. If you are converting existing workers to virtual corporation conceptsyour hiring work is already done for you. <BR><BR>In both cases it is necessary to explain to workers the advantages, procedures,and obligations of being compensated solely on the basis of error-free taskcompletion. As a refresher these are: <BR><UL>    <p>  <LI>No arbitrary cap on income;  </p>    <p>  <LI>payment is made solely on the basis of error-free task completion;  </p>    <p>  <LI>within the limits of the production scheduling system, individualsmay choose the number of hours they work and when they work;</p> <p>  <LI>in addition to being paid for production, if they create product orprocess innovations a separate compensation will come into effect.</p></UL>One of the first things that will happen is that some people will completetheir tasks ahead of schedule. This means they will earn more per unit oftime than had been planned. This is good for them, but has not helped thecompany to reduce costs. What should be done to correct this? <BR><BR>When the productivity increase reaches a certain level, by prior agreement--andon a mutually profitable basis--the benefits will be shared between thecompany and the individual. The individual will still make more per unitof time, but the company will also pay less per error-free task completion.The major benefit for the both the individual and the company is still tocome, from product or process innovation. <BR><BR>The only guide line to be followed concerning the amount of the productivityincrease that accrues to the entrepreneur or company and to the individualis that it should be that percentage and amount that maximizes the longterm interest and profits of the two parties involved. It should maximizethe individual's motivation while providing an adequate return on investmentand productivity increase for the entrepreneur or company. <BR><H4>Implementation Details</H4>How do we implement a system of paying only for error-free task completion?As indicated above we start with the standard cost accounting system. Fromthis you will have determined the hourly rate for the people doing tasksand the amount of time required for the task. With this you can determinethe task value, which is the basic input for determining individual pay.The following table illustrates the principle: <BR><P><CENTER><TABLE border> <TR> <TH>Task</TH> <TH>Hrly Rate</TH> <TH>Timeto Complete (Mins.)</TH> <TH>Task Value</TH> </TR> <TR> <TD>A</TD> <TD>10.00</TD><TD>20</TD> <TD>3.33</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>B</TD> <TD>12.50</TD> <TD>75</TD><TD>15.63</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>C</TD> <TD>15.00</TD> <TD>3</TD> <TD>0.75</TD></TR> <TR> <TD>D</TD> <TD>10.00</TD> <TD>7</TD> <TD>1.17</TD> </TR> <TR><TD>E</TD> <TD>10.00</TD> <TD>15</TD> <TD>2.59</TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER><P>With this task value, and knowing the actual production of each individualyou can then calculate individual compensation for the period. As an example:<BR><P><CENTER><TABLE border> <TR> <TH>Individual</TH> <TH>Task</TH> <TH>TaskValue</TH> <TH>Task Completed</TH> <TH>Payment</TH> </TR> <TR> <TD>Adams</TD><TD>A</TD> <TD>3.33</TD> <TD>32</TD> <TD>106.56</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>Baker</TD><TD>B</TD> <TD>15.63</TD> <TD>10</TD> <TD>156.30</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>Charles</TD><TD>E</TD> <TD>2.50</TD> <TD>43</TD> <TD>107.50</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>David</TD><TD>C</TD> <TD>0.75</TD> <TD>127</TD> <TD>96.25</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>Evans</TD><TD>C</TD> <TD>0.75</TD> <TD>1.43</TD> <TD>107.25</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>Evans</TD><TD>D</TD> <TD>1.17</TD> <TD>23</TD> <TD>26.91</TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER><P>At the moment I am assuming implementation of the concept in an on-goingorganization, including the fact that people have been trained for theirjobs. In a new, startup operation, it would be necessary to create the costaccounting system as a planning forecast and to conduct training. In thisnecessarily brief article I can not go into all of the details of such anoperation, but anyone who is in business should know what to do. <BR><BR>In the true virtual corporation, training would be the responsibility ofeach individual. A company or entrepreneur could provide part of it forhis associates as an incentive or benefit, but I think it best not to provideall of it on a no-charge basis. People will derive more benefit from trainingwhen they know there is at least some cost to them. <BR><H4>Errors</H4>What about errors? How do we handle them? In the process of learning anddoing things errors are sometimes difficult to prevent or avoid. Individualswill however give more thought to them when there is a monetary cost tothem for making errors. Further, it is immoral for a person to be requiredto pay for the errors of another. This is separate from the fact that itis also irrational in the long term for one person to pay for the errorsof another. It deprives the individual of a very basic means of learningand improving their competence. <BR><BR>First and foremost, in accordance with the principles of the true virtualcorporation, pay is only for error-free task completion. When an error ismade, there is the option of correcting the error through a repair, or re-doingthe task without error. If materials and services have been wasted in theprocess, then the company or entrepreneur must be compensated for them.Including any &quot;overhead&quot; costs for warehousing, issuance, disposal,etc. <BR><BR>I know this will be controversial, but if the error has caused consequentialdamages, these must be for the account of the creator. As indicated above,to not do so is both immoral and irrational. <BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> | <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H3><CENTER><A NAME="PRO"></A>THE PROBLEMS</CENTER></H3><H4>Production Scheduling</H4>Yes, I know there will be production scheduling problems. I also know thatthey, like all other problems, can be solved with greater knowledge. And,since this is the only rational way to compensate people, the problems mustand will be solved. <BR><BR>There are many unanswered questions here, but it is expected that the readerwill think of how they can be solved on a mutually profitable basis. Forexample, what happens when the entrepreneur or the company conceive of aproductivity increase? Perhaps in the form of automation. Whatever the outcome,including eliminating the need for a human operator, a generalized solutionmust be in the production contract. There should be no reason why the companyshould keep or pay a person when they do nothing. Yet an attempt to findsomething for the individual to do can bring long term rewards to both parties.<BR><BR>This is a very brief discussion of production scheduling, but it is a verywell known subject and should present few problems to a professional. Ihave a full discussion of the subject in my book-in-progress. <BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> | <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H3><CENTER><A NAME="DIF"></A>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND PREVIOUS SYSTEMS</CENTER></H3>Hopefully, the differences between this system and previous attempts tosolve the problem of productivity should be obvious: <BR><UL> <p><LI>This system maximizes the income and profits of both	parties--the individual and the company;</p> <p>  <LI>it puts a premium on not making mistakes;  </p>    <p>  <LI>it removes arbitrary caps on individual income;  </p>    <p>  <LI>cost control is definitive and absolute.  </p></UL><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> | <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H3><CENTER><A NAME="INN"></A>IMPLEMENTING AN INNOVATION COMPENSATION SYSTEM<A/></CENTER></H3>The innovation compensation system is also easy to implement. In principle,innovation is compensated in the same manner as production, and that isaccording to the market value of the associated innovation. However, ratherthan just paying for more production, you must also pay a royalty basedon the market value of the innovation. This is true whether it is productor process innovation. <BR><BR>Why should a royalty be paid? Several reasons. One is that it is the onlymoral thing to do. The other is that the prospect of a significant paymentis a major motivating factor in innovation, and such payment will provideadditional motivation for future innovation. The company should be happyto make such a payment, because it is in their own best interest. It iswhat will create a stream of innovation, and in the end this is what makescompanies successful. <BR><H4>Handling the case of more than one innovator per innovation</H4>Calculating a royalty for one innovator is a simple matter. There may becases where there is more than one innovator. How do we handle that? <BR><BR>The first thing of course is to identify the people involved and quantifytheir contribution as well as is possible. It is not necessary to spenda great amount of time doing this, or is it necessary to write a book onthe subject. An outline of the contribution of each individual will certainlydo as a starting point. <BR><BR>Then pick the first person on the list and assign an arbitrary value totheir innovation. Say 100. Then go to the next name and assign a value totheir innovation relative to that of the first person. If, for example,it appears the innovation of the second person is worth twice that of thefirst person, assign it a value of 200. If that of the third person is halfthat of the first, assign a value or 50. <BR><BR>When finished, the entrepreneur would review the assessments in his ownmind. And then with all innovators as a group. It is almost certain therewill be some disagreement and discussion. This is a negotiating sessionto arrive at figures that are acceptable to all of the innovators. Lookat your figures -- those of the entrepreneur -- as the starting point. Thenit should really be up to the individual innovators to set mutually agreedrelative values. It is almost certain there is no one with better knowledgeon what was done than the individual innovators. Further, the entrepreneurshould have only one interest at this point. That the finally selected valuesare in fact agreeable to all of the innovators. <BR><BR>When this has been agreed, a table such as the following can be created:<BR><P><CENTER><TABLE border> <TR> <TH>Innovator Name</TH> <TH>Relative InnovationValue</TH> <TH>Percent of Total</TH> </TR> <TR> <TD>Andrews</TD> <TD>100</TD><TD>23.53%</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>Baker</TD> <TD>200</TD> <TD>47.06%</TD> </TR><TR> <TD>Clifford</TD> <TD>50</TD> <TD>11.76%</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>Danforth</TD><TD>75</TD> <TD>17.65%</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD><HR NOSHADE></TD> <TD><HR NOSHADE></TD><TD><HR NOSHADE></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD><B>TOTAL</B></TD> <TD><B>425</B></TD><TD><B>100.00%</B></TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER><P>Knowing the market value of the innovations as a group for a certainperiod of time, and assuming a royalty percentage, it is now possible tocalculate the individual royalties for that period. <BR><H4>Innovations added to innovations</H4>It is almost certain the market unit that exists now will be improved inthe future. How do we handle that? <BR><BR>When we remember that innovations are compensated based on their marketvalue the answer is simple. We only need to know the market value of theinnovation and go through the above exercise with the individuals involvedin this new innovation. <BR><H4>The Royalty</H4>How much should the royalty be? There is no magic number. It is what willprovide the best return to both the company and the individual. We mightpick a figure of 10% for the sake of discussion. <BR><BR>Suppose a worker makes an innovation that increases company sales by $1million. Then his royalty should be $100,000. I can hear the screams now.&quot;You must be crazy! That is too much money!&quot; If you say that--andyou want to think in terms of short-term economics--I suggest you look atit from the standpoint of the return on your investment. You are investing$100,000 and obtaining a return of $900,000. Not too shabby. Especiallywhen you consider it probably occurred in one year. Further, it is a returnyou would not have had if the innovation had not occurred. And, if sucha payment in principle is not made, you can be sure innovative thinkingwill not occur again for a long time. Or, if it does, the individual willstart their own company to capitalize on it. I personally know of individualswho had ideas, offered it to their company, and the idea was rejected. Theythen quit, started their own company, and were very successful. I have onefriend who eventually sold his company for $241 million. <BR><BR>You might be wondering what the worker will do with the money. Is it reallythat important to anyone but him? There are a few possibilities: <BR><UL>  <p>  <LI>He might just quit and retire with his wife to Montana.  </p>    <p>  <LI>He might quit, leave his wife, and head for the South Seas.  </p>    <p>  <LI>He might like the idea of the &quot;quick hit,&quot; and work on doing	it again.	</p></UL>He might use some of the money to buy computer, workshop, or laboratoryequipment to enhance his innovation abilities. He might also spend someof his time taking specialized training courses that will further enhancehis ability to innovate. <BR><BR>Whatever he does, he has provided the company with an increase in salesand profits that vastly outstrips the associated cost. At the very leastit will serve as an example of what others can do. <BR><BR>One last word on this subject. The royalty should and must be paid for aslong as this innovation is providing value to the company. If you must askwhy, review the previous paragraphs and think. <BR><BR>Further, no innovation may be used without the permission of the innovator.If you don't understand why, remember that an innovation is property isthe property of the person who creates it. In principle it is no differentthan tangible property, such as a painting. If you liked the painting ofan artist, wanted it, but you could not agree on the price, would you justtake it anyway? <BR><BR>If nothing else, look at it from a practical standpoint. People who do notreceive proper payment for innovations have been known to just stop innovating.Or, if they did not stop, they kept their innovations to themselves, preferringthat to receiving less than the value they placed on them. <BR><BR>On the other hand, when a person is properly rewarded for their intellectualoutput it acts as a stimulus. Proper, market-value compensation while createa veritable deluge of innovation. Basic innovation, and product and processinnovation. <BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> | <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H3><CENTER><A NAME="UNI"></A>UNIONS</CENTER></H3>The virtual corporation could spell the end for unions in their presentform, however there is hope for them. They could reconstitute themselvesas an educational organization and a clearing house for contract workers.<BR><BR>As an educational organization they could teach such traditional coursesas English and basic science and mathematics, and then more advanced, specializedcourses to allow individuals to continually increase their educational qualifications.<BR><BR>As a clearing house, they could maintain -- on a contractual basis -- individualnames and associated experience and qualifications. Entrepreneurs and companiescould then consult the clearing house to obtain people with certain specifiedskills. Unlike their current activities, unions would need to do these thingson a mutually profitable, fee-paying basis, such as is currently done withemployment agencies. <BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> | </CENTER><P><HR NOSHADE><H3><CENTER><A NAME="LEG"></A>LEGAL AND FINANCIAL SITUATION</CENTER></H3>I am not a lawyer and therefore can not give legal advice. For that youmust contact a lawyer. I will only give some thoughts and ideas for youto consider and possibly discuss with an attorney. <BR><BR>The American political r&eacute;gime seems to live in fear of independentworkers and has some very strict guidelines that must be followed to supportthe fact you are not an employee. Once that has been done there are sometax advantages -- and liabilities -- to being independent. It also movesthe burden of some bureaucratic paper work previously done by the employeronto the individual. <BR><BR>Generally you must have a business license if you are independent in thenature of being a &quot;consultant.&quot; This would probably be the closestthing to an individual who works independently and on contract. <BR><BR>As with any business, it is imperative that you keep good records. Thismeans both the legal and &quot;administrative&quot; records, and financialrecords. As an independent businessman and, in effect, an entrepreneur,you will be entitled to certain tax breaks. But, as mentioned above, therewill also be some additional hits by the IRS. Probably the most prominentis that you must pay the other half of what the IRS euphemistically calls&quot;social security&quot; tax. Depending on the type of work you are doingyou may be entitled to a tax break on special clothing and on a home office.But again as stated above, you must make absolutely sure you are followingappropriate IRS guidelines. <BR><BR>While you would not directly receive the medical and pension benefits ofan employee, there is no reason you could not be a member of a group plan.This could be another function of a new type of &quot;union,&quot; whichwould be more like a professional society than a union. As far as pensionsare concerned, with an investment ,of as little as $10 a week starting whena person is twenty-one, they can have more than $500,000 in assets in today'sdollar upon reaching age 65, and draw a pension income of more than $50,000.This would exceed the working income of the average worker, and also illustratesthe fraudulent nature of so-called &quot;social security.&quot; Which inany case is only a money laundering operation, transferring part of theincome from a number of people to one other person while at the same timeextracting a large &quot;handling&quot; fee. How else can you explain thefact there is less money in what is euphemistically called &quot;your account&quot;than what you and the employer &quot;contributed&quot; over the years? <BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><CENTER>| <A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A> | <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H3><CENTER><A NAME="SUM"></A>SUMMARY</CENTER></H3>The environment of a proper virtual corporation creates a new type of companyand a new class of &quot;worker&quot; who is no longer a worker. Each &quot;worker&quot;is now an individual and not a cog in a machine. The individual is now atthe very least a budding entrepreneur who has an ability to earn limitedonly by their experience, education, imagination, and drive. The abilityto continually advance based truly on individual merit, becoming a full-fledgedentrepreneur in their own right. <BR><BR>The prime consideration is innovation and error-free production. It is independentof color, religion, sex, politics or another other arbitrary, non-performance-relatedconsiderations. An intelligent entrepreneur or company director should onlybe interested in the long-term results for his or her organization. <BR><BR><HR><H4>Footnotes</H4><OL>  <LI>William H.

The gayest area by faris Dupont Circle, a close second is the Capital Hill district, with thenewer Adams Morgan area coming in a steady third. The nation's capital offersa gay man or lesbian the ultimate in of gay life, art, theater, culture,clubs as well as a welcoming, hospitable southern gay and lesbian community.</B><UL>  <LI><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor788581"><B>Accommodations</B></A>   <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor788742">AIDS/ HIV</A></B>   <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor795238">Alcohol / Drug Abuse</A></B>  <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor785613">Bars - Mens</A></B>   <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor784124">Bars - Mixed</A></B>   <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor781544">Bars - Women</A></B>   <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor779839">Body Piercing</A></B>   <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor779250">Bookstores</A></B>   <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor778317">Hotlines</A></B>   <LI><B><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor777417">Massage</A></B>   <LI><A HREF="dc.list.html#anchor776718"><B>Restaurants</B></A> </UL><P><CENTER>Go to<BR><A HREF="travel.nav.html">Travel Navigational Page </A>| <A HREF="pinkpages.navagational.html">PinkPages Navagational Page</A> | <A HREF="index.html">Pink Web Home Page</A><BR><A HREF="pp.order.html">Order a Pink Pages </A>| <A HREF="referral.suggestion.html">Referrals- Corrections - Suggestions</A><BR><BR><IMG SRC="rule.2.jpeg" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1"><BR></CENTER><P>To contact us by E-Mail<BR><A HREF="mailto:comments@pinkweb.com">&copy;1996 kp media group </A><BR></BODY></HTML>

Most ofmy training in the communications field has been in radio. I actually startedin the business at a small AM station in Quincy, MA. I began as a receptionist,then a copy writer, and finally on air as an Arts and Entertainment reporterfor the station. <BR>I moved to Florida and landed a morning show at an FM Adult Contemporarystation and held that position for about 4 years. In that time I was fortunateenough to host beauty pageants, conventions and telethons live and on television.I also directed and produced dinner theater productions of shows like &quot;AChorus Line&quot; and &quot;the 1940's Radio Hour&quot; at citrus hill inFlorida. <BR>I decided to move back to Boston (my real home) and am I glad I did! I wasfortunate to meet Mary Kennedy, the Producer of Pridetime. I began by doingsome voice-over work for the show and one or two commentaries. Then thehost at the time moved on and I was asked to step in. I still remember thefirst Gay Pride march I hosted with Georgia Ragsdale. I was a nervous wreck,and remember saying the route of the parade would pass through South Bostoninstead of the South End of Boston. I was quickly corrected, and even afterthat I've been allowed the honor of hosting the last three marches and allof the shows in between.<BR>Pridetime has given me the opportunity to explore my desire to learn andunderstand and by asking questions of community leaders, celebrities andwriters. I try to ask thoughtful questions that most people would like toknow the answers to. I'll ask the tough questions when the situation callsfor it, but I enjoy the positive side: the coming out process, the way eventschange a persons perspective, etc.<BR>Some of my favorite guests have included Judy Tenuta, local film consultantGeorge Monseur, Cambridge City Councilor Katherine Triantifilou, authorLeroy Aarons (Prayers for Bobby) and my personal favorite Harvey Fierstein.<BR>I look forward to my own understanding of our community and serving ourcommunity with uplifting and intelligent talk, as well as challenging andbreaking down stereotypes using televisions power to mix word and images.<BR><BR>I look forward to seeing you next time on Pridetime! <BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rule.3.jpeg" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" WIDTH="432"HEIGHT="9" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H1>Mark Adams</H1>It all began at a small 5000-watt radio station in the Merrimack Valley- I'd had a &quot;falling out&quot; with the administration of Boston University'sSchool of Communications when they'd determined I'd be better off anywherebut there. This mid-market station hired me as a news man - after severalweeks, they too determined I'd be better off doing anything but news, sothey gave me a mid-morning call in cooking show, quite appropriate, actually,as I knew not how to fry water! From there, I hit several other mid sizedradio outlets, doing DJ work , talk shows, and reviews of numerous highschool performances of ARSENIC AND OLD LACE. Tiring of the daily grind ofbroadcasting, I took to teaching. Teaching broadcasting, that is, at a now-defunctschlock Career Academy Broadcasting school, where many thousands of dollarswas more than enough for admittance. Out of over 500 students taught I canclaim two success stories, One a morning DJ at a Miami station, the othera news anchor at an ABC affiliate in Fresno, California. Oddly, enough,they are both gay, and they eventually became lovers. After the Academy'snon-voluntary closing, I returned to the radio biz at what was then Boston'sonly country radio station, a low-budget operation that paid in barteredcowboy hats and boots instead of cash. From there it was on to a more successfulcountry radio station on the FM dial, where I became close friends withthe likes of Boxcar Willie. I regained my sanity when a former paramutualsuggested I open a video store - I think there were 3 in New England atthe time. And thus began - THE MOVIE PLACE, which now has the largest selectionof all-male titles and lesbian films. I was then asked to write a videocolumn for IN NEWSWEEKLY, which I still do, and recently met Mary Kennedy,who foolishly thought I could do a good job of reviewing gay themed videosfor her wonderful PRIDETIME show. The rest, as they say, is fictional history.<BR><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rule.1.jpeg" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" WIDTH="432"HEIGHT="9" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><H1><IMG SRC="pridetime.mike.jpeg" WIDTH="76" HEIGHT="106" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM">Mike Ceceri</H1>Some people consider watching television something to do when they are bored.I have always considered it a major part of my life. I have always lovedevery aspect of it, and for as long as I remember I knew I wanted to bea part of it. <BR>I am a true gypsy at heart. Born and raised in Rhode Island, I learned ata young age that life is short so enjoy it. After graduating Coventry HighSchool in 1988, I moved away to study Graphic Design and Musical Theaterat Flagler College in St. Augustine, Florida. I returned in 1991 to RI andlanded several parts in semi-professional theater. I also worked officejobs and did the whole starving actor thing. I then decided to get a jobdoing design work. In May of 1995 I took a job as Production Manager forthe New England Community Guide's Pink Pages. I got involved in Pridetimeduring Pride 95. I started out by filling in for a missing crew member,immediately I was hooked. I enjoy being a part of the talented productionteam, suggesting segments, helping on shoots and my favorite... being oncamera. Interviewing Judy Gold was my favorite project so far. I look forwardto every show because it allows me an opportunity to meet different membersof the community I would not be exposed to otherwise. <BR><P><CENTER><B>Go To<BR><A HREF="pridetime.home.html">Pridetime Home Page</A> | <A HREF="index.html">PinkWeb Home Page<BR></A><A HREF="referral.suggestion.html">Ideas or Comments</A><A HREF="index.html"><BR></A></B><BR><IMG SRC="rule.2.jpeg" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="9"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER><P>To contact us by E-Mail<BR><A HREF="mailto:comments@pinkweb.com">&copy;1996 kp media group </A><BR></BODY></HTML>

The Candela laser is safer than traditionalmethods because of its unique ability to selectively treat the tattoo orlesion pigment. Thus, it will eliminate the tattoo or pigment while leavingthe surrounding skin undamaged.<BR><BR>What conditions are treated with the Candela laser system? Pigmented lesionslike nevus of ota and multicolored tattoos (amateur and professional) includingblack, blue, and other colors are treated. The effectiveness of the laseris dependent upon the age, location, depth, and type of tattoo/pigmentedlesion, as well as on the composition of the pigments.</H3><H2><CENTER>Tattoo before treatment</CENTER></H2><H3><BR>Why would someone have a pigmented lesion or tattoo removed? Many peopleare uncomfortable with unsightly pigmented lesions like nevus of ota, orwith tattoos they had applied several years ago. It is estimated that asmany as 50 % of individuals with tattoos regret the permanency of the tattooand wish to have it removed. With the Candela lasers, treatment is now possible.<BR><BR>What does treatment involve? Treatment with the Candela lasers varies frompatient to patient depending on the age, size and type of tattoo, colorof the patient's skin and depth to which the tattoo<BR><BR>The skin's reaction to the laser is tested during the first visit to determinethe most effective treatment. Treatment consists of placing a handpieceagainst the surface of the skin and activating the laser. As many patientsdescribe it, each pulse feels like the snapping of a rubber band againstthe skin. Smaller tattoos/lesions will require fewer pulses, while largerones will require more. All tattoos will require retreatments, necessitatingmultiple patient visits. The Candela system is less painful and requiresless recovery time than some other treatment methods. The degree of discomfortvaries with each person, depending on his/her pain threshold. Most patientsdo not require anesthesia. In some cases, however, depending on the natureand location of the tattoo or lesion, the physician may elect to use someform of anesthesia.<BR><BR>Is it possible to have a tattoo or pigmented lesion treated that was previouslytreated by another modality? Patients with previously treated tattoos maybe candidates for the Candela systems. Tattoos or pigmented lesions thathave not been effectively removed by other treatments may respond well toCandela laser therapy.<BR><HR></H3><H3><CENTER><IMG SRC="Medical-face.gif" WIDTH="192" HEIGHT="158" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER></H3><H1><CENTER>Skin Resurfacing</CENTER></H1><H3>As time marches on, our facial skin begins to reflect our years. Finelines and wrinkles appear around the eyes; creases deepen in the mouth andforehead areas. Your image is no longer a reflection of how you feel aboutyourself...Youthful, Healthy, Vibrant.<BR><BR>How does the laser work?<BR>Guided by your surgeon, the CO2 laser uses light pulses to accurately andpercisely vaporize damaged tissue layer by layer. The light pulses remainon the skin for very short periods of time. So short, that surrounding tissueis not damaged.<BR><BR>The area to be treated is usually marked preoperatively. The laser low powerbeam is then applied to the skin or wrinkles, in the microscopic first layersof skin are vaporized. The laser beam itself is obsorbed by the water inthe skin's cells causing them to dry. The dead cells are then gently wipedaway from the treated area. <BR><BR>The laser's fine control offers the patient a safer, more predictable procedurewithout bleeding, minimizing the risk of complications. <BR>The procedure usually takes any where from thirty minutes to two hours basedon the areas treated. Depending on the type and depth of the wrinkle orscar, one or more sessions may be scheduled.<BR><BR>Laser Skin Resurfacing may also be performed in conjunction with eyelidsurgery.<BR><HR></H3><H2><CENTER>Laser Treatment of Leg Veins<BR>Question and Answer</CENTER></H2><H2><BR>What conditions are treated with the Candela Sclerolaser?</H2><H3><BR>The Sclerolaser treats telangiectasia or spider veins (less than 1 millimeter)commonly seen on the legs. The precise origin of the disorder is unknownbut reports have shown that pregnancy, hormonal changes, weight gain, leginjury or prolonged standing may influence the occurrence.</H3><H2>Why should I have my leg veins treated?</H2><H3><BR>The majority of patients seeking treatment for removal of leg veins arefor cosmetic reasons. Most are uncomfortable with the appearance of theseveins during the warmer months when shorts/skirts are worn.</H3><H2>How does the Sclerolaser work and why is it a safe treatment?</H2><H3><BR>The Sclerolaser produces an intense but gentle burst of laser light thatpasses harmlessly through the skin and is selectively absorbed by the vessel.The light produced by the laser generates heat within the vessel, destroyingit without causing thermal injury to any of the surrounding tissue.</H3><H2><BR>Are there other methods used to treat leg veins?</H2><H3>The most common therapy used to treat leg veins is sclerotherapy. Sclerotherapyinvolves needle injections of sclerosing agents; such as saline, into thevessels to be removed. </H3><H2><CENTER>1-800-535-SKIN(7546)</CENTER></H2><H4><CENTER><I>Mastercard, Visa, American Express and Discover Accepted<BR>Talk to us at laser@pinkweb.com/</I><A HREF="mailto:comments@pinkweb.com">&copy;1996kp media group<BR><BR></A>Back to <A HREF="Laser.Dermotology.html">Skin/ Laser Home Page<BR></A><BR>Go to<A HREF="../index.html"> </A><A HREF="index.html">Pink Web Home Page</A></CENTER></H4><H3><BR><HR>&copy;1996 Skin Management Systems, Inc.</H3></BODY></HTML>

The Winter offers the majesty of The White Mountains,for those who like to ski. However, for those who enjoy escaping winterswrath next to a warm fire, you will find an abundance of rustic inns, b&amp; bs and other hideaways. The Spring and Summer offer crystal lakes,scenic views and enough nature trails and challenging terrain to satisfythe most finicky of nature lovers. The foliage offered in the fall willtake your breath away and make you realize the power and beauty of MotherNature.

However, for all those who enjoy citylife, Providence is the city. It is small enough to navigate without a car.It also offers some of the best gay nightclubs in New England, most of whichare close enough to bar hop within a night. In addition, Providence hassome of the best dining in the area. The city attracts people from Bostonand Hartford areas because it is only a short drive away.<BR><BR><B><A HREF="ri.listings.html#anchor688274">STATE WIDE</A> </B><UL>  <LI><A HREF="ri.listings.html#anchor691130"><B>Accommodation </B></A>  <LI><B><A HREF="ri.listings.html#anchor691277">AIDS/HIV 1</A> </B>  <LI><B><A HREF="ri.listings.html#anchor692239">Auto Dealer/Service </A></B>  <LI><B><A HREF="ri.listings.html#anchor692392">Business Group </A></B>  <LI><B><A HREF="ri.listings.html#anchor692571">Baths </A></B>  <LI><B><A HREF="ri.listings.html#anchor102310">Bath Supplies</A> </B>  <LI><B><A HREF="ri.listings.html#anchor763624">Computer Bull.

Itis often the destination for a peaceful weekend get away at one of the manyquaint bed and breakfasts. It offers all the charm and robust natural scenerythat comes to mind when thinking of New England.

Same gendercommitment ceremonies are not legally recognized anywhere in the country.Such ceremonies do not automatically give you spousal health insurance benefitsor inheritance rights or the right to make medical decisions in the eventthat your spouse is incapacitated. Well, as most newly 'committed' lesbiansand gay men will tell you, the joys that come along with affirming and celebratinglove in front of many friends and family are not limited to heterosexuals.Many claim that the ceremony has great emotional, social, and spiritualmeanings.<BR><BR>When it comes to commitment, no one knows more about nesting than lesbians.And this is reflected in the number of calls received by Private Affairs,a gay-owned service that arranges commitment ceremonies. Over 70 percentof inquiries are from lesbian couples.<BR><BR>Regardless of gender, planning your ceremony can be a joyful yet complicatedundertaking. Jewelers, printers, photographers, caterers, clergy and floristsneed to be contacted, catering halls need to be booked, and tuxedos or gownsneed to be purchased. <BR><BR>According to Joe and his 'husband' Patrick, the only real problem is schedulingchurch time since these ceremonies have become so popular. Currently, fifteenclergy and Justices of the Peace are willing to perform commitment ceremoniesin the Boston area. If a couple chooses to have their ceremony performedby clergy, pre-nuptial couples counseling is required. Sessions are usuallylimited to 2 or 3 two-hour meetings prior to the service. On the other hand,a Justice of the Peace usually does not require counseling. Currently, Justicesdo not perform legal ceremonies but tend to have their own special romanticceremonies for same gender couples. These are nondenominational and suitmany non-traditional couples.<BR><BR>The big question is: Will it be legal? Two lesbians, Genora Dancel and NiniaBaehr, are challenging the issue in Hawaii. In 1991, three Hawaiian couples,two lesbian and one gay, sued when the state refused to issue marriage licensesto them. In the spring of 1993, the Hawaii Supreme Court recognized thatthis denial amounted to discrimination on the basis of sex. The court evencompared this &quot;different gender restriction&quot; on marital choiceto old laws prohibiting interracial marriage which were eventually struckdown as being racially discriminatory. Since Hawaii has an equal rightsamendment which makes sex discrimination unconstitutional, the court concludedthat denying same gender couples marriage licenses might be unconstitutional.<BR><BR>The Hawaii Supreme Court sent the case back to trial court with the instructionto review the state's marriage policy under &quot;strict-scrutiny,&quot;meaning that the state must prove that it has a &quot;compelling interest&quot;in maintaining its restriction. Starting from the assumption that equaltreatment, not discrimination, is mandated by the state's constitution,this ruling puts the burden of proof on the state.<BR><BR>In reaction, Hawaii's legislature passed a law in June 1994 affirming itsdiscriminatory intent; the only state interest it named was &quot;propagationof the human race.&quot; Legal experts believe this will not stand as a&quot;compelling reason&quot; and the trial court will rule against thestate. &quot;Hawaii certainly doesn't require heterosexual couples to submitfertility tests or confirm their intentions to have children before issuingthem marriage licenses, and the lesbian baby boom belies the notion thatsame-sex couples don't have kids,&quot; according to Susan Murray and BethRobinson, two Vermont attorneys working with the Boston-based Gay &amp;Lesbian Advocates &amp; Defenders (GLAD) on the same gender marriage issue.<BR><BR>Once the case is thrown back to the Hawaii Supreme Court, the conventionalwisdom is that it will uphold its earlier decision. The freedom for samegender couples to marry, therefore, will become law in Hawaii. The caseis being tried by the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, and a finaldecision is expected by mid-1996 or early 1997.<BR><BR>Until that time, gay and lesbian couples continue to plan for and celebratetheir not yet legally recognized marriages. According to Private Affairs'Pereira, however, three big questions need to be answered before a coupleembarks upon any matrimonial journey - When? Where? and How much? Most samegender couples have a certain date in mind for their wedding. If a coupleis having trouble deciding, Pereira asks if they have a month or time ofyear that is special to them, such as the day the two met. He noted thatwhile most straight weddings occur on Saturdays, most same gender couplesopt for a Friday evening or Sunday afternoon. &quot;Gays and lesbians preferto be a little bit different,&quot; Pereira said.<BR><BR>Most same gender couples prefer to have their ceremonies near where theylive. In Boston, for example, the Arlington Street Church is a favoritebecause of the role it has played in the gay and lesbian community. Severalother chapels, such as King's Chapel, are also happy to accommodate samegender couples. Some couples, however, prefer a more natural setting, andboth Provincetown and Ogunquit, Maine, are popular places for both the ceremonyand the honeymoon. Some P-town guesthouses overlook the bay while othershave lovely gardens and outdoor spaces. Weather permitting, the nationalseashore's dunes make for a magnificent setting for a memorable ceremony.<BR><BR>As far as budgetary concerns, the ceremony's price tag depends upon howmuch the couple is willing and able to spend - and the couple's imagination.One &quot;Victorian wedding&quot; that Pereira handled, including partsof the wedding party arriving in horse drawn carriages, cost $11,000. Themost expensive affair he put together was for 210 people at the CambridgeMarriott costing a whopping $16,000. For his own, Pereira and husband spenta mere $5,000. Unfortunately, the most unique request he has received, fromtwo lesbians who wanted to be married underwater, was called off in theplanning stages and never got a price tag.<BR><BR>For Pereira, getting married is simply &quot;one more step towards a morefulfilling commitment,&quot; regardless of legal recognition. He does predictthough that once same gender marriage becomes legal, &quot;You'll see moreand more gays and lesbians getting married.&quot; For him, this should meana booming business. &quot;I think (same gender marriage) is more acceptednow. It's not a big shock anymore. It does happen. And it is now a partof life.&quot; </B><H2><CENTER>We offer a complete <BR>business service guide to palnning <BR><A HREF="cc.list.index.html">commitment ceremonies</A>!</CENTER></H2><P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rule.1.jpeg" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN="BOTTOM"NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1"><BR><BR>Go to<BR><A HREF="boston.index.html">Metro Boston Navigational Page</A> | <A HREF="pinkpages.navagational.html">PinkPages Navagational Page</A> | <A HREF="index.html">Pink Web Home Page</A><BR><A HREF="pp.order.html">Order a Pink Pages</A> | <A HREF="referral.suggestion.html">Referrals- Corrections - Suggestions<BR></A><BR><IMG SRC="rule.3.jpeg" WIDTH="432" HEIGHT="9" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="1"><BR></CENTER><P>To contact us by E-Mail<BR><A HREF="mailto:comments@pinkweb.com">&copy;1996 kp media group </A><BR></BODY></HTML>
