<P><HR><B>As Gov. Tom Ridge Approaches the Midpoint of His <BR>
Four-Year Term,Ridge's Commerce Secretary - Erie Native Thomas B. Hagen
- Reflects <BR>
on the Ridge Administration's Efforts to Improve Pennsylvania's Business
Climate<BR>
<BR>
An ER Extra<BR>
</B><HR><BR>
Al Monzo's Palace Inn in Monroeville seems like an unlikely place to keep
an appointment with Pennsylvania's Secretary of Commerce. But Tom Hagen,
in Pittsburgh to meet with a group promoting tourism, just wanted to find
a place to sit down and get to work.<BR>
 <BR>
In 1994, capitalizing on economic stagnation, low job growth and dismal
export activity, Gov. Tom Ridge wooed the business community. Long dissatisfied
with many elements of doing business in Pennsylvania, business supported
Ridge in his bid for the capitol. <BR>
<BR>
Once there, he appointed Thomas B. Hagen secretary of commerce to spearhead
this all-important area. Hagen, long Ridge's friend and political supporter,
also calls Erie home. Former chairman and CEO of Erie Insurance Group, Hagen
knows about doing business in Pennsylvania - he's been doing it for 40 years.
<BR>
<BR>
In this career incarnation, Hagen flies here and there, home and abroad,
promoting Pennsylvania's positives and strategizing against its negatives.
Lydia Strohl talked to Hagen about his strategy for economic growth.<BR>
<BR>
Executive Report: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Pennsylvania
business climate?<BR>
Thomas Hagen: First of all, our workforce. The workforce in Pennsyl-vania
has great work ethic and high productivity. Our costs might be a little
high in comparison to some states, but the productivity more than makes
up for it. We also have a great strength in the quality of life in this
state.<BR>
<BR>
Our weaknesses from the business point of view have been two-fold. One is
the cost of doing business, through taxation and related costs like workers'
compensation. And the other has been attitude of state government. Namely,
the attitude and regulation in the old Department of Environmental Re-sources,
which was really extremely negative to creating a good business climate.
I think we've made some strides starting to turn that around.<BR>
 <BR>
ER: Statistics rank Pennsylvania quite low in a lot of business-related
growth areas, like new business formation, export potential, etc. Do you
think these figures are justified?<BR>
<BR>
TH: I think the figures are justified and they should be considered. But
we shouldn't make judgements totally on those figures without knowing some
things about the whole picture. <BR>
 For example, new business formation. We are not in a high-tech    area,
although we have a growing population of high-tech companies, particularly
here in the southwest and in the southeast. But it's not like California,
which has a lot of high-tech companies spinning off constantly. We're going
to be at a disadvantage comparing new business startups to a climate like
that.<BR>
While, yes, we've got weaknesses, we should be doing a better job of promoting
our strengths. Because if we're going to promote our weaknesses, then others
will pick up on that.  There's one [relocation consultant] I can think of
who doesn't even bother to mention Pennsylvania to his clients because he's
been so turned off by the attitude of Pennsylvania state government.<BR>
<BR>
ER: Are there any areas of business that you really think can drive growth
for the state?<BR>
<BR>
TH: We have a very diverse state, so it really depends on what part of the
state you're talking about. Here in the southwest we've had a lot of bio-tech
firms. We have the same in the southeast, particularly in the pharmaceutical
area. In the northwest we have the plastics capital, the powdered metals
industry in the north central part of the state. I'm not necessarily going
to promote one over the other. <BR>
<BR>
We're just taking a step in our current budget by eliminating the sales
tax on computer service companies, companies that do data processing. That
tax, put on several years ago, is really counterproductive if you want to
have that kind of operation grow in your state.<BR>
<BR>
ER: Does this diversity make your job easier or more difficult?<BR>
<BR>
TH: It makes it more interesting. Yesterday I was working on some things
involving the Philadelphia naval shipyard, and today I'm here working on
tourism. And a few days ago I was talking with the secretary of agriculture
about some things we're working on together - agriculture is our No. 1 industry.<BR>
 <BR>
ER: What's your strategy to capitalize on the strengths of our business
climate?<BR>
<BR>
TH: First of all, we have to do some things to make the business community
aware that we mean business about pumping that business climate. Last year
we started out by proposing a $286 million business tax reduction, the third-largest
business tax reduction in the United States in the last 10 years. We followed
up on that this year with another $60 million in business tax reduction.
In two years that's roughly $350 million - we're putting our action where
our mouths are. <BR>
<BR>
Now what I would hope for is that the leaders in the business community
and others in business would tell their friends - in trade meetings, on
the golf course or wherever - that Pennsylvania has a whole new attitude.<BR>
<BR>
To help us in that regard, the state appointed two new advertising agencies.
One, for travel and tourism promotion, is Poppe Tyson WCP, and that's here
in Pittsburgh. And on the economic development side, Ketchum. These are
two outstanding firms, creative firms, that we believe will be very helpful
to us in getting the word out to the world that Pennsylvania is a good place
to vacation in, Pennsylvania is a good place to work in, Pennsylvania is
a good place to do business in.<BR>
<BR>
ER: Do you think that Commerce got what it needs in the new budget to do
all this work?<BR>
<BR>
TH: The new budget is an extremely tight budget. It's the first time in
a quarter-century that a governor has proposed a budget less than the year
before. It's about $30 million less than the budget last year overall.<BR>
<BR>
In Commerce, our programs are at the same level as last year. We were still
able to rearrange so that we have some good new initiatives, but when it
comes to the total at the bottom of the sheet, we're equal with last year.
<BR>
<BR>
The reason for this very tight budget is a slow economy forecast over next
year and the prospect of about $600 million less in federal aid.<BR>
<BR>
ER: It's early, but are there any results from this new business climate
you say exists in the state?<BR>
<BR>
TH: It takes a little while for the word to filter out that Pennsylvania
is getting more competitive and wants to have new businesses here. I know
of one in my home county, Erie County, that came from Jamestown, N.Y., Bush
Industries. They said very candidly that if it were not for the attitude
of the Ridge administration toward creating a good business climate that
they would not have located that plant. It's eventually going to be 1,000
jobs. Using Pennsylvania wood products, the furniture that's going to be
made in this new state-of-the-art plant is mostly for the export market,
mostly cabinets and tables for computer equipment.<BR>
<BR>
ER: Obviously it's hard to concentrate on all the elements - geographically,
by industry - how will you prioritize?<BR>
<BR>
TH: It's not too hard to prioritize.  The business climate is created through
a reasonable and competitive tax structure, workers' comp structure, regulatory
structure. We've already started to work on that. <BR>
<BR>
At the same time, we've been working on strengthening our international
development. We have four offices now, in Brussels, Frankfurt, Toronto and
Tokyo, staffed by independent contractors, natives, they know the culture.
But we're looking at East Asia, South America, and increasing our presence
in Central and Eastern Europe.  Our goal is to increase export trade by
40 percent over the four years of this term, which will equate to about
100,000 new jobs. And we believe we're right on track with the increase
that we're seeing in trade.<BR>
<BR>
A tangential area is quality education. We need to have that if we're going
to compete in the world economy. The governor feels very strongly about
his voucher plan for education.<BR>
The other thing we are trying to do is have better coordination in government.
We came in and found that the information systems were not only archaic,
but chaotic. The Department of Administration has been undergoing an exhaustive
study of our information technology and how we can better utilize the technology
of today. We've been engaging in a conscious effort to help departments
and agencies to work together for a common goal. I was just here for a regional
meeting regarding tourism, we've had several throughout the state. It's
not just the Commerce Department, other elements of state government are
involved: the Pennsylvania Historic and Museum Commission, the Department
of Transportation with their welcome centers, the Turnpike Commission with
their rest stops along the turnpike, the Department of Conservation and
Natural Resources - all these agencies need to be involved so that we have
a total effort toward promoting. <BR>
<BR>
ER: How do you keep it lean when you're getting all these entities involved?<BR>
<BR>
TH: It's lean because we're keeping down our employment growth. Actually,
if you have better coordination, maybe you can do it with less people and
fewer costs in the long run and have a better result.<BR>
<BR>
ER: That's your business background talking  there. How hard will it be
to work smart in a governmental structure?<BR>
<BR>
TH: It comes in really handy. Quite frankly, this administration has been
able to attract really first-rate people. Our new director of the Office
of International Trade is a lawyer that has negotiated international contracts,
has spent 30 years in international business with several companies, the
last 12 years of his career as president of Hershey International. He has
lived all over the world, Japan, Berlin, Paris, speaks five languages -
to be able to attract someone with that kind of talent to government is
unusual.<BR>
<BR>
I won't say he's typical, but we've been able to attract people with equal
credentials in their respective areas. <BR>
<BR>
ER: How were you personally chosen for the position to which you were appointed?<BR>
<BR>
TH: I've been friends with Governor Ridge a long time, going back to the
days when he was a young practicing attorney in Erie. I was involved in
every one of his congressional races and was very active in his campaign.<BR>
<BR>
I also was at a point where after 40 years of business I was looking for
a last assignment, you might say. So when he asked me, this was a challenge
I was eager to take on.<BR>
<BR>
I think I can bring experience in the business world, a knowledge of the
political system, because I've been involved in one form or another of it
for a long time. Particularly, I'm aware of the international aspects of
things, because I have had that experience. <BR>
<BR>
ER: We've seen a reduction in the corporate net income tax - will there
be another?<BR>
<BR>
TH: We only have so much available to us - I mentioned the job creation
tax credit and the elimination of the so-called computer tax [in the current
budget]. And we felt we had to have some reduction in the capital stock
franchise tax, which is an archaic tax that this state has and has depended
on, one that I'd eventually like to eliminate all together. It's a question
of what's available and what the priorities are. We certainly hope to reduce
the CNI some more. It would be nice to get it to 8.5 percent if we can do
it, it's now 9.99 percent.<BR>
<BR>
ER: What's your reaction to allegations that the restructuring of the DER
and loosening of certain environmental regulations has actually been detrimental
to the health of the general public?<BR>
<BR>
TH: Secretary Seif would be better suited to answer this question but I'll
say this: It's a balancing act. <BR>
What we are trying to get away from are the punitive aspects of the previous
regulatory environment. We want to have strict regulatory standards and
if people violate those standards then they should be punished. But we don't
want to go out and, where people have an environmental problem, and admit
they have an environmental problem, hit them over the head with regulations
and fines and jail terms and those sorts of things. It's much better to
work with people that have environmental problems and help them solve them.
<BR>
<BR>
ER: What governmental priority is attending to the needs of small and mid-sized
businesses? <BR>
<BR>
TH: It's an extremely high priority. In fact, we have totally reorganized
our small business operation in our department, that had become pretty ineffective.
We have now an office of Entrepreneurial Assistance, that will be more proactive
with small businesses, with minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses.<BR>
<BR>
As you know, we're working out the merger between the Department of Commerce
and the Department of Community Affairs. We think it will have a positive
impact.<BR>
<BR>
ER: How does Pennsylvania rank right now?<BR>
<BR>
TH: Pennsylvania is the fifth largest state, but ranks 11th in export trade.
So we think we can do a lot better. But it will take time to get that ranking
down closer to our population, because as we grow, other states are growing.
So we've got to grow at a greater rate to overtake them. <BR>
But it isn't as competitive overseas as it is domestically for location
of new plants or businesses. It is quite cut  throat right now, with all
of the states around us attracting businesses or retaining businesses in
the state. New Jersey, quite frankly, is out to eat our lunch. <BR>

<P><HR><B>A Majority of American Employers Aren't Covered by the Family
and Medical Leave Act; Some of These Smaller Employers Try to Mirror the
FMLA, While Others Can't Afford To</B><BR>
<HR>When Doris Dyen needed to have surgery last summer, her coworkers at
the Steel Industry Heritage Corp. picked up the slack. Dyen's position as
director of cultural conservation requires her to handle cultural planning
and programs and supply documents and archiving work. She had completed
most of her major work before the absence, but the small staff of four full-time
employees and three part-time staffers had to keep Dyen's projects going
during her recovery. <BR>
<BR>
The trick was to plan carefully for Dyen's six-week absence.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's never a good time [to take an extended leave],&quot; says
Dyen. &quot;But if you know beforehand, you can plan it around big events.
As it happened, our major project wasn't completely finished, but there
was substantial work done. It wasn't a crisis.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Mainly, because Dyen and her employer worked together. For some smaller
employers, the situation might have turned into a crisis. Unlike larger
employers that are now bound by the relatively new Family and Medical Leave
Act, companies with less than 50 employees are not bound by FMLA and must
develop leave policies that serve the needs of both the company and the
employee. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, 95 percent
of U.S. employers employ less than 50 people and are not bound by FMLA.<BR>
<BR>
So how do these employers handle leave requests? Oftentimes, smaller employers
don't develop a policy until a situation - such as the one Dyen was in -
presents itself.<BR>
<BR>
In Dyen's case, the smooth extended leave could be credited to good cooperation
between employer and employees, and to the fact that she's not easily replaceable.
But had she needed more time, there's no legal mandate that Dyen's job be
waiting for her when she was ready to return. <BR>
<BR>
The only employers required to preserve a job for someone like Dyen are
those that employ 50 or more employees, according to FMLA final regulations
promulgated by the U.S. Department of Labor a little over one year ago.
Covered employees must have been with the company for a year or have worked
1,250 hours in the previous 12 months. Covered employees can request leave
for birth or adoption of a child, or treatment of a serious health condition
or the serious health condition of an immediate family member. FMLA allows
an employee to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for qualifying circumstances.
(See sidebar for the mechanics of FMLA.)<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Smaller Companies</B><BR>
<BR>
At the Steel Industry Heritage Corp., the formal, written leave policy gives
a certain amount of vacation time, sick days and personal days, which can
accrue and can be used for emergencies. Dyen used her three weeks of vacation
and most of her accrued sick days to cover her six-week absence without
having to take any unpaid leave. She was able to return when the time came.
 <BR>
Augie Carlino, executive director of the Steel Industry Heritage Corp.,
says his group's policy regarding paid leave, i.e., vacation, sick and personal
days, is set by the board of directors and depends on the employee's position.
If Dyen had required more time, says Carlino, the two of them would have
negotiated it. But that's an issue the group is presently reviewing. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;At the present time, we look at each situation on an independent basis,&quot;
says Carlino. &quot;We'd probably have continued to pay her even if she
had to be gone longer, but it would have to be reviewed by the board. We're
now looking at our total benefits package because we realize we need to
be more competitive in order to attract quality employees. We'd like to
enact some kind of short-term disability policy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Like Steel Industry, Print Tech, a printing business that employs slightly
more than 30 employees in its four locations, also does not fall under the
FMLA. Print Tech employees are required to use their vacation and sick days
when faced with extended leave. Unlike Steel Heritage, however, Print Tech
does have a formal policy to deal with extended leave. President Bob Weingard
says Print Tech's policy allows employees to apply for a 30-day unpaid leave.
If more time is needed, employees need to reapply. However, he says, there
is no guarantee that the employee will come back to the same position, although
it's never happened so far.<BR>
<BR>
In developing this policy, Weingard looked to both human resource consultants
and legal experts. In effect for five years, he says &quot;there have been
no real problems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A 1994 survey of 300 small companies by the Kessler Exchange, a research
company in Northridge, Calif., showed that 60 percent of the companies with
fewer than 50 employes had leave policies in place. <BR>
<BR>
Those policies, however, in most cases do not mirror the FMLA guidelines,
says John Kirkwood, president of Kirkwood Consulting Associates, a human
resources consulting firm. Additionally, there are no other laws covering
an extended sick leave that give direction to smaller companies. Situations
like pregnancy, age and sex discrimination, and sexual harassment while
on the job are covered by other laws, but nothing mirrors some of the situations
covered by FMLA.<BR>
<BR>
Small companies, Kirkwood says, are aware of FMLA, but must respond to the
circumstances of their own businesses. &quot;Certainly, employees are better
off with the protection of family leave, but many smaller companies simply
can't afford to let their employees leave for extended periods of time,&quot;
he says.<BR>
<BR>
The resulting policies that are not as generous as FMLA are not based on
any mean-spiritedness, but rather are &quot;solely a function of what [the
employer] can afford to do.&quot; If forced to comply, small companies would
be faced with either having to find some way to temporarily replace an employee,
or find another way to get the job done, such as asking the remaining employees
to work overtime.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There'd be a loss of productivity, especially in smaller companies
where each employee is valuable,&quot; Kirkwood says. &quot;It's tough to
bring in a temporary employee and ask him or her to be      up to speed.
A larger company is in a better position because there are    more people
who can take over an absent employee's duties or move up temporarily.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A study recently released by the Department of Labor stated that 85 percent
of employers surveyed indi-cated that the law had no noticeable effect on
productivity; 93 percent reported no change in profitability.  But  larger
companies bound by FMLA cite common complaints, among them:
<UL>
  <LI>	The burden of recruiting, selecting, placing and training temporary
workers to fill clerical and labor vacancies at a much lower rate of efficiency.
  <LI>	The fact that managerial employees can't be replaced by temporary
workers. 
  <LI>	Without citing statistics that support their position, employers
argue that temporary workers have more accidents, adding to workers' compensation
costs.
</UL>
<BR>
Print Tech's Weingard doubts that his company could comply with FMLA.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It would be a big problem,&quot; he admits. &quot;With four locations,
we have a minimum of staff at each, so even if one person calls in sick
for one day, it's a problem - we've lost 25 percent of our workers for that
day. If we're understaffed, we lose customers. We need everyone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Weingard says that even a six-week absence would be difficult. &quot;We
can't use temporary placement agencies, because we have all skilled workers.
We can't hire a trained person for six weeks, and then ask them to leave.
We'd have to hire someone permanently and when our original worker came
back, hope we had work for him or fire the replacement.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, more regulation may be on the way, especially if Democrats
are able to regain control of Congress. Some fear currently mandated unpaid
leave may eventually turn into paid leave. Others expect smaller businesses
eventually will be bound by FMLA.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many companies are writing polices that come into compliance with
the act in anticipation that they'll be required to do so in the future,&quot;
says Ronald Andrykovitch, an employment law attorney with Cohen &amp; Grigsby
in Pittsburgh. &quot;They think it's fair.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kirkwood, however, doubts that the majority of small companies could meet
FMLA, because of business necessities. Statistics support his theory.<BR>
<BR>
A study conducted by the      Small Business Administration in 1990 titled
Leave Policies in           Small Business, estimated the cost     of six
weeks of unpaid maternity     and infant care leave to be $612 million,
nationally, a year. The        amount for 12 weeks of leave, as  mandated
by he FMLA, would           be double.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;An employer can't always       find someone to fill in if a worker
      is gone for an extended period            of time,&quot; Kirkwood
says. &quot;They    might be required to if the employee is part of a union,
or if there's an employment contract, but if not,  they can only do so much.
Employers must be responsible to both    employee needs and the needs of
the business.&quot;<BR>
But for Steel Heritage's Carlino, meeting employees' needs makes      for
good business, be it granting extended leave for medical reasons,  or letting
employees work less         one day if they worked more the      day before.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because we have so many late-night meetings and travel time that we
don't track, we have an unwritten policy that allows us to be flexible when
employees need extra time off. When you ask people to put in extra time,
you're taking away their private time with their families, and they should
be compensated for that.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You need to treat people with respect and dignity. You can't make
your employees feel that they're expendable commodities. If you treat them
like that, there's no incentive for them to go the extra mile.&quot;   
               <BR>
<H3>An Employer's Guide to  Family and Medical Leave Act</H3>
<BR>
The Family and Medical Leave Act was signed into law in 1993, and the final
regulations were released by the U.S. Department of Labor about one year
ago. It covers employers who hire at least 50 workers. Employees must have
worked for that company for at least 12 months, but not necessarily consecutively,
or at least for 1,250 hours during the last year. Employees may not be covered
if they work at a site with less than 50 employees within 75 miles. Further,
part-time employees are usually covered if they work approximately 20 hours
per week.<BR>
<BR>
Employees can take up to 12 weeks for several reasons: to care for a newborn
or adopted child; if the employee is suffering from a serious health condition
(mental or physical), or if an immediate family member (spouse, child or
parent) is suffering from such a serious health condition.<BR>
Under &quot;serious health condition&quot; are afflictions that could come
as a surprise to employers. For example, morning sickness, asthma and migraines
are all covered under FMLA. Abuses are more prevalent when employees take
intermittent leave for these kind of chronic illnesses (with the exception
of morning sickness, which does ultimately end). This happens, according
to attorney Ronald Andrykovitch of Pittsburgh's Cohen &amp; Grigsby, because
the law's definition of serious medical illness is very broad. Employees
don't need to be hospital inpatients. Rather, leave can be for chronic conditions
like those mentioned above. Additionally, an employee needs to provide only
the initial medical certification for chronic illnesses. He or she does
not have to provide certification every time a condition flares up, although
updates can be required. Because of this, says Andrykovitch, abuses are
difficult to police.<BR>
<BR>
If the 12 weeks are used and the condition still exists, as is often the
case in recurring illnesses, then employers may be required to provide more
leave under other laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Alternately,
if the employee's situation is not covered under another law, or under a
union contract or company employment policy, the employer's legal obligation
could end.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many employers think that the 12 weeks are a ceiling. It's not. It's
more of a floor,&quot; Andrykovitch says. &quot;Once the 12 weeks are up,
more time might be required. It's very complicated and unclear.&quot;<BR>
In fact, Andrykovitch says family leave is usually taken because of serious
illness - not the maternity leave that so many people associate with the
law. Rarely will a situation be limited solely to FMLA. Instead, there usually
is interaction with ADA, workers' compensation laws or unemployment laws.
Human resource professionals need to have an integrated approach to leave
policies because of this, he says.<BR>
<BR>
Generally, an employee's job is protected during this 12-week leave. The
exception, says Andrykovitch, is for highly compensated employees. <BR>
<BR>
According to Andrykovitch, paid leave such as vacation or sick days can't
be added on to FMLA leave, which is unpaid. Employees take either their
accrued paid leave or unpaid leave under FMLA.<BR>
The trick for employers, says Andrykovitch, is designating such leave as
FMLA. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This law has a strange twist in that employees need not request that
their leave be designated as family leave. Lawmakers did not place the responsibilities
of knowing the act's intricacies on the employees, but rather on the employers.
As long as [the employees] give notice to the employer and it's for a FMLA-protected
reason, an employer can't terminate them.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Employers need to be aware that it's up to them to designate leave
as FMLA leave - including giving the employee notice -  so the employee's
'bank' of leave is used. Employers must be proactive when it comes to family
leave.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It's especially important to label FMLA leave as such if there's an attendance
problem, he says. FMLA is sometimes used as a defense by employees who feel
they were wrongly fired for discipline problems.

<B><FONT size=+2>Managed Care </FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Patient Care Must Remain<BR>
the Industry's Top Priority</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</I></B> </CENTER>
<P><HR>The story goes something like this: Johnny wipes out on his bicycle.
He's stained in blood from head to toe. As Dad's rushing him to the emergency
room, Mom's punching buttons on the cellular phone, calling the HMO to obtain
the required approval for an emergency room visit.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Is he unconscious?&quot; the voice on the other end of the telephone
asks.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No, but he's very bloody,&quot; retorts worried Mom.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Well, why don't you just bring him into the office tomorrow.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That's the wrong answer, at least from Mom's perspective.<BR>
<BR>
But like it or not, managed care and its cost-containment strategies are
upon us. At midyear, about three-quarters of the Pittsburgh area's commercially
insured population was enrolled in managed care, according to a study by
Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm, and the Pittsburgh Business Group
on Health, a group of 33 employers in the region.<BR>
<BR>
In Pittsburgh, not suprisingly, the most popular forms of managed care are
those affording consumers most leeway in their healthcare. Just how long
employers can continue to offer these products, which are more costly than
more restrictive ones, remains to be seen. We've been lucky so far: the
region's dominant health insurer, Blue Cross, has exercised the decision-making
power it retains in managed care responsibly, as have the smaller players.
<BR>
<BR>
Elsewhere, it's been a different story. Just ask Joyce Cerep of Scranton.
Her husband died on the bathroom floor of their home while a doctor serving
as an HMO gatekeeper refused to give permission to call an ambulance. The
Geisinger Health Plan and the Scranton doctor are the defendants in - you
guessed it - her lawsuit.<BR>
<BR>
About a year before his death, Jim Cerep suffered a seizure and was involved
in a minor car accident. An ambulance took him to Community Medical Center
in Scranton for tests. Because the hospital was not a Geisinger facility,
the HMO refused to pay nearly $2,800 in medical bills, according to the
lawsuit.<BR>
 <BR>
The Cerep's family physician - assigned to the Cereps by Geisinger - warned
the family to contact him in the event of any future seizures before seeking
medical care. <BR>
  <BR>
In May 1994, Joyce Cerep heard her husband collapse in the bathroom. She
called the primary care physician, who told her that the situation was not
an emergency. She called back three minutes later and pleaded for permission
to call an ambulance.<BR>
<BR>
The woman called again 14 minutes later, when she could no longer hear her
husband breathing. The doctor was unavailable, so Joyce Cerep finally called
the ambulance.<BR>
<BR>
Paramedics found her 33-year-old husband dead. He had suffocated. <BR>
   <BR>
Don't get me wrong. This column isn't a knock on managed care. This column
is about priorities. By early August, four of the country's largest HMOs
predicted disappointing second-quarter earnings, accelerating a deep plunge
in HMO stocks to levels not seen in almost a year. The situation could hurt
patients if HMOs cut expenses too deeply - just to restore their bottom
lines to please Wall Street.<BR>
    <BR>
I don't want a doctor or a hospital whose bottom-line concern is the bottom
line. I want a physician whose bottom-line concern is the patient's health.<BR>
<BR>
Managed care decision-makers must not lose sight of their primary goal:
providing the best healthcare possible for the patients who need it. That's
priority No. 1.<BR>
When healthcare decisions come down to dollars and cents, patients are in
trouble.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Leaving Chautauqua</FONT SIZE> <FONT size=+1> </B>The Western
New York Educational Institution<BR>
Keeps its Incredible Wealth Within its Gates<B></FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher <BR clear=all></I></B><HR>The end
of the last century saw a period of social unrest not unlike that which
we see today. Turbulence, engendered by the Civil War and marked by a deep
chasm between North and South and black and white, gorged the nation's psyche.
Concurrently, the shift from an agrarian to an industrial economy made even
our bread and butter uncertain.<BR>
<BR>
Out of this turmoil, a peaceful place, reserved exclusively for quiet reflection
and dedicated to the dissemination of knowledge, emerged on the serene banks
of Lake Chautauqua, New York. Initially founded in 1874 as a summer school
for Sunday school teachers, its educational mission expanded rapidly. Today,
Chautauqua attracts over 15,000 individuals seeking knowledge to conquer
the challenges confronting mankind, in an environment providing refuge from
the harshness of the world.<BR>
<BR>
An easy three-hour drive from downtown Pittsburgh, Chautauqua is a citadel
of culture, education and religion. From the moment one enters the  gates,
which limit access to the 1 1/2- square-mile grounds, one senses this place
is markedly different. People genuinely respect each other here. Aside from
the somewhat onerous gate fees, the price of entry is the willingness to
shelve behavior patterns mandated by today's uncivil society. In their place,
Chautauquans adopt a behavior code founded in politeness.<BR>
<BR>
In some ways, Chautauqua is a microcosm of Pittsburgh. The over-65 crowd
clearly dominates. Cultural activities are the foundation upon which the
community is built. And Chautauqua, like Pittsburgh, holds a vise-like grip
on its past. <BR>
  <BR>
Pittsburgh could learn from Chautauqua. As we move from an industrial to
an information-based economy, the Chautauqua concept is especially valuable.
<BR>
<BR>
But the distinguished lecturers who feed Chautauquans a steady diet of provocative
insights into the world's most enigmatic dilemmas go largely untapped, their
ideas evaporating when the next lecture begins. In 1881, Chautauqua spawned
the nation's first correspondence program, spreading education to the common
man, even beyond its geographic boundaries. Now the birthplace of distance
learning needs to extend itself once again. Pittsburghers who flock to Chau-tauqua
in droves fail to harness the energy and seize its powerful ideas. Chautauqua
itself needs to examine the reality of the world in which we live, and let
its lofty ideals out of its gates. Chautauqua should be a departure point,
not a destination. Ideas should not go there to die.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Repeat Offenders</FONT SIZE></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Employers Beset by Repeated Workplace Accidents <BR>
Should Take a Long Look at</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1> Themselves</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Bill D. Hager</I></B><HR></CENTER>
<P>While there are no formal statistics on accident repeaters in the workplace,
many companies report that a small percentage of employees account for a
large percentage of lost-time injuries.<BR>
<BR>
One safety director believes that 30 percent of accidents at his company
are caused by 3 percent of the workers. For many organizations, dismissing
repeaters runs them afoul of union contracts, provisions of the Americans
With Disabilities Act or leaves them ripe for an expensive wrongful termination
or discrimination lawsuit.<BR>
<BR>
What then to do? First, we need to confront a misconception. Both studies
and experience show that accident repeaters are much more than disturbed
employees and, in fact, are not always the same people. Rather, while some
workers have a chain of accidents for a period of time, they seem to end
the pattern, only to be replaced by yet new repeaters.<BR>
<BR>
True, there are some employees who take advantage of the workers' compensation
system, looking for a way out. But on closer examination, some companies
have been surprised to find that these escapists are only a small percentage
of the repeater problem. The bulk of repeaters, it turns out, don't want
to get hurt, feel embarrassed by their injury history and would like nothing
better than to regain control.<BR>
<BR>
If we correctly assume that attitude affects safety, it is critical not
to label people as &quot;accident repeaters.&quot; This term coldly implies
that all fault lies with the worker.<BR>
To break the habit of accident repeaters, we first need to distinguish between
four sources of accident      repetition:
<UL>
  <LI>Exposure: Acknowledge that some people work at tasks that have relatively
high risks. This includes anyone who does heavy manual materials handling,
drives a truck or works outdoors in extreme environments.
  <LI>Cumulative: Realize that some employees experience wear-down from
cumulative trauma. Often physical job stresses lead to progressive illnesses,
each of which may be reported as separate incidents. But they may really
have one problem that never healed.
  <LI>Reinjury: Recognize that after an injury, sometimes a weak spot is
created, leading to future problems in that same area.
  <LI>Referred injury: Know that injury in one part of the body can lead
to problems in another area. For example, a foot problem can affect how
people walk, which in turn can lead to potential knee pain.
</UL>
<BR>
These sources can affect even previously strong workers. They may      
 be too proud or think of themselves     as too tough to report minor pains,
until these build into major, ongoing problems. <BR>
While it's easy to fault people for their own injuries, in every example
mentioned here, unrealistic management expectations or poor safety communication
may be hidden contributing factors in accident repetition.<BR>
<BR>
The bottom line is that &quot;frequent flyers&quot; - as one manufacturer
labels repeaters - can be reset onto the safety track. But companies need
to act strategically to help break the chain of multiple incidents.<BR>
First, they need to determine which contributing factors propelled the accident
series. Interview those who have had repeat incidents             and solicit
their expertise. Talk to supervisors, managers and line workers, and seek
their opinions on causes and solutions.<BR>
<BR>
Next, a strong safety training program is most likely to help end a chain
of repeat accidents. What should this training include? For starters, practical
methods of attitude control, balanced body mechanics and stress management,
as well as a strategic understanding of the multiple contributing factors
in accidents.<BR>
<BR>
Then develop positive accident investigations that are prevention - not
blame-oriented. Supervisors can be trained to see early warning signs and
to better listen to safety concerns.<BR>
<BR>
And keep it alive. Safety intervention has to be more than a one-time  event.
                                                   <BR>

<H4>A Bright Idea</H4>
Look up. How's the lighting situation in your office? Odds are you've never
considered how much it costs to bathe your desk in orangey-pink fluorescent
glow, let alone whether it could be done better or cheaper. How would you
like the federal or state government to step in and tell you how to improve
your efficiency - or else?<BR>
<BR>
Commercial (and residential) lighting systems have grown vastly more efficient
and affordable over the last couple of years, so much so that proponents
say businesses upgrading antiquated systems can save 30 percent and up on
their overall energy bills. New bulbs and electronic ballasts are cooler
as well as more energy-efficient, creating savings on air-conditioning bills
in the bargain.<BR>
<BR>
Naturally, lighting manufacturers and distributors are high on the new products.
Large corporations can spend tens of thousands of dollars installing systems
which, they say, will pay for themselves inside of three years and provide
savings eternally after. <BR>
<BR>
But there's shedding light on an idea, and there's overexposing it. One
lighting company, Northern Light &amp; Supply Co., went so far as to pose
this question: Should either Pennsylvania's Public Utility Commission or
the state legislature mandate installation of highly energy-efficient systems?<BR>
<BR>
The EPA has already addressed the issue with its five-year-old Green Lights
program (mentioned in last month's story on Green Design). The goal is to
get businesses to voluntarily pledge to revamp their lighting systems while
providing technical information <BR>
and contacts. It's gotten results.<BR>
<BR>
Nationally, the EPA estimates a savings on electric bills of $200 million
for participating businesses, with an average internal rate of return of
30 percent per business. That also comes to an air pollution reduction of
3.5 billion pounds per year - less electricity production means less combustion.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As a voluntary program, Green Lights has worked well,&quot; says Carol
Febbo of EPA's Green Lights program, Region III. &quot;In our region, as
of March, we'd signed on 426 partners of all kinds, large and small, public
and      private. They've committed to upgrading 880 million square feet
over the next five years.&quot; Nationally, she says, the total square footage
is equivalent to  one out of every 14 buildings around the country.<BR>
<BR>
She does add to the EPA's wish list some kind of partnership with the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commis-sion and utilities - so far this program has gone
on without them - but adds that no one has thought about mandating business
participation in conservation programs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Things go smoother when we tell them that it's a voluntary program,&quot;
she says. &quot;People open up.&quot; And Green Lights is only one of a
slate of volunteer conservation programs. Next on the list for the region
will be the EnergyStar building program - helping businesses design and
redesign for HVAC savings.<BR>
<BR>
Jay Latterman, president of Northern Light, says even more incentives for
conservation are possible. Many businesses across the country receive credits
and rebates from power companies to convert their lighting. He suggests
that the western Pennsylvania area take an aggressive look at forming an
energy-saving policy.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's nothing really that says, 'People, go look at it,' &quot;
he says. &quot;The utilities aren't pushing it, because they're trying to
sell electricity.&quot; He points out that energy costs in Allegheny County
are very high,  10 1/2 cents per kilowatt as opposed to around 8 cents outside
of Duquesne Light territory. Latterman believes that some sort of state-sponsored
forum for education for small business and residential consumers is in order.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When this country is trimming back, this is a plus-plus way to cut
costs that won't hurt anybody,&quot; says Latterman. &quot;What I am suggesting
is that we take a look at the policy we presently have - which is no policy
-and look aggressively into getting one. It requires that we look at the
energy efficiency overall of products being sold here and that we try to
improve them. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't want to get on the Green bandwagon too dramatically. But we
waste a hell of a lot of electricity unnecessarily. There's no one out there
at this point that's saying we should look at ourselves.&quot;<BR>
		                  
<H4>A Wild Ride</H4>
The Pittsburgh Zoo has had one wild and woolly summer. Flocks of visitors
shattered all previous attendance records in July, with over 145,000 snaking
through the gates. The previous record was around 124,000. On July 5, the
zoo topped its one-day attendance record (9,066, set in July 1995) as 9,081
people came to &quot;do the zoo.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're getting around 4,000 visitors most weekdays, as opposed to 1,000
or 2,000 a couple of years ago,&quot; says Public Relations and Marketing
Director Saul Markowitz. &quot;They don't just wait for special events or
sunny days.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pittsburghers are becoming aware that the zoo is a wonderful family
day,&quot; says Assistant Marketing Director Kitty Julian. &quot;The Kids
Kingdom has brought people back to the zoo and helped regain everyone's
trust that it's a great place.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The education program is also attracting herds of kids, with 2,000 attending
Zoo Camp, well over the 1,400 of last year. <BR>
<BR>
This fall promises a whole slate of &quot;emu-sements&quot; - ZooBoo, a
Halloween celebration including a parade and haunted house, and     free
kids' month through all of November. New animals like a baby mandrill born
in May and the expected arrival of rare black rhinos in the late summer
or early fall add  to the zoo's attractions.                       <HR><A HREF="../HomePage.html"><IMG SRC=

<B><FONT size = +1>Fed Up With Phone Menus?<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>Ann Devlin - Columnist</I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>OK, I am going to keep this very simple. When I make a phone call,
I want a human being to answer. And I want that human being to be in Pittsburgh.
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I have exited from my e-mail and let my calls go to my voice mail,
just to share this radical definition of customer service with you. I'll
offer in     my defense that I am an entrepreneur in the middle of a small,
high-tech start-up. Now, corporate Pittsburgh, what's your excuse?<BR>
<BR>
I write that good-naturedly ... but make no mistake, like many of your other
customers, I am at my limit. All together now, let's take a field trip back
in time and find out how we got here.<BR>
<BR>
It all started innocently enough, with that sadistic little exercise we
can almost now recall with affection. You remember - the runaround. <BR>
<BR>
That was when businesses allowed human beings to make things difficult.
We called with a question, concern or complaint, and a customer service
  representative who'd heard it all before assumed the posture of corporate
   protector. <BR>
<BR>
If evasive action was necessary, we were transferred ... and transferred
... and transferred. No problem in getting someone to pick up the phone,
but we seldom got what we needed. <BR>
<BR>
By the time that suspicion was confirmed, we had already been transferred
into oblivion  or disconnected. Oh, we always had a fall-back position.
We could call back. Or we could call KDKA's Wayne Van Dine.<BR>
<BR>
Then, slowly, we started hearing what we thought just might be our big chance
for some high-tech revenge. Every now and then, we might get a machine on
the other end of the line. Automated phone answering systems were novel,
efficient and, yes, just a little bit of fun. <BR>
<BR>
Our fingers could control our fate. If we pressed the buttons in an orderly
and fast enough fashion, we could eliminate human incompetence and get exactly
what we wanted. <BR>
<BR>
Finally getting a human on the phone was like winning the grand prize.<BR>
<BR>
This was sport - phone recreation. What we didn't expect was that this was
about to become the business equivalent of a medal event.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, automated answering systems were everywhere. So were menus. And
then, an even uglier reality set in. Sometimes those menus never even gave
us the option of talking to a human being. <BR>
<BR>
If we didn't know the extension, if we didn't have a name, if we didn't
have a correct spelling, we didn't have a chance. We thought, This can't
get worse. Surprise.<BR>
<BR>
We dialed a sure thing: Directory Assistance. And got a recording.<BR>
<BR>
News reports labeled this &quot;progress&quot; - and revealed that callers
would have to sound totally helpless, pathetic or both before a listening,
but not speaking operator would actually make a sound on the other end of
the line.<BR>
<BR>
We were not amused. We mumbled or concocted other subversive strategies
to make operators speak. We didn't want to, but we learned we could play
this game, too.<BR>
<BR>
That's when they moved the playing field altogether. We dialed local, our
calls were answered long distance.<BR>
  <BR>
Which brings us to today, when we ring a Pittsburgh business ... and get
a pick-up in Indiana. And if we ever do get a real live human being, that's
where they are, too. Just for sport, ask for directions or ask them to deviate
from their automated menus and tell you what is on the seventh floor. Try
to get them to find employees who have changed job descriptions, or names,
or are away from their desks. Ask them about changes in cafeteria hours.<BR>
<BR>
I myself keep asking questions until they finally disclose their location.
And then, after I tell them that I'm sure they are a very lovely person,
I tell them that I wish someone in Pittsburgh had their job. <BR>
<BR>
Here's a question to top managers who decided customers could be handled
by remote control: Since when did telephone operators and customer service
representatives take such a huge bite out of your bottom line that you've
had to automate them, centralize them and alienate all the rest of us? The
next time you're going fishing for some new gee-whiz customer service technique
to employ ... why not try common sense?<BR>
<BR>
When we call your business, let us speak to a human being, and let that
human being be right here in this place where they can help us and where
you are making money: Pittsburgh. <BR>
<BR>
If you want a refresher course in the payoff for all this, call Carol here
at Executive Report. She'll listen to you and point you to whomever best
can answer your query. The moment you hear her voice, your day is going
to get much better. And my argument is going to get much stronger.     
            <BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Working With Reality</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT size=+1>The Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association<BR>
Strives to Keep Jobs in the Area</FONT><BR>
<I>By Jim Strader </I><HR></CENTER>
<P>In a state whose factories were the forge of the nation, a decline in
manufacturing jobs marks what could be seen as a cultural change. After
all, from the mills of the Mon Valley came the beams that built the country's
skyscrapers, the bridges that spanned rivers and the armaments that helped
America win world wars. The blue- collar hardhat who carried a lunchbox
in the plant gate and hoisted an Iron City after quitting time became an
American icon.<BR>
<BR>
But like much of the country, Pennsylvania has seen a drop in its number
of manufacturing jobs as employment climbed in the service sector. In fact,
the state's decline was much sharper than the rest of the nation, according
to recently released figures from the Pennsylvania State Data Center, the
state's official source of population and economic statistics. From 1980
to 1990, the center says, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania plummeted by
23.5 percent; the comparable number nationwide for the same period was a
drop of 6.6 percent.<BR>
<BR>
And the decline has continued;  from 1991 until last year, Pennsylvania
lost more than 43,000 manufacturing  jobs, according to the center.<BR>
<BR>
By comparison, jobs in construction rose from 1980 to 1990 by 37.9 percent,
the state data center says. Financial jobs increased by almost as much,
at 36.9 percent, and professional services jobs rose by 32.6 percent.<BR>
	<BR>
The shift to other types of jobs as elements of heavy industry disappear
is something state officials and representatives of manufacturing industries
recognize. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Obviously, we're concerned,&quot; says Dick Shurilla, a Harrisburg
spokesman for the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association. &quot;Our position
is one of working with this reality.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A variety of broad economic development efforts could help state government
have an impact on stemming the loss of manufacturing jobs. <BR>
<BR>
The state has pushed a program of job creation and job retention, using
a variety of methods to boost employment. In an undertaking not limited
to any business sector, the Ridge administration pushed for and won lower
business taxes and reforms in the workers' compensation system and began
a review of regulatory policies. The state has looked for new markets for
Pennsylvania's products, both around the country and especially overseas.<BR>
<BR>
Of more direct benefit to the attempt to keep heavy industry at home in
Pennsylvania is a law passed last year that encourages companies to clean
up and reuse abandoned industrial sites. The program is being used cooperatively
by the Department of Environmental Protection, which is responsible for
overseeing clean ups, and by the Department of Community and Economic Development
- the former Commerce Department - which provides loans and other assistance.
They have strong PMA backing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can't think of anything the Ridge administration is doing that we
don't support,&quot; Shurilla says. <BR>
But the PMA also has its own take on how to approach the problems its members
face and to look for solutions. The organization, which represents manufacturers
in matters relating to state government, sees its mission as that of a foundation
more than a lobbying group, Shurilla says. The PMA is more interested in
building coalitions on issues than in button-holing lawmakers and officials.<BR>
<BR>
A recent thrust and a key priority for PMA President Murray Dickman is education
improvements, Shurilla says, on the theory that a better educated work force
helps business. &quot;The schools aren't giving us the workers we need to
meet the demands of manufacturers,&quot; according to Shurilla. The need
is seen in secondary and higher education, as well as in vocational and
technical training, he says.<BR>
<BR>
Other issues tie in to the effort to improve conditions for manufacturing.
Though they don't seem to have an apparent link, PMA supports both a proposed
gas tax increase and competition in the electric business. While higher
gas taxes would hit businesses that rely on trucking, the improvements to
roads would outweigh that cost, Shurilla says. And electric competition
would be good for customers, if it can be phased in to keep utilities afloat
in the meantime, he adds. In the end, it all goes back to one goal.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Our policy is to do what we can to promote job creation,&quot; Shurilla
says<BR>

<B><FONT size = +1>Another Young, Innovative Chef Returns and is Now Starring<BR>
at the Iron Butterfly, a New Cultural District Eatery</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Lydia Strohl </I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>Despite the fact that their wine menu is blazoned with &quot;In A
Gadda Da Vino,&quot; the Cultural District's newest restaurant, The Iron
Butterfly, isn't named for the '70s rock group famous for recording the
longest song in rock history. <BR>
<BR>
Rather, the name is a sort of metaphor for culture emerging from the gritty
industry that was foundation to Pittsburgh's fortunes. Barbara Hughes, 
formerly the manager of Bravo Franco, and one of several partners in the
new venture, says the basis of the restaurant will be its interaction with
the events in the Cultural District. Others involved are Nathaniel Wilcox,
owner of the Sewickley Hotel, chef Stephen Malfatti and Kathleen Master,
former bar manager at Rico's.  &quot;For instance, if there's a cabaret,
we might have a 'cabaret of cabernets' wine tasting.' &quot;<BR>
<BR>
But it will take more than clever promos to overcome what can be a dearth
of downtown business; Wilcox says nights with no theater performances sometimes
see just two diners. And for that, the restaurant's shooting for an old-fashioned
solution:  just darn good food and drink.<BR>
<BR>
Malfatti, 34, a Pittsburgh native and graduate of the Culinary Institute
of America, cut his teeth at the London Hilton as well as in New York's
superior Le Cirque and Tavern on the Green. The eclectic influence is clear.<BR>
<BR>
On a recent evening, we had a roasted calamari and saffron risotto and the
barbecued duck and portobella mushroom quesadilla with spicy mango salsa.
The risotto was creamy and smooth, but the saffron taste was a little too
overpowering. The quesadilla was at once piquant and sweet, held together
with melted cheese. The barbecued duck was piquant - not too oily, with
a thick, rich barbecue tang, grilled to perfection. The mango salsa was
sweet, a thick, guacamole-textured topping adding a surprising dimension
to the already inventive dish. The salads are uninspired - I'd suggest choosing
some other tempting item, like the tian of crabmeat and avocado, sauce gazpacho,
or the seared foie gras on poached figs with a currant demi-glace.<BR>
<BR>
The English influence shows in Malfatti's use of rich reductions, flavored
with fruit or port - but the accommodations he creates for them are uniquely
contemporary. We tried medallions of veal tenderloin in a port wine shallot
demi-glace; the sauce was well-balanced and deep, the veal perfectly cooked.
But the hit at the table was Napoleon of red snapper: a finely sauteed fillet
of snapper layered with scallops, crayfish and asparagus, then another fillet.
The innovative port wine lobster sauce was delicately flavored but quite
rich; unfortunately, the entree was sitting in a pool of it, which overpowered
the other wonderful tastes.<BR>
<BR>
The Iron Butterfly's lunch menu is not just a thin echo of dinner. For starters,
we tried the roasted yellow bell pepper soup infused with basil, a light
cream soup with a fantastic sweet taste. The fried herb polenta was smooth,
perfectly complementing a thick link of sweet sausage and a marinara of
which even our picky Italian taster approved. Sandwiches include the usual
Reuben - but we were impressed with the hand-hewn prosciutto and gorgonzola
on foccacio, served with fire roasted pimento chutney. Lunch entrees run
the gamut: we tried lobster and shrimp ravioli - wonderful, but again sitting
in a pool of herbed olive oil. Bites mixed with a bit of the accompanying
sun-dried tomato were heavenly, however. Another winner was roasted breast
of chicken with portobella Madeira demi-glace and saffron risotto - the
risotto was mellower than when tried before,   the chicken moist and finely
sauced with an earthily rich glaze.<BR>
<BR>
The dessert menu is not as inspired as the rest of the creations. A light
Marscapone cheesecake was fluffy, not too sweet. The raspberry chocolate
torte is thick and rich with chocolate. But go back to the office for coffee
-even a freshly brewed pot was mediocre.<BR>
<BR>
The wine list currently presents a short, but admirable selection - from
an Opus I Meritage ($95.00) to an Italian Gavi di Gavi ($22.00). Happy hour
in the bar, which is a beautiful slab of viridian marble, perfectly complimenting
the celery walls and simple white table-clothed rounds, looks like a restful
alternative to Dingbats.<BR>
<BR>
FYI, &quot;In A Gadda Da Vino&quot; is an allusion to the Iron Butterfly's
(the group's) drunken pronunciation of 'In the Garden of Eden.' <BR>
<BR>
With a little more consistency, this Iron Butterfly might just emerge as
one of downtown's hits.<BR>

</B><HR>You've probably seen the Strip Tease - a clever ad campaign touting
the freshness of Pizza Outlet's ingredients. With 53 stores open since 1988
and counting, banking on quality seems to be working for the company. A
$30,000 initial investment into one store in Mt. Lebanon has grown into
a company recording $20 million to 30 million in sales company-wide, doubling
sales each year since 1994. Varol Ablak, his brother Seckin (pronounced
&quot;Sedgekin&quot;) and their father head the company's quick expansion,
and have goals of opening store 1,000 by the year 2005. But they're running
out of room in Pittsburgh, so Seckin is heading down to conquer northern
Virginia and spread pizza to the D.C. market. He's expecting to open the
first store there by September, and have 10 open by next year. Lydia Strohl
talked to him about the fast-moving company in their South Hills office.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Executive Report:</B> When did the first Pizza Outlet open?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Seckin Ablak:</B> January 30, 1988. My brother and father started the
business; I was finishing my last term at school and helping out whenever
I could. They had some experience. My brother went to Louisiana to open
a store with some friends and they didn't have success there. My father
is a mining engineer, a deep mine specialist and he went down there, too.
When the [oil] industry started to go bad he decided that he might want
to do something like [a restaurant] too - but that was when the economy
started to go bad because oil prices went down. They were big restaurants
- Sicily's Pizza, dine-in, buffets, plus deliveries. So they had a lot of
overhead. They did have a few stores that were delivery, and it seemed those
stores were a lot more profitable. Just because of the low overhead. I mean,
Pizza Hut now has gone into delivery. They're getting away from the restaurants,
not totally, but they seem to be opening more of the delco - delivery and
carry out - than red roof dine-in facilities. <BR>
<BR>
There's a lot of places that do the restaurant very well, but there are
few places that deliver pizza very well. It's difficult. You've got to find
the drivers. When they decided to come back to Pittsburgh - we had a lot
of friends and this was where we wanted to be -[my brother] sold his interest
and invested it in the first store here.<BR>
<BR>
The first store in Mt. Lebanon was just a small delivery/carry out store.
We don't have other financing. There have been other partners that have
come in, but basically it's just through the stores that we've been able
to grow. <BR>
<BR>
It's so tough to find people to work. With the training that we do we feel
that we have very good people working for us. We have 25 people who work
out of the office, including supervisors. Everyone in the office also assists
in the stores. Ever since we started eight years ago we've put in a tremendous
number of hours.<BR>
<BR>
We've almost overextended ourselves at times. We had an opportunity to take
over a lot of [Domino's]stores, and it wasn't a very good time for us financially
to do it, but we didn't feel we had another opportunity like this. We jumped
and we really had to buckle down and make sure it worked for us. And it
has. Overall, I think we have about six stores that were Domino's. We have
about four stores that were Four Star Pizza. Until recently, all the stores
we opened were previously owned by someone else, and were, obviously, unsuccessful.
We've gone in and streamlined the operation, made it more efficient and
increased sales. But recent stores have been built from scratch. <BR>
<B>ER:</B> What was the initial capital investment?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> I believe it was about $30,000. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> How did the growth track from the first opening?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> By the end of 1988 there were two stores. By the end of '89 there
were six stores. At the end of '90 there were seven - then it starts getting
gray. But in 1996, by the end of July, we will have opened 13 stores. And
that's not including two temporary locations that were open in the Olympics.
We also had a location at the Regatta, selling personal pizzas; we had a
wave runner delivering pizzas to boats.<BR>
<BR>
There are a lot of people involved in the company, and we respect everyone's
ideas. We have the final say, of course, both in the franchise and the corporate
stores, but you know, you learn every day. And if you're just so straight
that you think you know everything, you lose the opportunity to grow, to
try different things. We in no way feel we're above anyone else. We work
just as hard as we expect everyone else to work.<BR>
<BR>
My father watches over the maintenance department, and a lot of times he's
up on the last rung of the ladder painting something because no one else
will go up there. He does what it takes to finish the job. Sometimes I'll
drop by a store and if they're behind, I'll grab a broom, you know. I don't
want to be there 'til one in the morning, so I do what it takes. I feel
that they see us working this hard, they know what it takes. They're going
to work this hard for us. And they do.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> How many employees do you have now?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA: </B>Between corporate and franchise I believe we employ about 1,300.
We have 25 corporate stores and 28 franchise stores. We just had a store
open in Kittanning. We continue to grow. After college, I went to New Orleans
for a year and worked on the offshore oil rigs. I wasn't very happy with
my job and planned on coming up to Pittsburgh, helping out a little, passing
out resumes. I believe it was May of 1989. I didn't send one resume out.
I just got involved in the business and it just took off. My brother Varol
has engineered a lot of the deals that we've come across. He's very experienced
in lease negotiations and business opportunities. He's the president and
the one that really pushed for the expansion. He's struck the deals for
the locations - to be able to go in with less capital and strike up the
best deal.<BR>
<BR>
He's in Turkey right now. There are some people interested in opening stores
in Turkey. We're Turkish. And there are other people that are interested
in foreign markets. There's so much growth potential in foreign markets,
it's really amazing. Friends that we have that have gone to Turkey have
seen, in popular beach towns for example, a three-story Burger King that
has 300 or 400 people there 24 hours a day eating. It's constantly packed.
So we feel our expansion could be beneficial for us and whoever gets involved.
It's amazing how they look at American investors, and American companies.
It's very positive. I believe one of the busiest McDonalds in the world
is in Moscow. I've seen sales figures for companies that have opened in
foreign markets and they are two and three times what American stores are
doing. I know the Domino's that have opened in Japan are maybe four times
the sales of the U.S. stores, but they could also be charging more because
they pay more for rent or labor. But generally all you hear is success stories
as far as expanding. <BR>
<BR>
There are also areas we're looking to expand to in the U.S. As I said, we
opened some stores in the Olympics.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> How did that happen?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> We have some people interested in opening some stores in the
South, in Florida, in Texas, and they're from At-lanta. One of the stores
that we opened this year is in Atlanta - the owner had some friends that
invest with us in Pittsburgh, and he thought it would be great to develop
there. So my brother went down to see him and he had some friends that had
space at the Olympics. He looked into it, and we assisted them in getting
the equipment and in the management end of it. We have someone down there
now supervising the whole operation. It was basically word of mouth.<BR>
I've met with various franchise companies, and one of the things that one
company asked was 'What type of advertising do you do?' I thought he meant
to sell our product - he meant advertising to sell a franchise. I said,
'Well, we haven't.' He said, 'What do you credit your growth towards?' I
said, 'Every person that has opened a franchise store has either been family,
friend or employee.' Even the store in Atlanta is an employee who used to
work for us - he was a driver for us while he was going to school. Then
he moved to Atlanta and he felt that our product was better than anything
he could get there, so we helped him open a store down there. A franchise
store opened in Laguna Hills, that's near Los Angeles. There are two brothers,
and when we opened the first store in Mt. Lebanon one used to work for us.
Once again they call us and say, 'Can you guys get us a steak hoagie out
here? We haven't had a steak hoagie like you guys make.' They're business
people and they sold interests in other investments to open a store out
there. They're very successful and are looking to open a second store.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> What kind of investment is it to open a store?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> To get into a franchise is about $83,000. The initial investment
in the delivery end is a lot less than you would have to pay in a lot of
the big restaurants - Olive Garden, Italian Oven, even Boston Market, the
investment is well above $300,000. I think the Italian Oven is half a million.
With us, you can open at least five stores for the same amount of money.
We require that the managing partner have a certain ownership percentage.
Unless someone has money invested, people switch jobs. The only way we could
assure that store would be run properly is by having a partner that's going
to run it. Now, we have a lot of managers in our stores that run better
stores than some of our franchisees. But we're the managing owner, so we
guarantee those stores are going to be run right.<BR>
<BR>
A few of the people that we've had have gone on to open a second store,
a third store - what they do is get a general manager in their store, and
supervise it. But that owner is trained to run that store, if the manager
leaves. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ER: </B>Opening a pizza franchise in Pittsburgh sounds like taking sand
to the Gobi - and yet, you've had phenomenal success. What are the keys?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> First of all, we set up a game plan. And one of the most important
things was - well, there's a lot of things. Quality. We use nothing but
quality products since we've opened our stores, even the first store. My
brother was doing research and he came across my father-in-law, who had
a food supply company. They talked about what were the best products out
there for pizza. Since then, my father-in-law has gone on to work with Pennsylvania
Macaroni Co., and we feel they supply the best Italian products in the market.
<BR>
<BR>
Second thing is service. We've all strived to make sure we had good people,
we had clean stores, we had good service. That's not an easy thing to ask
people - because you can't just have 10 or 15 people in a store cleaning.
So you also have to run it in the most efficient way. It's budgeting your
time, scheduling properly, expecting more from people and constantly checking
on things, making sure the people do what they need to do before they leave.
Sunday, my father and I went to the driving range, and we were supposed
to meet that night for dinner. We got done around 12:00, and he said he
was going to check on a few stores. When I met him that night, he told me
which ones he went to, and what he saw. We want to check on our stores,
and if there's anything that might not be right, correct the problem. We
have checklists to make sure the drivers know what they're supposed to do
during peak times and during slow times. A lot of the people that we deal
with are parttime employees, so it's real important to train them right.
You can't constantly tell people what to do, they have to know. So if you
spend the time to train people, it might initially take a little longer,
but once you do it right the store runs a lot more efficiently.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> How does the training run?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> The general manager handles it at each store. He has a checklist
and goes right down the list. Cooks are the same way. Especially with new
stores, it's very difficult, because we hire about 30 or 40 people, and
you need to train all those people by the time the store opens. What you
do is isolate a person to one particular area, and work with them until
they know that area. Everyone's cross-trained, so if a driver comes in and
the phone is ringing, he grabs the phone. If a cook is making pizzas and
a hoagie needs to be made, he does it. If it's a busy night and someone
gets behind, he tells the general manager, who assigns a backup. <BR>
<BR>
We're in the process of getting computers. We use Pizza Fast. Each customer
has a separate file, which is accessed through their phone number. It would
automatically pop up their name and address, a history of what they've ordered,
and it gives us a mailing list so we can send coupons. It gives us other
information automatically like how many orders an hour, at the end of the
week, what's the average delivery time, each day - it allows us to take
care of things if need be. We have a director of operations in the office,
and underneath him are five supervisors. They each watch over five stores,
and each store has a general manager. The general manager watches over day-to-day
operations, and he's the one person we talk to. We have meetings in the
office to go over various things - it's the supervisors' job to get the
message to the managers. It's maybe a little top heavy, but it's worked
very well for us.<BR>
<BR>
The franchise department is quite similar. We have a director of operations
for the franchise stores. He has two assistants under him and we visit each
franchise store once a month. We do a visit sheet to make sure they are
following all the specs. We check on the image of the store and other various
things. If there's something they need to address, they take care of it
that month. If they don't, then we can take action - we've never had to
in the past. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> What type of control do you retain?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> We have the ability to pull the name from the store if it's necessary.
It may never be necessary, but there's a lot of people that have their total
lives invested in our company. Us, for example, but just to give you an
idea - say we have an owner in Dormont that isn't doing a very good job.
That affects Mt. Lebanon. It's up to us to make sure that doesn't happen,
because someone has their whole life savings tied up in that store. This
is a map of the whole Pittsburgh area, and you can see that all the delivery
areas come right up to each other. Pretty much all of Pittsburgh is covered
- we're looking to open a store in Carnegie. There are certain areas we
don't deliver to, and that's why we say limited delivery area. For example,
Rte. 19 and Rte. 8 are maybe six miles apart, and we try to do about a 2.5
mile radius, so there's an area there that's not covered. But you really
need to be on Rte. 19 or on Rte. 8 - and there's really not enough in the
middle to put a store there.<BR>
<BR>
We're starting to move into areas farther out - Morgantown, Charleroi, Ellwood
City, St. Clairsville, Ohio.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> What do you look for in locating an Outlet?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA</B>: We check demographics, automobile count - it's real difficult
to come up with a minimum. Do you know where Valencia is? It's real spread
out, but Valencia is one of our best stores. It's very interesting. And
a franchise store in Sarver is one of our most successful franchises. You're
talking in a three- or four-mile radius only having 3,000 households. There
is competition - three or four stores have opened and closed since we've
been there. It's the management. We've created a system where, if you follow
the system, there's no reason it shouldn't be successful.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> How will the minimum wage hike affect your business?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> We're going to have to adjust our prices. It's not bad for us.
We have a lot of very dedicated people. It's going to be difficult, but
we'll do what we need to do.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> Restaurants traditionally have narrow profit margins. Is that
true in your business?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> We've had stores that have had a 25 percent profit in a month,
and we've had stores that have lost money. We've closed two stores. We closed
one store downtown, on Fifth Avenue - it was a dangerous area. Not that
we ever had a problem with it, but you just needed the right person in there.
There were break-ins - it was just difficult. The other was a store in Carnegie,
and the owner was building another store and didn't want to pay our royalty
fees. He just switched the name - he's running a very successful business
right now.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER</B>: Is the royalty based on a percentage?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA</B>: Yes, three percent is our fee. Initial franchise fee is $8,000.
They get trained, and even if they haven't run a business before, we show
them how to look at the numbers, we show them how to train people. We have
a four-week training program that we put people through and they learn every
aspect of the business. We also assist them in opening the store. We have
a crew of people that go up there, since you're talking about 30 to 40 people
coming in at once. We're there for the first full week, open to closing,
making sure the stores run properly. Their second store is less, as there's
no training involved, it's $5,000. And employees of ours, even if there
is some training involved, we'll give it to them for $5,000, just because
they've worked with us and they know much of the business. We cut them a
break.<BR>
<BR>
It's not like we're profiting $8,000 - we have a training manager and a
whole crew of people that we pay for to work in that store. We have a guy
involved in national development, who assists in every aspect of opening
the store - hiring a general contractor, putting together a floor plan,
purchasing the equipment - all that. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> How do you increase sales in a market? Which company do you consider
your toughest competition?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> In general, when we go into a market, we like to open right next
to Pizza Hut, to Domino's, because we feel we have a better product and
we can compete with them. There's plenty of business for both of us - and
if they open in our area, they'll take a little bit from us. People have
different tastes.<BR>
<BR>
They're very successful: but they don't have what we have. What we stress
is quality. A lot of those companies will have their vegetables sliced and
vacuum packed, delivered out of the back of an 18-wheeler. We slice the
vegetables we need that day. We make the dough fresh daily. We have proprietary
items - like our own pizza sauce, pepperoni and fresh cheese.  We tell the
companies what kind of specs we need on the food. They're all top quality
companies. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> Can the franchises outside of Pittsburgh get the same ingredients?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA: </B>We don't ship ourselves, but these companies that are working
with us in the local area are making enough money that we expect them to
service a place like California, or Atlanta. We pick companies that are
already being serviced by our suppliers - so to put an extra pallet of pizza
sauce up until our store there needs it is no problem. So a pizza in California
is the same as here, Atlanta the same thing.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> What about Turkey?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA: </B>Turkey, it might be a similar menu, but there's going to be some
differences. A lot of the products we work with are pork products, and Turkey
is a Muslim nation - they don't eat pork. We'll have to find what the tastes
are. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ER: </B>Which marketing strategies do you find most effective?<BR>
<BR>
<B>SA:</B> For local areas, these last two openings, Kittanning and St.
Clairs-ville, we've done more sales than any of the other areas. This is
outside of the Pittsburgh market. And what we attribute that to is radio
ads, television - I'm sure St. Clairsville catches a few of our ads. But
they must've heard about us somehow - from coming up to Pittsburgh, maybe
seeing our billboards. But it's not like we did a tremendous amount of advertising
to warrant that amount of sales. The ones opening in Georgia and California
have started out slower, and we expected that. It takes time. There's not
the momentum.<BR>
<BR>
We do various things when we open. There was a live remote from the Kittanning
store, so a lot of people heard we were opening that day. We send flyers
out to local businesses with coupons on them. We go from house to house
hanging menus on doors. We try to cover the whole area before we open. We
always open on Wednesday.<BR>
<BR>
There's a certain percentage that we do out of the office, like a co-op
program. We have an advertising agency, Carroll Advertising, they come up
with ads. Last year's ad was the 'Strip Tease,' a play on words, basically,
because all of our products are delivered fresh from the Strip district.
The radio ad won first place in the Pittsburgh area, and in the national
awards, I think we came in third. It was tremendous for us. <BR>
<BR>
There were a few people that did complain, that didn't appreciate the whole
concept, we tried to handle them as delicately as possible. <BR>
<BR>
Basically, we give [the advertising agency] a budget, we say we want to
spend this much. In general, it's roughly $700 per store - with 45 stores
in the Pittsburgh market, we say you have $31,500, that much to spend. When
a new store comes on, instead of taking that and splitting it up one more
way, we just add to it. We request that the franchises spend 6.5 percent
of sales, the $700 is included in that, and whatever's left we ask them
to spend on local markets, from putting ads in the paper, to local yearbooks,
to sponsoring local teams. <BR>
<BR>
The best form of advertising is door hanging, flying coupons and menus on
the door in the afternoon; when they come home they're more likely to order.
The same with businesses - if you stop in before lunch when everyone's hungry
you get more response.<BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Sexual Harassment</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Don't Think it Will Go Away;<BR>
Investigate it and Eradicate it<BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Jim Urban</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>When six former employees of Astra USA sued the pharmaceuticals giant
last spring, their charges were simple and to the point: Top management
sexually harassed young, female members of the Astra sales force, and middle
managers who tried to put a stop to the harassment were forced out of the
company, the complaint charged.<BR>
<BR>
Astra, which calls the lawsuit &quot;outrageous,&quot; nonetheless has suspended
CEO Lars Bildman and two other top executives amid allegations that they
were among the worst offenders, preying on young, female sales trainees
at meetings the company held near its headquarters in Boston.<BR>
<BR>
In a nutshell, the sexual harassment scandal has been a public relations
nightmare for Astra, which is finding out how quickly word gets around.
Some female physicians who got wind of the scandal have stopped writing
Astra products - including popular allergy drug Rhinocort - in silent protest.
And prospective employees now view Astra as an employer that tolerates sexual
harassment in the workplace.<BR>
<BR>
No employer wants that kind of reputation. The Astra case shows the importance
of investigating sexual harassment when allegations surface and eliminating
harassment if it does indeed exist in the workplace. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sexual harassment in the workplace is a problem,&quot; says attorney
Robert McTiernan of Tucker Erensberg in Pittsburgh. &quot;It is not something
that has been blown out of proportion. It is there. You just cannot readily
dismiss something as being without justification. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Usually, you will not find some kind of behavior that is not appropriate,&quot;
says McTiernan.<BR>
The problem is this: Some companies, especially smaller businesses that
don't have human resources professionals on staff, think the problem will
resolve itself. Those companies, by ignoring the harassment, are risking
litigation and the kind of negative publicity that Astra is still experiencing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You cannot put your head in the sand,&quot; says Sidney Zohn, an attorney
with Buchanan Ingersoll in Pittsburgh who handles many sexual harassment
cases. &quot;There is an affirmative obligation to address the situation.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sometimes an employee who may have been the victim of sexual harassment
tells the employer but doesn't want anything done,&quot; adds attorney Vicki
Beatty of Pittsburgh's Meyer Darragh Buckler Bebenek &amp; Eck. &quot;The
employee just wants the employer to know. Even though the employee may not
want anything done about it, the employer has an obligation to investigate.
They are making a big mistake if they don't.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sexual Harassment Types<BR>
</B><BR>
The courts recognize sexual harassment claims under two primary theories:
quid pro quo sexual harassment and hostile environment sexual harassment.<BR>
<BR>
Quid pro quo sexual harassment occurs when a superior demands sexual favors
in return for economic or job benefits, or when the superior punishes the
subordinate employee for refusing to comply with the sexual request. Quid
pro quo harassment also has a subcategory called reverse quid pro quo harassment:
If an employee is coerced into submitting to unwelcome sexual advances in
return for a job benefit, other employees who were qualified but denied
the benefit can establish that sex was a condition for denying the benefit.
<BR>
<BR>
The courts usually follow a five-part test to decide whether the plaintiff
has a quid pro quo case. The victim must show they are a member of a protected
group, such as females; the sexual advances were unwelcome; the harassment
was sexually or gender motivated; the individual's reaction to the advances
affected a tangible aspect of employment such as compensation or advancement;
and, the offender is a superior.<BR>
<BR>
The other type of harassment, hostile environment, exists when sexual or
gender-related conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's performance
or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive environment. Employers
often fear this kind of sexual harassment complaint because it is likely
the harassment occurred without the employer's knowledge. The sexual harassment
claim need not be based on conduct that is solely sexual in nature, since
intimidation and hostility toward gender can result from conduct other than
explicit sexual advances.<BR>
<BR>
<B>It Gets Tricky</B><BR>
<BR>
Any personnel investigation is complicated, whether the employer suspects
theft, drug abuse or sexual harassment. But investigations especially get
tricky when the subject is sexual harassment.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A lot of these types of situations don't occur when there are a number
of other witnesses standing around,&quot; says Meyer Darragh's Beatty. &quot;Often-
times, that type of harassment -  propositions and threats - takes place
behind closed doors.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So it comes down to the purported victim's word against the purported offender's
word, and credibility is the issue.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The employer must walk that balancing act,&quot; adds Buchanan Ingersoll's
Zohn. &quot;Are you going to destroy the career of someone who has done
nothing wrong? Are you going to take no action when there might be something
there?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Most attorneys agree that it's best to take a detailed statement from the
victim, perhaps allowing the victim to write out the statement and sign
it. The employer then must get a response from the suspected offender, and
from there move to corroborate information via other sources.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It so often boils down to one person's word against another and a
determination of credibility,&quot; says Tucker Erensberg's McTiernan. &quot;The
employer has to make a credibility determination based on all the points.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To me, in my experience, the person handling the investigation usually
has a pretty good sense of who is telling the truth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, there will be instances in which the evidence is inconclusive.
In that case, the employer should inform all parties that the investigation
was inconclusive, but sternly remind them that sexual harassment is not
tolerated.<BR>
<BR>
There have been many instances in which an employee who was in jeopardy
of losing his or her job came forth with sexual harassment allegations with
hope of securing their job. On the other hand, there have been cases in
which poor employees who were in jeopardy of losing their jobs also had
valid harassment claims.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are no guarantees,&quot; says Meyer Darragh's Beatty. &quot;You
have to go with what you believe to be the truth.&quot;<BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Uniform Changes</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Teams Generate Money by Changing Uniforms: <BR>
The Pirates and Steelers are Next <BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Bill Modoono</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>The Pirates 1996 season comes to a merciful conclusion at the end
of this month and after a season like this one, fans expect changes.<BR>
<BR>
And, shortly after the World Series, the Pirates will respond to that demand
and announce major changes, designed to alter the club's bottom line.<BR>
<BR>
Free-agent signings? Trades? Front-office shakeup? Naw, that's old hat,
and old hats don't cut it in the '90s. Which could explain why the Pirates
have decided to change their hats - along with their uniforms and logo.<BR>
<BR>
For the 1997 season, the Pirates will have three different caps they will
wear in games, three different uniforms, new warmup jackets and a new official
logo. Most importantly for the team, the moves figure to be anything but
cosmetic.<BR>
<BR>
The Pirates were so serious about making these changes that they test-marketed
the designs on focus groups most likely to be interested in the new look:
kids ages 6 to 19.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We saw what they liked and what they didn't like,&quot; says Steve
Greenberg, the Pirates' vice president for marketing and operations. &quot;If
the team shows significant improvement, what we propose to do can create
an incredible demand for Pirates clothing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Pirates, of course, are not alone in changing uniforms or logos to increase
income. It's something that has been done by a number of teams in recent
years, albeit with mixed results. In Houston, for instance, the NBA Rockets
figured after winning two championships, the time was ripe for a new look.
But the new look, coupled with a less-than-championship season, resulted
in disappointing sales in 1996.<BR>
<BR>
A more successful fashion statement was made by the Penguins, who added
a third jersey to their home/away wardrobe and not only pleased fans with
the new look, but translated the jerseys into playoff success. Until reaching
the Stanley Cup semifinals, the Pens were undefeated in their new jerseys,
which made the shirts even more popular.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The third jersey was our best-selling item all year,&quot; says Mark
Willand, director of marketing for Prime Sports, which handles Penguins'
marketing. &quot;As soon as we introduced it, it was extremely successful.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Penguins, in fact, sold out an initial order of 300 jerseys - at $110
each - on the first night they were offered to fans on TV. That's right:
$110 for a night shirt.<BR>
<BR>
Like all professional sports teams, the Penguins have to share some of the
proceeds from merchandise sales with the rest of the league. But the Penguins,
Pirates and Steelers can benefit from the sales of their own merchandise
by becoming part of the retailing process, as all three have done.<BR>
<BR>
Even the Steelers have planned a uniform change - albeit a modest one -
for 1997. Joe Gordon, the Steelers' marketing director, says the sale of
merchandise only accounts for a small percentage of the $65 million in revenue
the club annually produces. Yet he considers this revenue &quot;critical.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Any revenue a team can generate on its own is very important,&quot;
says Gordon. &quot;It's an additional revenue source, which didn't exist
three years ago. It's important as a way of helping us continue to compete.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Gordon says sports fans are more willing to accept design changes in this
era, but the Steelers - conservative as ever - will &quot;not do anything
radical.&quot; The new &quot;streamlined, contemporary look&quot; is largely
the result of the uniforms being produced by Nike in 1997 rather than Starter.<BR>
<BR>
The Pirates and Penguins have always been willing to make more radical changes,
and the moves have paid off. Willand says in the past decade merchandise
marketing has gone from producing revenue in the low six-     figure range
- $150,000 to $200,000 - to seven figures.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It can have a big impact if done sensibly,&quot; Willand says. &quot;You
can't be overly commercial, because people will see through it. But anytime
you make a sensible addition, it can make a significant difference.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For the Pirates, who generate seven-figure revenue from shared national
money, plus additional money they get from their own &quot;clubhouse stores,&quot;
the new uniforms and hats are designed to be more than just cash cows. &quot;It's
a marketing tool,&quot; says Greenberg. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;If a lot of people are walking around in our new jerseys,&quot; says
Greenberg, &quot;it's advertising.&quot; <BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>The Pension Plan</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Setting One Up Is Not as  <BR>
Difficult or Costly as Some Think<BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Henry Lipput</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Ryan Krischke, owner of data communications firm Network Resources,
has always offered his employees a good benefits package, but he wanted
to take it a step further by setting up a pension plan. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've always done everything we could. We saw this as the last major
benefit,&quot; he says. &quot;It's worked out fairly well because we can
tie it directly to the profits of the company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Sound like a major undertaking for a small business? In reality it's not.
Thinking that pension plans are difficult for small businesses to set up
is a common misconception, says Joseph P. Nicola Jr., a senior tax manager
with  Pittsburgh's Alpern, Rosenthal Co. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Department of Labor and the IRS have both made it very easy for
small businesses to set up retirement plans,&quot; says Nicola. &quot;And
the reason is because the IRS in particular has a procedure by which they
will bless a plan well in advance.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So what keeps many small businesses from establishing a pension plan? &quot;My
guess is fear, more than anything else,&quot; says Nicola. &quot;There are
quite a few employers out there who are concerned about fiduciary liability
and responsibility. Now that's a rather fallacious fear only in the sense
that all pension plans are required to carry what are known as fidelity
bonds, which is basically insurance. That's what essentially protects the
employer from any kind of liability.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Granted, there are certain costs associated with setting up and administering
a pension plan. A company can have a tax attorney or accountant draw up
a customized plan to submit to the IRS for approval, costing $2,000 or more.
An alternative is a prototype plan, which costs a business next to nothing.
Administrative requirements include annual filing requirements with the
IRS and the labor department.<BR>
<BR>
There are also costs associated with meeting the testing requirements of
the IRS for pension plans. For qualified retirement plans, such as 401(k)s
and profit-sharing plans, the government attempts to maintain a ratio of
the money that is going into a plan for two separate groups within a company:
highly compensated employees and non-highly compensated employees. <BR>
<BR>
Criteria used to distinguish highly compensated employees includes income
levels and whether the employee is a stockholder. The government totals
up all of the income in each group and how much money went into the plan
for each group, not only contributed by the employee, but also by the employer.
<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;What happens is that you then get a certain ratio of income to the
amount contributed for each group,&quot; explains Don McDade, an associate
general manager for AllAmerica Financial. &quot;And let's just say that
for the non-highly compensated group, that percentage came out to five percent
of income. Then what the government says is that the highly compensated
group cannot contribute more than five percent of their total income.  There's
a two percent spread between the two.&quot;  The government calls this test
a nondiscrimination test. &quot;What the government says is that if we allow
the highly compensated group to contribute a lot more money than the non-highly
compensated group, then that would be an unfair advantage.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What can happen is that the plan over time can become pretty expensive
to administer because of these regulations and the testing that has to go
on,&quot; says McDade. &quot;The employer generally can't do it, it's too
complicated.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although a broker or insurance agent can perform this work, it is still
an extra cost for a small business.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, says McDade, &quot;The main reason that small business owners
do not set up qualified retirement plans is because a small business owner
does not want to be locked into having to commit to putting a certain amount
of money into a qualified retirement plan every year. With a lot of plans,
they could be locked into putting in a fair amount of money. &quot;<BR>
<BR>
When small businesses do bite the bullet and set up a plan, chances are
they are doing it as a benefit for employees, not as a tax deduction for
the company. &quot;I would say that 80 to 90 percent of business owners
out there are very aware of the fact that they need to save money for retirement,
that they want something that they can contribute to and work with, and
they want their employees to be able to have something,&quot; says McDade.<BR>
<BR>
That is the reason, despite the testing and administration costs, why Network
Resources set up a 401(k) and a profit-sharing plan. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've been around - it will be nine years this year - and it's something
we've always wanted to do,&quot; says Krischke. &quot;Historically it's
always been very difficult in terms of the paperwork and reporting requirements.
I really wanted to get it done simply as a corporate benefit. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The company's been very solid and profitable over the last few years
and we really wanted a way to provide a benefit to the employees that would
also give everyone a tax break.&quot;<BR>

<B><FONT size =+2>Teaching Leaders</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I><FONT size=+1>Leadership Can Be Taught in the Classroom;<BR>
Corporate America Thinks So, Anyway<BR>
</FONT></I></B><BR>
<I>By Gretchen McKay</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Conventional wisdom tells us great leaders are born, not made. But
some students at Pittsburgh colleges and universities would argue against
that notion. They are enrolled in programs and classes that teach leadership.<BR>
<BR>
These classes attempt to teach the subtle, but critical, skills that separate
a &quot;leader&quot; from just a boss.<BR>
&quot;Some of the very best, brightest individuals aren't necessarily the
best leaders,&quot; maintains PNC Bank training specialist Larry Pickett,
who considers a good leader as one who can give direction to, coach and
support his or her employees, as well as delegate tasks.<BR>
<BR>
And you won't always find that person at the top of the organization. Pickett
should know: He's among 50 or so graduate students at Duquesne University
who spend their Saturdays working toward their  Master of Arts in Leadership
and Liberal Studies, or MLLS.<BR>
<BR>
The 36-credit program is designed to develop a person's leadership capabilities
as well as increase his or her understanding of the world in which modern
leaders must function.<BR>
<BR>
According to Benjamin Hodes, Duquesne's dean of continuing education, the
need for leadership education has never been greater, particularly as more
and more organizations remove layers of management.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Having technical skills isn't enough to understand how to cope with
change and challenge,&quot; says Hodes, who defines leadership as the ability
to influence others. &quot;Especially when people are much more responsible
for managing themselves and their work.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Still, can leadership be taught to a natural-born follower? Absolutely,
says Marie Cini, assistant professor of leadership studies at Duquesne.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Leadership is a journey,&quot; Cini says. &quot;It involves constantly
recognizing your weaknesses and building upon your strengths.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the corporate world, Pickett says the learning process is by &quot;trial
and error, and we can't afford that. When you let good people slip out the
door [because of poor leadership], there's an intangible cost to the bottom
line.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Corporate America obviously agrees that leadership education outside the
organization is a viable pursuit: 75 percent of students are reimbursed
for tuition by their employers.<BR>
<BR>
Carnegie Mellon University requires students in its Graduate School of Industrial
Administration to take at least two courses in leadership as part of the
curriculum.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We think we have something serious to add to what you might accidentally
pick up on the job,&quot; says instructor Thomas Kerr, former assistant
general counsel to Westinghouse.<BR>
<BR>
Course work includes case studies of actual situations students or others
in the industry have dealt with, either successfully or not. Students, for
example, may be asked to prepare a female employee for a tour in a foreign
country that disapproves of women in management positions.<BR>
<BR>
That hands-on approach also is paramount in CMU's course on crisis management
and leadership. In addition to giving students the benefit of his own experience,
instructor Gerald Meyers, former chairman of American Motors and a crisis-management
expert, invites a different chief executive officer to class each week for
a question-and-answer session.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;I bring them in and say, 'Here's the guy, ask him any question you've
got, see what you can learn from him,' &quot; says Meyers.<BR>
 <BR>
Beforehand, students research the industry and prepare a paper describing
the executive's qualities. They also role-play a crisis with the actual
executive in attendance.<BR>
<BR>
The experience, says Meyers, is one where  &quot;a whole lot of heat happens
 and sometimes some light.&quot; Especially since the executive himself
later comes on stage to tell the class &quot;what went right and wrong.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's how we study leadership,&quot; says Meyers. &quot;We see what
made this person great, his attributes, as well as his shortcomings.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
CMU, like other schools, also offers one- to four-week courses in leadership
for working executives, often on individualized topics, through its Executive
Education Center.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sometimes an executive gets so embedded in what he's doing day to
day, he needs to step back and say, 'Is this the most objective or productive
way to manage this?' &quot; says program director Clark Jordan.<BR>
<BR>
Leadership studies aren't always tied to business: Robert Morris College
offers a program for teachers and professional trainers, the Master of Science
in Instructional Leadership.<BR>
<BR>
The degree, intended for educators who want to take a greater role within
their schools in the area of curriculum development and design, includes
courses in leadership, decision-making and written and oral communication.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Leadership is the ability to influence others,&quot; says Edward Nicholson,
president of Robert Morris, who likens learning how to lead to mastering
golf or a musical instrument.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can watch it on TV, but it usually won't improve your skills,&quot;
he says. What's needed, he says, is good instruction, constructive feedback
- and lots of practice.<BR>
<BR>
Leadership training isn't restricted to the graduate level; at least two
local colleges offer either classes or entire programs in leadership for
undergrads.<BR>
<BR>
At Robert Morris, for example, undergraduate business majors must take at
least two courses that emphasize the development of leadership skills -
that is, learning how to communicate well one-on-one and in small groups,
how to organize and motivate others, and how to formulate visions and develop
strategies.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, every undergraduate must take a series of five courses in oral
and written communication during freshman and sophomore years.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Leadership is essentially the ability to influence others,&quot; explains
Nicholson, &quot;and to a large extent, that's through the communication
process.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
At Chatham College, a women's college in Oakland, all students are encouraged
to participate in Chatham LEADS, a non-degree program that aims to develop
leadership skills and provide true practice in leading.<BR>
<BR>
The four-year program consists of workshops and seminars focusing on self-awareness
and leadership skill development as well as mentoring and internship opportunities
with local and national women leaders. Last year, for instance, a group
of students traveled to Ireland to study with Irish leaders. And this fall,
Chatham launched the Pennsylvania Center for Women in Public Leadership,
through which students will study leadership positions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My premise is, you lead if you're expected to lead,&quot; says Chatham
President Esther Barazzone, &quot;but a lot of women aren't expected to
lead.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Women need to become aware early on of their potential, says Barazzone,
or they may not develop that expectation. They also need to become conscious
of barriers they face.<BR>
 <BR>
Leadership training is particular- ly important for women, notes Barazzone,
because it helps them learn how to deal with what she sees as &quot;public
resistance to women in leadership positions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;An openly strong woman is not always welcomed as that,&quot; she says.
&quot;Leadership training is a way of keeping their confidence high and
strengthening their effectiveness.&quot;<BR>

</FONT></I><FONT size =+1>IEmployers Find Ways to Make Insurers<BR>
Put Their Money Where Their Mouth Is<BR>
</B></FONT><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Employers shopping the managed care market for a healthcare provider
have encountered a problem: With competition so fierce, insurers are jumping
all over themselves promising to meet the healthcare needs of corporations
and their employees.<BR>
<BR>
That doesn't sound like such a bad problem - but in the fervor of the sell,
managed care companies may promise more than they can deliver. In healthcare,
that can be downright dangerous. Enter, the performance guarantee.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Employers need to ensure that [the managed care company] is not buying
their business,&quot; says Maureen Londino, a principal with Buck Consultants.
&quot;They have a better chance if they can put the appropriate protocols
in place and build some kind of performance guarantees. They have to define
all this up front, and then hold them accountable.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The first thing to question is whether the managed care company has the
network of providers in place to service your employees. Employers must
check that the network has the right geographic placement of doctors, hospitals
and other providers. They should also make sure the doctors are taking on
new patients, so that employees are assured access to them.<BR>
<BR>
If the proper network isn't in place, however, don't immediately discount
that insurer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sometimes the network will agree to expand access and will negotiate
with the provider,&quot; says Londino. &quot;In fact, some may even put
dollars at risk, for example, $100,000, if the networks aren't in place
by a specific date.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
According to Londino, networks now cover most of the region. But that's
not always been the case. &quot;Two years ago, there was a problem with
access in West Virginia, but corporations negotiated with managed care companies,
who built the networks.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Other often-negotiated elements revolve around financial arrangements, according
to Towers Perrin consultant David Lagnese.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The old days where everything is fully insured are long gone,&quot;
says Lagnese. &quot;There's a lot of variation in plan design among employers.&quot;
Banks, for instance, might want to delay payment, whereas a utility might
want more predictability in their billing scheme. Negotiating points often
include the capitation arrangements with providers, as well as how various
bonuses are paid to providers. Another area for big employers to explore
is whether or not they will share in volume discounts with suppliers, such
as pharmacy charges.<BR>
<BR>
Also popular are performance guarantees that put some part of the administrative
fee (generally in the range of 50 to 100 percent) at risk if the managed
care company doesn't meet targets set in the areas of claims, customer service
and response. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The managed care company comes in and projects what the covered claims
cost will be - and it generally should be 5 percent either way,&quot; says
Londino. &quot;But they can put the numbers on and then not manage the business
and have a 25 percent difference.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Other areas in which standards are often set are in claims turnaround -
Londino says it should be under 10 days, &quot;or there's a problem.&quot;
Some contracts establish how out-of-network claims will be responded to,
as well.<BR>
<BR>
Member services is another area of concern. The rule of thumb is that a
hotline call be answered in 30 seconds. And look at that carefully, says
Londino, because some companies may use answering machines to maintain the
answering time in heavy calling periods. A 15 percent abandonment rate -
when the phone isn't answered so the caller hangs up - is often a contractual
point.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The benefits may be richer, so there's some concern on the part of
employers that they're giving away savings. Managed care is supposed to
be more efficient and these arrangements ensure that,&quot; says Lagnese.
<BR>
<BR>
While these guarantees are generally written as multiyear agreements (two
to four years) that allow for some kind of settling up at the end of the
specified period, Londino recommends asking for monthly administrative reports,
and having quarterly meetings with the insurer to make sure problems are
being addressed. Once a year, invite an outside auditor in to make sure
the contract is being honored. Londino says some companies don't monitor
or recapture these savings, which can be up to 20 percent of healthcare
costs.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, these negotiations seem to be reserved for large employers.
Small companies, insuring under 1,000 lives, generally buy an off-the-shelf
managed care product, so have less leeway. Still, it's good business to
monitor and partner with the insurer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;To some extent, employers need to be realistic - if they push too
hard the company may say they can do something when they really can't, so
the plan is poorly administered and the employer is unhappy,&quot; says
Londino. &quot;If they work in partnership, they have a more successful
long-term relationship. And on the flip side, if a managed care company
does better than the targets, the employer may want to build in performance
incentives, and split the gain.&quot; <BR>

<P><HR><B>Cut From a Different Mold Than His Predecessors, New    University
of Pittsburgh Chancellor Mark Nordenberg Referees Swim Meets, Shops for
Groceries and Picks Up the Family Laundry;<BR>
Many Think He's the Right Man for Pitt<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
Mark Nordenberg celebrated with friends the day he got the biggest break
of his 23-year career, the day &quot;interim&quot; was dropped from his
title as chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh. But he didn't toast
his good fortune at a fancy restaurant or a swanky club. Not even at the
corner bar. <BR>
<BR>
Instead, at the end of that fine June day, he did what he does countless
summer nights: He acted as a referee for his 13-year-old son's swim meet.
At the end of the meet, another parent unexpectedly pulled out a magnum
of champagne and the grown-ups toasted Nordenberg with plastic cups and
joked around.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;People feel like they're part of Mark's success,&quot; says Nordenberg's
 wife Nikki. &quot;It's a very Pittsburgh thing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Now so is Nordenberg, head of a university that in recent years was stung
by charges that the chancellor's office had become rife with cronyism and
arrogance. That's hardly the case with Nordenberg, a 48-year-old,      boyish-looking
chief executive who     many describe as a regular guy. He's a law professor
whose true love is teaching. A committed husband and father who juggles
the demands of a dual-career family and teenage kids.<BR>
<BR>
This is a guy who picks up the laundry, shops for groceries and hand-writes
notes in his Christmas cards - hundreds of them. A guy so regular that some
of the perks of the job - like living in the chancellor's sprawling residence
just off the Oakland campus - seem a bit too much for him.<BR>
&quot;I like to be in a place where you naturally run into your kids on
the way to the bathroom,&quot; <BR>
Nordenberg says in what he calls his &quot;drawn-out Midwest-ern drawl.&quot;
He picked that up in Duluth, Minn., where he was born and spent most of
his childhood, in a tight-knit family from Swedish roots.<BR>
<BR>
Growing up in Duluth, Nordenberg cheered on the St. Louis Cardinals because
- simply put - his father did. &quot;I was a typical oldest child,&quot;
he says. &quot;What my dad liked, I liked.&quot; <BR>
His mother was a high school English teacher, and he was a serious student
who regularly made the honor roll and ran cross-country track. He was forced
to leave his hometown the summer before his senior year in high school when
his father, a U.S. Steel Corp. executive, was transferred to Pittsburgh.<BR>
 <BR>
The family loved Pittsburgh and the move drew them closer, so much so that
when Nordenberg graduated from North Allegheny High School, he chose to
attend Thiel College in Greenville to be near them. Ironically, his father
was transferred to Chicago two years after the family came to Pittsburgh.
Nordenberg's teachers encouraged him to stick with science, so he majored
in math at Thiel. But after a couple of years he began contemplating the
career in law that later landed him back in Pittsburgh.<BR>
<BR>
His father, Alan, was not pleased to hear of his interest in law, and told
Nordenberg to think twice about it. &quot;He looked at me and said, 'I hope
you thought carefully about all the opportunities you are leaving behind
in science,' &quot; Nordenberg recalls. <BR>
<BR>
About that time, Nordenberg met Nikki Pirillo on a bug-collecting biology
field trip at Thiel. She was a 17-year-old freshman. He was a more seasoned
man, a 19-year-old sophomore. The two married in 1970, the year both graduated,
Nikki six months early. <BR>
<BR>
After graduating with honors from the University of Wisconsin Law School,
Nordenberg joined a firm in Minneapolis in 1973. He was offered a position
in the Watergate prosecution but turned it down, largely because he did
not want to move at that time. The decision left him pondering &quot;the
power of personal inertia,&quot; the lure of the familiar that could keep
one from growing and trying new things in the course of a career. So after
just two years of practicing law, he decided to try teaching. &quot;I really
thought I should see if this form of life would be more rewarding,&quot;
he says. <BR>
<BR>
He joined the faculty of the Capital University Law School in Columbus,
Ohio, in 1975. Two years later, he returned to Pittsburgh - hired by a Pitt
law dean named John E. Murray Jr. - and never left. He's Pitt's 17th chancellor.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Trusted and Respected</B><BR>
<BR>
Libby Jacaszek worked under seven deans as an administrative assistant at
Pitt's law school before retiring last spring. Nordenberg's strong work
ethic still stands out in her mind. One Saturday morning when he needed
her help sending out a Federal Express package, he tracked her down by calling
her cousin.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He's a person of determination,&quot; she says. <BR>
<BR>
Others agree. In fact, Nordenberg's enthusiasm for teaching earned him the
nickname &quot;Sparky Nordenberg&quot; among his students in the early 1980s.
Murray, now president of Duquesne University, gave Nordenberg a job as a
visiting assistant law professor at Pitt in 1977. At the time, Murray periodically
watched professors in the classroom and critiqued their teaching. He will
never forget the first time he watched Nordenberg.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After that hour, he came into my office and said, 'What do you think?'
and I said, 'I never really want to see you teach again because you are
an excellent teacher.' Some people are born to teach, and Mark is one of
them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nordenberg began teaching specialty civil procedure, the rules that govern
how cases move through civil court. In 1983, he was named a full professor.
A year later, law students voted to give him the Excellence-in-Teaching
Award. The next year, he received the Chancellor's Distin-guished Teaching
Award.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He was almost intellectually intimidating,&quot; recalls Brian Himmel,
a 1992 magna cum laude graduate of Pitt's law school who was in Norden-berg's
civil procedure class in 1990. <BR>
&quot;It wasn't because he put on airs or anything,&quot; Himmel says. &quot;You
could just tell how much he knew.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Some law professors humiliate students using the Socratic method of teaching,
embarrassing them in front of their peers if they can't break down a case.
But the tone in Nordenberg's class was more friendly, and he never seemed
to deliberately belittle anyone, Himmel says. In fact, he would patiently
try to explain an answer if a student didn't seem to understand.<BR>
 <BR>
Nordenberg did, however, keep the students on their toes by posing long,
detailed questions - often rocking slightly as he recited the background
- capped off by the name of the student he was addressing. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;He wouldn't say your name until the end,&quot;  Himmel says. &quot;When
you heard your name, you would feel this pain go through your body.&quot;
When Himmel graduated, he was shocked when, as Nordenberg handed him his
diploma, Nordenberg commented on how well Himmel had done in tax courses.
&quot;That he knew about that and realized it was me surprised me,&quot;
Himmel says.<BR>
<BR>
Nordenberg's affection for people lies at the heart of his love for teaching.
&quot;There probably is nothing more noble than being involved in the development
of human potential, which is at the heart of teaching at any level,&quot;
the chancellor says. He treasures the moments when former students return
or bump into him and tell him how much they learned in his classes, &quot;how
someone might have grown over the course of a semester or year.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But there is a pattern to Nor-   denberg's career at Pitt. Every time he
got comfortable in the classroom, someone asked him to take on an administrative
job. In 1985, he was named associate dean for academic affairs and then
interim dean of the law school. Two years later, he became dean on a permanent
basis, a post he held until 1993. He then turned his attention to teaching
again and, a few weeks later, was asked to take on another interim job,
this time as provost. He had returned to teaching yet again when former
Chancellor J. Dennis O'Connor announced plans to step down under fire and
board of trustees Chairman J. Wray Connolly approached Nordenberg in the
summer of 1995 about taking on the role of acting chancellor.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was minding my own business and putting my faculty life back in
order,&quot; Nordenberg says. But those days are over for now. Nordenberg
will be lucky to fit guest lecturing around his new priorities, which include
growing Pitt's endowment, cultivating alumni, convincing state legislators
to fund the school at an adequate level and maintaining enrollment levels.<BR>
<BR>
His track record as dean of the Pitt law school lays a good foundation.
At the law school, Nordenberg built alliances with law alumni and the community.
He attended the annual Bench-Bar Conference at Seven Springs Resort, a weekend
of schmoozing that academic types usually avoid. He gave speeches to law
firms and corporate legal departments and served on countless committees
and commissions, some of which revised civil court rules.<BR>
<BR>
Pat Sorek, a 1984 Pitt law graduate who is a clerk for U.S. District Judge
Robert Cindrich, was working for the U.S. Justice Department in Washing-ton,
D.C., when he met Nordenberg at alumni receptions held in the capital. &quot;He
was just great, the way he could talk to people and work the crowd,&quot;
Sorek says. &quot;He was your prototypical ambassador.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Nordenberg also developed an alumni giving program that was extremely successful,
says Marvin Lieber, a '58 Pitt law graduate and partner with Lieber, Lieber
and Tarantine in Pittsburgh. &quot;His outreach is very important because
it gave him the opportunity to listen to a number of constituencies that
aren't the faculty alone,&quot; Lieber says. &quot;He continues to do that
type of outreach.&quot;<BR>
One incident that caused controversy during Nordenberg's tenure as dean
involved S. Candice Hoke, a professor who sued the university in federal
court after she was denied tenure. The sex discrimination lawsuit charges
that some senior male faculty members in the law school consistently voted
against the tenure of feminists they viewed as outspoken. The suit says
Nordenberg &quot;seriously misrepresented'' Hoke's qualifications in a letter
to the provost and that Nordenberg later wrote to recent law school graduates
who supported Hoke's decision to sue and threatened &quot;not to certify
them as morally fit to be admitted into the state bar.'' Nordenberg was
not named as a defendant.<BR>
<BR>
The university says the decision to deny Hoke tenure was based on weaknesses
in Hoke's professional performances, not gender. Pitt says in the spring
of 1992 - when Hoke says her tenure was denied due to gender - two of the
three law faculty members who received tenure were women. <BR>
Nordenberg's friends, meanwhile, say his concern for others and an ability
to listen carefully, analyze information and present a reasoned solution
make him a trusted adviser.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When it was time to make important decisions in my career, I always
talked to him,&quot; says Ken Gormley, now a law professor at Duquesne who
started teaching at Pitt in 1982. Nordenberg became a friend and colleague
who was always willing to stop by and help out.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You just knew that when you sat down and talked to him, he was listening
and whatever he said was going to be his honest opinion,&quot; Gormley says.<BR>
<BR>
Link Christin, a 1979 Pitt law graduate, says, &quot;He has a sort of a
judicial quality about him, a wisdom that is older than his years.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Even current Pitt students find Nordenberg appealing. Senior Andrew Wuertele
had only met Nordenberg once when he saw him walking out of the student
bookstore last year. Wuertele explained he was considering running for the
president of Pitt's student government and would like to talk about it.
&quot;He said, 'Yes, come along, walk along with me. Tell me what's on your
mind,' &quot; says Wuertele, who later ran for the office and won. &quot;It
showed so much respect for me as a student.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>His Father's Influence</B><BR>
<BR>
Since his father died of cancer three years ago at the age of 73, Nordenberg
has realized the power of his example. Like Nordenberg, his father worked
hard - he was usually the first to arrive at the office in the morning -
and honored institutional loyalty. &quot;He was a person who I think placed
an extremely high value on treating people with respect, recognizing and
rewarding their contributions and attempting to work with people to improve
performance,&quot; Nordenberg says. &quot;I do think all those things are
also very important to me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Some have noticed that at Pitt, where Nordenberg is known for sending handwritten
notes to colleagues. H.J. &quot;Jerry&quot; Zoffer, who recently stepped
down as dean of Pitt's Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, says
he got about three notes from Nordenberg in a single month. <BR>
&quot;It's not the kind of thing you expect from someone as busy as him,&quot;
Zoffer says. &quot;You feel he has nothing else to do but concern himself
with those kinds of acts of kindness.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
Another faculty member who has never met Nordenberg was pleasantly surprised
when she got a note from him after reading about her involvement in a workshop.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Nordenberg finds the time, just as his father did. Ironically, all three
of the senior Nordenberg's children went into law.<BR>
<BR>
Nordenberg's sister, Lynn Crenney, who is a year younger, is a partner at
Wilder Mahood and Crenney in Pittsburgh. His brother, Jon, who is five years
younger, is an attorney in Madison, Wis.  <BR>
Today Nordenberg's family re-mains as important to him as anything.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nothing in life has been more satisfying than being a father,&quot;
he says. &quot;I probably would give up everything if that was the price
required to maintain our relationship as a family.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The couple's 22-year-old daughter, Erin, recently graduated from Kenyon
College in Ohio. Carl, 16, attends Central Catholic High School, and Michael,
13, attends the Falk School at Pitt. Nikki is a partner in a career counseling
and consulting business. Most of her work involves counseling members of
the Allegheny County Bar Association about work issues, sometimes a desire
to leave law. <BR>
<BR>
As Nordenberg settled into the new job, the family was wistful about leaving
their five-bedroom home in Regent Square, which they are renting out to
a visiting faculty member, and moving into the chancellor's residence on
Devonshire Street.<BR>
<BR>
The imposing mansion has four floors, including the basement, and is easily
three times bigger than the house the Nordenbergs lived in for the past
13 years. Sure, Sophie, the family's mixed-breed dog, and Snake, a 5-foot-long
king snake, will be there, but as Nordenberg puts it, &quot;major areas
of the house are more suitable for professional entertaining than roughhousing
with my sons.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Still, Nikki is committed to making the new house a home. The Ping-Pong
table she got Nordenberg for his birthday goes in the basement rec room.
The kids will no longer be allowed to keep televisions in their rooms for
fear they will never be seen again. The Nordenbergs hope putting the television
in a second-floor living room will force togetherness, a challenge in any
family with teenagers. <BR>
  <BR>
The family usually eats dinner together, though some nights are reserved
for the children's activities. The Nordenbergs have volunteered at Michael's
swim meets for several years. Nordenberg has coached several of Carl's soccer
and baseball teams. He and Carl have played Rotisserie League baseball together
for years despite consistently finishing in the bottom half.<BR>
<BR>
The family has adjusted fairly easily to Nordenberg's new job, Nikki says.
After all, Nordenberg has been working seven days a week for years. On weekdays,
he's usually at his desk at around 6 a.m. and home by about 7 p.m. On the
weekends, he slacks off a little, getting into the office at about 6:30
a.m. and home by lunch.<BR>
<BR>
Nordenberg laments that the university is too often viewed in impersonal
terms as a big, complex place. The chancellor's cavernous office, Room 107
at the end of a dimly lit catacomb-like hallway in the Cathedral of Learning,
still has its charms, though. Nordenberg knocks on a wood panel and laughs,
saying his son is convinced there must be a secret compartment somewhere.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In fact, the university is home to tens of thousands of wonderful
human beings, faculty, staff and students who make important contributions
on a daily basis and who are individually good citizens and neighbors,''
Nordenberg says. &quot;I would like more of that to show through and be
 appreciated.&quot; <BR>
He will, no doubt, try to do his part. Sending out notes and remembering
faces and names. Pulling into his parking spot in the predawn darkness.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;He knows this university,&quot; says Edward Sell, a member of Pitt's
faculty since 1947 and the dean of Pitt's law school from 1966 to 1977.
&quot;If anybody can pull this off, he has the capability  to do it.&quot;<BR>
<H3><CENTER>Meanwhile, at Duquesne, Murray Settles In<BR>
-Deanna Gentile Marra</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Duquesne University's board of trustees recently broke a 118-year-old tradition.
The university normally renews its president's contract annually. But this
summer, the board offered a five-year contract to President John E. Murray
Jr. who, since 1988, has had his contract renewed on a year-to-year basis.<BR>
<BR>
Why the sudden change of heart? In large part because of Murray's fund-raising
prowess and how it has allowed him to transform Duquesne into a top institution.
You may remember that ER featured Murray as the cover story one year ago
this month. But Duquesne's board of trustees noticed his success long before
ER did.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The board could not be more pleased with the leadership of President
Murray over the last eight years,&quot; says Richard L. White, chairman
of Duquesne's board of trustees. &quot;It is an amazing effort that has
brought Duquesne national and international acclaim as one of the leading
Catholic universities in America and the world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Murray is often thought of as the man who saved Duquesne from serious enrollment,
financial and morale problems. During his tenure, Duquesne's enrollment
has increased by 46 percent, the curriculum has expanded to include 80 new
academic programs, and the campus has been rebuilt to make Duquesne one
of the top universities in terms of computerization, multi-media and distance
learning. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think it was basically the concept of stability and continuity,
and a continuation of all the foundations we have been building over the
last eight years,&quot; Murray says of his five-year extension. &quot;Another
piece of this is that our capital campaign will finish in 1999 and, therefore,
it would be appropriate to finish that capital campaign before leaving as
president.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Murray made his mark as a fund-raiser extraordinaire in 1988, when he revitalized
a dead capital campaign that had a goal of $25 million. At that campaign's
completion, a total of $74 million was raised. <BR>
<BR>
The latest capital campaign has a goal of $100 million. So far, more than
$84 million has rolled in.<BR>
&quot;The most important ingredient in the entire capital campaign is scholarships,&quot;
says Murray. &quot;If we want to remain on the cutting edge of computerization
- multi-media, distance learning - the state-of-the-art equipment that you
buy today becomes primitive within three years, so you have to keep replacing
that. We need support for the technology we have integrated into the campus
and will continue to advance with over the next five years. On top of that,
we need support for the kind of research that goes on in a typical university.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Murray's plan for the next five years focuses primarily on making major
advancements in distance learning. &quot;Everybody now is a perpetual student
no matter what the discipline. Everybody has to continue to go to school,
and it's a lot easier if you're in Erie or Tokyo to go to school where you
are and be taught by highly qualified people in a place like Pittsburgh.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For example, distance learning has allowed Duquesne to offer a chemistry
course to students both at Duquesne and the University of Kansas simultaneously.
Earlier this summer, Murray taught a two-day seminar to approximately 65
executives here in Pittsburgh and at the same time to a group of executives
who tuned in from Houston. <BR>
<BR>
   Murray sees distance learning not only as the key to expanding both continuing
education programs and corporate education  programs well into the next
century, but also as a way of establishing branch campuses via cyberspace
through partnerships with other schools. <BR>
     What happens after the five-year contract expires? The 63-year-old
Murray says he has no plans to retire any time soon. <BR>
<BR>
     &quot;I don't think I'll ever retire,&quot; he says. &quot;I will continue
to teach as I will even next year in the school of law as a professor of
law, and I will continue to write my books and my articles.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
   With a chuckle he adds, &quot;I used <BR>
to say that I would like to be found dead in the library, slumped over books.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now I've changed that a little bit. Either that or slumped over a
computer screen.&quot;<BR>
<H3><CENTER>CMU's New GSIA DeanMixes a Corporate  Background With<BR>
Academic Experience<BR>
- Jim Urban</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Some of the more popular elective courses at Carnegie Mellon's Graduate
School of Industrial Administration are those that drill students in entrepreneurial
strategies. In simplest terms, the students learn how to start and build
their own businesses.<BR>
<BR>
Now, the new GSIA dean - former AT&amp;T Vice President Douglas M. Dunn
- says he's ready to take entrepreneurial education a step further at GSIA.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;How can we begin to bring the kind of material offered in these entrepreneurship
courses into our core material?&quot; Dunn asked rhetorically during an
interview in late July, shortly after he moved into his new office on CMU's
Oakland campus.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't want to treat entrepreneurship as a separate discipline, but
rather part of the core curriculum,&quot; Dunn says. &quot;We can help people,
as their careers develop and grow, have the ability to start a business
on their own and make intelligent decisions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Dunn, a Canadian-born 53-year-old, knows firsthand what entrepreneurial
thinking can do for a regional economy, having spent a number of years in
entrepreneurial hotbed Atlanta. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees
from Georgia Tech and taught there for two years. During a later stint in
Atlanta, he headed external relations for AT&amp;T's southern region, shaking
new hands every Monday at the Rotary Club luncheon.<BR>
<BR>
Can Pittsburgh follow Atlanta's lead? Dunn admits that one of the first
stories he heard about Pittsburgh was the &quot;brain drain&quot; - the
flight of young talent to other regions of the country. He says GSIA plays
a role in attempting to stem the tide.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My model is to support local businesses and local business opportunity,&quot;
Dunn says. &quot;I think that will be the magnet for not only stopping the
brain drain to the extent that it exists, but also serving as a point of
attraction for people coming in.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'd also like to do more good research into entrepreneurship. We want
to understand what business models are successful and why businesses succeed
or fail. These are good research subjects for our faculty. I'd like to see
more of that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
CMU's appointment of Dunn is in line with a national trend in which some
MBA schools are looking for deans outside of academia. Duquesne University
has former Westinghouse Electric executive and deputy U.S. Commerce Secretary
Thomas Murrin as dean of its A.J. Palumbo School of Business. Elsewhere,
the University of Maryland hired a one-time Wall Street heavyweight, former
First Boston CEO William Mayer to head its MBA program. Other schools, meanwhile,
including some top programs, have resisted the move to the corporate world
and remained within academia. An example is Harvard's appointment last year
of world-renowned manufacturing management professor Kim Bryce Clark as
dean of its business school.<BR>
In GSIA's case, CMU President Robert Mehrabian says Dunn has a unique mix
of both corporate and academic experience, which makes him a good fit for
GSIA. Dunn spent 26 years at AT&amp;T, his most recent position being vice
president of visual communications and multimedia strategy. And he has a
Ph.D. in business statistics from the University of Michigan, where he studied
quantitative methods under noted professor W. Allen Spivey.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Communication is one of his strongest characteristics,&quot; Spivey
says of Dunn. &quot;That's refreshing for someone who has a technical background.
People with technical backgrounds sometimes tend to speak in technical terms
and for many years thought they could stay off in their own domain talking
to each other. And what happens is that they tend to be dealt out of the
big hands.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Doug is free of that,&quot; Spivey says.<BR>
<BR>
Adds CMU President Robert Mehrabian: &quot;His knowledge of the business
world and his understanding of how universities can serve the needs of the
corporate world make him an excellent choice to head our world-class business
school.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER>Kalamazoo's Cook Takes Over at Allegheny<BR>
- Cynthia Bent</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
&quot;What attracted me to Allegheny College was the quality of the people,&quot;
says Richard Cook, who began his term as the new president of Allegheny
College in August. &quot;It's a very open and supportive environment. It
struck me so clearly that it seemed very much like the place that I wanted
to be.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Cook says he wants to continue the focus on the quality of the student experience,
capitalizing on the excellence of the staff and faculty at the Meadville
school while improving facilities. Following a $45 million capital campaign,
Allegheny is building a $15 million science center, with a   $12 million
sports and recreation center soon to come.<BR>
 <BR>
As far as academic direction, Cook wants to push for an integrated learning
experience, meshing academics with real life. He brings to Allegheny a background
of administering off-campus internship and international studies programs
for which Kalamazoo College of Michigan, his previous employer, was well-known.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Internships may play some part in that, some sort of service may play
an increasing role, and we need to carefully and deliberately look at increasing
international opportunities,&quot; says Cook. &quot;I don't intend to impose
any kind of blueprint on a   different place. But I think there        
are things from my past experience that I can bring to Allegheny that  
   will help increase the effectiveness of the program.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
He also emphasizes that the Pittsburgh area plays a major role in the life
of Allegheny College. Some 25 to 30 percent of the student body is recruited
from Greater Pittsburgh, and thousands of alumni populate the Pittsburgh
business community. Over a quarter of the board of trustees hails from Pittsburgh,
as well.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm enthusiastic about increasing the ties between Pittsburgh and
Allegheny,&quot; he says. &quot;I've already been to the city a couple of
times. I was very impressed - the people were personable and warm, and I
saw a lot of pride about the city. I'm looking forward to getting to know
Pittsburgh.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Cook leaves the position of provost at Kalamazoo College. He had been with
the school for 23 years, having risen through the chemistry department.
<BR>
<BR>
As provost there, he worked with the president to revamp the entire curriculum
and academic calendar. He also revamped the school's prominent study-abroad
program and recruited and hired more than 40 percent of the Kalamazoo faculty.
 <BR>
<BR>
Hunting for the Right Graduate Program? Here's a Sampling of Some Unique
Degrees<BR>
<BR>
While we are on the topic of education, here's a sampling of unique degrees
offered by the region's four-year colleges and universities. Some of the
programs have been around for years, while others are brand-new. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Among them:<BR>
<BR>
<B>CMU's Winning Pair</B><BR>
<BR>
At the top of the list are two programs offered at Carnegie Mellon University:
the Master of Science in Industrial Administration, or MSIA, and the Master
of Science in Public Policy and Management, or MS.<BR>
<BR>
The MSIA, offered at CMU's Graduate School of Industrial Admin-istration
(see the story about new GSIA Dean Douglas Dunn on page 22), is similar
to an MBA, only CMU adds a few twists.<BR>
The core curriculum covers quantitative managerial decision-making techniques;
business communication skills; tools for managing human resources and dealing
with organizational issues; and an overview of how the economic, political
and legal environments interface with business. <BR>
The GSIA faculty members have won wide acclaim - and three Nobel Prizes
- for ground-breaking research in organizational theory, artificial  intelligence,
operations research and corporate finance.<BR>
<BR>
The MS is offered at CMU's Heinz School, which traditionally leads     
professional programs in the             integration of analytic skills,
management competency  and technological sophistication. <BR>
Students develop broad-based, analytically rigorous, marketable and transferable
skills regardless of their particular substantive areas of interest.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Katz MBA</B><BR>
<BR>
A mile away from CMU, full-time MBA students at the University of Pittsburgh's
Katz School earn their degree in 11 months. That's only a year off from
work. <BR>
<BR>
About 40 percent of the 52.5 credits are electives, so the student can pretty
much choose to concentrate on one area or acquire a variety of skills.<BR>
<BR>
The student learns teamwork by going through the entire program as a member
of a group called a Learning Organization, or LO. Each LO sets its own rules,
forms smaller teams for projects and self-governs - just as a corporation
functions.<BR>
<BR>
Pitt also offers the MBA to part-time students, who usually finish in about
three years and do not have to quit their full-time job.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Duquesne and Bayer<BR>
</B><BR>
Further down Forbes Avenue is the Bayer School at Duquesne University, where
graduate students in the Environmental Science and Management program study
ever-developing environmental issues.<BR>
<BR>
The 42-credit curriculum emphasizes environmental sciences, but also includes
the necessary training in business and behavioral science and touches on
law and public policy. Practice in writing and related communication skills
is integrated throughout the program. Two internships - one in  industry
and the other in a regulatory agency - provide valuable practical experience.<BR>
<BR>
Qualified students who do not wish to pursue the degree may still seek enrollment
in particular classes that interest them.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Penn State</B><BR>
<BR>
Penn State is combining business education with science, too, offering a
new five-year, dual degree program in which students can earn a Ph.D. in
pharmacology while they also earn their MBA. Students conduct their Ph.D.
research during the day at Penn State's Milton S. Hershey Medical Center
in Hershey. They take their MBA classes at night and on weekends at Penn
State's <BR>
Harrisburg campus.<BR>
<BR>
The program is geared toward people who plan to work for small to mid-sized
biotechnology firms.<BR>
&quot;[Scientists] find themselves managing labs rather than working in
them,&quot; says Mel Billingsley, professor of pharmacology in the college
of medicine at the Hershey Medical Center. &quot;And as soon as they step
away from that design bench, they are immersed in very different kinds of
activities - scheduling, managing personnel, budgeting and coordinating
programs.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Point Park's IMBA</B><BR>
<BR>
Point Park College offers an International MBA that moves beyond the traditional
MBA by integrating the international dimension of modern business into the
program.<BR>
<BR>
One of the core courses is Cross-cultural Business Management, in which
students learn cross-cultural skills that help them function effectively
in multinational enterprises. <BR>
<BR>
The electives include International Advertising, International Accounting
Concepts and Multinational Human Resource Management.<BR>
<BR>
Working professionals can pursue the degree on a part-time basis. Students
need 39 credits to graduate.<BR>
<BR>
<B>La Roche's HR Program</B><BR>
<BR>
La Roche College offers a master's degree in human resources management,
combining  business administration with psychology, sociology, economics
and the law. The degree consists of 14 three-credit classes, with part-time
students usually finishing in under three years. The classes are held in
the evenings and on Saturdays.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Chatham</B><BR>
<BR>
A new addition to the curriculum at Chatham College is the Master of Liberal
Arts. The MLA program examines major works and ideas that express humankind's
continual efforts to understand the self, the family, the community, the
natural world and the universe.<BR>
<BR>
One course offered in the program this fall, entitled Seminar on Labor Issues,
includes an economic analysis of labor issues along with discussion of the
gender gap in the work force and the decline in union membership.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Geneva's MSOL</B><BR>
<BR>
Geneva College just added a Master of Science in Organizational Leadership
program after spending about three years developing the       curriculum.
The school interviewed scholars in leadership studies as well as corporate
leaders in developing the program.<BR>
<BR>
In 20 months, students can complete their master's degree, meeting one night
each week from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. at assorted class locations throughout
the Greater Pittsburgh area.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Other Good Ones</B><BR>
<BR>
At Waynesburg College, the 36-credit MBA program is designed to accommodate
both the part-time and full-time student.  Students in the MBA program may
elect to specialize in the criminal justice area. The MBA/Criminal Justice
option emphasizes the real world, real problems and real solutions for those
students concerned with crime and justice. The program also delivers managerial
and organizational skills essential to justice agency operations.<BR>
<BR>
Seton Hill College in Greensburg offers a graduate program in art therapy,
the process of putting what one feels into something one can see. For example,
an adult in a treatment program may keep to himself and seem lost in his
own thoughts. The art therapist helps the client express those thoughts
and communicate through art.<BR>
<BR>
Program director Josie Abbenante built the program from scratch. She came
to Seton Hill from the University of New Mexico, where she developed a similar
program that now is among the top five in the country.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The State Universities</B><BR>
<BR>
What the universities in the state system of higher education bring to the
table is quality graduate programs usually at less expense than the private
universities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>At Indiana University of Pennsylvania</B>, the MBA can be taken on either
a full-time or part-time basis, with day and evening classes available,
including a full schedule of course offerings in the summer. The program
has a strategic and international focus in its curriculum. The faculty members
have extensive academic, industrial and consulting experience and bring
a strong, real-world flavor to the IUP classrooms.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Executive Track of IUP's MBA, </B>located in the Pittsburgh and Johnstown
areas, is designed for experienced managers from industrial, financial,
nonprofit and small businesses as well as the public sector. A Saturday-only
class format allows participants to complete the degree in two years. <BR>
<BR>
<B>At California University of Pennsylvania,</B> meanwhile, full-time students
complete the MBA program in a little over one year, with part-time students
finishing is just over two years. California's MBA program takes the student
through advanced managerial skill development in the areas that significantly
affect modern business enterprises.<BR>
<BR>
<B>At Slippery Rock University, </B>a notable graduate offering is the Master
of Public Administration degree, available full- and part-time to students
wishing to advance through the public sector. The program probes administrative
problems and practices in the public sector, pushes for improvement in the
students' communications skills and drills them in quantitative and qualitative
research and analysis.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Undergraduate Options</B><BR>
<BR>
Are you trying to convince some of your employees to complete their undergraduate
degree? Carlow College offers the Carlow Accelerated Program. CAP features
intensive eight-week sessions (five sessions per year) of evening courses
leading to a Bachelor of Science degree in business management, health science
management or information management, among other degrees.<BR>
<BR>
It is possible for students to complete a degree in 18 months if they take
courses throughout the year.<BR>
<BR>
What about your children as they head into higher education? Allegheny College
in Meadville (see the story about Allegheny's new president on page 23)
offers an environmental management program in which undergrads spend their
first three years at the Meadville campus, followed by two years at Duke
University in Durham, N.C.  The student finishes with a bachelor's degree
from Allegheny and a master's from Duke. <BR>
<BR>
Westminster College in New Wilmington offers a bachelor's degree in international
business. The curriculum addresses the international aspects of business
while also focusing on foreign language and foreign culture. <BR>
<BR>
 While very few entry-level positions exist in international business, the
program is excellent preparation for aspiring MBAs and for employment opportunities
that may come five to 10 years down the line.<BR>
<BR>
At Robert Morris College, undergraduate business majors must display a proficiency
in communications  skills, including writing, speaking and cross-cultural
communication. The nine required communications courses were added to the
curriculum one year ago. The college had surveyed business leaders in the
region, who told the college that today's graduates lack writing, verbal
and critical thinking skills.<BR>
<BR>
At St. Vincent College in Latrobe, students at the Center for Northern Appalachian
Studies document the heritage of the multifaceted region of northern Appalachia
using the tools provided by a variety of disciplines and community-oriented
projects.<BR>

<B><FONT size=+1>Pennsylvania Capital Bank Showed There is a Market for
Private Banks; Almost Seven Years Later, Larger Banks Have Jumped Into the
Old European-Style Banking That Caters to the Wealthy<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
<I>By Christopher L:awton</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Meet Barb, a midlevel manager for a large manufacturing company.
She makes a better-than-average income of about $60,000 per year. Her husband,
John, makes his living as an elementary school teacher in one of Pittsburgh's
local school districts. He also makes a good income, about $38,000 per year.
The private banking industry, traditionally a staple of the very wealthy,
wants their business.<BR>
<BR>
Surprised? You shouldn't be. Many couples today who earn two incomes and
approach $100,000 in combined yearly income are prime candidates for private
banking, a growing niche in the banking industry. Private banking supplements
the basic services offered in consumer banking with services such as sophisticated
investment counseling and trust and estate planning.<BR>
<BR>
Private banking emerged in the late 1980s out of the less traditional trust
services that many banks provided for the extremely wealthy. It became the
best way for most banks to rebound from enormous losses suffered from pursuing
large corporate clients and institutional investors. With the recession
of the '80s, the banks faced falling interest rates and competition for
corporate loans from alternative investment sources such as investment bankers
and insurance companies. That forced the banks to attract a new segment
of customers.<BR>
<BR>
So Barb and John ... come on in.<BR>
<BR>
According to most experts in the industry, affluent customers are those
who make at least $100,000 in income as a family or on an individual basis.
Some are the extremely wealthy families of Pittsburgh's elite. But most
private banking customers come from other market segments. Many are entrepreneurs
- individuals who have recently started or have inherited the family business.
Others are attorneys, physicians and mid- and senior-level corporate executives.
Those customers who have recently received payments from 401(k) retirement
plans or who need estate and retirement planning help round out the list
of potential private banking customers.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to managing money and providing business banking services, private
banking facilitates the applications for jumbo mortgages - those exceeding
$250,000.<BR>
<BR>
Private banking has become a viable way for the banks to attract the wealth
of these customers - who still need traditional banking services as well.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Pittsburgh's Growth</B><BR>
<BR>
The private banking industry quickly became such a viable market nationwide
that banks such as Pittsburgh's Pennsylvania Capital Bank were founded for
the sole purpose of providing private banking services for an affluent customer
base. <BR>
<BR>
Pennsylvania Capital opened its doors in the Times Building on Fourth Avenue
downtown in September 1990. The bigger regional banks jumped into the fray
later.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We established Pennsylvania Capital Bank in Pittsburgh because of
the region's excellent small business market and affluent customer base,&quot;
says Donald Nolan, president of Pennsylvania Capital. &quot;Many of our
customers are the young business entrepreneurs, in their mid-30s to mid-50s,
who need help with lending, investing and business planning.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Nolan argues that he feels Pennsylvania Capital Bank is better suited to
fulfill the needs of private banking customers than many of its larger competitors.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We specialize in private banking products and services, period,&quot;
Nolan says. &quot;Other banks that sell traditional services aren't as focused.
They're more like generalists who can offer a diverse product to a wider
array of customers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The bigger banks say, &quot;Not so fast.&quot; Their size, larger banks
say, provides resources that smaller banks can't tap when it comes to serving
the private banking market.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We bring all of the bank's cultures together for the benefit of our
private banking customers,&quot; says Joseph Guyaux, senior vice president
and manager of PNC Private Bank. &quot;We bring the management of investment
performance, traditional banking needs, and matters of trust and estate
planning together under one roof. The private banking customer then has
these services coordinated by a private banker who directly oversees the
client's financial goals.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
PNC and other banks such as Mellon and National City also have an exceptional
breadth of investment experience and capital assets to offer. PNC has been
managing money for its customers for 178 years and is the 19th-largest investment
manager in the nation. Mellon Bank has also been a long-standing lending
institution and a major bank holding company with over $30 million in assets.
<BR>
<BR>
In the last two years, Mellon made two key acquisitions: The Boston Co.,
currently Mellon's premier mortgage provider, and Dreyfus Financial, which
handles mutual funds and nonbanking investments. &quot;All of these services
give our private banking customers the widest array of competitive products,&quot;
says David Kutch, senior vice president of Mellon's Private Bank. <BR>
<BR>
The latest entry into private banking is National City-Pennsylvania. Following
the acquisition of Integra, National City moved quickly to bring private
banking to western Pennsylvania. Steve Hartle, executive vice president
for National City's Private Bank, has the responsibility for initiating
National City's private banking push through the end of this year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our goal is to bring banking services to traditional trust services,&quot;
says Hartle. &quot;This mixture broadens and deepens the relationship we
have with our private banking customers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
 Hartle feels that private banking customers want and demand a high degree
of responsiveness, and he's right. Some say that is what private banking
is all about.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our customers want to work with a knowledgeable professional who understands
their needs, and they appreciate having a primary contact at the bank who
provides quality products and superior service,&quot; Hartle says.<BR>
<BR>
Private banking customers require more sophisticated types of products than
their traditional banking counterparts. And, unlike convenience banking
customers, private banking customers want to deal with a person, not just
an institution. In other words, they perform a lot of their banking in the
bank.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;We get to know our customers on a personal level, so that we can make
the best choices for them in terms of the products and services we offer,&quot;
says Pennsylvania Capital's Nolan.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Pennsylvania Capital</B><BR>
<BR>
The mere existence and growth of Pennsylvania Capital shows there is a market
for private banking in Pittsburgh. It had been 15 years since a bank in
Pittsburgh had started from scratch when Pennsylvania Capital began operations
in 1990. With $110 million in assets and 1995 posted earnings of $1 million,
Pennsylvania Capital has demonstrated in a short period of time that it
is a player.<BR>
<BR>
And although Pennsylvania Capital doesn't have the lengthy history or combination
of traditional services that many of the larger banks in town have, it boasts
an impressive asset ratio and diverse products, many of which mirror those
offered by larger banks.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most of the larger banks gear their cash management services to large
Fortune 500 companies,&quot; says Judy R. Murtha, a vice president who oversees
the cash management services at Pennsylvania Capital. &quot;We offer these
services to middle-market companies who quite often are amazed that we're
willing to help them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pennsylvania Capital Bank's  Capital Cash Service gives customers detail
or summary balance information on all activity occuring in their account
the previous business day, with up to 60 days of history.  It can also provide
information on accounts maintained at other institutions. The information
can be accessed by personal computer or telephone. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our cash management services enable Pennsylvania Capital to provide
an in-depth financial analysis of a business and/or an individual,&quot;
says Murtha, adding that for those who prefer to deal directly with their
local bank, Cash Concentration Service allows daily consolidation of all
of an individual's accounts into one concentration account at Pennsylvania
Capital Bank.  <BR>
<BR>
&quot;This service gives our customer added flexibility by consolidating
their funds quickly and easily,&quot; says Murtha. &quot;And with our Electronic
Debit/Credit Service, customers can pay bills, perform direct payroll deposits
or collect member dues.&quot; <BR>
 <BR>
Pennsylvania Capital matches the larger banks by offering sweep accounts,
which enable companies to automatically invest any excess collected checking
account balances into several different investment vehicles, including a
tax-free money market fund, a regular money market fund, a money market
trust, a treasury obligations fund or a prime obligations fund.<BR>
<BR>
Pennsylvania Capital also allows companies to borrow up to 97 percent of
their receivables, eliminating or narrowing cash-flow problems.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When the majority of our customers hear about this service, they think
that it's too good to be true,&quot; says William E. Koeberlein, another
Pennsylvania Capital vice president. &quot;But they quickly see how lucrative
it is for them, and Pittsburgh has proved to be one of the best markets.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Private banking is one of the highest growth services in the banking industry
today. Some scoff that it is a service just for the wealthy, but those same
individuals may be surprised to know that they're already a part of the
growing segment of affluent private banking customers. Or potential candidates
in the near future.<BR>

<P><HR><B>A Developer Partnering With the Rooneys is From Connecticut, an
Indication of How Aggressive Some Outside Developers are Being in the Pittsburgh
Market; But What <BR>
About the Local Developers?<BR>
<BR>
By Vince Gagetta<BR>
</B><HR>Alex Conroy, owner of the Conroy Cos. of Greenwich, Conn., can credit
his skills as a salesman as much as his reputation of being a heavy hitter
in real estate development for winning the coveted contract to develop the
area near Three Rivers Stadium for the Rooney family. <BR>
<BR>
Why was Conroy selected for the job?  Because, Art Rooney II says, he did
what all good salesmen do: He asked for the order. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Frankly, we didn't seek him out, he approached us,&quot; says Rooney,
a Pittsburgh attorney and the Steelers' vice president.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is, Conroy approached the Rooneys regarding another project, not
even in Pittsburgh, which the Steelers' owners were not interested in pursuing.
But they were - and had been for some time - more interested in doing something
about turning the barren wastelands and dreary warehouses near the stadium
into something more appealing and commercially viable. As long as Conroy
- presumably with very impressive resume in hand - was in town and pitching,
why not run the North Side project up the flagpole? <BR>
 <BR>
Why not, indeed? And so a choice local commercial development plum got plucked
by an out-of-town firm while some of Pittsburgh's biggest, best and brightest
developers watched with, in many cases, undisguised envy. <BR>
<BR>
It's not that Pittsburgh companies will be shut out of the proposed $600
million project to construct a multi-use sports, retail and entertainment
complex on land west of the stadium. As Rooney notes: &quot;I don't think
the decision to use Conroy as the developer on the project eliminates the
possibility of involving local developers at some point. The potential is
there, and there are a lot of very fine local companies that could play
key roles in the project. They have the capabilities to participate, certainly.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But Conroy will be lead developer.<BR>
 <BR>
Calling in big guns from out of town to handle very large, very public and
very prestigious Pittsburgh area projects is nothing new. It has happened
often enough throughout the various Pittsburgh renaissances to give some
locals the modest beginnings of inferiority complexes.<BR>
It is likely to continue. Even the largest local firms maintain a regional
focus and few have even ventured on to the national scene. Conroy's company,
on the other hand, has had extensive national experience and currently is
involved in similar projects in Rhode Island and Virginia. <BR>
The Connecticut developer also impressed the Rooneys by bringing something
more to the party than his development skills: the Nordstroms. Conroy had
already worked with the Seattle, Wash.,  family - owners of what is reputed
to be the finest, most customer-sensitive and most sought-after retail store
chain in the nation.  Both Conroy's Rhode Island and Virginia projects include
Nordstrom stores, and his involvement in the Three Rivers Stadium project
was seen as the key to convincing the Nordstroms that there was no finer
place in the land for their next store than Pittsburgh's North Side - the
wishes of Mayor Tom Murphy and the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership notwithstanding.<BR>
<BR>
Although the Rooneys and the Nordstroms have known each other for years
- Steelers' President Dan Rooney was chairman of the NFL's Expansion Committee
in 1974, the year the Seattle Seahawks, of which the Nordstroms were then
majority owners, joined the league. Since then, the Rooneys on numerous
occasions have tried to convince their friends the Nordstroms to expand
their 80-plus-store chain by building one  near Three Rivers Stadium. But
it was not until Conroy entered the picture that the Seattle family realized
what a smart move it would be. Art Rooney II credits Conroy with being the
principal reason that Nordstrom agreed to participate in the local undertaking.
<BR>
<B>Connections Count<BR>
</B><BR>
The formal announcement of the Three Rivers project was made on July 17,
one day after Mine Safety Appliances Co. announced it intended to develop
the property it owns in Cranberry, Butler County, into an office park. The
company plans to subdivide the property, sell parcels and construct buildings
suitable to the buyers' needs. <BR>
<BR>
MSA - like the Rooney family, long and very positively identified with Pittsburgh
- did not immediately announce the developer of the project. But a company
spokesperson emphasizes that MSA is looking for a prominent developer with
national connections as a joint-venture partner. And several people closely
associated with local commercial development activities say they think the
&quot;national connections&quot; requirement will eliminate many Pittsburgh
developers from realistic consideration.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It looks like another invitation for the big guns to come in and show
the locals how things are done,&quot; one observes.<BR>
<BR>
There are those who claim that Pittsburgh developers tend to be too narrowly
focused, too conservative and perhaps too set in their ways to keep national
firms from walking off with the most profitable local projects or from venturing
further afield  themselves.<BR>
<BR>
There are good reasons why local developers have become so conservative.
Everyone acknowledges that the Pittsburgh area is not a prime development
area. Most of the choice, reasonably level sites, especially those in close
proximity to the city, disappeared from the market decades ago. There is
hardly any property available here where a developer can put up a building
or two without either demolishing existing structures or going through the
considerable expense of leveling hills.<BR>
 <BR>
That, says Tony Dunn, president of the Kossman Realty Co. unit of Kossman
Development Co., could be too great a challenge for some local developers.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is a tendency around here for us to look at a typical piece
of Pittsburgh land and see a big hill that makes the site unacceptable for
development, while some more adventuresome developers apparently see an
opportunity to bulldoze away the hill to create a valuable and desirable
building site,&quot; Dunn says.<BR>
<BR>
The adventurers, Dunn thinks, tend to be from out of town. At a recent meeting
in Las Vegas of the International Council of Shopping Centers, a group that
includes developers, property owners and retailers, Dunn was surprised to
see a developer promoting potential sites in the Pittsburgh market.<BR>
The developer, a Texas company, has tied down properties in the northern,
southern and western suburbs that - according to the company's brochure
- are ripe for development. &quot;Apparently, that company sees something
in our own backyard that most of the rest of us have not seen or have chosen
to ignore,&quot; Dunn says. <BR>
<BR>
That speaks to the vision - or lack thereof - of many long-established local
development firms, Dunn says, adding,&quot;Local developers here are very
conservative, even the biggest ones. We don't seem to have the energy or
the vision any longer to pursue many projects, particularly the more challenging
ones. We're focusing on our own properties, trying to keep them filled,
and not taking on new projects.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kossman Development, like all other local developers Dunn knows, will no
longer build an office or commercial building on speculation as they would
just a few years ago. &quot;We won't even think of breaking ground unless
we have a very firm commitment - and by that I mean a long-term commitment
in the form of a lease of at least 15 years from someone who will occupy
most of the building,&quot; he says. &quot;And the committed tenant must
have an impeccable credit rating. That's the way - the only way - we do
business in the 1990s.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Playing With Fire<BR>
</B><BR>
The reasons for such an approach are readily apparent. Banks, insurance
companies and other lenders have adopted extremely cautious - some say negative
- attitudes about lending money for commercial real estate development projects,
having been hit severely during the 1980s hell-bent-for-leather development
years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're saying 'no' and asking questions later,&quot; remarks the
head of one small local development company, who asked not to be identified
because he does not want to appear to be criticizing anyone he might approach
for a loan anytime soon. &quot;They're asking themselves, 'What would the
people who ran Westinghouse Credit do with this loan application?' and then
doing the opposite. And who can blame them?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Tight financing, along with labor and other operating costs that continue
to be high in comparison with surrounding areas and nearby states, has made
Pittsburgh &quot;a market that hasn't got growth built into it, it seems,&quot;
Kossman's Dunn says. &quot;Most people around here are taking a wait-and-see
attitude.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That is certainly the case when it comes to the development of new downtown
office space. Not only are locally based conservative developers shying
away from such projects, but the supposedly more adventuresome and wealthy
national firms are taking a pass on them as well. That is hardly likely
to change anytime soon, everyone contacted for this article agrees, and
certainly not before there is some vigorous upward movement in Class A rental
rates.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Given the current high construction and financing costs, any new Class
A space downtown would have to go for around $30 a square foot,&quot; says
Warren Kimball, president of Kimball Properties Inc. &quot;That is well
over the current market, which is at about the mid-20s. I don't see it happening
anytime soon. And that has nothing to do with being conservative. It's just
the reality.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
David Matter, president of Oxford Development Co., agrees. His company needs
that type of rental-rate breakthrough before it can proceed with the long-awaited
construction of Two Oxford Centre downtown, in what is now a parking lot
between One Oxford Centre and the City-County Building. <BR>
&quot;Nothing will happen until we begin to approach the $30 mark,&quot;
Matter says. <BR>
<BR>
Oxford and other local developers have several nonoffice commercial projects
underway or about to begin downtown, so things are far from being dead in
the water. But city development is downright sluggish compared to the suburbs.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The suburbs is where the action is,&quot; says Jim Scalo, president
of Burns &amp; Scalo Real Estate Group in Bridgeville. &quot;And local developers
are getting a big part of that action because we know the suburban markets.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The real growth potential for this region is in technology-driven
industries. They typically don't need to be in downtown Pittsburgh or downtown
anywhere. They don't want to be downtown. They want the campus-type settings
that we can offer in the suburbs. The people who work in these companies
are more interested in, say, playing Frisbee at lunchtime than going to
some fancy restaurant. And that's not only in this area but all across the
country.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Scalo says he does not worry   about big out-of-town firms coming   in and
picking up choice projects.      His biggest concern - and the     biggest
threat to local development efforts throughout the Pittsburgh region - is
about local conditions which have been allowed to deteriorate for years,
he says.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What we have to address is our terrible infrastructure situation and
the civil wars being fought among groups and political forces over new road
construction. Some people are actually working to delay needed road- building
projects for politically selfish reasons, and that is an abomination.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;And we don't have a marketing plan for the entire nine-county region.
We have development agencies, which are supposed to be working to attract
businesses to the region, competing with each other rather than cooperating
and doing what's best for the entire region, not just one small segment
of it,&quot; he adds.<BR>
<BR>
The region is too fragmented politically to achieve reasonable    development
goals, Scalo says.       Some areas seem to have a definite anti-development
bias - and no clue as to what's needed to attract and   keep businesses.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Fortunately, there are pockets of the region where you can still get
things done,&quot; Scalo says. &quot;Washington County, for example, has
very proactive commissioners and a development authority that is very receptive
to new ideas and approaches. When we have that kind of atmosphere, we usually
end up being too busy working and developing projects to worry about out-of-towners
coming in and stealing jobs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Will local forces have the foresight to collaborate in a manner that has
the potential to strengthen themselves along with the region? <BR>
<BR>
Let's just say that for the present, hello Nordstrom and hello Alex Conroy.

<B><FONT size=+2>The YWCA Kicks Off its Capital Campaign<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>From its beginning 129 years ago, the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh
has focused on creating opportunities for women's growth and leadership.
The annals of the YWCA overflow with success stories of women it has helped
- women who have given back a hundred fold to their families and their communities.<BR>
<BR>
But the challenges facing today's YWCA and the women it serves are very
different than those of a century,  half-century, or even a decade ago.
Today's YWCA is addressing these changes as well as anticipating tomorrow's
challenges with energy and vitality - understanding that in change, there
is growth and opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
The YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh has forged a path of leadership, advocacy,
courage, compassion, action and results for the women of this community.
From counseling to child care, housing to job training, teen clubs to health
advocacy, the YWCA reinforces individual values and encourages women to
actively resolve their problems by setting and achieving goals.<BR>
<BR>
Today's YWCA serves tens of thousands of tots, teens, young women, baby-boomers
and seniors through a broad spectrum of diverse human services and educational,
social and recreational programs. The girls and women it serves are representative
of the diverse needs and cultures found in the urban mix that is Pittsburgh
and Allegheny County.<BR>
<BR>
The YWCA's commitment is simple, yet profound - &quot;To strive to create
opportunities for women's growth, leadership and power in order to eliminate
racism, and to facilitate a common vision: peace, justice, freedom and dignity
for all people.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Its success is clearly and forcibly demonstrated by all statistical measurement.
It is perhaps best calculated, however, by the number of women whose lives
have been changed forever because of today's YWCA.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh's ability to continue to grow to meet
the changing needs of women faces some serious challenges. In response,
the YWCA has, for the first time in more than three decades, turned to the
community to support its efforts. The YWCA currently is conducting an $8.75
million capital      campaign - and is happy to report that almost 60 percent
of the goal already has been reached due to the generosity of Pittsburgh's
corporations, foundations and individuals who have consistently supported
the YWCA's programs.<BR>
<BR>
We sincerely hope that you will take the opportunity to learn more about
the YWCA and the campaign in the pages that follow. Above all, we hope you
will join those generous contributors in supporting this effort to assure
that one of Greater Pittsburgh's greatest and most vital assets remains
strong.<BR>
<BR>
Meeting today's challenges and strengthening the YWCA's people, programs
and facilities for the challenges we face in the future is what this campaign
is all about.<BR>
Thanks in advance for your generous support.<BR>

YWCA- The YWCA: For Today's Women <BR>
A Message from CEO Margaret Tyndall<BR>
<BR>
The need for a vibrant, dynamic organization that creates opportunities
for women's growth and leadership is as strong today as it was 129 years
ago when the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh was started.<BR>
<BR>
Back then, the YWCA served young women flocking to the city for jobs. Those
were grueling times for women. Demeaning working conditions and low pay
devalued their lives. Through the YWCA they found a safe, nurturing place
to live. The YWCA educated those young women, cultivated moral values and
improved their lives as well as the fabric of their community.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the center of the YWCA's mission is empowerment. And while some of
the issues may have changed, the need for an organization like the YWCA
has not. Take a look at the world around us: the disparity between women's
income and men's income, racism scarring the lives of young people, violence
casting a dark shadow on their futures.<BR>
<BR>
The YWCA is deeply committed to meeting the needs of women, girls and their
families. More importantly, the YWCA recognized very early on that providing
services was not enough. We knew we had to attack the root causes of the
social problems that created the demand for our services. The YWCA's mission
is a rare blend of service to women and advocacy on issues affecting their
lives and futures.<BR>
<BR>
Our Bridge Housing, job training and child care programs address the most
urgent needs of women: a secure place to live, learning skills that lead
to productive employment at a decent wage, and providing support for mothers
trying to make their way in the world while raising a family. These programs
make a direct impact on the lives of young women.<BR>
<BR>
On a broader scale, the YWCA is a moral compass for the community, speaking
out firmly on the social ills that have created the need for our     services.
Foremost among these ills        is racism. It is a blight on our community.
It consumes so much energy      that could be channeled to more productive
uses. As women, we have experienced oppression and discrimination. This
experience helps us understand how racism dehumanizes both its victims and
its perpetrators. It has given us the firm resolve to eradicate racism wherever
it exists, by any means necessary.<BR>
<BR>
Our voter registration drive is another reflection of the YWCA's advocacy.
We are helping people, particularly those who historically have been disenfranchised,
to understand their responsibilities as citizens. The YWCA is empowering
these women to seize control of their own lives, to raise their voices on
pressing issues affecting their lives and the lives of their families.<BR>
<BR>
Today's YWCA, like the fledgling association that nourished young women
129 years ago, remains committed to giving women the tools and moral fiber
they need to lead productive lives This is our mission. It is reflected
in everything we do and say.                      <BR>
<BR>
Training, Inc. <BR>
and the Journey <BR>
to Self-Sufficiency<BR>
<BR>
Twenty-five year-old Tricia Wojtasiak was a welfare-dependent, single mother
of a five-year old daughter until she decided to break the cycle of dependency
that had ruled her life.<BR>
<BR>
That's when she enrolled in the YWCA's Training, Inc. program.<BR>
<BR>
The 22-week program gives unemployed or under-employed people a chance to
support themselves by training them for office careers. The training is
done at the downtown headquarters of the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My mother was on welfare; I grew up on welfare. I didn't want my daughter
to grow up on welfare like I did,&quot; said Wojtasiak, who completed training
in April and was hired as a receptionist at the downtown law firm of Jones
Gregg Creehan and Gerace. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I love my job. It's great getting a paycheck. I've earned it - it's
not a handout. And I am glad to get off welfare,&quot; Wojtasiak said.<BR>
 <BR>
Wojtasiak was hired when another Training, Inc., graduate moved up the career
ladder. Peg Krainc, a 1988 graduate, left the firm in March after eight
years as a receptionist to work as judicial secretary for Judge Cynthia
Baldwin. Before leaving, she recommended that her replacement come from
Training, Inc.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have good memories of Training, Inc., and how they help people get
on their feet. And, I knew they wouldn't recommend someone who was not qualified.
It was a way of paying them back - a way to say thanks,&quot; Krainc said.<BR>
<BR>
Krainc, now 42, used Training, Inc., as a springboard to the professional
world from the blue collar world she had known. She had grown bored with
the monotony of her letter-sorting job and worried about her future. She
wanted a better paying office job but lacked computer skills. Through Training,
Inc., she got &quot;a taste of everything&quot; from word processing to
data entry, mock interviews and dress codes.<BR>
<BR>
Krainc was one of the first         graduates of Training, Inc., which began
here in 1988. As a program of the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh, Training,
Inc. is primarily funded through the Pittsburgh Partnership of the City
of Pittsburgh. In the eight years of the program, 76 percent of those graduating
have been placed in jobs and 83 percent are still working after one year.<BR>
<BR>
Shirley Mueller, manager of Training, Inc., said the program's long-term
success is due to the fact that it reshapes participants' lives.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's not just a training program. Our graduates are still working
because our program changes lives. If they lose their job, they don't go
back to their old ways. They get another job,&quot; Mueller said.<BR>
During the 22 weeks, trainees gain hands-on experience in a simulated office
setting. They get practical experience with office equipment and software
used in Pittsburgh's business community and learn business and management
skills through operating a fictitious corporation. Training includes typing,
word processing, data entry, filing, spreadsheets, customer service, business
communication, business ethics, career planning and goal setting skills.<BR>
<BR>
Most importantly, trainees develop confidence and self-sufficiency through
a positive attitude that includes rewards for every achievement, no matter
how small. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;When a person has been on welfare more than six months, they lose
their sense of self-worth and self-esteem. They don't see themselves as
making a positive contribution to society. They feel trapped and they are
trapped,&quot; Mueller said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Through daily achievement and recognition of that achievement, they
come to believe in themselves. They renew their belief in themselves,&quot;
she said.<BR>
<BR>
Judith Burton, now 50, was at the lowest point in life when she turned to
Training, Inc. in 1992. Burton was forced to go on welfare in 1986 when
her husband of 16 years left her with three children and no child support.
Despite her extensive work experience in an office and as a supervisor,
Burton felt the job market had passed her by since she had quit working
to raise her family.<BR>
<BR>
Her life continued its downward spiral for the next six years.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Things changed so much in a few short years. Welfare kept us alive,
but to me it meant failure,&quot; Burton said. &quot;I had no confidence,
no self-esteem. I had nothing.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Training, Inc. proved to be Burton's lifeline. She learned new computer
skills and improved her typing. More importantly, Burton rediscovered herself.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They (Training, Inc. instructors) gave me back my life. They give
you a chance to improve everything about yourself and your life. My self-esteem
and confidence came back,&quot; Burton said.<BR>
The Training, Inc. staff continued to support Burton during her job search.
They helped her prepare a resume, taught her interviewing techniques and
provided moral support. After 162 applications and 75 second interviews,
Burton's determination paid off with a job with Allegheny County. Today
she is supervisor of inventory control and assistant to the deputy director.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's hard work, but it's heaven. You are in control of your own life
and your own destiny. And when you cash a check, it's not a handout - you've
earned it,&quot; Burton said.<BR>
<BR>
Thirty-five year-old Jane Davis also used Training, Inc. to get out of the
&quot;welfare trap.&quot; She was on welfare for two years when she enrolled
in the program in 1994. Her goal: to get off welfare and earn a good living
for herself and her son, now 11.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My goal was to get off welfare and stay off it for good. Welfare is
a trap. You get on and you have to make more than minimum wage to get off.
Without an education and skills, you get trapped. Training, Inc. gives you
credibility in writing that you have the skills,&quot; Davis said.<BR>
<BR>
Davis, who now works for a major Pittsburgh corporation, said Training,
Inc. changed her life for the better.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Work can be stressful, but it's a good stress. It feels good to be
working. Even if I won the lottery, I'd still work. And I know I'll never
go back on welfare,&quot; she said.                                    
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Something for Everyone<BR>
</B><BR>
Women striving for growth in their personal lives can look to the YWCA of
Greater Pittsburgh for a broad range of support and services. At the YWCA,
attention is focused on improving the economic condition and quality of
life of those served. YWCA programs and services give women greater self-confidence,
enabling them to take control of their lives.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Teen Programs<BR>
</B><BR>
Working with young women is the YWCA's highest priority. In 1995, more than
8,000 teenagers took part in   classes addressing dating, sexuality,   values
and setting limits. Over 500 teenage girls participated in after-school
teen clubs that helped them develop self-confidence and realize their assets.<BR>
 <BR>
Force, a new initiative launched in 1994, tackles the tough issue of gang
violence. The Fe-male OutReach Collaborative Effort provides outreach, case
management, information, referral, support and follow-up for young women
be-tween the ages of 10 and 25 who are involved in gang activities, violent
or self-destructive behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Counseling Services<BR>
</B><BR>
The YWCA's Coun-seling Services help women address such problems as depression,
emotional abuse and addiction. Legal Resources for Women provides information,
referral and consultation services to women facing legal problems often
related to divorce, child custody, credit or sexual harassment.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Health Promotion<BR>
</B><BR>
The YWCA continues to offer affordable, accessible exercise programs for
women of all ages and their families. Encore Plus is a new program aimed
at the early detection of breast and cervical cancer. The YWCA also offers
post-mastectomy physical rehabilitation and psychological support services.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Employment Training<BR>
</B><BR>
Through YWCA employment services, women achieve economic independence by
increasing their employment opportunities. These programs serve women who
primarily are educationally disadvantaged, lacking work experience and who
are often long-term welfare dependent. The employment services provide basic
skills training and help build self-confidence, enabling participants to
enter the world of work. Additionally, parenting classes and quality child
care are provided for young mothers. These job training programs have a
75 percent placement rate for women completing the curriculum.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Child Care Services<BR>
</B><BR>
Another way the YWCA enables women and their families to achieve self-sufficiency
is by providing quality, affordable, accessible child care. The YWCA offers
a variety of day care    programs for children up to age 12, including pre-school,
before and     after school care, holiday care and  summer day camp. Child
Care Partnerships' resource and referral division provides a variety of
              services to help families obtain child care - including a
database with information on more than 700 licensed and registered child
care providers in 26 counties in Western Pennsylvania. The YWCA also manages
approximately 2,900 child care subsidies at any given time. Partners in
Caring offers training and support for child care providers, particularly
those offering care in their homes. And the YWCA offers technical assistance
to employers seeking to provide employee child care services. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Housing Services<BR>
</B><BR>
The YWCA's Bridge Housing provides shelter and support services to women
and children who are homeless as a result of domestic violence, drug abuse
or economic setbacks. The assistance they receive through counseling, parenting
education and referrals helps them achieve economic and emotional independence.
                                   <BR>
<BR>
<B>The Campaign for the YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh<BR>
</B><BR>
The YWCA's $8.75 million capital campaign will raise critically needed funds
to build a new Homewood-Brushton center, renovate its aging downtown facility
and expand programs for youth and job training.<BR>
<BR>
According to YWCA Chief Executive Officer Margaret Tyndall, Ph.D., the fundraising
initiative marks the organization's first capital campaign in over 30 years.
Nearly 60 percent of the goal has been raised to date.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh has reached a critical juncture in
its history. This fundraising effort is vital if we are to continue to respond
effectively to the challenge of change in the 21st century,&quot; Tyndall
says.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Homewood-Brushton Center: $2 Million</B><BR>
<BR>
The YWCA's Homewood Brush-ton Center serves a predominately African-American
community with a median household income just over $13,000. More than a
third of the population has not finished high school and 70 percent of the
households are headed by single women. The rate of teen pregnancy in the
area is among the highest in the country.<BR>
<BR>
The YWCA plans to build a two-story, 17,000 square-foot facility - four
times larger than the current center - on the same site at Frankstown Avenue
and East View Street. The new facility will allow the creation of a full-service
women's and family center, including: 
<UL>
  <LI>larger space and new technologies to improve job training and child
care capabilities and capacity; 
  <LI>the addition of new state-of-the-art computer technology for classrooms;
  <LI>well-designed and adequate recreational space for youth; and 
  <LI>accessibility for people with disabilities.
</UL>
<BR>
The new structure will increase by 50 percent the YWCA's ability to serve
area women and children through job training and child care. The expanded
facility also will allow the YWCA to offer a more comprehensive program
of counseling, information and referral, parent resource center, and teen
services to the girls and women of this area. It is this comprehensive approach
of today's YWCA which makes a difference in the live of those it serves.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Renovation of Downtown Flagship Program Center: $4.5 Million </B><BR>
<BR>
The capital campaign includes the first major alterations to the YWCA's
Wood Street headquarters since it opened in 1962. About 100,000 people -
slightly under 10 percent of the population of the Greater Pittsburgh area
- use the YWCA's downtown facility each year. The building was designed
to serve both as an administrative center for the five centers in Allegheny
County and as an activity center for the Pittsburgh community.<BR>
<BR>
Modernization and renovations will allow for enhanced services and programs.
The renovations also will allow the YWCA to incorporate the new technologies
now available to ensure modern delivery of services. Programatic needs to
be addressed include:
<UL>
  <LI>A Child Care Resource Center housing a library of materials for both
child care providers and parents. Today, the YWCA serves family daycare
providers, child care center staffs and more than 10,000 parents. Expansion
of the program will allow the YWCA to impact the lives of 15,000 children.
  <LI>Personal Counseling Center to provide private space for interaction
between staff and clients. The YWCA conducts more than 2,000 legal and personal
counseling sessions annually. About 75 percent of the women served in counseling
have annual incomes under $17,000.
  <LI>YWCA Teen Programs reach out to almost 10,000 adolescents annually.
The downtown facility's Teen Service Program Center will serve as a hub
for the YWCA's adolescent programming.
  <LI>Health Promotion Services always have been an important element of
the YWCA's mission. The health and fitness program, which for many is the
only affordable program in the area, is used thousands of times each month.
Improvements must be made to the facility's recreational and exercise programs.
Space reconfiguration also will allow expansion of the highly regarded breast
surgery survivor program, Encore, and Encore Plus, a new program aimed at
early detection of breast and cervical cancer.
  <LI>A Center for Collaboration will provide space for other women's organizations
- enabling the YWCA to work with them to promote services for women and
families. The YWCA has worked closely with these organizations, often acting
as an incubator for new programs.
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Widening the Doors of Opportunity: $2.25 Million</B><BR>
<BR>
Youth programs are among the most demanding, yet essential,      activities
of the YWCA. The YWCA's programs focus on enhancing          self-esteem,
building character and developing leadership skills among girls ages 10
to 15. Increased funding for this program will allow much needed growth.<BR>
<BR>
Job training programs are at       the very core of efforts to bring training-disadvantaged
women into the workforce. The YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh currently serves
155 women per year in its programs, but there is overwhelming demand   
       for expansion. Welfare reform will   create the need to move thousands
of women into work activities. The YWCA is committed to assisting with that
transition.      <BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Congressional Power </FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>The Debate Should Not Be How Much,<BR>
But Rather How it is Used</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</I></B> </CENTER>
<P><HR>When Alfonso Lopez Jr. carried a .38-caliber revolver and five bullets
into his Texas high school in 1992, I'm sure he never dreamed that he was
about to set in motion a debate over how much power Congress should wield.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, Alfonso did just that. Caught with the gun, the teenager appropriately
was charged by San Antonio authorities with a firearms violation. The state
charges were dropped the next day, when federal prosecutors took over the
case, charging Alfonso with violating a relatively new federal law: the
Gun-Free School Zones Act.<BR>
<BR>
Lopez was convicted, but won a reprieve last year when a deeply divided
Supreme Court reviewed his case and in a 5-4 decision struck down the Gun-Free
School Zones Act as being unconstitutional. The majority's reasoning was
simple: Congress - whose power to regulate is limited by the constitution
- had overstepped its bounds.<BR>
<BR>
Congressional power to regulate, in part, rests in the commerce clause of
the constitution, which simply states that Congress can regulate commerce
among the states. From the 1930s until Alfonso Lopez's case, that power
for the most part had been absolute. If Congress wanted to regulate something,
it regulated it, citing the link to interstate commerce. Some examples of
commerce clause-based legislation: Congress criminalized carjacking, domestic
violence, arson and the failure to pay child support, all of which already
had been criminalized by many of the individual states. Some businesses
also felt the reach of Congress when it used the commerce clause to prohibit
wetlands destruction.<BR>
<BR>
I have no problem with a federal law punishing those who bring a gun into
a school or steal a car at gunpoint, except for the fact that many states
already have similar laws enacted. That begs the question: When Congress
passed the Gun-Free School Zones Act or the carjacking law, was the intent
to get guns out of schools or protect drivers? Or was it to allow the politicians
who supported the law to position themselves as being tough on crime?<BR>
<BR>
It's most likely the latter. And who loses? We do.<BR>
<BR>
All those civil lawsuits pending in federal court are pushed back a few
more months because the federal judiciary must give priority to the Alfonso
Lopezes of the world who are dragged into the federal system by our &quot;tough-on-crime&quot;
Congress. After all, the same constitution that gives Congress the power
to regulate interstate commerce also gives criminal defendants like Lopez
the right to a speedy trial. Civil cases get pushed back.<BR>
<BR>
And that brings me to my point: Perhaps this debate Alfonso Lopez triggered
should not be over the extent of Congressional power and the Supreme Court's
interpretation of that power. Rather, the public should instead keep one
eye on how Congress uses its power. <BR>
<BR>
Right now, Congress is using its commerce clause power to push through tort
reform, which from a business standpoint is good. Give Congress credit for
seizing on that power to remedy a problem. Every business benefits from
tort reform.<BR>
<BR>
But let's not be misled the next time Congress pushes through duplicative
legislation like the Gun-Free School Zones Act. It amounts to political
grandstanding and good sound bytes at election time. It's not an effective
use of the power our constitutional drafters bestowed upon Congress.<BR>
<BR>
It's an abuse of power, and we should recognize it for what it is.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Quiet Courage<BR>
Our Pages Reflect Her Dedication</FONT SIZE> <FONT size=+1></FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher <br clear=all></I></B><HR>For decades,
business defined model employees as devoted and proficient individuals who
consistently exceed expectations, setting the pace for others to follow.
These employees are generally reliable to a fault and pursue excellence
with a vengeance.  Customer service and independent problem-solving come
instinctively to them. They are as rare and as precious as the historical
artifacts housed in the splendid new Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional
History Center.<BR>
<BR>
Over the years, the intense demands of burgeoning global competition expanded
the definition of &quot;model employee.&quot; Today, such employees generally
also are technologically proficient individuals. Experts in communications,
they've refined relationship-building to an art form.<BR>
<BR>
At Executive Report, I recently adopted a more succinct definition. To all
of our staff, the name Jackie Priddy is synonymous with model employee.<BR>
<BR>
Jackie brought all of the characteristics of the exemplary employee to her
job and more. She juggled billing, collections, phone answering and typing,
while masterminding the magazine's circulation system. And, she cheerfully
handled these multiple priorities gracefully and flawlessly.<BR>
<BR>
April 16, 1996, was a ferociously sad day at Executive Report. This was
the day that Jackie lost her two-year battle with cancer. This was also
the day that the magazine lost part of its soul.<BR>
<BR>
Jackie's infectious can-do attitude was the infrastructure upon which Executive
Report built its successes. Serving as the gateway to the magazine, she
greeted all with aplomb. The sparkle in her voice and in her work energized
our organization daily. Jackie's invincible spirit permeated the company,
inspiring everyone to reach for broader horizons.<BR>
<BR>
Most truly great individuals never grace the pages of a history book. Instead,
they persevere only to claim their place in anonymity.<BR>
<BR>
Although Jackie's hard work and dedication won't feature prominently in
history textbooks, the pages of Executive Report will always reflect her.
By elevating the standards of performance at the magazine, Jackie made an
indelible mark in the magazine's annals.<BR>
<BR>
She added quiet courage to our definition of model employee, and she will
continue to inspire us to realize our fullest potential. That's the modern-day
version of exemplary.<BR>

<B><FONT size=+1>It's Time We Recognize Our Large</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Elderly Population as a Resource, Not a Liability</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Michael C. Hendrickson</I></B><HR></CENTER>
<P>Yhere was a story on a local television station a few months ago that
dealt with the progress being made in the treatment and possible cure of
Alzheimer's disease.<BR>
 <BR>
Towards the end of the segment the newscaster solemnly informed the audience
that &quot;Allegheny County now has the second-highest number of residents
over the age of 65, trailing only Dade County, Fla.,&quot; the implication
seeming to be that our region is in danger of being overrun with forgetful,
disoriented, wheezing elderly men and women.<BR>
<BR>
There are magic numbers and milestones in all our lives.  Age 30 - time
to settle down, raise a family. Forty - time to slow down a little and enjoy
life, then 50 - half a century! <BR>
<BR>
The age of 65 has in many cases signaled the end of one's professional life
in the way of employment. There is a pervasive theory in society today that
being productive is synonymous with being gainfully employed and if you're
not gainfully employed, then you must be poor and/or a drain on our resources.
<BR>
<BR>
Gerontologists and sociologists have coined the term &quot;ageism&quot;
to connote a negative stereotyping of older adults and aging in general,
with 65 being a general barometer of being &quot;old.&quot; This approach
to aging is not only unfortunate, it's also inaccurate in light of some
basic facts.  <BR>
<BR>
Allegheny County is proof there is successful aging in this country - less
than 5 percent of our residents over the age of 65 are in nursing home settings.
Nationally, more than two-thirds of those over 65 are independent, as is
half the population over 85. Locally, 75 to 80 percent are moderate to middle
income spenders and have nearly twice the disposable income of those aged
20 to 35, making them a very strong consumer force.  <BR>
<BR>
But the fact is, this age group brings more to our quality of life than
can be determined in dollars and cents. How can we begin to measure the
   benefits provided by thousands of    volunteers - most over 65 - in 
  organizations such as the United Way and Meals on Wheels, not to mention
a plethora of libraries, churches, hospitals, nursing homes, foundations
and other social support agencies? <BR>
<BR>
Western Pennsylvania's broad-based volunteerism allows society to extend
certain benefits to the less fortunate. Not to mention the level of satisfaction,
well-being and quality of life that can only be described by someone who
has been a volunteer. <BR>
<BR>
Some demographic experts have even suggested that Pittsburgh's relatively
low crime rate is partially due to our large contingency of elderly residents.
<BR>
  <BR>
There are many areas where age isn't an issue. Seniors have been recognized
for their inspiration, creativity and leadership in fields such as the arts,
literature, music, healthcare, education, scientific study and sports. In
our region, contributions made by Pittsburghers in their later years are
too numerous to list. <BR>
     <BR>
And there is still tremendous room for growth for additional opportunities
to utilize the skills and talents of those aged 65 and over. Those of us
in progressive geriatric healthcare systems have suggested this population
could perhaps be utilized to solve some of our society's more pressing problems,
such as day care and illiteracy. Many geriatric systems have developed mentoring
programs with local schools to help bridge generational gaps. <BR>
<BR>
The concept of reintegrating older adults into the societal framework to
share their vast wisdom, experience and knowledge with younger individuals
benefits society at large and can begin to dispel some of the misguided
myths of aging. <BR>
<BR>
Seniors today continue to have opportunities to be pioneers in all walks
of life. They have had many life experiences - good and bad - that we can
draw from. All they need in many instances is an avenue to share their time
and talents, which might be the role of a volunteer, consultant, coach -
or just a friend.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps those who view our elderly population as a necessary inevitability
do so because they have realized their own life is temporal, it is finite,
there will be an end some day. But those who have reached this age are repositories
of important information about how to live as well as age successfully.<BR>
<BR>
As such, they are extremely well-equipped to be role models and mentors
to a growing number of young people who are desperately trying to find leaders
to emulate.                          <BR>
                                <BR>
Michael C. Hendrickson is president and chief executive officer of Lutheran
Affiliated Services in Cranberry Township.<BR>

<B>LAUGHING MATTERS</B><BR>
<BR>
Got problems? Employees disgruntled? Production down? Stress levels rising?
Here's an idea: lighten up and laugh a little.<BR>
<BR>
That's advice from Ron Cichowicz and Ken Service, a pair who could be called
the &quot;chuckling communicators.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Cichowicz, who for years handled public relations for the Catholic Diocese
of Pittsburgh, and Service, director of communications for the University
of Pittsburgh, have devoted years of study to the benefits of a little laughter.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;My personal belief, both as a writer and just as a person, is that
humor is critical in our lives,&quot; says Cichowicz. &quot;I've got research
that shows that two-thirds of illnesses in people under the age of 65 are
stress-related. Ten minutes of laughter can produce two hours of restful
sleep that night.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The two have been friends for 20 years and enjoy collaborating on projects
like speaking engagements for organizations. The International Association
of Business Communicators sponsored the two for a talk May 7 about how frivolity
can improve life. Both are dedicated humorists in their own rights; Cichowicz
writes a regular humor column for Hospital News and has written two books
of witticisms, while Service pens a humor column in a new monthly publication,
Higher Education News.<BR>
<BR>
Cichowicz collects research on the topic of humor as it relates both to
personal life and to organizations like corporations. Study after study,
he says, demonstrates the benefits <BR>
of applying humor to the workplace as well as the home. <BR>
<BR>
Cichowicz says that beyond the physical benefits to individuals (less stress,
less illness, even burned calories), humor can help companies by improving
teamwork, creativity and morale, diffusing tension and creating communication.
The direct results are impressive.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Digital Equipment Company in Colorado Springs incorporated a humor
program at their office. Productivity rose 15 percent, and sick days were
cut in half,&quot; he says. It may be as simple as employees posting cartoons
on their doors or in interoffice memos. One company kept a set of foam rubber
balls in the conference room to be thrown at cynics in meetings. CEOs can
set the tone for their company by injecting a little humor into speeches
and internal newsletters. <BR>
<BR>
Service says the key is taking a sideways look at life, stepping back for
a little light-hearted <BR>
reflection on the inconsistencies of the world. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Self-effacing humor is good,&quot; he says, &quot;and doesn't risk
offending others or descending into tastelessness.&quot; Looking at the
funny side of things, he says, might even help find serious solutions. <BR>
<BR>
There's even help for the comically impaired: It is actually possible to
teach someone to be humorous. Cichowicz says with practice, one can develop
a knack for organizational humor.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If you've ever laughed at anything since you became an adult, you've
got a sense of humor,&quot; he says.                      <BR>
<BR>
<B>ZOO LOOKS TO YOU FOR NEW REVENUE<BR>
</B><BR>
The Pittsburgh Zoo is at it again. In April's issue, ER detailed the zoo's
rise from the ashes of governmental stagnation by privatization. Now the
zoo has joined forces to create the Pennsylvania Zoological Council and
produce the council's first brainchild, the &quot;Save Wild Animals&quot;
license plate.<BR>
The Zoological Council was formed to market, lobby and raise funds for Pennsylvania's
four American Zoological Society accredited parks, including Pittsburgh's
zoo, the Philadelphia Zoo, the Erie Zoo and the National Aviary here in
Pittsburgh. On the council are the directors of the four institutions: Barbara
Baker of Pittsburgh, Pete Hoskins from Philadelphia, Jim Rhea of Erie and
Dayton Baker from the National Aviary. It was Dayton Baker (also Pittsburgh
Zoo director Barbara Baker's husband) who dreamed up the plates and pushed
the project from design through Harrisburg's approval. <BR>
<BR>
It took back and forth negotiations between the council and PennDot to finalize
the project. But the final slogan and the image, a tiger and her cub, were
judged to be the most instantly recognizable and emotionally appealing from
among the designs submitted.  The plates went into production in April.
<BR>
<BR>
Each attention-grabbing $35 plate will garner $3.75 for the Pittsburgh Zoo.
Pennsylvania vehicle registration renewal packets will contain applications
for the plate; the Pittsburgh Zoo also has applications, and AABCO Notary
Service on Frankstown Road can issue a plate on the spot.<BR>
<BR>
The Pittsburgh Zoo will use the revenue to partly fund the Kids Kingdom's
Discovery Pavilion, set to open in May 1997. The Aviary plans on putting
its share to work in its conservation projects, including both care of rare
birds here and research and planning projects worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SPENDING RETIREMENT DOLLARS ... ON THE GRANDKIDS<BR>
<BR>
</B><BR>
If you think our region's large (300,000 plus) elderly population is a drawback,
talk to Leslie Hughan. She'll set you straight.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'd say of the very elaborate cruises, to the Far East and so on,
90 percent are for the 60 and over market,&quot; says Hughan, an Ambassador
Travel Service agent. &quot;They can afford it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Doug Mato of Around the World Travel in Greentree says there's lots of money
in the &quot;mature&quot; market, and it's only going to get better as the
senior population grows.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They do more getaways, they've got the time and the money,&quot; he
says. Many of their older customers take several vacations each year. Even
though there are travel groups that cater extensively to seniors, he thinks,
&quot;It's really an untapped market.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Retirement used to be just a prelude to death, but now we live 20-plus
years after. People ought to think of their later years in terms of how
they want to be productive,&quot; says Jim Denova. As director of Vintage,
a senior citizens' center in East Liberty, he advocates looking at senior
citizens as an asset ... and an opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
Ken Dychtwald, president of Age Wave Inc., has been researching &quot;social
gerontology&quot; for years with amazing results. Senior citizens nationwide
command some 70 percent our nation's net worth, and contrary to popular
belief, they aren't afraid to spend it.  In fact, they account for 40 percent
of total consumer demand. Seniors (over age 50), for example, are the No.
1 spenders on children's retail clothing. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Grandparents are always in here shopping,&quot; says Jacque Stuckert,
manager of Gap Kids clothing in Shadyside. &quot;They always come in and
buy and have us send out the clothes to their grandkids. They like the convenience.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Seniors also purchase 80 percent of all luxury travel, 37 percent of spa
memberships, and watch more television than any other age group.<BR>
<BR>
Considering this state of affairs, Denova believes Pittsburgh may well be
sitting on a Methuselan gold mine. He says few businesses in the area effectively
cater to one of its largest markets because of misconceptions about senior
citizens' financial situations. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Baby boomers are turning 50 this year, and they're going to push the
threshold of aging up. Fifty doesn't mean 'Senior Club,' &quot; says Denova.
&quot;They don't see themselves that way.&quot; Combine the boomer attitudes
with their sheer numbers and the assets they command, he says, and our nation's
concept of senior citizens is going to change very soon. <BR>
<BR>
He suggests a couple of industries that could benefit substantially from
the &quot;maturity bloom.&quot; Health clubs, for one. Insurance companies
are taking advantage of the increased amount of time people are healthy
and active, realizing their business will benefit from encouraging seniors
to be active.<BR>
 <BR>
    Modern Maturity offers some specific tips on marketing to the older
set in a special report, &quot;Mature America in the 1990s.&quot; The report
outlines preferences among the &quot;50-plus&quot; for almost every consumer
category - what they think about the environment, their health, what kinds
of cars they buy, and the marketing they respond to. They even publish a
small booklet entitled &quot;How to Advertise to Maturity.&quot; Some tidbits
of advice: <BR>
<BR>
 Furnish evidence like studies, ingredients and warranties. Older adults
take time to analyze their purchases. Samples and trial periods are good
strategies for the same reason.<BR>
<BR>
 Depict them with a whole range of people, not just in groups of elderly.<BR>
<BR>
 Acknowledge the fact that retirement means more time for leisure and romance,
not the end of life.<BR>
Other sources of information include the AARP Research Infor-mation Center,
American Demo-graphics magazine, and Age Wave in Emeryville, Calif.<BR>

<BR>
<B>MANAGED CARE FOR THE MASSES</B><BR>
<BR>
Managed care's going mainstream - and that means a whole new lingo to learn.
Here are some terms you may need to learn to play (see our cover story:
Managing Managed Care  on page 18): <BR>
 <BR>
Capitation: A method of paying for medical services on a per-person rather
than a per-procedure basis. Under capitation, an HMO pays a participating
doctor a fixed amount per month for every HMO member he or she takes care
of, regardless of how much or how little care the member receives.<BR>
<BR>
Copayment: A fixed payment the member pays (usually in the $5 to $25 range)
each time he or she visits a clinician or receives a covered service.<BR>
<BR>
Deductible: In traditional insurance and POS plans, a fixed amount the patient
pays each year before the insurer will begin covering the cost of care.<BR>
<BR>
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO): An organization providing healthcare
in return for pre-set monthly payments. Most HMOs provide care through a
network of doctors, hospitals and other medical professionals that their
members must use in order to be covered for that care.<BR>
<BR>
HMO Model Types: HMOs generally come in two different &quot;models&quot;:<BR>
<BR>
1. Staff Model HMO: A type of HMO in  which doctors and other medical professionals
are salaried employees of the HMO, and work in clinics or health centers
owned by the HMO.<BR>
<BR>
2. Group Model HMO: An HMO made up of one or more physician group practices
not owned by the HMO, but operating as independent partnerships or professional
corporations. The HMO pays the groups at a negotiated rate, and each group
is responsible for paying its doctors, other staff, hospital care and care
from outside specialists.<BR>
<BR>
Independent Practice Association (IPA): IPAs generally include large numbers
of individual private practice physicians who are paid either a fee or a
fixed amount per patient to take care of the IPA's members.<BR>
<BR>
Mixed-Model HMO: A health plan that includes more than one form of HMO within
a single plan. For instance, a staff model HMO might also contract with
independent physician groups or individual private practice physicians.<BR>
<BR>
Managed Care Organization: An umbrella term for HMOs and all health plans
that provide health care in return for pre-set monthly payments and coordinate
care through a defined network of primary care physicians and hospitals.<BR>
<BR>
Network: The doctors, clinics, health centers, medical group practices,
hospitals and other providers that an HMO, PPO or other managed care plan
selects and contracts with to care for its members.<BR>
Out-of-Network: Not in the HMO's network of selected and approved doctors
and hospitals. HMO members who get care out-of-network (sometimes called
out-of-area) without getting permission from the HMO to do so may have to
pay for all or most of that care themselves. Exceptions are usually made
for extreme emergencies or urgent care needed when traveling away from home.<BR>
Point-of-Service (POS) Plan: A type of HMO coverage that allows members
to choose to receive services either from participating HMO providers, or
from providers outside the HMO's network. In-network care is more likely
to be fully covered; for out-of-network care, members pay deductibles and
a percentage of the cost of care, much like traditional health insurance
coverage.<BR>
Practice Guidelines: Carefully developed information on diagnosing and treating
specific medical conditions. Practice guidelines, usually based on clinical
literature and expert consensus, are designed to help physicians and patients
make decisions, and to help a health plan evaluate appropriateness and medical
necessity of care.<BR>
<BR>
Preferred Provider Organization (PPO): A network of doctors and hospitals
that provides care at a lower cost than traditional insurance. PPO members
get better benefits (more coverage) when they use the PPO's network, and
pay higher out-of-pocket costs when they receive care outside the PPO network.<BR>
<BR>
Preventive care: Care designed to prevent disease altogether, to detect
and treat it early, or to manage its course most effectively. Examples of
preventive care include immunizations and regular screenings like Pap smears
or cholesterol checks.<BR>
<BR>
Primary Care: Preventive health care and routine medical care that is typically
provided by a doctor trained in internal medicine, pediatrics or family
practice, or by a nurse, nurse practitioner or physician's assistant.<BR>
<BR>
Primary Care Physician: A physician, usually an internist, pediatrician
or family physician, devoted to general medical care of patients. Most HMOs
require members to choose a primary care physician, who is then expected
to provide or authorize all care for that patient.<BR>
<BR>
Referral: A formal process that authorizes an HMO member to get care from
a specialist or hospital. To ensure coverage, an HMO patient generally must
get a referral from his or her primary care physician before seeing a specialist.<BR>
<BR>
Specialist: A doctor or other health professional whose training and expertise
are in a specific area of medicine, like cardiology or dermatology. Most
HMOs require members to get a referral from their primary care physician
before seeing a specialist.<BR>
<BR>
Treatment Protocols: Practice guidelines for treating specific medical conditions.<BR>

<FONT size=+1>The Democrats Bash Ridge for Job Losses,<BR>
But Whose Story Can You Really Believe? </FONT><BR>
<I>By Jim Strader </I><HR></CENTER>
<P>Not too many images spell more trouble for politicians than laid-off
workers walking out the gates of a plant slated for shutdown. Lost jobs,
whether due to companies' laying workers off or  deciding to expand elsewhere,
don't help anyone trying to foster economic growth.<BR>
<BR>
And while building the excitement over the prospect of new jobs often is
left to press secretaries  - usually new plants and expanded businesses
are still intangibles when announced - the disappointment at the opposite
is generally public domain. The faces of blue-collar workers losing their
jobs make great TV, and the newly unemployed often provide stinging quotes.<BR>
<BR>
Gov. Tom Ridge, who made job creation a part of his economic program for
the state, has had his share of well-noticed job departures from Pennsylvania
in the first 18 months of his term.<BR>
<BR>
 Economic bad news, when it hits in different parts of the state, compounds
the black eyes Ridge suffered for signing off on a legislative pay raise
last year and calling for an increased gasoline tax earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
This spring, Caterpillar Inc. announced it would close a parts plant in
York, eliminating 1,100 jobs. That closing gave Democrats in Harrisburg
the cue to tally the lost jobs they attribute to Ridge. They counted almost
25,000.<BR>
<BR>
The Democrats include in  their  tally 1,500 banking jobs at Integra following
its acquisition by National City and 225 Westinghouse Electric jobs cut
in restructuring. A <BR>
Keystone Coal mine closing in Armstrong County added 350 jobs to the list.
And Democrats say a strike at Industrial Ceramics Inc. in Westmore-land
County cost 219 jobs.<BR>
<BR>
The total includes jobs lost for a wide range of reasons - factors as diverse
as restructuring, downsizing, acquisitions and military base closings. 
Two of the largest hits the Democrats pointed out were jobs lost because
of Pentagon cuts - 1,700 jobs lost at a Boeing helicopter plant in Delaware
County and 2,100 jobs lost when the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard closed -
both decisions of the federal government. It may be a stretch to blame Ridge
for the lost Navy jobs, but they're on the list anyway.<BR>
<BR>
Those kinds of calculations anger Ridge's staff. Spokesman Tim Reeves says
the Democrats shouldn't count job losses that Ridge had no control over
and should count the jobs that have been created with his help. Reeves points
to 1,200 PNC Bank jobs, for instance, that were close to going to New Jersey
but remain in Philadelphia. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In an economy the size of Pennsylvania's, in the healthiest, most
robust times, there are companies that close and companies that relocate,&quot;
Reeves says. &quot;The key is the net effect.&quot;<BR>
Reeves says unemployment figures showed a gain of about 28,000 jobs in roughly
the governor's first 12 months in office and a jobless rate at its lowest
point in the state since 1991.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is not picking and choosing the facts,&quot; he says. &quot;This
is the barometer we have always used.&quot;<BR>
PNC Bank regional economist Paul Flora says both Ridge and the Democrats
seem to be reading too much into the events of the last year. Not a lot
of what happens in the economy under a particular political administration
can be traced to its actions, he says. More often, events were set in motion
years earlier.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, factors under the control of the federal government - such
as fiscal and monetary policy - have a much larger impact on state economies,
Flora says. Typical initiatives of state governments, chiefly tax and regulatory
incentives, take more time to produce effects.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In general, I guess I've disagreed with both the sitting governor
and his Democratic opponents,&quot; Flora says.&quot;He can neither take
credit nor be blamed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Flora's figures, which measure job growth from December 1994 - just before
Ridge took office - to the following December, show an increase of about
10,000 jobs. The numbers showed national job creation for the year proceeding
at a slightly lower rate. <BR>
<BR>
To the Ridge administration, the criticism from Democrats amounts to the
product of a &quot;bad news magnet,&quot; Reeves says. The number of new
jobs created tell the true story, he said.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If one is an incident and two is a trend,&quot; he says, &quot;we're
way past a trend here.&quot;<BR>

<P><HR><B>Name: James Treher<BR>
Age: 67<BR>
Personal: Married, he and wife Barbara live in the South Hills.<BR>
Daughter Adrienne works with CII; son James Jr. is a <BR>
Pittsburgh based FBI agent.<BR>
Education: BA, Political Science, Duquesne University, 1952<BR>
Public Administration/Psychology<BR>
Last Book Read: Code Name Downfall, The Secret Plan to<BR>
Invade Japan, by Thomas Allen <BR>
</B><HR>The FBI? Scotland Yard? Criminal intelligence? How does this impact
my business? Ask Jim Treher. Sixteen years ago, Treher retired from the
FBI after 25 years of service. But he got bored and - tired of being in
his wife's way - started Corporate Investigations Inc. with a fellow former
FBI employee (guess they just can't sit still). The advent of multimillion-dollar
negligent hiring settlements made their timing perfect. <BR>
<BR>
The now 10-year-old company practices its own brand of corporate preventive
care, screening potential employees for corporate clients the world over.
Treher deploys his considerable knowledge to do everything from a simple
department of motor vehicles check to thorough background investigations,
making sure that the candidate has given the company the correct information
about his or her situation.<BR>
 <BR>
It's amazing (and a little frightening) just how much information can be
gleaned legally - if you know where to look. Well, Jim Treher does. Lydia
Strohl talked to him in his Scott Township office.<BR>
 <BR>
Executive Report: Tell us about Corporate Investigations Inc.<BR>
<BR>
Jim Treher: I retired from 25 years in the FBI 16 years ago, as an agent.
I was in San Francisco, Detroit, New Orleans, Pittsburgh, in [former FBI
Director J. Edgar] Hoover's office, and was a staff instructor at the FBI
academy. I came back to Pittsburgh and retired and directed the county police
department for three years.<BR>
<BR>
Ten years ago I started this business with one employee and an office half
the size of this one. In 10 years, we've grown to 25 employees and are probably
one of the leading companies in spite of our size. We're now on our third
generation of computer operation - we have a lot of innovative ideas. <BR>
<BR>
We're up against some giants, like Burns and Pinkerton, and others, but
their piece of the corporate pie that is background investigation is not
much bigger. It's a highly competitive field. <BR>
<BR>
We now have a service called Corp Net, everything that's found is immediately
entered into the computer.  Clients can check via their computer.<BR>
<BR>
The other thing that we have that is unique is that I still have all the
old FBI contacts all over the world. We also have a division of linguistics,
people who can speak and write Russian, German, French, Spanish. We do a
lot in the West Indies and South America, the former USSR, China, Canada,
Israel, all over Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Ninety-nine percent of the work is background investigations -  do one thing
and do it well, and you can do it better than anybody else.<BR>
<BR>
ER: How big is the background investigation industry?<BR>
<BR>
JT: I can't answer that, but it's growing daily. Ten years ago, there were
only a handful of companies doing it, and then the legal profession discovered
what they term 'negligent hiring.' <BR>
<BR>
I'll give you a good example: A transportation firm in Texas, they provide
taxicabs, buses for the disabled. They hired a driver and didn't do any
kind of background investigation at all. He wasn't there six months before
he had brutally raped a woman, in front of her sub-teenage daughters. This
guy had a string of sex crimes as long as your arm. The victim sued the
company for negligent hiring, and they were found guilty. The judge leveled
a penalty of $2.7 million in actual damages. Then he added another $1 million
in punitive damages for what he called deliberate neglect.<BR>
So companies can't afford not to do this, like you can't afford not to have
liability insurance. And the fact is, for an entry level job, let's say
$20,000, it costs one-half of one percent for a background investigation.
When you consider all the jeopardy: You're going to bring someone in, they're
going to know the company's competitors, resources, procedures. What if
this guy is capable of selling out? What if you've got a gambler, a heavy
drinker? You can't go on what people say on their resumes. If you hire someone
who says 'Yes, I have all the qualifications,' or 'I have a master's degree,'
and it takes you a lot of money to recruit them, then to go through the
hiring process, then you put them on the job for six months before they
find their way around, and you find this person's grievously unprepared,
they can't do the job. Now you've got to start that all over. Where for
$200 you could have had the whole thing.<BR>
<BR>
ER: What do you look at?<BR>
<BR>
JT: We have three levels. The lowest level we suggest is rudimentary - criminal
and credit and past employment, DMV for a driver, or if you pay them mileage
for their automobile, you would be held liable. That would be for  a basic
laborer in the shop or the office. For people in positions that are more
critical, we would want to check or confirm the degree or certification
and the level. Then we would want to talk to references, and more importantly,
developed references, because obviously, everyone gives their best friend
for a reference. We have a whole list of questions. One of which is does
he have any debilitating habits, how much does he drink, is it a problem?
And the outsider is more apt to answer those questions.<BR>
<BR>
We develop references generally by asking. If they're just out of school,
we'll ask the department head if he had any close friends. Or the reference,
by asking, who else did you play ball with? But one thing that I am absolutely
a bug on is we don't ask one applicant one set of questions and another
one a different set. I would not want to go into an adversarial situation
in court and the judge say, 'How come you have three pages of information
on this person and only one on this person?' I have applied all the structures
and tried-and-true procedures that we used in the FBI. Remember, we're dealing
with people's lives, and if we come up with something wrong, and they don't
get a job, we've affected them. <BR>
<BR>
We may want to look into bankruptcy or their general business ability. Some
people say, 'I don't care whether they pay their bills or not - why should
I do a credit check on some guy that's out there moving boxes around?' Well
the reason is that a credit profile is a pretty good profile of an individual's
maturity and dependability. If they can't pay their bills, if it's a consistent
pattern, they're not the kind of person I'd like to have working for me.
Plus the person that can't pay their bills may be a gambler, may be sniffing
nose candy or may be just a compulsive drinker who spends too much money.<BR>
<BR>
One of our clients is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world. They
built a research facility down in the southern states a few years back.
 They produce pharmaceuticals that you could literally put under your tongue
or down your shoe that have a street value of $500 or $600. Because of the
cost and the susceptibility of what they manufacture to theft, they projected
that they would have a 12 percent theft loss rate. <BR>
<BR>
When 1,400 people were to be hired, we did background investigations on
everybody. We had about a 22 or 23 percent question rate. And that means
serious questions - bad credit, criminal conviction background, bad driving,
bad employment record. The first quarter of the operation they had a zero
loss rate. They were delighted, and I said, 'Well, we got rid of a quarter
of the people that would have been problems - drinkers, thieves, the poor
credit risks.'<BR>
<BR>
That's another one of the reasons for the necessity of a background investigation.
Retail credit theft, for instance, runs about 40 percent of their loss.
They think it's the shoplifters. Shoplifters don't take nearly as much as
their own employees. They have the opportunity; they know how to do it.
<BR>
One thing that bothers me is we haven't been able to make any inroads in
the health profession. And there is absolutely no enterprise that I can
think of where there is more opportunity for grief than hospitals. They
say they can't afford it: If you hire someone with no background investigation,
they have access to hospital narcotics, they're in the rooms of people who
are susceptible to assault of all kinds, they can steal the patients' and
visitors' stuff. Another one is the airlines. What the airlines lose in
theft of baggage is just incredible. They just fire people and shut up about
it. <BR>
<BR>
ER: What's the most intense check that you would do?<BR>
<BR>
JT: That would be level three. The basic things, and then some. We go into
Nexis/Lexis, to see what kind of publicity there might have been. We're
going to check every company they've worked for to make sure that the company
really exists and they really worked there. Another thing a lot of people
have misapprehension about is if there is no state record. But they could
have been involved in a kidnapping, or bank robbery; those federal crimes
are not in state records. So we check the federal criminal docket and the
civil docket. We're going to check on the county level. We're going to check
net worth - how many homes or boats or airplanes. Even that is seldom more
than about $500, for a cradle to grave search.<BR>
<BR>
ER: How do you find out what people own?<BR>
<BR>
JT: It's all a matter of tax records. There are data banks. You can find
out a lot about a person legally and properly. A lot of the civil libertarians
worry about that, but I don't. If people are too concerned about what other
people can find out about them, they probably have something to hide.<BR>
<BR>
ER: What percentage of investigations turn something up that causes a candidate
not to get a job?<BR>
<BR>
JT: Between 20 and 25 percent. And these are serious contradictions or questions.
We don't make any recommendations - all we say is that we find no problem
or it's questionable. You make your decision. It's a judgment call. If someone's
been convicted of a felony, and you can't count arrest - legally you can
only go back seven years - you've paid your fine or your time and they haven't
done anything since. They're getting on with their life. But that's up to
company policy.<BR>
<BR>
ER: What do you feel your FBI background brings to the company ?<BR>
<BR>
JT: I think the experience of having been in an adversarial situation in
court, in front of a judge and a jury and attorneys. You only have to get
caught a couple of times not having a real good answer. I put the worst
case scenario on every one. <BR>
<BR>
I'll give you a for instance. We go to a university and say, 'Confirm this
person's degree.' They look in the computer and can't find it. We then ask
them to do a hand search, because things can fall through the cracks. If
they still can't find it, if it's been within seven years, we'll go to the
department head. Last thing we'll do is go to the alumni association and
ask them. All four. That's the thing that I learned from the FBI. <BR>
<BR>
Make sure your sources are ethical. Don't take just one, particularly if
it's a negative. It takes you a lifetime to make your reputation - you can
lose it overnight by some dumb thing. <BR>
<BR>
We've had some close calls. Talk about double jeopardy - this was a black
female who'd applied for a pretty responsible job with a big company.  We
went through the four phases, she didn't get the degree. We checked the
four things again, no degree. They said, 'She just handed me the diploma.'
<BR>
<BR>
So I asked them to fax me a copy; I faxed it to the university. They quit
using those diplomas five years before she claimed she'd graduated.<BR>
<BR>
Another pair of gals, twins, both used the initials B.J. Did the university
check and they came back and said 'B.J. got a degree, but her social security
number is one digit off what you have.' The next thing was to check references,
and one of the developed references said, 'Tell Betty Jane I said hello.'
'Who?' 'Betty Jane, B.J.' Turns out they were twins, one was going on the
other.<BR>
<BR>
It's like a doctor - you've got a swollen knee and the first thing he does
is look down your throat, to know the totality of the situation.<BR>
<BR>
One time, doing one of the things that the client hadn't asked us to do
- they didn't want the criminal check done anywhere else but where this
woman lived, even though she had lived in two or three other states - we
found out that this woman had murdered her husband and cut him up into little
pieces.<BR>
 	<BR>
You know, even when we go to the state with a release from the employee,
22 states will not let us into their criminal records. So on the one hand
we have the court saying to the employer, you are responsible for doing
a background investigation, and then you go to this state and they say no,
you can't see the records - you talk about a catch-22. Now there are some
of my competitors who claim, and this is just a lie, that they can get a
national criminal check. You cannot get a national criminal check. There's
only one national crime repository, and that is only available to the criminal
justice system. Some firms keep databases, they're inaccurate, inadequate.<BR>
<BR>
We do a state-wide if we can, and if they won't let us we go to the counties.
But you can walk from here to six counties - Pennsylvania is a state that
allows us to get the whole thing. I don't think everyone should be able
to get it on their neighbor or friend, but if you have a release, you should
be able to.<BR>
<BR>
ER: In all these steps do you have the employee's consent?<BR>
<BR>
JT: Oh, absolutely. I spent a great deal of money getting a lot of legal
advice and creating a compliance manual that made absolutely certain that
we were in compliance with the Consumer Protection Act, the Fair Trade Reporting
Act, the OEO and the OEA and all the rest of them. <BR>
<BR>
ER: Where do your FBI contacts come into play?<BR>
<BR>
JT: For instance, I have a correspondent in London who I met in my FBI career
who was in criminal intelligence with Scotland Yard. He does things for
me in the UK and Europe. We are getting more German and Russian and Chinese
and French technical people. For instance, it's very hard to get information
from India. So I'll look in my directory of former FBI agents and find someone
who is there or has contacts there. If I didn't call them, I'd probably
have to go to the embassy, and it'd take six weeks. Having people on the
spot who know what you want, and how to do it legally and professionally
 is an enormous advantage.<BR>
<BR>
Not only is it the FBI directory -also the FBI National Academy. We bring
in police from all over the world and train them for 12 weeks at the FBI
Academy in Quantico. Their directory has contacts in every state in the
union, every city, and every country in the world. Pago Pago, Bangladesh,
Guam, each one of these is an individual who speaks English, and whose connection
with the FBI they honor and value. I was an instructor and sometimes one
of these guys was in my class. That's worth a million bucks right there.<BR>
<BR>
ER: So you hire them like you would an independent contractor?<BR>
<BR>
JT: Yes, only in some cases they are forbidden to accept it and will do
it just as a matter of international cooperation. Going to someone who knows
and saying 'Do you have our equivalent of a credit check? Do you know of
a company doing business as so-and-so and where are they located?' It's
an enormous advantage.<BR>
<BR>
ER: What's been your most astonishing discovery?<BR>
<BR>
JT: The lady who cut up her husband, that was one of them. But there was
another one - one of the biggest chemical technical companies in the country
hired a guy for a cleanup of a hazardous materials site, Superfund. They
hired him for about $100,000 based on his master's degree in chemical engineering,
his experience as a CEO - he had a marvelous resume. He dressed in Brooks
Brothers clothing and he could drink two or three martinis and still not
put the lampshade on. He handled his silver very well and he was a perfect
gentlemen. Well, they did not have him around long, and first thing you
know he'd gone out and gotten himself a Cadillac on the company plastic.
He was running up enormous bills and taking trips to places that never heard
of chemical spills, and pushing people around. So finally I got the case,
and determined he was a liar and a blackguard that had been cited by the
DEA a number of times and started companies that went bankrupt. He'd picked
up a few words here and there and was an avid reader and he was a big faker,
that's all. What happened was there was a class-action suit against the
company for this hazardous materials site he was hired to clean up. Well,
the company was not lily white, and he knew it all. After he figured he
was going to get it anyway, some attorney came to him and wanted to know
whether or not he'd cooperate with them, and he said, 'If I had a couple
bucks I could tell you.' And he did. He cost that company a mint, a lot
of legal grief. For $200, I could have had that faker out before they even
brought him in. He cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars.<BR>
<BR>
ER: So everything you check out by computer and telephone is legal - do
you do surveillance and whatnot as well?<BR>
<BR>
JT: No, I do not. I don't have anybody on the street. What people do call
and ask is about counterelectronic measures. And I tell them look, there
are about 13 or 14 different ways to intercept a conversation. They have
what they call parabolic mikes - you can sit right there, over in that building,
aim it  like a camera. It reads the vibrations off the window from our conversation
and they can reconstruct our conversation. <BR>
<BR>
Everybody's watched too much television. I get something every day advertising
you can listen to your neighbors' conversation three blocks away - that
stuff doesn't work.<BR>
 <BR>
On the other hand, everything here is shredded. I take defensive tactics.
I don't want anyone to know my clients.<BR>
<BR>
Now there's the most productive, cheapest, easiest surveillance in the world
- trash cover. People throw things in the can - and you pay some guy $5
a day to go through it. You can't believe the stuff you can find out. You
can find out what kind of medicine they're taking, whether they've got a
girlfriend, if they're taking trips, or own stock. <BR>

<B><FONT size = +1>Can We Hold Economists<BR>
Hostage for our Economic Woes?</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>Ann Devlin - Columnist</I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>He is Anonymous Economist. And he is ready to talk. I open with a
gentle inquiry: &quot;So why do people hate you guys?&quot; Long pause and
then, &quot;I think economists have become the butt of jokes...&quot;, Anonymous
Economist begins his attempt to explain why his colleagues, to a one, proved
to be some of the most inflammatory talk show guests I ever interviewed.
The conversations always started safely enough, with concise observations
on emerging trends. But then I'd take that first listener phone call and,
yes, Houston, we had ignition.<BR>
<BR>
It seems there were a lot of temple-throbbing folks out there just burning
to get even with one of society's officially sanctioned soothsayers. Get
even for all those forecasts that torpedoed their well-intentioned investments.
Get even for those defeating interest rate fluctuations that forced them
to forego the luxury car ... or the big step-up home. Get even for every
insecurity, real or imagined, in their corporate futures. Rage mattered.
Facts did not.<BR>
<BR>
Anonymous Economist has some thoughts on taking the heat. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Economists have allowed themselves to be viewed as forecasters. And
anyone who does [forecasting] is bound to be wrong, like weather forecasters.
The ability to forecast is very limited. Possibly, in the past, economists
have claimed too much for their       profession.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And history shows just how easily that can happen. The '60s delivered a
Masters of the Universe decade for economists. Just about everyone, it seems,
decided that it was their good judgment and right-on-target forecasting
that delivered all that prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
And yet, Anonymous Economist notes, there were a few other factors going
their way. The economy had emerged unscathed from war and American goods
dominated the world market. Add to that, he says, cheap energy, liberalized
trade and the commercial exploitation of technological developments that
date back to the 1930s: jet aircraft, rocket propulsion technology, a host
of other inventions and, yes, even television.<BR>
 <BR>
It all brought about &quot;a sense of optimism and confidence,&quot; Anony-mous
Economist explains, &quot;a sense the economists knew how to manage or fine-tune
the economy. And that was reflected in an overconfidence about the economists'
ability to forecast and prescribe the right medicine.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But time, as it will, rudely advanced. The 1970s brought high inflation
rates, high interest rates  and a lack of growth in real incomes.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;All of the positives turned slightly negative,&quot; Anonymous Economist
remembers. &quot;The technology cycle was slightly on the downside. World
trade grew at a much slower rate, with many countries turning to protectionism.
There was an eight-fold increase in energy. Bad harvests drove up the price
of food. And all of that was compounded by the bad economic policy of the
Nixon administration.&quot; <BR>
Yes, it was time, the public decided (and maybe some public officials too)
to blame the economists.<BR>
And we've been at it ever since. &quot;That's absurd. People want to lash
out at somebody,&quot; Anonymous Economist says. But then the conversation
turns to the other kind of criticism: corporate. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The point is, many economists failed to address the needs of their
companies. Becoming blinded by the forecasting of the gross domestic product,
they started playing games,&quot; Anonymous Economist asserts, as he looks
back on all those honors given to the most accurate of his colleagues. <BR>
&quot;Instead of forecasting for profits, they were forecasting for prizes,&quot;
and that, he says, is how some economists found themselves out of a job.
Companies, especially industrial ones, now find it all too easy to rely
instead on economic intelligence and forecasts widely available by computer.<BR>
<BR>
Ah, yes, the '90s. Economists can find themselves victims of one of their
own trend projections: outsourcing.<BR>
<BR>
But, the No. 1 reason we don't like economists may come down to this: They
are no fun. We want to believe all things are possible. Economists, however,
never fail to remind us all things come at a price.<BR>
<BR>
And the  price of ending our conversation, I told Anonymous Economist, was
proof that he and his colleagues had a sense of humor to get them through
these difficult times. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;So,&quot; he asked me, &quot;do you know the definition of a male
economist? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;A man who knows 50 different ways to have sex, but he doesn't know
any women,&quot; he answered himself.<BR>
<BR>
P.S. - Anonymous Economist decided during our conversation to decline the
title I offered him. While that didn't stop me from using it, it now gives
me great pleasure to reveal that Anonymous Economist is, in truth, Norman
Robertson, Economic Consultant and Adjunct Professor at Carnegie Mellon
University.                <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Antonini's</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size = +1>Just off the Coast<BR>
of the South Side</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Lydia Strohl </I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
From the outside, Antonini's, at 27th and Jane Street in the South Side,
seems a definite drive-by. Housed in a rather rundown brick building, with
a low paneled addition, the exterior features a large weathered sign with
an arrow pointing to parking and a few faded flags. It may look like a miss,
but hit the brakes and follow the arrow.<BR>
<BR>
The interior hasn't fared much better than the exterior - the addition has
aspirations of being an indoor courtyard, complete with a fountain. An adjoining
room and bar have been repapered and are rather dark. Everything's mauve,
except the little white Christmas lights which grace the  greenery. <BR>
So far, you might think the only thing this joint's got going for it is
that it's a South Side restaurant with a parking lot. Withhold judgment
please, until your mouth is full.<BR>
<BR>
There's Italian in the very foundation of the South Side, but until about
three years ago, there were no Italian restaurants here, excluding pizza
shops. Now they abound, and Antonini's takes top marks. <BR>
<BR>
The menu, graced with a sepia photo of the Italian coast, is where the artistry
of this ristorante begins. The menu is manageably small, yet has a substantial
selection of pastas, meats, poultry and seafood. Items range from traditional
(veal parmesan, $15.25) to unusual (macaroni with lobster and roasted peppers
in a tarragon scented cream sauce, $18.50).<BR>
<BR>
Appetizers, too, give choice to both timid and the adventurous. There are
clams steamed in seasoned oil and garlic ($6.95) or panino fritto, fried
bread dusted with garlic and parmesan ($2.95). We tried calamari, pan-fried
in garlic and oil with fresh plum tomatoes and fresh clipped parsley. It
was wonderful to have a calamari offering that wasn't fried. This was cooked
so lightly and subtly, just softening the squid. A frequent Antonini's specialty
is the sauteed portobella mushrooms - these were two of the largest I'd
ever seen, with stems like ping-pong balls full of fleshy meat. The mushrooms
themselves were cooked to tender perfection and bathed in a rich reduction.
Along with them came grilled Italian bread dotted with partially melted
square of fresh mozzarella. <BR>
<BR>
Without asking, your waitress will bring an antipasto to the table. The
offerings vary, but each time we dined included spicy homemade Italian sausage,
marinated roasted red and green peppers, wedges of polenta and marinated
red potatoes. One night, the  plate hosted a wealth of grilled vegetables
as well; another night, some crisp and marinated green beans.<BR>
<BR>
Next comes a family salad, simple fresh greens and vinaigrette. A bowl of
fresh parmesan and cruet of herbed olive oil accompany Italian bread, which
is unfortunately unexciting.<BR>
<BR>
I admit, on more than one occasion I've just stopped there. The service
here is friendly, down to earth and busy - they don't hassle or hurry you.
In fact, they almost ignore you. As with  the decor, no airs or attitudes
here.<BR>
<BR>
But the food is fresh and luscious. We sampled from both the pasta and the
entree menu. Tempted by the macaroni with artichokes, black olives and sundried
tomatoes in garlic and olive oil ($12.95), I instead dove into the linguine
with lobster, shrimp and scallops in a spicy diablo sauce ($18.95). And
I mean dove. There had to have been six lobster claws, a half a dozen each
large scallops and shrimp. The sauce was a little thin, but rich-tasting
and spicy indeed. By contrast, a scallopini of veal with roasted sweet and
hot peppers, ($15.95) - chosen with difficulty over the chicken stuffed
with ground mushroom stuffing ($14.95) - was sauteed with a rich brown reduction,
subtle and tender. <BR>
The wine list, too, is simple but substantial. A good Pinot Grigio can be
procured for $16, and there are more pricey alternatives as well.<BR>
<BR>
We finished with the smoothest  Tiramisu in my personal experience. Even
the weak coffee couldn't dull Antonini's shine.<BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Staffing Solutions</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Don't Be Left Short When Vacations Start<BR>
Some Firms Use Interns, Others Use Temps<BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Henry Lipput</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>At International Sports Marketing, summer is the busiest time of
the year. But it's also the time when employees take the family to the beach
for a week. And when you factor in sick days or long weekends, it's tough
to maintain adequate staffing. For a small business, that can be crippling.<BR>
ISM's solution, in part, has been simple and inexpensive: It uses interns,
lots of them.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We use interns year-round, but we have more use for them in the summer,&quot;
says Kevin Saundry, ISM's director of account services and internship coordinator.
&quot;Unfortunately our calender of events, while it's spread out throughout
the year, is heavily based around the summer. So for us, the ideal intern
would start around March and end in July or August. We'll have one to two
interns a semester, except for the summer, when we utilize up to six.&quot;
 <BR>
<BR>
Robert Perkoski, director of  placement at the University of Pittsburgh,
says both interns and employers benefit from internships. The employers
benefit because they get a good look at someone who upon graduation may
be considered for a full-time position.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;[The company] can get an idea of what the candidate will be like in
the workplace. And for the candidate it's a good opportunity for them because
they also get experience and they get the opportunity to use some of their
academic skills in the workplace,&quot; Perkoski says. &quot;It's a win-win
situation for a lot of companies, and I think students in particular find
it a great opportunity.<BR>
&quot;In the Pittsburgh market we can have PR, advertising firms, those
kinds of companies. And then students will get the opportunity to go in
and work sometimes 10, 20, even 40 hours a week in the summer. In lots of
cases they'll get the real life experiences as it would be working as a
full-time employee.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Although most internship programs pay very little, Perkoski stresses the
importance of work experience for students that internships provide. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In some fields it's almost absolutely critical,&quot; he says. &quot;If
you're looking at public relations, advertising, radio, television, lots
of those fields, it's almost an absolute requirement.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In other fields, it helps tremendously. In a survey that was done
last year of employers and companies by one of the professional associations,
one of the highest ranked criteria for selecting candidates was previous
work experience in the field.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You can get a chance to prove your talents right there and sometimes
you can just come right on board afterwards and get an offer from the company.&quot;
<BR>
 <BR>
The internship program for all companies, according to Perkoski, is above
and beyond the current staffing that a company has, and there are laws to
ensure that businesses keep it that way.  &quot;So they're really looking
at more of a partnership,&quot; he says, &quot;not to cover a position that's
been let go or something like that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
ISM's internships are unpaid for the most part, but interns the company
feels have shown some potential will have a chance to represent the firm
by going on the road to execute events. These interns are paid a small stipend
and all their business expenses are taken care of. Other firms will compensate
interns, usually an hourly wage.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;We're very flexible with working with them,&quot; says Saundry. &quot;We're
willing to work with students that need to earn money to either pay for
an apartment, if they're from out of town, or just to make money for the
summer.  We don't stand in their way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Employers can solicit interns from just one school, perhaps the company
president's alma mater, or they may solicit from many different schools
to attract a larger pool of candidates. This year, ISM broadened the base
of schools from which is solicits internship applicants.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;In the past we traditionally really only utilized interns from a
couple of sources,&quot; says Saundry, &quot;one being Robert Morris College,
which has been our primary feeder, if you will, of interns. We've had a
relationship with them for over four years, and I am a product of that internship
program. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;And we have three other full-time employees who are products of internships
through our company as well. Part of our refocus this year was to say 'Okay,
let's expand our internship pool and go after interns from varied backgrounds.'
Our needs have somewhat changed focus, and we look at ourselves as more
of a sales-oriented-type agency, so therefore we wanted to come at schools
like Pitt, Duquesne, Slippery Rock, all the local schools, to find the most
qualified candidates with a little bit of a sales background, a little bit
more of a marketing background, than what we had seen in the past.&quot;
 <BR>
<BR>
The other staffing option is the use of temporary employees. According to
Antoinette Grady, general manager for Allegheny Personnel Services, the
peak season for hiring temporaries has traditionally been the summer. <BR>
 <BR>
However, she says, &quot;we've been noticing a constant, more steady flow
throughout the year.&quot;<BR>
Like internships, a temp agency may provide an eventual employee.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I believe a lot of people realize now that the temporaries services
are a very viable source for recruiting,&quot; says Grady.<BR>

<B><I><FONT size=+1>The Wide Array of Local MBA Offerings Allows<BR>
Students to Tailor a Program To Their Own Career</FONT></I></B><BR>
<I>By Gretchen McKay</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>During the '80s, you couldn't walk the halls of corporate America
without bumping into an MBA grad.<BR>
<BR>
Ten years later, little has changed: In fact, the Master's of Business Administration
degree is as popular as ever, with more than 800 business schools across
the U.S. offering some 1,300 programs.<BR>
<BR>
That should ben no surprise. William Presutti, associate dean and director
of graduate studies at Duquesne University, says an advanced business degree
is almost mandatory  to climb the corporate ladder. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;With corporate downsizing, there are fewer career tracks. People are
looking for ways to differentiate themselves,&quot; he says, noting that
the credential has become so prevalent it may work against you not to have
it. <BR>
 <BR>
But today's MBA programs bear little resemblance to those of a decade ago.
For one, students are older, more likely to have work experience or be going
to school part-time.<BR>
<BR>
And thanks to the globalization of the U.S. economy, the '90s MBA programs
have more emphasis on the international. And increasing numbers of international
students deepen the understanding of cultural, social and political differences
among peoples.<BR>
<BR>
Duquesne, which offers the traditional MBA as well as a Master of Science
in Information Systems Management (MS/MIS), has reshaped its curriculum
to require courses in communications, computers and quantitative and qualitative
problem solving. Both programs also integrate four major themes into all
of their courses: ethics, the globalization of business, total quality management
and the management of technology (computer literacy).<BR>
<BR>
And Duquesne has replaced the &quot;case method&quot; of learning business
with a more &quot;hands-on&quot; approach where real business people come
in to present actual issues or problems. The University of Pittsburgh's
Katz School of Business takes a similar tack.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We demand it,&quot; says associate dean Daniel Fogel. Pitt students
team up with area businesses for class projects. &quot;There's no secondary
research, just real problems and real solutions.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Teamwork, too, is a priority. Every student goes through the entire MBA
program as a member of a &quot;learning organization.&quot; These students
acquire team-based skills, and learn how work gets done in a real corporation,
says Fogel, where people with different  viewpoints must reach consensus.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Businesses want students to understand that the world doesn't work
as neatly as in a computer program,&quot; he says. &quot;They have to be
able to deal with uncertainties...to develop interpersonal skills so they
can deal with other people.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
Pitt offers traditional two-year MBA and MS/MIS programs, as well as the
FLEX-MBA, where students earn their degree electronically via fax, E-mail
and videotape. Students can also choose between an 11-month MBA, two 2-year
dual degrees and three international dual degrees.<BR>
Bill Donley, a Koppers vice president, says the FLEX-MBA program expands
his own business experience. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've been with Koppers for seventeen years, so I don't have a great
perspective on how other companies are run,&quot; he says. Through the degree,
he'll discover how things happen both in Pittsburgh and around the world.<BR>
<BR>
Point Park College emphasizes global markets, too, and is the only school
in the area to offer an international MBA. The program echoes the traditional
MBA but goes one step further by integrating international dimensions into
each class. In addition to electives in international accounting, advertising
and marketing, students gain an overview of management practices and government
policies in Europe, the Middle East, Latin America and East Asia.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We can't isolate an economy anymore,&quot; says program director Dimitris
Kraniou. &quot;The name of the game is global competition. American executives
know they have to deal with international business forces.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Looking to specialize? In addition to the traditional MBA, business students
at Robert Morris College can opt for the MBA or Master of Science (M.S.)
with a concentration in accounting, computer and information systems, finance,
health services management, marketing or sports management. Those with enough
undergraduate business courses can also choose the one-day-a-week MBA, which
takes two years to complete.<BR>
<BR>
How's the job market for MBAs in the Pittsburgh area? Still good, says Joan
Craig, director of placement and career services at Pitt. Those with the
dual MBA/MS-MIS do especially well, she adds, as the need for more technically
oriented graduates increases.  MBAs with some relevant work experience can
earn an average of $51,000; new grads command from $37,000 to $40,000 a
year.<BR>
<BR>
Craig admits, though, that an increasing number of graduates must leave
the city for employment. Most jobs here are in service industries.<BR>
<BR>
The bottom line, she says, is that the MBA is still a very marketable degree.<BR>
 &quot;Employers are always looking for bright young people,&quot; she says.
The MBA, she says, is the degree of choice.<BR>

<B><FONT size=+1>College Athletic Departments Struggle to Comply With<BR>
a Federal Law That Calls for Gender Equality<BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Bill Modoono</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>College athletics has always been about great rivalries. Army-Navy
in football, Duke-North Carolina in basketball, Harvard-Yale in crew.<BR>
<BR>
In recent years, however, new rivalries have sprouted up and, unlike their
predecessors, they produce very few winners. In fact, it's hard to even
know how to keep score when you pit men's gymnastics against women's tennis
or men's wrestling against women's soccer.<BR>
<BR>
But those kind of matchups are becoming increasingly commonplace in colleges
and universities as athletic departments struggle with ways to equalize
opportunities in sports for both men and women.<BR>
<BR>
The struggle is not motivated entirely by a search for equality. A legal
mandate -  Title IX of the Education Act of 1972, which bars sex discrimination
in schools that receive federal funding - hangs over the entire enterprise.
Living with Title IX is sometimes difficult, sometimes costly and often
perplexing for college administrators striving to do the right thing.<BR>
<BR>
Consider, for instance, Pitt. In 1995, Athletic Director Oval Jaynes had
to do something lots of corporations have done in the '90s - downsize. He
eliminated the men's gymnastics program and the men's tennis program and
added women's soccer as a varsity sport. The two-steps-back-one-step-forward
approach was Pitt's latest attempt to satisfy one of the demands of Title
IX; namely, if your school is 50 percent female, then approximately 50 percent
of your athletes should be female as well.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;With a Division I football program that has 108 athletes on it,&quot;
Jaynes says, &quot;and with the largest female team having only 27 women,
this becomes a very, very difficult thing to reach.&quot;<BR>
But the effort must be made. In 1993, in a landmark case involving Indiana
University of Pennsylvania, IUP was ordered to reinstate two women's sports
teams that had been dropped for budgetary reasons. The judge ruled that
lack of money was no excuse when opportunities for female athletes are involved.
Around the nation, more than a half dozen colleges have been sued over potential
Title IX inequities.<BR>
<BR>
Jaynes realizes that while decreasing opportunities for male athletes is
not the ideal way to make things work, it is a quick and efficient way.
Decisions are based on expenses, a survey of student interests and the amount
of participation, Jaynes says.<BR>
<BR>
Pitt will start the 1996-97 school year with nine male sports and nine female
sports. Traditionally at most Division I schools, sports are paid for by
revenues generated by the top money-makers - football and men's basketball.
<BR>
<BR>
Supporters of Title IX claim that schools like Pitt that cut men's teams
to reach equity figures are using the legal mandate as a scapegoat. &quot;An
excuse is what it is,&quot; says Arthur Bryant of the Trial Lawyers for
Public Justice, a Washington public-interest law firm that has handled most
Title IX lawsuits, including the IUP case.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's an equality law. The way Title IX is interpreted doesn't mean
you have to eliminate men's sports.&quot; To Bryant, the issue is financial.
Schools are facing difficult economic times, but are nonetheless reluctant
to trim the fat from the main revenue sports - football and men's basketball.
He cites one common Division I practice - having the football team spend
the night before a home game at a local hotel - as a wasteful practice.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The cost of that alone could pay for a minor sport for a year,&quot;
Bryant says. Still, it is hard for athletic directors to cut corners in
the major sports. For one, being frugal could hurt recruiting and give opponents
a competitive advantage. Two, most ADs are evaluated on the major sports'
success. <BR>
So it is sometimes more politically expedient to drop a men's sport with
little student support - such as gymnastics, swimming, water polo and wrestling
- rather than trim the football budget. <BR>
According to Bob Bubb, former wrestling coach at Clarion University and
executive director of the National Wrestling Coaches Association, over 60
Division I schools have dropped wrestling in the past five years.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It makes you angry,&quot; says Bubb, who thinks the matter needs to
be resolved by Congress. &quot;It's not the law that's bad, it's the interpretation
of <BR>
the law.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The important thing,&quot; says Jaynes, &quot;is to make the decisions
for the right reasons. I care about the student athletes at Pitt, male and
female, and that drives every decision I make.&quot; <BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Double Jeopardy</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Employers Face Legal Obstacles On<BR>
Both Ends of Employee Reference Checks<BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Jim Urban</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Jim Treher conducts background checks for a living, and oh, can he
tell some stories. There's the woman who used her twin sister's college
degree to get a job offer. There's the would-be MBA graduate who actually
only completed a few credits toward the degree. There's the corporate executive
whose professional experience wasn't what he said it was.<BR>
<BR>
And those were the cases in which no one really got hurt, outside of a little
wasted time and money. This past spring, the stakes were higher: A meter
reader was arrested and charged with raping a woman inside her Westmoreland
County home. The employee, who worked for a subcontractor that Peoples Gas
Co. had hired to read meters, had a criminal history of burglary, theft,
auto theft and criminal mischief. No one checked.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The best reason to do a background check is because the employers
are absolutely responsible for seeing that the people they hire are not
dangerous,&quot; says Treher, a retired FBI agent and president of Pittsburgh-based
Corporate Investigations Inc. (for more on Treher and his work, see People
Making News on page 10).<BR>
<BR>
But finding out information about prospective employees is not always easy,
even when a veteran investigator like Treher is doing the digging.<BR>
 <BR>
One problem: Former employers - fearing legal action if they give a negative
reference - often will only confirm the dates of employment, the job title
and salary.<BR>
<BR>
Another problem: only 40 percent of the states - fortunately Pennsylvania
is one - will release a criminal's rap sheet to the public.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Neutral References</B><BR>
<BR>
Pennsylvania courts have held that employers have a conditional privilege
to communicate defamatory information when asked by a prospective employer
to evaluate the employee's performance. Yet employers, often at the prodding
of legal counsel, limit the information they disclose about a former employee
- even if that employee was exemplary. <BR>
<BR>
In a recent Robert Half International poll of 200 executives from the country's
1,000 largest companies, 68 percent said that it was hard to obtain reference
information about a prospective employee. And another survey of human resource
professionals showed 41 percent worked at companies with policies against
providing any outside references for former employees.<BR>
<BR>
But this blanket &quot;no comment&quot; practice, as it's known in some
legal circles, is not as foolproof as once thought. It actually has spawned
a new line of lawsuits in which former employers have been sued for not
disclosing information about an employee's questionable past. In other words,
even saying nothing can come back to haunt the former employer.<BR>
<BR>
In Florida, for example, the families of several people killed in a workplace
shooting sued the gunman's previous employer for not disclosing the gunman's
&quot;dangerous propensities.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Specifically, the families charged that the former employer witnessed the
man threaten coworkers with guns, espouse belief in aliens and worship the
devil. Yet, this same man - later a murderer - had a letter of reference
from the former employer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You've got walk a thin line there,&quot; says attorney Theresa Wasser
of Doepken Keevican &amp; Weiss in Pittsburgh. &quot;If you know this person
has the propensity to do something criminal, you absolutely have to disclose
that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Some good advise: Have departing employees sign a release in which the employees
consent to disclosure of information relevant to work history. When a reference
query comes in, it's best to speak honestly and avoid puffery. Don't disclose
information related to the employee's physical or mental health. The employee
may later accuse you of firing him or her because of a physical or mental
disability.<BR>
<BR>
On the other side of the hiring process, employers should have prospective
employees sign a release authorizing former employers to provide work history
information. Check with multiple references to draw a more complete picture
of the applicant, and be attentive to what the references don't say. What
they don't discuss may be a red flag. <BR>

</FONT></I><FONT size =+1>In the Footsteps of Yet Another National Trend,<BR>
Women Choose Mid wifery Over Medicine</B></FONT><BR>
<I>By Cynthia Bent</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>When Kelli Huss had her first baby, all eyes were on her ... 20 in
all. Crowded into the birthing suite with her were husband Mark, mother
Jan, sister-in-law Darlene, cousin Lynette, mother-in-law Charlene, Aunt
Carol, Mark's Aunt Kay, even Kelli's 10-year-old sister Leanne. All of them
fit, and there still was room for two certified nurse midwives from Family
Nurse Midwife Associates. <BR>
In a traditional hospital setup, Huss's choice of company would have been
impossible - husbands only. But the midwives gave the power of decision
to Huss and her husband.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Everything was exactly the way I wanted,&quot; she says. &quot;They
have a special connection with my daughter now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Certified nurse midwives are not really new. Midwives in one form or another
have been around for as long as women have given birth. But more and more
women in the western Pennsylvania area are choosing midwives over obstetricians,
reflecting a trend that's already overtaken most of the rest of the country.
<BR>
<BR>
Midwives offer more personal attention, more empowerment to the family,
less traumatic births and a cheaper bill. Numerous studies, including one
by the Institute of Medicine in Washington, D.C., and one by the United
States Congress, Office of Technology Assessment, show that certified nurse
midwives are safe, cost-effective and educated practitioners. Far from the
traditional image of a lay woman with a bonnet and a bucket of hot water,
modern nurse midwives are formally educated and rigorously certified. They're
backed up by obstetricians, insured and operate mostly in hospitals or specialized
birth centers. Family Nurse Midwife Associates, for instance, is based in
Westmoreland County at Jeannette Hospital. <BR>
<BR>
The midwife philosophy is that birth is a normal process. &quot;Low-tech,
high-touch&quot; is an oft-used  catch phrase.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;We believe that childbirth is a normal event that happens in a family's
life, rather than a potential medical disaster,&quot; says Nancy Ritenour
of Family Nurse Midwife Associates.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're alert to problems, but we attend to normalcy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Not that midwives stint on attention to their patients. Intensive prenatal
care is a cornerstone of practice. Midwives universally take at least half-hour-long
appointments. They take pride in their consideration of the whole family,
using appointment time for education about diet, emotional issues and family
adjustment.<BR>
<BR>
Midwives educate and counsel, but urge mothers to take control of their
pregnancies. The family draws up a birth plan saying exactly what they want
- who will be there, how much monitoring they want, yea or nay to an episiotomy.
When labor actually starts, the midwife stays with the woman from the moment
she checks in. Use of fetal monitors and IV drugs is minimal. Birth is seen
as normal and natural unless something happens to suggest otherwise.  The
mother does whatever she wants to - walk, take a hot bath, sip tea, sit
in a rocking chair, take any position she chooses, and nature takes her
course relatively unassisted. In case of complications, backup doctors are
there in the hospital (at stand-alone centers, the patient is transported
to the nearby affiliated hospital). But while Caesarean sections are performed
in 25 percent of traditional births, they are used in just 4 percent of
midwife-assisted births.<BR>
<BR>
Yet some women do not feel midwifery is for them, despite the safety nets.
Critics charge that midwives in some centers urge women who request drugs
to &quot;tough it out,&quot; and some centers have no-epidurals policies.
Though early discharge policies (some as early as 12 hours) are unsettling
to some, most women are ready to go, and are visited by a nurse within 72
hours. <BR>
<BR>
At BirthPlace, the only stand-alone birthing center in the region, women
who find they must have some relief during labor can have Stedol, a synthetic
narcotic, at the center or be transported, accompanied by the midwife, to
affiliated West Penn Hospital.  The center itself is in a Victorian house
on Baum Boulevard, one half mile away. It boasts five midwives and  two
birthing suites, outfitted like Holly Hobby's bedroom, with lacy curtains
and bedspreads, pink and blue wallpaper, even straw hats on the walls. A
bathroom with a jacuzzi-jet tub and a complete kitchen round out the comfort
 zone.<BR>
<BR>
But beneath the homeyness, each bedroom can transform instantly to a hospital
unit. Cabinets hold cotton, antiseptics, sharps; an oxygen tank lurks in
a corner under a pillowcase, and the hat hanger over the bed doubles as
an IV hook.<BR>
<BR>
The result of all this extra care, ironically enough, is a lower bill. Excluding
treatments and procedures most women don't need, preventing cesarean sections,
and providing early discharges add up to less. The average bill for a hospital
birth can range anywhere from $7,000 to $10,000; the national average is
$4,000 for a birth center.<BR>
<BR>
But  western Pennsylvania has not quite caught up. This is surprising, since
midwives' cost-effectiveness makes nurse-midwifery attractive to insurers
and HMOs. Nurse midwife services are covered by almost all insurance plans;
BirthPlace is an alternative with all the HMOs and carriers in the area,
and is covered by Medicaid, though not always by Medicare.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our perspective is that nurse midwives who are licensed to practice
in Pennsylvania are considered safe practitioners and that they provide
a good service for our members,&quot; says Dr. Carey Vinson, regional medical
director for Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania. All the safeguards taken
by midwives mean they have no problem finding malpractice insurance, either.
BirthPlace pays the same rates as  obstetricians attached to West Penn.<BR>
<BR>
So why hasn't nurse midwifery boomed here? Nearby Philadelphia has 20-plus
midwives, to Pittsburgh's handful.<BR>
<BR>
One reason is lack of advertising. Most people have never heard of the option.
Midwives also face stiff competition from the large local population of
obstetricians. But nurse midwives put the onus on the consumer. <BR>
 <BR>
&quot;There's not much proactiveness here on the part of women,&quot; says
Jane Butler, a nurse midwife from the San Francisco area.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;It's not as if hospitals in California said, 'OK, we're going to
change things and make everything nice for you.' The women said, 'Look,
we don't want it like this anymore.' &quot;         <BR>

<FONT SIZE=+>Managing Managed Care<BR>
</FONT SIZE><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl</I> </CENTER>
<P><HR>Hannah Rose Nickeson was born eight weeks premature. At first there
seemed to be no undue threat to her health: Hannah, though tiny, had only
some typical liver problems. But at three months, an extremely high temperature
prompted her parents to rush her to the ER.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, she had a septic kidney infection. Doctors found that her ureters,
which conduct the flow from the kidney to the bladder, had developed at
the wrong angle; urine backup was causing the infection. A 10-day course
of antibiotics treated the infection, but doctors found mysterious calcium
deposits in her kidneys. High levels of calcium were also found in her urine.
When the infection returned three months later, an operation was scheduled
to correct the ureters. And the calcium conditions (called nephrocalcinosis
and hypercalcuria) led to years of doctors, pills and tests for the small
child, as experts tried to advise the family on how to manage these conditions
and prevent the calcium buildup from leading to blockage.<BR>
<BR>
That's easier said than done. Hannah's condition is baffling. Usually, problems
such as she experiences (and they are not common) are manifestations of
syndromes which are also accompanied by mental or physical retardation.
The early infections arrested the growth of her left kidney, but Hannah
shows no sign of developmental problems - now almost 5, she's smart, creative,
adventurous and incredibly cute. She loves bugs and ropes - just your typical
kid.<BR>
If it seems a miracle that a child with such a mysterious and potentially
dangerous condition is so healthy now, consider this: At the time she was
born, Hannah's family belonged to a managed care plan, and they still do.
Despite the horror stories that abound about the difficulty and limitations
of managed care, the Nickesons were able to secure the best care they knew
about for her. Granted, both parents work in the healthcare field, and neither
is a pushover. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You have to be willing to work with and shop within the system,&quot;
says Ellie Nickeson, Hannah's mom, a social worker in the Ventilator Assisted
Children/Home Program of Western Pennsylvania. <BR>
&quot;You have to understand your limitations and look for and get other
things. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;But you also have to be willing to accept the limitations,&quot; she
adds. &quot;We've gone outside the system. We've paid for things we feel
we need that aren't covered.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
At this stage, developmental problems are no longer a threat. Hannah continues
to have high levels of calcium in her urine, but at last check had no further
deposits in her kidneys. Her left kidney has begun to grow again. It's a
mystery where the calcium comes from, or why she has the condition in the
first place. Generally, problems of this sort are genetic, but in her case
that doesn't seem so. One Chicago specialist calls her condition the Hannah
Nickeson Syndrome - because he has never seen anything like it before. Now
managed by medication, there seems little threat to her future health.<BR>
As Pittsburgh moves toward managed care, more and more people like the Nickesons
will have to advocate for themselves in the healthcare system. In the managed
care framework, no longer is it acceptable to go for care where you see
fit - and expect insurance to cover it. Rules and regulations born of cost
containment are limiting care in all manner of ways. To achieve their desired
result - a happy, healthy daughter - the Nickesons have researched, appealed
and discussed their hearts out during the last five years. Perhaps you don't
think it should be necessary to do so, but don't waste too much time bemoaning
that state of affairs. The fact is, you might have to, too.<BR>
<BR>
Executive Report's two-part series entitled Managing Managed Care will detail
the choices necessary to make a smooth transition to managed care. This
month, choosing a plan. In the July issue, using it to get proper care.<BR>
<BR>
Choosing a Plan<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Managed care&quot; means just that. To control costs, managed care
plans limit the care to which their subscribers have access. While that
does not mean a patient cannot get treatment for a health condition, it
does mean that they must follow certain guidelines in pursuing their care,
typically within networks of providers that the insurers contract with in
large volume. In an HMO, or health maintenance organization, the member
is only covered for services from providers in the network. The more popular
POS, or point-of-service programs, allow members to use providers outside
of the network at a higher cost (for definitions of common managed-care
terms, see Chronicles on page 8). Theoretically, the tighter the controls,
the more costs can be cut out of the system.<BR>
Though managed care is relatively new to western Pennsylvania, the market
is already burgeoning. Experts surmise that over 50 percent of the private
health insurance market is insured under managed care, up from just 7 percent
in 1990, as more and more employers turn to managed care to help control
skyrocketing benefit costs. Sometimes employees have a choice of plans and
sometimes they do not; Blue Cross, for example, cuts out competition by
giving tempting rates to employers who offer only their products, which
limits employees' choices. Locally, Blue Cross, with Keystone Health Plan,
its HMO, and Select Blue, a POS option, is estimated to dominate with over
50 percent of the managed care market; U.S. Healthcare, HealthAmerica and
Advantage Health Plan also provide managed care here. All offer an array
of managed care products, each with varying degrees of freedom for the consumer.<BR>
<BR>
Employees confronting a choice of managed care plans usually have an ace
in the hole: their corporate human resources personnel. They've probably
done a lot of research on the plans being offered and will share it. <BR>
<BR>
The plans, too, are good sources of information. They do regular member
satisfaction surveys, and keep records of complaints and re-enrollment rates
for both doctors and members. And if they're unresponsive in giving information
to you, it may be indicative of their customer service. Make sure you ask
about that too: Find out the hours they have real people on the line to
talk about your concerns. Better yet, ask around. People you know who use
these plans are the best sources.<BR>
There are outside organizations that monitor and accredit these healthcare
plans. At the national level, the National Committee on Quality Assurance
has standardized measures for quality, called HEDIS data, which are the
basis for plan &quot;report cards.&quot; They also provide comparative information
useful in benchmarking a plan's effectiveness in these areas. NCQA has a
voluntary accreditation process, in which plans are reviewed under 50 standards
in the areas of quality improvement, physician credentials, members' rights
and responsibilities, preventive health services, utilization management
and medical records. Only 37 percent of plans actually have full accreditation,
and the information is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.ncqa.org,
or by calling NCQA at 202/955-3515.<BR>
Another national organization, the Center for the Study of Services, has
also published plan-by-plan ratings, gleaned from a survey of 150,000 HMO
members nationwide. Advantage Health Plan and HealthAmerica are the only
two Pittsburgh HMOs represented; the ratings cover access, quality and choice
($12; call 800/475-7283).<BR>
<BR>
At the state level, HMOs and PPOs must be licensed by the department of
insurance; industry insiders say Pennsylvania has some of the best standards
in place of any state. But while information about the plans is compiled
by the state, they have yet to make this information available to consumers.<BR>
<BR>
Locally, however, the Pittsburgh Business Group on Health has also done
some benchmarking of plans. Their information is available on three local
plans, HealthAmerica, Keystone Health Plan and U.S. Healthcare. It compiles
findings on the physicians and hospitals in the networks, along with member
satisfaction rankings, such as ease of making appointments and whether members
would recommend the plan. The information has been published in their publication,
Health Pages, which periodically runs information on other aspects of the
local healthcare industry as well (for subscription info call 212/505-0103).<BR>
<BR>
To further assess the health of the organization, Angela Walker of Johnson
and Higgins recommends checking its financial stability. &quot;Especially
with some of the smaller companies - you want to be sure they'll be around
in a couple of years, and be sure the company can pay their bills,&quot;
says Walker. One source is Best's Insurance Reports. To secure a copy, call
800-424-BEST.<BR>
Another financial factor that can affect the quality of care is the method
managed care companies use to compensate doctors and hospitals. Traditional
indemnity plans paid for services on an as-used basis. But as managed care
networks buy or partner with physician groups to streamline their services,
more and more doctors in the area are on the staff of managed care plans
and receive a salary. One way managed care motivates providers they contract
with for services to be judicious caregivers is by paying them a capitated
fee: one lump sum per member per month, regardless of the services performed.
Capitation rates for primary care range from $7 to $24 per month, depending
on factors like age and level of illness; physicians sometimes also receive
bonuses or withholds based on their patterns of referral and usage of ancillary
services. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;At present, most of these are based on utilization - experience, referrals
and the number of other services they use, and not on other aspects of performance,&quot;
says Marvin Gaynor, a professor at CMU's Heinz School of Public Policy.
Theoretically, these policies could cause doctors to be too conservative
doling out services. &quot;Although that is changing. It might be hard to
find out how doctors are compensated from the HMO, because they do not have
a single uniform contract with physicians.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Gaynor recommends asking your physician how he is compensated, and how that
level compares to true expenditures, to gauge these issues.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What's Up, Doc?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Accreditation status, all these things are useful, but they're of
little value to the consumer,&quot; asserts Robert Achenbach, deputy secretary
for quality assurance and health planning in the Pennsylvania Department
of Insurance's Bureau of healthcare financing, which is responsible for
monitoring managed care plans.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;People make the choice by providers, doctors and hospitals,&quot;
he says.<BR>
<BR>
In managed care plans, patients are generally monitored by their primary
care physician, who becomes their &quot;gatekeeper&quot; to care. All care,
except in the case of extreme emergency, must be coordinated by the primary
care physician, who may be a family practitioner, internal medicine physician
or pediatrician, depending on the needs of the patient. <BR>
<BR>
The gatekeeper concept is meant to ensure that the patient is not making
treatment decisions that are unnecessary or inefficient, thus taking cost
out of the system. It also ensures that the patient will make decisions
with the help of someone who not only knows the healthcare system, but who
has access to all th patient's records and knows the patient's history,
which can figure prominently in treatment decisions. In the past, cases
in which a patient might have gone to the more expensive care of a specialist
might have been just as competently handled by the primary care physician.<BR>
<BR>
And, in this world of increasing rules and regulations from healthcare insurers,
the primary care physician should become a patient advocate, helping them
through a now-confusing system of referrals, authorizations and limitations
on service.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's essential for the consumer to understand when they join a managed
care plan that they are putting their faith in the hands of a primary care
physician medical manager,&quot; says Tom Chepel, who works with Achenbach
in the bureau of healthcare financing. &quot;An essential provision consumers
should look for is whether your primary care physician is in the plan.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
If you have a doctor you trust, check the networks that are offered through
the various plans to see if he or she is involved. Do the same with specialists
and hospitals you prefer and trust. The HMOs all have lists of providers
they contract with for care.<BR>
<BR>
If you do need to choose a new primary care physician, look at the list
of providers and determine what kind of service you need - pediatric, for
young kids and teens; family or internal medicine, for older folks. Then
look at where the doctors are geographically, or call your local hospital,
describe your needs and ask them to refer a doctor. <BR>
<BR>
Last but not least, call the physician's office. Find out where they were
educated, and whether they have board certification. If the physician has
teaching responsibilities at an area school or hospital, that's also a plus.
Make sure that they're taking new patients (many primary care physicians,
particularly in rural areas, have become overrun with the new structure
of managed care) and ask how long it takes to get an appointment.<BR>
<BR>
The relationship that your doctor has with the managed care company is also
important. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Find out if the doctor knows and wants to participate in managed care,
or has to do it to survive,&quot; says Dr. Richard Harris, president of
the Allegheny County Medical Society. &quot;Ask about the procedures for
referrals and emergencies, because the booklets are very misleading. They
may say the ER is covered, but you may have to go through your doctor and
have other restrictions.&quot;<BR>
Conflicts between doctors and plans usually arise from the plans' requirements
for making referrals and using ancillary services, like blood tests and
x-rays. Dr. Marc Schneiderman calls it the &quot;hassle factor.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The playing field is even - if the patient needs an x-ray, every insurance
company will give it to them. It's where you want that care, and how much
you're willing to pay for that,&quot; says Schneiderman, a primary care
physician with Fifth Avenue Medical Associates in Coraopolis. Though they
have the capability of doing both x-rays and blood work in the office, some
of the HMOs they contract with will only pay for these services to be done
at certain labs. &quot;So they have to go to the hospital, park, go to the
lab, check in -that's an hour and a half right there.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Schneiderman also suggests asking your doctor's office about the HMO's guidelines.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The HMO will tell you if the doctor chooses to do it in the office
he can - but they don't tell you they won't pay for that. Our office will
tell you what we will do depending on the coverage you have.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The same thing goes, he says, for referrals to other physicians.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A lot of HMOs are advertising coverage for chiropractic services.
If you call the HMO and ask if you can go they'll say, 'Yes, if your primary
care physician refers you.' But they don't say, 'We have restrictions on
the doctor,' &quot; says Schneiderman. &quot;To refer to a chiropractor,
it has to be an acute problem, less than 10 days old, not recurring, and
the patient has to have finished a course of physical therapy and seen an
orthopedic surgeon to say the problem is not curable by surgery.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Then I look like a schmuck. It's the hassle factor that HMOs build
in that saves them money.&quot;<BR>
Harris recommends checking other aspects of a doctor's involvement with
the plan, too.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Ask how long they've been in managed care - if it's more than two
years, their offices will be better at dealing with it. It's a function
of learning the system and being reasonably good at it,&quot; says Harris.
<BR>
&quot;Also, how much of their practice is managed care? It's got to be a
significant portion, so they're set up to deal with it. Ten percent is not
enough, but 70 percent is too much, because you don't care. My office at
40 percent is almost impossible.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Because managed care requires authorization for almost every step of treatment,
doctors have had to add staff to handle the extra load both the insurers
and the patients demand. Physicians spend a lot of time on the phone with
the insurers too - often explaining their course of treatment to a paper
pusher.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have to explain to a person who doesn't understand what I'm going
to do. When an office has over 50 percent of patients in managed care, they
just can't do all that fighting, so they don't go to bat for their patient,&quot;
says Harris. &quot;Also, with managed care, the number of visits is higher,
because the co-pays are low; they come to the office with a hangnail. There's
a lot more to do to take care of them the way you need to.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>All Plans are not Equal</B><BR>
<BR>
The bulk of grievances and complaints lodged by consumers of managed care,
according to the state bureau of healthcare licensing, are benefit-related.
HMOs are contractually obligated to cover you according to the benefits
and limitations of your specific package - not to cure you as you see fit.
Review the coverage available to you carefully, because there is no one-size-fits-all
plan - every company negotiates their own package of benefits.<BR>
 <BR>
Only you know what kind of coverage you need. If you or someone in your
family has special needs, look to see that those services are covered, and
to what extent. Really probe: Check the number of allowable visits, the
use of diagnostics, the HMO's attitude on experimental treatment.<BR>
Fortunately or unfortunately, however, many consumers are making decisions
about their care when they're healthy - so they don't know specifically
what they need. One important aspect if you are healthy is preventive services.
Though that's a charge to managed care, they don't always fulfill it. Check
what kinds of services are actually included: Checkups, immunizations, lifestyle
modification programs and even co-pays on health club memberships are among
the offerings. Also look at the coverage of any non-disease-oriented health
services you may need, like birth control, optical benefits, even infertility
treatments. <BR>
<BR>
The key is not to think just in the short run. Make sure the plan has the
depth of service you would like to have when you're sick - the right numbers
and locations of well-respected specialists and hospitals, continuity of
care options like mental health benefits. Remember, though, that it is largely
your own doctor who will determine your hospital - so find out the affiliations
of the doctors you will use. Also check into policies on allowed lengths
of hospital stays. More is not always better - but make sure the managed
care company will cover a continuity of care, such as a rehabilitation facility
or home nursing if you don't have someone at home to take care of you.<BR>
<BR>
Another important difference is pharmaceuticals - many HMOs have formularies,
specific lists of drugs they cover. HMOs save money by having doctors stick
to the formulary, because they can buy those medicines in volume. Trouble
is, those drugs aren't always the most effective for treatment, so patients
may end up with the choice of paying more or getting less. <BR>
<BR>
Check with your doctor to see how much freedom he has in these issues; also
ask about treatment protocols. &quot;Find out what leeway there is in treatment;
there may be protocols for physicians,&quot; says CMU's Gaynor. (Protocol
is a roadmap for treating an illness.) &quot;Who's approving those on the
other end? Is it an administrator? A nurse? And how much flexibility does
the doctor have in following their protocol?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Emergency service is another stickler - because care must be routed through
the primary care physician, HMOs routinely turn down bills for service enrollees
deemed &quot;emergency.&quot; <BR>
It's policies like these that can make dealing with HMOs difficult - so
find out the restrictions before you run smack into them.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The only thing you can be guided by is a knowledge of yourself and
the predictors your lifestyle has for illness,&quot; says Dr. Sean McLinden,
executive director of the Pittsburgh Health Research Institute at Duquesne
University. &quot;You can identify needs based on certain lifestyle choices
- like prenatal care. And if I drive fast and reckless, I ought to pay attention
to my trauma coverage. <BR>
&quot;If you have a point of service plan, you can go outside the network,
but may receive no compensation. Usually, for a specialty illness, the plan
doesn't cover it. And you can do very little under the current system, because
you're locked in for a contract year.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Knowing the system, and having your doctor as an advocate, can help. But
not always, so check on your re-enrollment options - generally, subscribers
may only switch plans once a year.  But if you voluntarily move to another
plan and have a pre-existing condition, it may not be covered.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Almighty Dollar</B><BR>
<BR>
At the root of managed care is cost, and the dollar savings on the surface
of the plan may look tempting. But take the time to sit down and actually
figure out, to the best of your ability, what a year with either plan will
cost you. Figure in everything that's covered and not covered. If a service
is not covered, call and find out what it will actually cost you to pay
for it out of the network. Figure in the cost of premiums, which are fixed
monthly contributions; co-pays, which are amounts you must contribute for
services or prescriptions; deductibles, if any, and the amounts you will
pay before insurance kicks in. Some plans cover preventive necessities,
like checkups and  immunizations, others don't. Factor in your own needs.One
important element is what insurance companies call benefit maximums. Some
plans will have lifetime maximums putting a dollar amount on care you may
receive in a lifetime. This may be ridiculous if a family member has a critical
illness. Other plans may have limits on the amount you are allowed to spend
out of network.<BR>
Once you come up with a true measure of what the cost of the plan will be
to you and your family, think about the hassle factor. Weigh the savings
against the extra you'll have to do if services you or your family need
are all the way across town.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a big difference between what people say they want and what
they will insist on,&quot; says McLinden. &quot;If you ask patients, they'll
say restriction is a big issue - but if the cost of the plan increases more
than $120 a year, they will give up choice.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In traditional fee-for-service plans, it wasn't so necessary to think ahead.
Now, in the managed care climate, it's beneficial to look as far ahead as
you possibly can. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are no guarantees - but if you ensure your family a certain
depth of coverage, and learn the system, that's one for you. <BR>
<BR>
Next month, we'll help you work the system you've chosen.

<B><FONT size=+2>Tax Reform </FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Business Has Yet to Recover What it<BR>
Lost Back in 1991</FONT></B><BR>
<I>By Jim Urban</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>It was the Top 10 list on which nobody wanted to be, but the cities
of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were right at the top. <BR>
<BR>
Vertex Inc., an eastern Pennsylvania software development firm, outlined
in a detailed study the tax burden on businesses in 25 metropolitan cities.
And the message the study gave about Pennsylvania was loud and clear: We're
No. 1.<BR>
<BR>
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh were actually Nos. 1 and 2 respectively in tax
burden, both well ahead of New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities.
No one should have been surprised.<BR>
<BR>
It all dated back to 1991, when the legislature and then-Gov. Robert Casey
resolved a budget impasse largely by raising taxes impacting business. The
1991 budget pushed the corporate net income tax from 8.5 percent to a national
high of 12.25 percent. On top of that they piled an increase in the capital
stock and franchise tax on corporate assets.<BR>
<BR>
And it gets worse. That year, the state eliminated the net-operating loss
carry-forward and initiated a 6 percent sales tax on a variety of computer
services, including data processing services such as those that prepare
payroll checks, as well as software writing and system design. Accountants
all around the state complained that no other state had such a tax.<BR>
<BR>
The message to business: Steer clear of  Pennsylvania.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;State taxation is a problem,&quot; Carl Johnson, chairman of Saxonburg-based
II-VI Inc. told fellow CEOs during an April panel discussion featuring the
region's high-growth companies.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;I've seen companies relocate to Ohio because of taxation, along with
workers' compensation,&quot; added another participant, First Western Bancorp
CEO Thomas P. O'Shane.<BR>
<BR>
In the final installment of Executive Report's six-month series entitled
Resuscitating the Region, ER looks at how tax reform offers an opportunity
to spur regional growth. In previous months, the magazine talked about the
importance of entrepreneurship, exporting, education, transportation and
tourism.<BR>
<BR>
This month: Tax reform.<BR>
<BR>
Looking Back<BR>
<BR>
The Vertex study that rated Philadelphia and Pittsburgh so poorly was conducted
in 1993, which was probably Pennsylvania's worst in terms of the tax burden
it levied upon businesses. Since then, business taxes in Pennsylvania have
been rolled back a bit. Nevertheless, many say there remains room, and need,
for further decreases.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You gave business a significant kick in the pants in 1991,&quot; says
Lance Shaeffer, executive director of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of
Commerce. &quot;We are only halfway home on that.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It helps to first understand the landscape in 1991. It was then legislators
reluctantly approved, and Gov. Casey signed, a $14 billion state budget
to end a 35-day impasse. The stalemate had left the state unable to pay
its bills or its employees.<BR>
 <BR>
It was ugly. At one point in the game, legislators got into a shoving match
on the House floor in Harrisburg. When the budget passed (following an all-night
session), many unshaven and bleary-eyed lawmakers broke into applause.<BR>
<BR>
The state's 501 school districts clapped too, since their funding was about
to collectively jump by about $200 million.<BR>
<BR>
Casey signed the budget into law at 11 o'clock that night, and quickly moved
to save face before hopping into bed at the governor's mansion.<BR>
<BR>
 &quot;The best we can say . . .  is that this budget restores Pennsylvania
with sound financial and fiscal footing,&quot; Casey said that night. &quot;I'm
not happy with the size of the increase or the mix of taxes found in this
bill.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
If he wasn't happy, just think how business felt.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Business Barometer<BR>
<BR>
Business wasn't happy at all. In fact, business was ready to bail out ...
of Pennsylvania, that is.<BR>
In that same year, 1991, accounting firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand partnered
with the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry to conduct what has
become an annual survey of Pennsylvania business leaders. Taken each of
the five years since then, the survey consistently has shown that more than
a third of the businesses would relocate to another state if they could.<BR>
<BR>
In the most recent survey released last September, for instance, 43 percent
of the 665 business leaders who responded said they would move to another
state if possible. <BR>
<BR>
In that same 1995 survey, more than 75 percent of respondents rated the
state's business climate as fair to poor. The 76.6 percent figure was better
than the 90.4 percent who responded the same way in 1993 and the 87 percent
who responded that way in 1994, but nevertheless it was still very high.
And in each of the surveys, taxes were rated as one of the top two concerns,
along with workers' compensation.<BR>
<BR>
So why was business force-fed the tax increases in 1991, with such backlash
practically inevitable?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Businesses don't vote,&quot; says accountant Jeffrey Wlahofsky of
Schneider Downs in Pittsburgh. &quot;Individuals vote.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
By the time Casey left office in 1994, the corporate net income tax had
been cut to 10.9 percent, but was still considered high in comparison with
 other states. Casey's successor, Gov. Tom Ridge, took it one step further
in his 1995 budget by trimming the rate to 9.9 percent, retroactive to Jan.
1 of that year. Ridge's first budget also allowed businesses to deduct the
first $100,000 in assets from the capital stock and franchise tax, an increase
from $75,000.<BR>
<BR>
Ridge also reinstated the net-operating loss carry-forward measure - eliminated
in 1991 - allowing businesses a tax credit for net-operating losses from
previous years. Until Ridge restored the net operating loss carry-forward,
Pennsylvania was the only state in the nation to assess a corporate net
income tax but not offer a net-operating loss provision. It made doing business
in Pennsylvania much more risky than in any other state. The measure still
lacks in that the loss from one year may only be carried forward for up
to three years.  In neighboring Ohio,  for example, the carry-forward is
allowed for 14 years.<BR>
<BR>
Additionally, the capital stock and franchise tax is still considered to
be high despite Ridge's increase of the deduction to the first $100,000.<BR>
<BR>
Looking Ahead<BR>
<BR>
The most recent state budget does not include the high profile cuts of 1995
- the corporate net income tax rate remains 9.9 percent - but Ridge maintains
there is relief.<BR>
<BR>
Most notably, the ridiculous computer sales tax that was created during
the 1991 budget crunch is history for businesses in manufacturing, processing
and agriculture, as well as for public utilities.<BR>
Ridge also offered tax credits for companies that created new jobs - $1,000
per employee after 25 are hired. So when an employer creates 26 new jobs,
the employer gets $26,000 in tax credits. While critics say that measure
won't do much for small businesses, Ridge maintains it's still relief that
business can seize.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Last year, we cut taxes by $286 million,&quot; the governor says.
&quot;We did it to send a signal that Pennsylvania is job-friendly. We did
it so everyone will know we are more committed than ever to retaining the
jobs we have and creating new ones. This budget continues that trend.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
There's action on other fronts, too. Jim Stalder, managing partner of Price
Waterhouse in Pittsburgh, is heading the Pennsylvania Tax Blueprint Project,
an independent, nonpartisan analysis of state tax policy that was endorsed
by the governor. The Tax Blueprint Project will develop computer-based impact
models that can be used to evaluate tax reform policies. Early findings
of benchmarking against 12 other states were due for disclosure shortly
after this article went to press.<BR>
<BR>
Longer term, any proposed tax reform can be tested to determine revenue
estimates and economic impact.<BR>
<BR>
In the end, legislators and the governor will be armed with information
enabling them to enact meaningful long-term measures that will foster economic
growth.<BR>
<BR>
As Ridge puts it: &quot;Tax cuts are an important part of our economic development
strategy.&quot;<BR>

<B><FONT size =+1>The South: Boomtowns Turned Zoomtowns</FONT> </B><I>By
Lind A Dickerson</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Greenville was a sleepy southern city 30 years ago. Today, Greenville
and the county that surrounds it are the economic development meccas of
the South, boasting      9 percent population growth over the past five
years while consistently holding unemployment rates well below 3 percent.
The last available numbers put Greenville's unemployment at 1.3 percent,
and much of South Carolina brags a similar track record.<BR>
<BR>
Sound like winning numbers? It gets better.<BR>
<BR>
Capital investments in South Carolina reached a state record $5.4 billion
in 1995 - the first year of Gov. David Beasley's administration - and new
jobs created neared 24,000. Michelin and Nucor each invested about $500
million, while Nan Ya Plastics and Amoco each invested $300 million. International
firms accounted for $1.8 billion of the $5.4 billion in new investment enabling
the state to stake its claim as a truly globalized region.<BR>
<BR>
The unassailable barometer of a vibrant economy, however, is always the
degree to which existing enterprises are growing in the economy. Here South
Carolina outperforms most other economies as well: Existing industry was
responsible for 84 percent of the state's total incremental capital investment.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When you win, it's fun,&quot; says Robert V. Royal, a retired banker
who currently is South Carolina's Secretary of Commerce. Royal says Beasley
effectively leveraged his cabinet to proactively encourage business and
the state legislature to locate and grow new investments within the state.
But government is not alone in its efforts to grow the economy. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a good partnership between local and state government, and in
most cases, the private sector,&quot; Royal says. &quot;It takes both to
make it happen.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why Greenville?<BR>
<BR>
A prominently displayed brochure in the lobby of the Greenville Chamber
of Commerce poses the following question: &quot;With an entire continent
to choose from, where in the world did Michelin put their North American
headquarters?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The answer, of course, is Greenville. And why not? Greenville is in many
ways the Camelot of the Carolinas.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the symbiosis between business and government, Greenville
boasts a strong work ethic, a high quality of life and a less than  2 percent
rate of unionization, factors Royal believes stimulate South Carolina's
unmatched ability to grow companies.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Nowhere in the world had [Michelin] seen people with a stronger work
ethic,&quot; the commerce secretary says. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The people were the single biggest reason that this region developed,&quot;
adds long-time Greenville resident Buck Mickel. &quot; We believe in a partnership
between business, government and the people.<BR>
Tom Wyche, a prominent Green-ville attorney and a pillar in the community,
asserts that Greenville's growth hinges on its environmental appeal and
its concomitant high quality of life. Admitting that historically the low
cost of land and labor were always factors, Wyche attributes the community's
most recent expansion to its tremendous appeal as a great place to live.<BR>
Less than an hour from the Blue Ridge Mountains and surrounded by beautiful
lakes, Greenville is gorgeous. And its consistently warm climate is also
one of its biggest assets. At 320,127 residents, Greenville is South Carolina's
most populous county. It's no wonder. People are flocking to the area to
take advantage of the burgeoning employment opportunities and the beautiful
surroundings.<BR>
Each of the 21 attorneys practicing at Wyche's firm, Wyche Burgess Herman
&amp; Parham, is a graduate of a top law school. Over 90 percent carry sheepskins
from Harvard, Yale or the University of Virginia. Wyche contends that Greenville's
outstanding cultural amenities and unmatched natural beauty enable his firm
to recruit the nation's best and brightest. And when you ask these Greenville
recruits how they like it there, they give you a resounding &quot;We love
it.&quot;<BR>
Wyche is not alone in his assessment. Thomas Barton, the founder and 34-year-veteran
president of Greenville Technical College, describes the region that spawned
his stalwart institution as &quot;a combination of companies and counties.&quot;
A long-time observer of Greenville's rags to riches development, Barton
contends, &quot;There's a new spirit here over the past decade. It's just
like a new city springing up.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Foreign Investment<BR>
<BR>
Greenville's growth is anchored in direct foreign investment. More than
231 international firms from 18 nations selected the upstate (Greenville
and surrounding areas) as their U.S. home, placing this region among the
highest per capita for foreign investment of any metropolitan statistical
area in the country.<BR>
<BR>
Renowned Harvard scholar Rosabeth Moss Kanter chose Greenville and nearby
Spartanburg as one of only five regions in the nation to feature in her
newly released book &quot;World Class.&quot; Kanter categorizes the Greenville/Spartanburg
area as a &quot;maker,&quot; which she defines as those regions that &quot;attract
world manufacturing because of their competence, and are thus magnets for
foreign investment.&quot;  Together, Greenville and Spartanburg have the
highest per capita diversified foreign investment in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the most celebrated international recruit is BMW, which opened production
at its Spartanburg plant in 1994. BMW's total investment in the upstate
region is expected to top $750 million, and projections indicate that over
8,000 peripheral jobs will be created because of BMW.<BR>
Then there is international player Michelin, a 20-year veteran of the upstate.
Michelin's investment began with a tire manufacturing facility in 1973.
By 1985, the Michelin Group of France decided to locate its North American
corporate headquarters in Greenville.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike Charleston, S.C., which has in its port an inherent connection to
the outside world, Greenville's integration with the world stems from the
business community's conscious decision to build their economy on direct
foreign investment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Business Leads<BR>
<BR>
Max Hellar, who led the development charge first as mayor of Greenville
and then from the South Carolina Department of Commerce, says business was
proactive in triggering regional growth. Himself a highly successful textile
manufacturer early in his career, Hellar asserts, &quot;We [government]
tried to be the spark plug. Business was the engine.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
One of the most coveted community leadership positions that one can hold
is to be a member of the chamber's esteemed Headquarters Recruitment Committee.
Prospects are afforded the utmost in southern hospitality when they visit
Greenville, but recruitment doesn't stop there. Four to five times annually,
the recruitment committee hits the road looking for prospects.<BR>
<BR>
When offered a tour of Pittsburgh, FOCUS Management Development Inc. President
Richard Harpum said wryly, &quot;You don't want us in Pittsburgh. We steal
companies.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
And when the companies come, finding skilled labor is not a problem. Harpum
says the area's quality of life enables it to attract people from outside
the region. As a result, they view their labor pool as the rest of the universe.
Since the supply of labor worldwide would never exceed Greenville's demand
for labor, Greenvillians think their cost of labor is stable over the long-term.<BR>
<BR>
Charleston Port<BR>
<BR>
What Greenville lacks, Charleston has in a deep water port that provides
a natural link to the rest of the globe. The second largest port facility
in the East, the Port of Charleston is the key driver of Charleston's economy
and is the connection to the rest of the globe for much of South Carolina.
<BR>
A recent economic impact study conducted by the South Carolina State Ports
Authority indicates that the ports generate $1.5 billion in personal income
annually. This study also credits the ports with creating 66,000 jobs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're an opportunity even for those not ready to use us yet,&quot;
says Anne Mose, director of public relations for the South Carolina State
Ports Authority. &quot;We've gotten to the point where success breeds success.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Because South Carolina built its economy on an international base, the Charleston
Port anchors much of the state's development efforts. From 200 miles east,
Greenville uses the Charleston Port as a critical component of its foreign
investment-based growth strategies. Serving as the nation's sixth largest
containment port, the Charleston Port handled 10.6 million tons of cargo
last year.<BR>
The Port moves cargo an average of two days faster than other ports, providing
South Carolina yet another advantage in luring firms doing business in international
markets. Easy interstate highway access and cost-effective rail transportation
add value to the Port, which in turn builds the state's capacity to attract
new industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Other Factors<BR>
<BR>
Some believe that South Carolina gives away the store to attract new industry
within its borders. It does give incentives, but how much weight those incentives
carry is a matter of debate.<BR>
&quot;Incentives are not the No. 1 thing you look for,&quot; says A.J. Batia,
vice president and general plant manager for Bayer Corp.'s Bush Park Plant
in Charleston.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't believe that incentives are the end-all,&quot; adds Ben Cole,
executive director of the Charleston Regional Development Alliance.<BR>
<BR>
Just look at South Carolina's strong education foundation, thanks in part
to the work of Greenville Technical School's Barton, who led the charge
in creating an ambitious program three decades ago to provide globally competitive
work forces to existing companies as well as corporations exploring relocation
in the South. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;In order to attract industry, you have to have something to bring
them here,&quot; Barton says. &quot;We don't care what you tell us that
you need. Whatever you need to make you competitive - worldwide machinery,
engineering, text books, teaching - we'll provide it.&quot; South Carolina's
Special Schools Program uses community colleges and technical schools throughout
the state to train work forces to meet existing or incoming industry needs.
Industry pays nothing for this training, which is frequently delivered on
site.<BR>
<BR>
Art Cann II, plant manager of Global Manufacturing Inc., credits the Special
Schools program as a key variable in Global's decision to locate a manufacturing
site in Charleston. At Global, the company establishes the curriculum, while
the state supplies - at taxpayer expense - the manuals and instructors.<BR>
<BR>
Southern Hospitality<BR>
<BR>
Ronald Hubner, president of Hubner Manufacturing Corp., says his reception
in Mt. Pleasant, S.C., was so special it swayed his decision to locate his
business there. Recruitment southern style involved dinner invitations to
local political leaders' houses. When NISE EAST arrived on the scene in
Charleston, the three counties surrounding Charleston jointly sponsored
a barbecue for all NISE EAST employees who were relocating there. In addition
to the 1,400 people NISE EAST will add to the area's employment rosters,
this consolidated naval engineering center will also serve as a strong magnet
for high tech firms  subcontracting to the Navy. <BR>
<BR>
On the other side of the state in Greenville, stories of generous entertainment
budgets and full-time recruiters abound. Visitors are treated as royalty.
Business people join economic development professionals to wine and dine
myriad individuals from around the world.<BR>
<BR>
Boomtowns and Zoomtowns<BR>
<BR>
After several pro-business state governments, all of South Carolina has
coalesced around economic development, and virtually everyone out to make
a buck is an economic development agent. The state's impressive track record
in meeting the needs of both domestic and international companies alike
stems from a variety of strengths. An appealing climate, a strong work ethic,
a reasonable cost of living, a business-friendly political environment and
relatively low corporate taxes number among the factors compelling businesses
worldwide to take note of the Palmetto State.<BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;gone south&quot; is no longer equated with a &quot;turn for
the worse.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
The South is booming, with exponential growth rates the norm rather than
the exception. Greenville and Charleston became boomtowns by riding the
southern growth wave. However, both communities became zoomtowns because
of their burning desire to assume their rightful place in the world. This
intense southern pride, coupled with good old-fashioned southern hospitality,
created forces with which the world must reckon. <BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Special Supplement : United Way </FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size =+1>Building a Better Community Together</FONT></B><BR>
<I>By Linda A Dickerson</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>When it comes to fiscal accountability, strategic direction, customer
satisfaction and return on investment, which local business segments come
to mind? Our banking community? Manufacturing? Our burgeoning high technology
industry? Or how about the ever-increasing cadre of entre-preneurial ventures?<BR>
<BR>
How about our local United Way?<BR>
<BR>
For each of the past several years, United Way of Southwestern Pennsyl-vania
has raised $35 million for area health and human service programs. Through
a thoughtful allocations <BR>
process, United Way gifts are distributed to a network of nearly 300 effective
human service programs that counsel and protect battered women, reunite
and strengthen families, protect our youth from violence, care for our elderly
and provide other critical services. <BR>
<BR>
United Way also connects more than 20,000 local people each year with the
counseling, protection from abuse and violence, food, clothing, shelter
and other vital resources they need. And it engages thousands of local people
in volunteer service to their neighbors.<BR>
<BR>
United Way does all of this - and more - at a cost of under 13 cents per
dollar.<BR>
<BR>
Yet another key lesson we in the business community can learn from United
Way is the importance and effectiveness of partnering - of pooling resources
and addressing an issue on a united front rather than in isolation. United
Way is in a unique position: it cuts across all boundaries - real or imagined
- between service providers, funders, the business community and other groups,
and brings them to the table to address our community's most critical problems.
And no other organization has such a kaleidoscopic view of our community's
health and human services - a view of the &quot;big picture&quot; rather

This Executive Report supplement highlights a few of the partnerships our
community has asked United Way to become involved in just because of these
attributes. I hope you enjoy reading this supplement. More important, I
hope you join Executive Report in supporting our United Way as it continues
its unique role in helping to improve the quality of life for all of us.

<B>Collaboration key to turning<BR>
addiction into hope</B><BR>
<BR>
Each morning brings a rush of decisions: which suit to wear to work, which
alternate road to use to avoid Parkway traffic, what to eat for breakfast,
whether or not to reschedule a meeting to free up some time. The list goes
on. <BR>
<BR>
For Sandra, a young woman trying to raise a 1-year-old with another baby
on the way, morning decisions amounted to deciding whether to buy milk for
the baby or drugs for herself. <BR>
<BR>
Because of a series of setbacks culminating in the death of her grandmother
who raised her, Sandra had become addicted to crack cocaine. But she wanted
out. She wanted her own house. A healthy baby. A good job. And, most importantly,
she wanted to reunite her family, which included a son living with a relative.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I planned to stop using drugs and get my life together,&quot; she
remembers. &quot;But each time my money would come, the drug man would come,
too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That was two years ago. Since then, Sandra's not touched drugs. She moved
out of a housing community and into a beautifully furnished home in Oakland.
She has a job as a nursing assistant. She bought a new car. And she has
her family back together again - all because of the Homewood/ Brushton Community
Collaborative, one of three unique partnerships of human service nonprofits
serving substance abusing women and their children. Others are helping change
lives in the Hill District and McKeesport.<BR>
<BR>
The Community Collaboratives were begun by United Way with the support of
local foundations nearly four years ago. Their aim was to introduce the
concept of collaboration to the human service industry, which had never
before cooperated, communicated and coordinated services to people in need
to the extent that the present Collaboratives do. Each of the Collaboratives
developed action plans to coordinate existing services, identify service
gaps and design initiatives to assure substance abusing women and their
children a &quot;continuum&quot; of care.<BR>
<BR>
Without the Collaborative, women like Sandra literally would have run all
over the area, hoping bus connections would get them to medical treatment
for their addiction, to help with housing needs, to marital and family counseling,
to job skills training and employment counseling, to legal advice, to healthcare,
and to parenting support groups. The partnership among United Way, local
foundations, governmental agencies and nonprofit providers participating
in the Collaboratives has created a single, one-stop source of help and
support. This, in turn, has strengthened more than 1,200 families by helping
mothers regain their self-sufficiency.<BR>
<B><BR>
Joining forces to make summer <BR>
productive for teens</B><BR>
<BR>
Last summer, Kenneth Johnson, an 18-year-old who lives in Pittsburgh's Hill
District, and Tina Martin, an 18-year-old Manchester resident, both worked
for the City, he in the General Services area helping to maintain the fleet
of vehicles, she in a project that installed heating and air conditioning
in renovated homes. And 19-year-old Gareth Davis II worked in the day care
center at the Wilkinsburg YWCA.<BR>
<BR>
Based on a report of the Employ-ment Policies Institute, these three local
youth will do significantly better and make more money out in the &quot;real
world&quot; than their non-working contemporaries.<BR>
That's one of the reasons a group of local companies and organizations,
including United Way, come together for YouthWorks '96, the Youth Employment
Initiative to develop summer jobs for local youth. Chairing the initiative
are Fred Thieman, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania
and chair of the Youth Violence Prevention Council; David Brewton, executive
director, Breach-menders, Inc., and Dianna Green, senior vice president,
Customer Operations, Duquesne Light Company. <BR>
<BR>
Green points to the employment initiative's benefits for local businesses.
&quot;Research shows employers reap dividends when they invest in human
capital - their productivity increases, which in turn benefits economic
development,&quot; Green adds.<BR>
<BR>
The Youth Employment Initiative is working to develop 1,800 jobs from the
public and private sectors. Key to the project is the preparation of youth
for their work roles and the participation of Olsten Staffing Services which
is helping to make sure the match between employers and youth are suitable
for both.<BR>
<BR>
The results? Look at more statistics from the Employment Policies Institute:
People who didn't work in high school were almost twice as likely to be
unemployed after 12 years, and kids who worked when in school earned $1,300
to $1,600 a year more than those with no early work experience.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Be a good neighbor... volunteer</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Buoyed by positive volunteer experiences with United Way Day of Caring and
other community service projects, Bayer Corporation wanted to develop a
formal way to engage employees in regular volunteer activities. But how?<BR>
<BR>
United Way Leadership contributor, Dan Grealish, president of Henderson
Brothers Inc., wanted to mobilize his fellow insurance industry professionals
in a day of volunteering: United Way Day of Caring with the Insurance Industry.
Where could he go for assistance?<BR>
<BR>
Nate Bodin, a junior at Upper St. Clair High School, is a leader when it
comes to organizing volunteer projects for his fellow students. But where
can he find information on projects that address the community issues he
and his fellow students are interested in?<BR>
<BR>
City Theatre wanted to improve the way it recruits and uses volunteers -
volunteers who can help not just with day-to-day tasks like designing sets
but volunteers who can lend their professional expertise in areas such as
marketing. But who is the local expert in such topics?<BR>
Good Neighbors, a partnership between United Way and the local foundation
and business community, can help people and groups like these. A service
of United Way, Good Neighbors is our community's newest and most comprehensive
resource for those who want to volunteer.<BR>
Good Neighbors quickly and efficiently matches people and companies with
volunteer experiences through a database of thousands of volunteer opportunities.
Potential volunteers can find tasks suited precisely to their expertise,
interest, schedule and location. <BR>
<BR>
And the volunteer opportunities aren't limited solely to human services.
Rather they include those in education, arts and culture, religion, government,
business and other public and private sector initiatives. Good Neighbors
also provides an array of support services including training and technical
assistance, recruitment, and recognition. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Volunteers can lend their expertise, new ideas and cost-efficiency
benefits to the community,&quot; notes Jane Burger, executive director of
the Grable Foundation. &quot;And with Good Neigh-bors, we can build on the
capacity of nonprofits to use volunteer resources which is critical in this
time of shifting dollars.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Is your company interested in helping the community and building teamwork
and morale with a volunteer program? Call Good Neighbors at 394-5380.<BR>
<BR>
<B>United Way, WTAE team up to support children, families</B><BR>
<BR>
Two-year-old Missy looks forward to the day care center her parents drop
her off at each morning on their way to work at a downtown bank. At the
center, Missy enjoys a safe, nurturing environment offering her a variety
of educational, cultural and social activities. She's learned to count to
10 and recite the alphabet, except she still has trouble with her Fs and
Rs.<BR>
Jeremy, another 2-year-old, lives with his grandmother because his mother,
a single parent without a job, tries to overcome a substance abuse problem.
Jeremy's grandmother cares for him most of the time, except when she cleans
homes to make money for the family. Then, he is shuffled off to one of the
neighbors' houses where he watches TV most of the day, not all of it aimed
at children.<BR>
Which child has the better chance of growing up to be productive, responsible
and happy? Statistics tip the odds in favor of Missy, who is receiving the
nurturing and stimulation needed in children her age. For example, &quot;The
Challenge to Achieve,&quot; a report of the Allegheny County Policy Council,
notes that children who enter school unprepared are often doomed to school
failure and that children who begin behind generally stay behind.<BR>
<BR>
Another partnership involving United Way is helping to create greater awareness
of the needs of our children and their families: SUCCESS BY 6. WTAE-TV invited
United Way to join in this two-year public service program. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;SUCCESS BY 6 is the next logical step following our FamilyWorks! campaign
to bring even greater focus to those issues that impact the well-being of
our children,&quot; notes WTAE-TV Vice President and General Manager Jim
Hefner. &quot;We are honored to be joined by such community leaders as United
Way. Together, we hope to make a significant contribution to the cause of
children.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The public service program includes SUCCESS BY 6 spots, each featuring a
different topic related to early childhood development and family support.
In addition, special programming such as &quot;Our Children: A Crying Shame,&quot;
are featured in WTAE-TV's prime-time line-up. Many of these specials feature
a phone bank to offer viewers the United Way HelpLine number to call for
more information on community resources - and for volunteer opportunities
that enable local people to help our community's children and families.<BR>
<BR>
In addition, WTAE-TV and United Way are developing community outreach projects
that will bring SUCCESS BY 6 to local neighborhoods.<BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Summer Construction </FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size =+1>Union vs. Nonunion Contractors</FONT></B><BR>
<I>By Christopher Lawton</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Several years ago, a Macy's Department store was scheduled to be
built at one of the nation's largest shopping malls near Philadelphia. The
200,000 square-foot project occupied three levels of retail space and included
several ornate German escalators, which were preassembled in Germany and
shipped up the Delaware River. All workers had to do was install them at
the store, but that's where things got complicated.<BR>
<BR>
Because the escalators came preassembled, one union realized that there
would be a loss of work for its members. Construction was immediately halted
as workers for the elevator subcontractor called a strike against the entire
mall project. To end the strike, a deal was ultimately negotiated with the
union whereby the workers would be paid to disassemble the escalators, then
reassemble them for inclusion in the mall. <BR>
<BR>
This delay of work and subsequent disassemble and reassemble cost several
months of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cost increases.<BR>
<BR>
Sound all too familiar? Stories like these have haunted union contractors
in the past. But more recently, these same contractors are pointing to their
share of fairy tale endings. Most notably, the $1 billion Midfield Terminal
project at Pittsburgh International Airport &shyp; a union job &shyp; came
to completion on time without any work stoppages. &quot;Old perceptions
generally aren't true anymore about the unions,&quot; says Jack Ramage,
secretary of the Master Builders' Association, an umbrella group consisting
of union contractors. &quot;The unions have become more flexible and competitive
in order to progress with their nonunion counterparts.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Union and nonunion contractors could debate for hours. Most nonunion, or
open-shop contractors, will tell you that union construction is more costly
because union wages are higher. On the other hand, most union contractor's
will counter that union construction may be more costly, but the quality
of workmanship is higher because union workers are better skilled and receive
ongoing safety training.<BR>
<BR>
In reality, there is truth in what both have to say.  <BR>
<BR>
The Union Contractors<BR>
<BR>
The Master Builders' Association has chapters all over the United States
and in Pittsburgh is made up of over 100 different member companies associated
with union construction. All of Pittsburgh's larger construction companies
are represented, as well as, general contractors, law firms and insurance
companies. <BR>
<BR>
Originally formed to negotiate with the unions over labor issues, in the
last 10 years the MBA has formed more of a partnership with the unions.
Ramage says this change came about because of the influx of the open-shop
competition.<BR>
<BR>
The MBA still finds itself negotiating collective bargaining agreements
with the four main trade unions, including the carpenters, laborers, cement
masons and operating engineers. But in addition, the MBA also provides ongoing
training to union workers, which Ramage says results in better quality and
explains the higher labor costs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A portion of the union worker's wage, whether they're a carpenter
or a general laborer, is paid to the MBA to provide [the worker] with ongoing
education in their trade,&quot; Ramage says.<BR>
<BR>
Then there's worksite safety, where the MBA says it also holds an edge by
providing some 500 on-site safety consultations and safety training seminars
during the year with the various contractors.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our safety representative goes to the site and performs a mock OSHA
inspection, to let the job-site superintendent know where he's weak,&quot;
says Ramage. The safety department of the MBA will also represent individual
contractors if they in fact are cited by OSHA for any job-site violations.<BR>
<BR>
Douglas Dick, the Dick Corp. president who holds the same title with the
MBA, gets right to the point.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I've driven by a number of the larger nonunion job sites and most
of them are using unsafe work practices,&quot; Dick says. &quot;The nonunion
contractors are simply unable, because of cost, to provide an adequate safety
training program for their workers. In some cases the contractors themselves
haven't been educated about job safety issues.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Is Price a Priority?<BR>
<BR>
Jack Mascaro, president of union contractor Mascaro Inc., says he usually
declines when his company is asked by a developer to bid against a nonunion
contractor.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;By and large it's difficult to beat a nonunion contractor if the owner
is only buying on price,&quot; Mascaro says.<BR>
<BR>
This is because in many cases the nonunion contractor can and will underbid
the union contractor's asking price.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But,&quot; says Mascaro, &quot;if the owner is more interested in
best value, consisting of price, quality performance and service, then we
can compete.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
How often does that happen? In today's construction economy, most builders
are concerned with union constructions cost. &quot;Any nonunion contractor
can be cheaper if they want to. Unfortunately, many clients have a tendency
to only look at the bottom line on bid day. What they don't anticipate is
that often with nonunion work, there's going to be a change in work orders,
as well as situations throughout the job that will make costs go up,&quot;
says Ramage. <BR>
<BR>
So when it's all said and done, Ramage says, union contractors may do it
just as cheaply as their nonunion competitors with more attention to skill
and safety. <BR>
<BR>
Rich DeYoung, chief operating officer of the architectural firm Williams
Trebilcock Whitehead, says his firm has worked with both union and nonunion
contractors and had great success with both of them. DeYoung agrees with
the union contractors' position that they offer more in terms of quality
labor.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Some of the primary differences are that the union trades have an
apprenticeship program, a way to formally train the craftspeople, and they
also have a skilled labor pool available at all times,&quot; says DeYoung.<BR>
<BR>
Nonunion construction, on the other hand, is usually made up of out-of-work
union-construction workers, workers just out of trade schools or people
who are beginning a second career.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;While theirs is not as formal a kind of training as their union counterparts,
the larger contractors generally work with the same people and therefore
provide a more informal type of training for them,&quot; adds DeYoung. <BR>
<BR>
The only real disadvantage DeYoung sees with union construction is in the
area of work rules. If you're from a particular trade on a union job site,
you can't perform another trade's work. So a carpenter can't unload a truck,
they must let someone from the trucking company do it for them. Construction
companies in this position often aren't able to use their work force in
the most efficient manner because of union rules. However, DeYoung notes
that even this rule is changing today.<BR>
&quot;Unions and construction companies are beginning to work together because
they know, bottom line, that this is affecting overall cost and job effectiveness,&quot;
says DeYoung. &quot;Unions today realize that they're bidding for work against
nonunion contractors, so while there might have been a significant division
between the unions and nonunions 10 years ago in terms of cost, the unions
are working to decrease that gap.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're much more cooperative with union contractors, allowing them
to do things more efficiently at the job-site.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the Pittsburgh construction market there is a trend toward job-site cooperation
between union and nonunion contractors. Many projects use both types of
contractors to complete building contracts. <BR>
<BR>
Other markets are not so lucky. This is due mainly because of a shortage
of a skilled union labor force in other markets. Pittsburgh has not felt
this shortage due to the sheer number of contractors &shyp; 1,000 or so
independent nonunion contractors operating within the metropolitan area.<BR>
<BR>
DeYoung does cite some nonunion contractors, such as Bridges &amp; Company,
that perform high quality work. However, he's quick to point out that, by
and large, there are many more qualified union contractors than there are
nonunion counterparts.<BR>
<BR>
The FMS Network Inc. is a company that represents and finds for its clients
various types of contractors to perform labor and service tasks. At times,
they represent both union and nonunion laborers, and as company President
David W. Buckley states, &quot;You find good and bad work practices with
both types.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In a region such as Pittsburgh, many of the skilled laborers are swallowed
up by the union contractors because the industry is busy. &quot;However,
since the closing of the steel mills in the 1980s, there are more skilled
ex-union laborers in the market who are working for themselves, performing
the same tasks that they did when they were union,&quot; says Buckley. Buckley
sees this shift as one of the primary reasons there are more quality construction
choices in this market, and many of those are nonunion.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The quality of union or nonunion work depends upon the work ethics
of the owners and senior management. If they have a high work ethic, it's
often relayed to the workers, and if so the job runs smoothly and within
budget. If they don't have a high work ethic, things obviously don't run
smoothly and there is a lot of waste on the job site in terms of building
costs. The latter is an example of contractors I won't work with if I suspect
or know these things in advance,&quot; says Buckley.<BR>
<BR>
 Buckley points out that whether or not someone chooses a union or nonunion
contractor, they should thoroughly inspect their work habits on past job
sites and get a feeling from the contractor that they are legitimate and
honest.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I would check their references and find out as much information about
them before they set foot on the job site. This is what we do for our customers
to ensure a proper match of labor to the task.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In this way, the job is implemented successfully and within their
budget,&quot; says Buckley.<BR>
The bottom line: whether or not a developer decides to use one or the other
type of contractors is unimportant. What is important is that they choose
the contractor who is going to give them the best value for their money.
The highest attention to detail with a minimum of waste and a maximum of
value.	<BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>A Gamble </FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Labor is Spending Big Bucks in Support of<BR>
Clinton and Congressional Democrats</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</I></B> </CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
The questioner wanted to know why the Republicans were doing such a lousy
job of getting their message out in advance of the presidential election.
And how were the Democrats doing such a good job of getting their message
out?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When people ask me that,&quot; Republican U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum
replied, &quot;I ask them how long it's been since they have written out
a check to the Republican party.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That wasn't the answer the questioner - in this case a small business owner
from Pittsburgh - wanted to hear. Nevertheless, Santorum hit the nail on
the head.<BR>
<BR>
While unfortunate, it appears that President Clinton could win another term
thanks to financial clout of special interest groups such as organized labor,
which will spend about $35 million supporting Clinton and congressional
Democrats with advertising in advance of this November's election.<BR>
And don't think Republican leaders aren't a little worried. That question
posed to Santorum was also posed by Newt Gingrich during a spring meeting
with Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour and other party
operatives. Gingrich told party leaders that something needed to be done
to offset the media blitz by Democrats and organized labor. And everyone
at the GOP meeting, including advisers to Republican nominee Robert Dole,
agreed that the advertisements were taking their toll.<BR>
<BR>
This election is coming down to money, and the Republicans may not have
enough of it.<BR>
<BR>
The Democrats began their hard-edged television blitz - at the rate of $1
million in paid advertising per week - a year ago. The campaign began with
a barrage of ads designed to shore up Clinton's stand on crime. Later, the
Democrats slammed Republicans' proposed Medicare cuts and GOP lawmakers'
efforts to limit the increase in spending for environmental protection.
Labor mixed in its own spots.<BR>
<BR>
The ads were precisely targeted, running in states that can turn a presidential
election, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Wisconsin.
<BR>
<BR>
I find labor's role in all of this quite interesting. I guess if you belong
to a union, consider the heavy financial support for Democrats as your dues
money at work. All this despite exit polls from the 1994 elections - when
Republicans won a Congressional majority - showing that 40 percent of self-identified
union members voted for Republican candidates.<BR>
<BR>
To me, it looks like this: Labor is gambling with its money. In the 1990s,
unions saw their base decline to 15 percent of the work force and only 10.4
percent of the private sector. What growth there was occurred mainly in
public employee unions. <BR>
<BR>
If labor puts Clinton back in for a second term and swings the Congressional
majority back to the Democrats, it has re-established itself as a formidable
political operation and a powerful voice within the Democratic Party. <BR>
<BR>
If the Republicans win the White House - and if you haven't guessed, I hope
they do - organized labor will have sealed its own fate as a nonfactor in
American politics. And you can bet labor will feel the Republican wrath.
<BR>
<BR>
During the GOP's brief hold on the majority, Republicans have threatened
to ease penalties for work place safety law violations, repeal the Davis-Bacon
Act propping up construction workers wages and hold down growth in Medicare
and Medicaid spending. They also fought the minimum wage increase. <BR>
<BR>
More will come, with labor paying a heavy price. It's quite a gamble, one
that may not pay off.                              <BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Thinking Ahead<BR>
A Few ounces of Prevention Now Will<BR>
Pay Dividends Latewr for Impoverished Youth</FONT SIZE> <FONT size=+1></FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher <BR clear=all>
</I></B><HR>The choice between prevention and intervention should be a simple
decision. Prevention generally costs less - much less - and it takes care
of problems before they occur.  <BR>
<BR>
Yet, society continues to rely on intervention strategies to mitigate its
problems. Why? <BR>
United Way's Early Childhood Initiative offers Allegheny County's low-income
preschool children true hope for a promising future and is an example of
prevention. Research shows that children born into poverty often struggle
to succeed in school and sometimes engage in violent behavior later in life.
<BR>
<BR>
Through the Early Childhood Initiative, United Way hopes to provide an escape
route for impoverished youngsters. The initiative will deliver high-quality,
affordable early education to low-income preschoolers in Allegheny County.<BR>
<BR>
The Allegheny Policy Council's &quot;Challenge to Achieve&quot; report asserts,
&quot;Children who begin behind, generally stay behind.&quot; The costs
to this community of children &quot;staying behind&quot; are immense. Allegheny
County's annual expenditures for child welfare, juvenile detention, juvenile
probation and principal alternative juvenile probation programs total $131
million.<BR>
<BR>
Despite these burgeoning costs, only 7,800 of Allegheny County's 18,000
preschoolers living in poverty currently receive comprehensive family support,
subsidized child care or publicly funded early education. <BR>
<BR>
The positive correlation between poverty and seriously substandard performance
in school and between poverty and violent behavior is irrefutable. Poor
performers and high- school dropouts swell the welfare rolls, exacting a
hefty investment from society. Similarly, incarceration for violent offenders
costs Allegheny County taxpayers approximately $44,000 per jailed individual.<BR>
<BR>
The Early Childhoo Initiative is asking this community to invest approximately
$3,500 per low-income child in early education programs. It's a pay now
or pay more - much more - later decision. The $3,500 investment is a prudent
one.<BR>
<BR>
Poverty need not sentence children to a life on welfare row or death row.
Society knows that early education significantly enhances a young person's
opportunity to succeed. <BR>
<BR>
Prevention at an early age is an investment. Intervention at a later age
is a cost.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Sexual Harrasment</FONT SIZE></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>It's Not Only Against the Law,</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>It's Wrong and Can Hurt Your Business</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By James B. Brown</I></B><HR></CENTER>
<P> surge in sexual harassment complaints in Pennsylvania over the past
few years should compel employers to seek to eradicate any  such problems
in their own workplaces. For besides being against the law,  it's wrong
and it's bad for business.<BR>
<BR>
Many attribute the increase in sexual harassment complaints to the Anita
Hill-Clarence Thomas sexual harassment hearings in 1991, which thrust the
issue into the national spotlight and raised public awareness about unacceptable
behavior in the workplace in Pennsylvania and nationwide.<BR>
<BR>
In 1990-91 there were 191 sexual harassment complaints filed with the Pennsylvania
Human Relations Commission. By 1993-94, the number increased precipitously,
to 738 complaints. <BR>
<BR>
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission recognizes two kinds of sexual
harassment. &quot;Quid pro quo&quot; harassment occurs when an individual
is subject to sexual advances, when conduct of a sexual nature is used as
a basis for employer decisions affecting the individual, or when the individual
is subject to such conduct as a term or condition of employment. &quot;Hostile
environment&quot; harassment occurs when unwelcome sexual conduct interferes
with an individual's job performance or creates a hostile, intimidating
or offensive work environment even if it does not result in tangible or
economic job consequences. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Bad for Business<BR>
</B><BR>
All employers must take proactive steps to prohibit sexual harassment in
the workplace and clearly communicate their sexual harassment policy to
employees.  Defending against a sexual harassment lawsuit can have a devastating
cost in money, employee morale and public image. <BR>
 <BR>
While most complaints typically have come from women working in blue-collar,
traditionally male-dominated work environments, there are a growing number
of lawsuits in white collar companies. The Wall Street brokerage firm of
Smith Barney Inc., for example, is currently battling a lawsuit where the
plaintiffs charge that the firm routinely discriminates against female employees
and has retaliated against women who complain about sexual harassment. 
Baker &amp; McKenzie, the world's largest law firm, had to pay $3.5 million
in punitive damages to a female secretary who sued the firm for sexual harassment.<BR>
<BR>
A 1995 report, &quot;Sexual Harassment in the Federal Workplace,&quot; found
that nearly half of all incidents against workers at federal work sites
go unreported and only 6 percent of workers file official complaints. Experts
say these statistics also apply to the private sector.<BR>
<BR>
The actual number of sexual harassment incidents is likely much larger than
that because many companies resolve sexual harassment complaints with employees
on their own. And some employees are reluctant to lodge a formal complaint,
and do so only as a last resort. <BR>
<BR>
In most sexual harassment lawsuits, the harassed employee does not sue the
harasser but rather the employer, the one with the deep pockets.<BR>
<BR>
Juries are doling out increasingly harsh penalties to employers whose employees
convince them that the employer condoned or failed to eradicate a hostile
work environment.  Verdicts with draconian punitive damage awards hit large
employers hard and can wipe out smaller companies. In Kimzey v. Wal-Mart
Stores, Inc., for example, the employer had to pay  $50 million in punitive
damages for not doing enough to prevent harassment in the workplace. In
Rush v. Scott Specialty Gases Inc., a federal court jury penalized the employer
by awarding a former employee 10 percent of the company's assets: That's
$4.2 million plus attorneys fees. <BR>
 <BR>
Every company needs a well-publicized policy against sexual harassment that
contains easily followed procedures for employees to file sexual harassment
complaints. The policy also must ensure that potential victims of workplace
harassment have protection from retaliation, enabling victims to come forward
as soon as an incident occurs.  Most importantly, there should be zero tolerance
for sexual harassment and the policy must be enforced 100 percent of the
time.<BR>
<BR>
Sexual harassment is wrong. The law says so, and juries have and continue
to penalize irresponsible employers accordingly.<BR>
                                           <BR>
James B. Brown is an attorney with Cohen &amp; Grigsby in Pittsburgh who
 concentrates his practice in defending employers in discrimination and
other employment litigation matters.<BR>

<P><HR><B>Olympic Tickets: Check Out This Price Markup</B><BR>
<BR>
Publisher Linda Dickerson tells the story of Atlanta's success as a hotbed
of entrepreneurial activity, beginning on page 27.<BR>
<BR>
But here's another Atlanta story, compliments of ER staffer Cynthia Bent,
a fencing enthusiast who is headed south this month to the Olympics:<BR>
<BR>
Prices charged by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games for tickets
to the men's and women's fencing at this month's games: $11 for preliminaries,
$35 for finals.<BR>
<BR>
Prices charged by Aarons Worldwide Tickets of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., for tickets
to the exact same events: $75 and $125.<BR>
<BR>
That's quite a markup. <BR>
<BR>
Add to that the fact that the Atlanta Committee is supposed to be the only
source of tickets to the Olympics. And as of June 1, no fencing tickets
are available from the Atlanta Committee - the event is sold out. <BR>
<BR>
But don't tell that to Aarons  Worldwide, which told ER it had &quot;plenty.&quot;
And Aarons  isn't the only ticket seller with fencing seats. The story is
the same for many of the smaller events like archery, handball or cycling.
Just look in your local Yellow Pages, under &quot;Tickets.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The source of private agencies' tickets depends on whom you ask. Aarons
 says it played the lottery, just like any other &quot;civilian.&quot; Top
Centre Ticket Service in Washington, D.C.,  says it bought tickets from
individuals who didn't want the second- and third-choice tickets they received
through the lottery. Diamond State, a local Pitts-burgh ticket agency, has
no comment.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;You're asking all the wrong questions,&quot; said the man who answered
the telephone there. &quot;Who put you up to this call, girlie?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Ticket distribution goes like this: The Atlanta Committee first made tickets
available to special parties like national Olympic committees (the USOC,
the French Olympic Com-  mittee, etc.) and sponsors (Coca-Cola, Kodak, etc.).
Then, on May 1, 1995, sales began to the general public through a mail order
lottery, and on February 10, 1996, through first-come, first-serve telephone
orders. The Atlanta Committee reports that 71 percent of the 555 event sessions
were sold out by the end of the mail order lottery. No tickets were distributed
until      June 8; until then, agencies were selling promises, no actual
tickets.<BR>
<BR>
A likely scenario is that sponsors and NOCs (national Olympic committees)
were reselling large blocks of seats they didn't want, but were forced to
buy by ACOG. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sponsors have a large appetite for tickets,&quot; says Laurie Olsen,
communications director for Olympic programs and ceremonies.<BR>
<BR>
To keep popular tickets available for the general public, sponsors and NOCs
were: 
<UL>
  <LI>Limited in how many tickets they could buy; and
  <LI>Required to buy at least one low-demand ticket  (to events like fencing
or archery) for every high-demand ticket (like basketball or gymnastics).
Olsen says this is the only way to keep popular events open to the public.
</UL>
In the past, this has resulted in empty stands on the day of competition,
because no one in the sponsor's party was really interested in the fencing
and archery tickets in the first place. Another result: scalping. Some sponsors
and NOCs are presumably turning around and selling their unwanted inventories
to ticket agencies, despite the fact that these sales invalidate their contract
with ACOG.<BR>
<BR>
To remedy these problems, ACOG has added a high-tech touch to the process.
Large-block ticket recipients can scan unwanted tickets back into ACOG's
ticket database. Those tickets will then be immediately available through
box offices and via the World Wide Web and telephone order. If the ticket
is sold, the sponsor gets a rebate on the ticket<BR>
<BR>
Despite this more than generous offer, ACOG already has found at least two
agencies selling tickets and filed lawsuits against them. One agent agreed
to stop selling tickets; the other, according to Olsen, filed Chapter 11
bankruptcy shortly after the lawsuit was filed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've been taking the responsibility to protect the public's rights
and our commodity very seriously,&quot; says Olsen, &quot;and communicating
to all of the sponsors and all of the NOCs, we will not deliver tickets
to them if we find out that they are reselling them to scalpers. That's
the kind of activity that frustrates the public.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It even frustrates the athletes. Fencer Suzanne Paxton, a member of the
women's foil squad, will be issued only two tickets - far from enough. Her
entire family wants to attend, but they can't find tickets anywhere but
the overpriced agencies. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know if my family can come,&quot; she says. &quot;It's very
unsettling not to have tickets in hand.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Gone Rowing<BR>
</B><BR>
On a balmy morning at the Three Rivers Rowing Association, it's not unusual
to see executives ducking out of the locker room suited up for work.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We go down shortly after 6 a.m., very early in the morning, when the
rivers are empty and there are no waterskiers or windsurfers,&quot; says
Ken Stiles, a Pittsburgh lawyer. &quot;We're back at 7:15, and by 7:30 we're
on our way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Stiles is a member of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater's crew, which was established
in 1993. Stiles, at the time, was a PBT board member.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I can't stress enough what being on the river is like,&quot; says
Ed West, property master at the Ballet and one of the team's founders. &quot;Going
out on the Allegheny, feeling this is one boat, one heart - it's a very
rewarding feeling.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The PBT crew is part of a corporate rowing program started by TRRA Executive
Director Michael Lambert. With a half dozen or so teams, it's not thriving
- but the benefits are greatly appreciated by those who are involved.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You're working with people in corporate or other levels that you don't
usually work with,&quot; says West.<BR>
<BR>
Jennifer Fagan, 25, a food technologist at Heinz, agrees. She's been with
the Heinz crew for three years; the team's been together for five.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;It's a great way to meet people from other departments - there are
other members, like from sales, that I would never have dealt with otherwise,&quot;
says Fagan. Heinz supports the team, paying the $240 dues per person, supplying
crew jackets with Heinz emblazoned across the back, and allowing leeway
for the lunchtime practice sessions. <BR>
<BR>
Corporations have the chance to compete against each other in Monday night
races, plus in the Lottie McAlice Regatta and the Head of the Ohio. And
they take it quite seriously.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We won the corporate championship two years in a row,&quot; says Stiles,
&quot;but were outrageously robbed last year.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But despite the enthusiasm of participants, TRRA has had a problem gaining
ground among corporations. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;As hard as we've worked at corporate rowing, we can't drum up other
corporations. It seems to be hard to maintain a crew, between the competition
for equipment, the early hours and the financial aspects,&quot; says West.
Members of the nonprofit PBT's crew  pay their own dues.<BR>
<BR>
The eight-person Heinz crew is raising money for their own boat - a $13,000
to $15,000 expenditure. That's a lot of bake sales. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's too bad there aren't more corporations that want to do it, because
we want more competition,&quot; says Fagan. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mind Your Ps and Qs ... and Watch Out for Bear-Hugging Russians<BR>
<BR>
</B>This month's cover story talks about H.J. Heinz Co.'s push in Russia
and includes details of cultural differences Heinz officials encountered
there as they built a manufacturing facility.<BR>
<BR>
One Heinz vice president suffered two broken ribs when he was bear-hugged
by a Russian bureaucrat (see Hold the Pickles, Hold the Ketchup on page
22). Should American executives  run when they see a Russian headed their
way with arms extended?<BR>
<BR>
Author John Mole explores cultural differences in Europe in his new book
entitled &quot;Mind Your Manners, Managing Business Cultures in Europe&quot;
(Nicholas Brealey Publishing, $17.95 paperback).<BR>
<BR>
The book explores the nuances of interpersonal relationships and tries to
explain the miscommunications that arise between different cultures with
different priorities. Mole, an Englishman, gained his cross-cultural wisdom
through a 15-year stint in American banking that took him around the world.
His summations of the character of American executives  can seem a little
smug - there's no one like a Brit for &quot;putting things in a nutshell&quot;
- but generally observations hold at least a grain of truth to them. <BR>
<BR>
Russia earns a chapter of its own. Mole says:
<UL>
  <LI> The Russian organization tends to be very autocratic, with all decisions
stemming from a central boss. Lower managers shuttle information back and
forth, with little power themselves. 
  <LI>The spoken word carries more weight than in America, with many agreements
sealed on the telephone. Papers like contracts may be open to later negotiation
and usually clarify situations rather than confirm.
  <LI> In the current climate of chaos, laws and regulations change as fast
as flags, and corruption is at least as widespread as under communism. The
Western executive is warned that commercial law is untested and unfamiliar
to most Russians.
  <LI>For Russians, smiling is not respectful on formal occasions. &quot;Smiling
for no reason is a sign of idiocy not geniality,&quot; Mole declares.
</UL>
One drawback: the book didn't mention bear hugs. <BR>

<BR>
Except in his case, it's not a matter of a handful of change making up the
difference. As executive director of the Southwest Pennsylvania Regional
Planning Commission, Kochanowski's transportation concerns are much broader
than that. He sees the area's road projects falling short by about $5 billion
over the coming 20 years.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We really have a crisis in transportation funding,&quot; Kochanowski
says, adding that short-term plans are being reworked after the transportation
department scaled back its commitment to highway projects this year.<BR>
<BR>
And that crisis, as Kochanowski sees it, is a big yellow caution sign for
the region's economy. Without additional highways and road improvements,
regional growth will slow in the years ahead. Legislators in Harrisburg
know the problem, but say there is no easy solution around the bend.<BR>
&quot;Bob has every reason to be upset,&quot; says Paul Parsells, the top
Democratic staffer on the House Transportation Committee and an aide to
Rep. Ron Gamble of Oakdale. &quot;Western Penn- sylvania really got whacked.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
PennDOT's commitment to the region over the next four years dropped in February
from $1.3 billion to $850 million. That means revising the plans and eliminating
work.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The projects missing from PennDOT's proposal hurt our region badly,&quot;
Kochanowski says. &quot;We had expectations that these projects would soon
be completed.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Just two years ago, the SPRPC drafted a forecast of the transportation needs
of Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Washington and Westmoreland counties
through 2015. By that time, the SPRPC anticipates, population will have
grown by 17 percent to about 2.7 million people and employment will have
increased 28 percent to more than 1.5 million jobs.<BR>
<BR>
To meet future needs, planners sketched out more than 50 projects. But with
the reduction in available funding, those plans have been scaled back.<BR>
<BR>
Two projects generally seen as the most important - the Mon-Fayette Expressway
and the Southern Beltway - remain priorities. These new toll roads would
complete a highway loop around the congestion of Pittsburgh, solving a long-standing
transportation problem.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pittsburgh is one of the few areas that lacks a good circumference
beltway. We've always just shoved everything through the city,&quot; says
Sen. Barry Stout of Eighty-Four, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Transportation
Committee.<BR>
<BR>
When the region thrived on &quot;smokestack industries&quot; like steelmaking
and coal-mining, companies used rails and rivers to move their goods. As
those businesses were replaced by lighter industry and the kinds of businesses
that relied on &quot;just-in-time&quot; delivery provided by trucks, roads
took on greater economic value.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For us to be competitive, we need to get the raw materials in and
the finished products out,&quot; Stout says.<BR>
<BR>
Which is tough for a company to do if its trucks spend a lot of time sitting
in traffic on Route 51 - today's best alternative to the Mon-Fayette Expressway.<BR>
<BR>
A beltway system would not only speed transportation and products around
the urban center, it also would provide prime ocations for new or expanded
businesses, Stout argues. <BR>
<BR>
But it all takes money. And since the state reduced its commitment, other
alternatives have been discussed, including a hike in the gas tax suggested
by Gov. Tom Ridge as a way to repair roads damaged by the winter storms.
The idea was an example of terrible timing - it came in an election year
and just as gas prices began climbing.<BR>
<BR>
Also put on the table for consideration - by Democratic Rep. Harry Readshaw
of Pleasant Hills - was a plan to increase vehicle registration fees. Charging
tolls on more roads, particularly Interstate 80, was another alternative
presented.<BR>
<BR>
Without some kind of financial boost, and given the number of hills and
bridges in the area and its terrain, Kochanowski says the available money
will allow only basic maintenance of current roads.<BR>
&quot;It really is a circumstance where we can only just run in place.&quot;<BR>

Last Vacation: New Hampshire, annually each summer<BR>
</B><HR>Entering the North Side's tree-lined Allegheny Square, you might
almost be in Europe - shady stone walks are lined with monumental yet intimately
scaled buildings. One of these, Pittsburgh's old Post Office building, now
houses the Pittsburgh Children's Museum. Thirteen years ago, the museum
opened in 5,000 square feet in the basement. It now occupies all three floors,
not to mention the sky-reaching rotunda. With a 22-foot  high climber, interactive
exhibits, a mural made of 30,000 gum balls and a puppet collection that
includes favorites from Mr. Rogers and Jim Henson, the museum is a child's
dream. Parents love it, too, for beneath the exciting exhibits is a mission
attributable to Executive Director Maggie Forbes that goes beyond fun and
games. Just this summer, the museum is debuting an exhibit called Safety
Street, which is geared to saving lives by teaching traffic safety - an
 important message in a city that recently lost two children to school bus
accidents. ER's Lydia Strohl talked to Forbes.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Executive Report</B>: Talk, if you will, about the early years of the
museum.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Maggie Forbes</B>: The museum opened in 1983. It was started by the Junior
League of Pittsburgh. The myth is that the idea was spawned on a rainy summer
Monday when a couple of women had nothing to do with their kids. They started
to look at how much there was geared toward their kids. They did three or
four years of research to make sure they weren't duplicating services. Certainly
we're not the first children's museum - there are well over 300 children's
museums in the country, and I get calls all the time from people looking
to start one. I think the reason is you don't go to the Metropolitan Museum
of Art and say, 'Oh, let's start one of those.' But you can come to a children's
museum and say, 'Look how wonderful. We could do something like this at
home.'<BR>
When we opened, and Buhl was next door, I think that gave us a focus. A
lot of children's museums open as sort of a junior science center, and for
us, that didn't make a lot of sense. I do get militant sometimes that children's
museums are the only ones that get their start in 5,000 square feet in the
basement, just to see how they do.<BR>
<BR>
One of the exciting things in the last 10 years is that some children's
museums are actually starting in buildings built just for them. But that's
not the norm. I love my old unsuitable building, but there are not bathrooms
on every floor. There are absolutely no amenities - no classrooms, no place
to eat, all those things that are very important to a museum.<BR>
 <BR>
And still I'd say that Pittsburgh has one of the real jewels of children's
museums. It's the right size: It's big enough that you walk in and say,
'Oh wow,' yet small enough that you can flit around and see everything,
then come back and do what you really want to do. It's very intimate, but
not the sort of place that 10-year-olds will walk into and think, 'Oh this
is a baby place.' For all our lack of funding, this place is very forgiving;
it has a richness and a luster that doesn't look shabby.<BR>
I think one of the things that we struggle with as a young organization
is that this region is so multigenerational. Western Pennsylvania parents
do with their kids what their parents did with them. That leaves us out.
We've had to struggle to introduce ourselves.<BR>
<BR>
For the first couple years I would watch them line up to see the trains
[at Buhl]. Eventually they got brave enough to come over. And then we were
bursting at the seams. We're still recovering from the congestion and the
crowds. For years I heard, 'I haven't been here since you expanded.' Well,
they weren't in a hurry to come back, to wait in line and not be able to
get in. But when we lost Buhl - it was awful. Our visitation was climbing
steadily; it hit 125,000 in 1991. I forget when the science center opened,
but it took a long time to really affect us. I swear just last year somebody
came back to see the trains. But it fell off precipitously. Things added
up - the 8-month newspaper strike, it seemed to all come at once. Advertising
is a good thing, but as a nonprofit you don't spend money you don't have,
so we didn't spend a dime on advertising. But what we did do, we concentrated
on building relationships with schools and community groups. And as hard
as it is to get to them, once you're working with them they know who you
are. And that's where this incredibly strong outreach came from. We learned
that they wanted us to come to them, because of busing problems, because
of distance.<BR>
<BR>
We're a little schizophrenic about that, because I really do believe that
the cities and museums are things we share. You're rubbing shoulders with
people you don't know. There are consequences of urban flight, of not sharing
with people. That is one of the real outcomes of a children's museum experience
- role-playing, kids interacting with other kids - it's as much about the
socialization as the content of the exhibits.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> What's the philosophy focusing the museum?<BR>
<BR>
<B>MF:</B> Our mission is to enrich children's lives. Children with their
family, schools and community groups. That makes it very inclusive. Children
do not come to us on their own. <BR>
<BR>
Those early childhood years, birth to three, are the most critical ones.
And it doesn't just drop off - you have to begin at the beginning, and then
move forward. You can't take those quantum leaps. If you don't begin at
the beginning and build - anyone who knows young kids knows how every day
they are learning things that are formative - so that is to say, let us
do everything we possibly can for our youngest kids.<BR>
<BR>
My husband's a professor at Carnegie Mellon, he's head of the Ph.D. Economics
program at GSIA, and in a recent class of his, there were 20-some candidates,
and 2 or 3 were American born. We have the finest schools in the world -
for other people. You can't fail kids in preschool, or kindergarten, and
expect them to do well at Carnegie Mellon University. The phrase higher
education offends me. My husband says I'm picking on academia, but they're
not the most exalted. It's full circle; it has to begin at the beginning.
Education is ostensibly for our youth, yet the younger you are the less
you matter. Certainly, financially, there's no question, but even in terms
of outlook - if you tell someone you are a preschool teacher, their eyes
glaze over. Yet the impact that those people have on children's lives, and
particularly on children that are at risk, is incalculable. Early childhood
experience is so important. At an early age, my kids were part of a group,
where they made choices, in a day care. And I think they have yet to find
that again. You learned to be part of the group, but you didn't have to
fit the mold.<BR>
<BR>
When my younger daughter was in kindergarten, she had a hard time adjusting.
She said, 'Mommy, we never have time to play.' I hit the roof. The teacher
said, 'They have 20 minutes for lunch and once they get used to this, they
eat more quickly and play on the playground.' The principal said, 'It's
not state law in Pennsylvania that children have recess.' But if you stop
and think about what you learn on the playground - for many of us, kindergarten
and first grade is the first social experience. And you're not getting it
if all you do is sit at a desk. You're not working things out. You're not
learning the consequences of not agreeing with the group or they won't play
with you any more. If you don't have those opportunities, that social aspect
of being part of a group is lost.<BR>
<BR>
If I could change the world, I would make it state law that there be no
more than 15 kids in the class. We know all the economic and social disparities
that exist - but we should really pay attention to the developmental disparities.
It's perfectly ok to learn to ride a two-wheeler anytime between 4 and 8
years old, and you're not weird or abnormal. Even more, you still want to
learn, because your friends do.<BR>
<BR>
But you're supposed to learn to read by second semester first grade, or
already you're a loser. When you think about all the things that contribute
to that, but our schools don't allow for those differences. <BR>
<BR>
I feel when kids come to the Children's Museum, they succeed. It doesn't
mean you don't have to learn to read; it's not to say you don't have to
learn mathematics. There are natural points, and some people will be ready
sooner. We shouldn't try to fit all those kids into the same pegs.<BR>
I also think that everybody is so busy blaming somebody else - parents say
it's the school's fault, teachers say it's the parents - that we aren't
focusing on what we can do to help our kids. Quality early childhood education
should be available to everyone.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> How does the Children's Museum incorporate elements that make
early childhood education successful?<BR>
<BR>
<B>MF: </B>We know that there are a lot of things that make children want
to learn, but failure doesn't make them want to learn. Project-oriented
things should be so much a part of the early childhood education. <BR>
<BR>
Yesterday we had a group of sixth graders from Greensburg Salem that did
a puppet show here.<BR>
 These kids had been given three months - this project was of cooperation.
There were kids who had built the puppets, or the set, or written it - they
had to research it, go find out about it, present your story and then share
it with people. Talk about a curriculum model. And I know all of the kids
on the project were not of all the same academic level. I don't know how
we've come away from recognizing how important all these things are. The
product wasn't half bad. But the process was extraordinary.<BR>
<BR>
There are ways that you can help kids want to learn, and many teachers are
doing a fine job. My daughter Alice is hugely competitive. We got a call
a few weeks ago from her new clarinet teacher saying she hadn't been to
a clarinet lesson in six weeks - totally unbeknownst to us. Well, this new
teacher came in and said that if you practice 100 minutes a week, there
will be a pizza party. Alice has never not been eligible for a pizza party.
That's not exactly the best educational model, but it's what works for her.
And I think that what works for these 10 kids may not work for that 11th
kid - but that does not mean that kid is a loser. <BR>
<BR>
There are kids that aren't bright, but they still can be good citizens.
But we still have a school system that pretty much awards academics or athletics.
Maybe you don't get excited if you're being handed a certificate - but just
think how you feel if you're not being handed that certificate. <BR>
<BR>
I remember a day when there were kids from Fox Chapel Country Day School,
and another day having kids from Northview Heights. And other than the color
of their skin and the lack of uniforms, the experience at the museum wasn't
different. The kids from Fox Chapel didn't do better at the Children's Museum
than the kids from Northview Heights. It worked for all of them. And I think
we have to come up with educational models like that.<BR>
<BR>
Another thing is, when you talk about educational reform, they always have
to have a revolution. Once again, begin at the beginning. If you have a
new model, introduce it in kindergarten, refine it, tweak it, take it up
to first grade. <BR>
<BR>
We've done it that way just because of resources. Sometimes we have no money,
but we try it. Then we can go out and get funding, because we know it works.
That learn by doing model, it is a process.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> When the museum opened, in the basement here, this exhibit, Riverscape,
was among the original offerings. Why has it remained viable?<BR>
<BR>
<B>MF:</B> Riverscape is the classic children's museum exhibit, the role-playing
we all do in kindergarten. Plus, it is about Pittsburgh in the past. These
pictures wouldn't exist simultaneously, but that wasn't our purpose, it
was to create a flavor of Pittsburgh in the past. While our first mission
is to our children, to be fun and engaging, we also want to be true to our
subject matter. This is a gritty, strong city, so the black and white photos,
the real scale, the ship's wheel, take the subject matter seriously. The
only thing we have redone is the floor. This is the exhibit where most adults
say, 'I wish they had something like this when I was growing up.' It's like
theater or literature that has an honest voice - anybody can read it.<BR>
<BR>
I really do feel that a children's museum exhibit should tell you right
away what you should do there.<BR>
 <BR>
<B>ER:</B> How long did it take for the museum to gain momentum to get out
of the basement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>MF:</B> Actually, it happened quite fast. Basically the museum went from
the basement to the second floor - we got a fabulous puppetry exhibit. But
the main rotunda space hadn't been developed. We have far more cubic footage
than square footage - it's one of our greatest challenges. Your strengths
are your weaknesses, whether you're a person, a city or an institution.
Then we got a grant and commissioned the climber, commissioned this wonderful
sculpture. There's Pisces the fish, diving into a gold lame cloud.<BR>
 <BR>
We first opened the puppet exhibit in 1985. Margot Lovelace, who ran the
longest continuing puppet theater in the country in Shadyside, donated a
big part of her collection. When we first opened it, the kids came up from
the basement all hot and sweaty and went 'Wow.' Hands-on is one thing, but
minds-on is another. This is completely visual. And they're not going to
spend as much time as they will loading up vegetables in the basement, but
it's important in that moment.<BR>
<BR>
<B>ER:</B> What's your annual budget?<BR>
<BR>
<B>MF:</B> The budget is around $1million, it's a little more than that
this year because of Safety Street. They call it 'earned' and unearned -
which I think is funny, the unearned stuff we work damn hard for, sometimes
harder. The same audience development issues existed with corporate and
foundation Pittsburgh, so it's getting better. But not any easier. We're
not defined by our collection, we're defined by our audience - and we are
not by any means the only organization in town that deals with children.
These are all things that people can take with them - the teacher that did
that puppet show took a class as puppetry as a teaching tool at the museum.
And look what it turned into. I think that relationship building is something
that is being recognized as being very important.<BR>
<BR>
This Safety Street that we are building with Allegheny General Hospital
is an example of this, it's a co-production. The idea came from a pediatric
trauma surgeon. When I first met Dr. Michael Hirsh I was showing him around
and saying, 'Inner being, self-esteem, well-being, they're all part of the
same spectrum,' and he said, 'Maggie, how would you like to save kids' lives.'
'Of course.' And this exhibit that teaches car and bus traffic safety is
about how children begin to take responsibility for their own safety. Learning
those things has to be the precursor to driver's education. When they're
15, they're rebelling, they're immortal. The safety message is so much better
taught as the responsibility of being a pedestrian when you're seven years
old. <BR>
<BR>
Also, parents are so fearful - and fear is not a positive motivator. It
makes us keep our kids apart - thinking, what are people going to do to
them. These are things we have very little control over. You can't put your
kids away in a box like Rapunzel. But these injuries that are happening
are preventable. Kids can be taught to make safer choices. This program
ties into a lot of others. I see this exhibit as a beacon for making safer
choices - how do we as a community take better care of them and teach them
to take better care of themselves. I feel very strongly about working together,
not being balkanized, not being so angry about what's going on that we don't
work together to find solutions. It's a scary time right now. The government
shuts down. That's a model for chaos right there, that the people who are
in government can't work together. And I think we see that trickle-down
effect. Our children should be something that unites us - that's something
we need to do and should be doing.<BR>
<BR>
On a feminist front, I believe that for the longest time no one paid attention
to our children for so long because it was the mother's job. The world has
changed around us and it's not just single parents, or working mothers,
but when you look at our schools, we aren't as much involved. That real
PTA involvement with schools - there was a whole segment of our population
that for so many generations was a part of the schools. The answer is not
just [for women] to stay home, you can't just worry about yours and live
alone.<BR>
<BR>
Safety Street is patterned after a program in Holland that has reduced traumatic
injury by 50 percent. This was not easy. We thought we had something everybody
was going to jump on - but we had to wrestle. When we first talked about
this, one of my board said, 'You know, Maggie, it doesn't put any fire in
my belly.' Then unfortunately, this winter, a five-year-old and a 15-year-old,
within five days, were killed in school bus accidents. The last thing that
mother told her son was, 'Don't miss the bus.' He chased the bus. These
are things that shouldn't happen. There was a 12-year-old killed by an ambulance
- he was riding his bike. I've never read an obituary for a 12-year-old.
<BR>
<BR>
This has been two or three years in the making. It's close to a $200,000
project. We're working with the communications department of Allegheny General
Hospital. They've donated $100,000, plus their expertise. IKM donated the
design of the exhibit; Laidlaw donated and refurbished the school bus; the
city gave the street lights. There's been major coalition building, curriculum
building. <BR>
<BR>
<B>ER: </B>How much of your budget do you raise yourself?<BR>
<BR>
<B>MF:</B> It's 55 percent - so I guess if you compare us to the Carnegie,
or the Symphony, we're doing pretty well.<BR>
<BR>
We've sold Stuffee, our health exhibit, to over 60 museums around the world.
He's just picking up his international market. I just got a royalty check
for one that was sold to Brazil. You unzip him, pull out his insides, and
talk about how the body works. We also have a giant lunchbox - so we talk
about what happens to the turkey sandwich after you chew it up and swallow
it down. You can pitch it to the age of the audience you're talking to.
You can say, 'What's this?' And the 7th grader can tell you - though you
find that the parents' knowledge of the anatomy is rusty at best.<BR>
<BR>
One of the things I am surprised by is that even the tiniest child might
say, 'Yuk.' I've said, 'Do you think the things inside you are disgusting?'
You talk about self-esteem, but also respect for your body, whether you're
talking about drugs or alcohol or your diet - that whole your-body-is-your-temple.
<BR>
<BR>
I say, 'These are wonderful things. Just say yes to who you are and what
you are.' Fostering respect and responsibility, making choices - I really
do think understanding makes a real big difference in this.

<B><FONT size = +1>Try Some of This Philosophy From a Guy Who<BR>
Knows How to Motivate: Steelers Coach Bill Cowher</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>Ann Devlin - Columnist</I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>So , I was reading about this business that does consulting for,
well, business. They are offering the answer to a number of corporate problems,
everything from building team spirit to keeping chins up when downsizing
begins. And they do all this by delivering just one fellow to a company's
doorstep: the Coach. Yes, for a significant fee, an honest-to-God NFL coach
can call the plays for your employees. And, yes, it seems this idea is really
taking off with managers who sideline themselves, so a coach can tackle
the most difficult plays.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think there's a great parallel between coaching [employees] and
running a football team,&quot; says Steelers coach Bill Cowher, who has
delivered speeches on the subject to corporate managers. &quot;You're bringing
together a group of people striving for a particular goal. You are trying
to get people to work with one another, understand the rules, be motivated
and work as one.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Cowher says managers have lots of questions. They want  to know how to maximize
an employee's time and effort, while building pride and dedication. This
coach emphatically states that priority No. 1 for any organization must
be communication. Every manager knows business, on a good day, can be an
obstacle course. But Cowher points out that when good communication puts
all employees on the same page, internal hurdles can often be eliminated
and goals achieved even faster.<BR>
 &quot;I think it's making sure people feel comfortable with one another.
Make sure they clearly understand what you expect from them. And I think
[you] need to give feedback ... on a regular basis ... and not just the
things they need to do better. Tell them when they are doing good.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These downsizing days of drastic corporate realignments, though, add a whole
new dimension to the business of keeping employees productive and motivated
in the midst of their fears. Cowher sees the parallel to professional football,
where the triple threat of superior talent, trades and injuries constantly
calls into question every player's fate and/or fortune. And Cowher sees
the way to motivate right through that problem: &quot;I think it is a case
of people feeling good about themselves. Whether or not the opportunity
exists with this company, or this football team, they can't control that.
So why worry about it? <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Why not have confidence in [your] own abilities ... in [your] own
skills ... and say, 'Hey, I'm going to do what you are asking of me now,'
and recognize that if I do it to the best of my abilities, it's going to
do nothing but open up opportunity for me.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
There always remain the employees, though, that even a coach couldn't motivate.
To them, the Cowher Power of Communication Rule still applies: &quot;Take
the people who are constantly testing the system, the people constantly
working on the edge, and you have to let them know what is expected of them.
Then, when it comes time to make a tough decision and say, 'Listen, you
are no longer going to be acceptable in this environment,' you can feel
good about yourself, that you have given that person every opportunity to
respond.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And what about the latitude a coach has to show, in a saliva-flying way,
his distinct displeasure when someone or something goes very wrong? Cowher
admits his profession affords him a certain license not broadly held by
America's corporate managers. Yet, under calmer circumstances, the coach
is struck by how similar the roles can be.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I'm a weight-balance. When we're winning, I've got to bring them down.
When we're losing, I've got to bring them up ... It's just like with a corporation.
When you're doing well, it's a good time to get on the employees, to make
sure that complacency doesn't set in. And at the same time, when things
aren't going well, it's your responsibility as a leader, to create the incentive
- to create othe reasoning for coming in and working a little bit harder.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Cowher philosophy will confront a fresh test in just a few weeks, when
training camp opens and the ghost of a Super Bowl Past might linger. No
problem.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I make sure you look at the big picture,&quot; Cowher says. &quot;Don't
look at one game or one situation and say because of that, forget about
the rest of the year. As long as you prepared, as long as you have gone
in there and done the very best that you can do,  you have got to accept
the fact that it isn't always going to work out ... For us after the Super
Bowl, the most important thing I wanted our team to do was remember what
we had done for that year and recognize that hey, we did everything we could
do. We put ourselves in a position to win and we played it toe-to-toe. We
went in there as an underdog and you could walk away from the 1995 season
with your head held high. And for us, that's going to be some of the fuel
that is going to spark this football team for next year.<BR>

<B><FONT size = +1>Try Some Good Mexican Cooking<BR>
Just East of the Border ... City Border</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I>By Lydia Strohl </I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR>amuel Aquirra came to the U.S. in 1987 from Guadalajara, Mexico.
His parents owned a small restaurant in the city; the family also worked
a farm just outside its limits. When he and his brothers - Ezekiel and Joel
- came here, they did what they knew. They started opening Mexican restaurants,
the first in Atlanta, Ga., in 1988. <BR>
<BR>
The three brothers now have five restaurants: three in Ohio, in Massilon,
Mansfield and Lima; one in Kokomo, Ind., and one just east of Pittsburgh,
in Monroeville. Why these distinctly undistinct locations? No magic to their
method, Aquirra says: &quot;We were just driving around, and we liked them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pittsburgh was a tip from a customer at a restaurant Aquirra owned (and
has since sold) in Indianapolis,  who said there was nothing in this town
like it. And while that's not exactly right (the Fajita Grill, near Century
III Mall, also specializes in Mexican homecooking), El Campesino does fill
a niche for those not interested in Route 51, Chi-Chi's or Taco Bell.<BR>
<BR>
Which are, coincidently, both across the street from Aquirra's Jonnet Plaza
location. But his food is worlds away from their offerings.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our food is no different from the food in my mother and father's restaurant
in Mexico,&quot; he says. &quot;We use the same seasonings, the same spices.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
One recent weekend, we sat at a booth in the brightly lighted El Campesino
- there's no disguising it's in a strip mall, no matter how many sombreros
and maracas are hung on the wall - and ordered up a storm. The menu is huge
and confusing -combinations of enchiladas, burritos, tamales, flautas, tacos,
chili rellenos and chalupas dominate the right-hand side, in platters No.
1 through No. 25. If you tire of deciphering what goes with what (there
is a handy glossary on the back of the menu, for those who do want to wade
through it), you can order a la carte. There are also dinners, like the
grilled cazuelada and the chimichanga, and El Campesino special combinations,
under which are featured local favorites like carnitas and pollo loco.<BR>
<BR>
The food is fresh and cheap and hot and plenty, that's for sure. Hot, handmade
chips and salsa come to the table immediately - some of the best I've ever
had, so crispy they almost tasted roasted, and not oily. We started with
a quesadilla, which was overloaded with cheese and grilled chicken, nicely
spiced. The guacamole dip was smooth and refreshing, not bland as they tend
to be in restaurants.<BR>
<BR>
The entrees came all looking alike - the combinations are smothered in a
thick, cheesy red sauce, which Aquirra says is thickened with mole. The
tamale is a thick cornmeal casing stuffed with barbecued pork - delicious.
 The fried chimichanga was also a treat - crispy but again not oily, with
great flavors and tender chicken that cooled just perfectly with fresh lettuce
and tomato.<BR>
<BR>
But the combinations were a bit of a disappointment - the enchiladas, burritos
and chalupas, in particular, were a little on the flavorless side. The chili
relleno had a good stuffing of ground meat, but was smothered in a strong
cheese sauce that was far too overpowering for the rest of the dish. The
chili poblano one night was so hot we turned purple upon ingestion - but
a couple days later was as tame as just-lain eggs. The chicken fajitas had
the good spices we were yearning for in the other dishes, but the chicken
that day was tough and chewy.<BR>
<BR>
It's hard, but save room for dessert. Fried ice cream - yes, it's true,
and it sure saves having to put it in the microwave - is a soft and tasty
treat, served in a taco shell with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. For
the true aficionados, the sopapillas - fried flour tortillas with cinnamon
and honey - are a delectable morsel. The flan, while rich and soft, was
almost too perfect to add much to the category. Skip coffee, unless you
want to be reminded of the office.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the campy atmosphere and some unzippy dishes (by my second visit,
I had caught on to using the bottles of El Yucetuco hot sauce on each table
- but not liberally), El Campesino is worth every penny (try as we might,
we could never spend even $10 a person). Plus, the waiters have beautiful
manners, soft accented voices and serve their customers thoughtfully and
adroitly. A large smile from the man who took our bill revealed a silver-rimmed
tooth - precious metal indeed, these days.     <BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Sharing Spaces</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Here's How to get High-End Space<BR>
When You Want Low Overhead<BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Henry Lipput</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>when attorney Alex Parrish decided to go it alone, he needed an office.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I looked around and thought about getting a space and a secretary
and all those things, and that's a huge overhead,&quot; he remembers. &quot;And
a big problem if anything goes wrong.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So instead of committing to a long-term lease in a location he could afford
but was far from his clients, Parrish found a home of sorts at HQ Business
Centers. HQ is one of a number of businesses in the Pittsburgh area offering
shared office space, secretarial services and the use of a wide range of
office equipment to small businesses.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For me it's worked out perfectly,&quot; says Parrish. &quot;It gives
me a mailing  address at One Oxford Centre, right across from the courthouse
where all the lawyers are. And it's also a quality address. For a sole practitioner
or any small business, that's critical to give you some credibility.&quot;
<BR>
 <BR>
Parrish chose HQ's &quot;Business Identity&quot; package, which lets him
use an office or conference room when he needs to, as well as a full-time
  receptionist. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The thing I use all the time is the phone system. I have my own phone
number. When it rings, a confident, professional secretary answers it every
time within a couple rings, the way I would ask my own full-time secretary
to answer it, and then does whatever I've asked with the call. I can be
working at home and they'll send it home. It'll ring there; the secretary
will tell me who called, and then I talk to the person. It's great,&quot;
says Parrish.  <BR>
<BR>
The HQ Business Centers franchise includes Pittsburgh, as well as Cleveland
and Columbus. There are  three locations locally.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are two customer bases that drive the business,&quot; says HQ
President Calvin Hunter. &quot;The first customer base is large firms which
need to set up branch operations in another city but don't want to commit
to a fully staffed and equipped office. The second base is the local entrepreneur,
the small business professional.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Hunter thinks the most important feature that shared-office facilities like
his offer clients is telephone related.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They don't have to have any contact with Bell Atlantic. We provide
a complete telephone package - a phone number, phone lines, the instrument,
long distance service and 800 number service if they want it. Plus, we answer
their phones,&quot; says Hunter. Other office services include fax, copying,
mail and a range of computer-based services like word processing, desktop
publishing and presentation and proposal preparation. <BR>
 <BR>
In some instances, shared-office setups have been a stepping stone for the
growth of small businesses. HQ's Hunter recalls one investment management
firm in Cleveland that started using the business identity service close
to five years ago.  <BR>
<BR>
&quot;He ran that business out of his home until it became a two- or three-
person business,&quot; says Hunter. &quot;And then he grew into our facility.
I think he started with three offices, and it grew to six.  After about
three years of that, they just outgrew us there. So he took a traditional
space.&quot;<BR>
The concept works for a number of service-based industries.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is like incubator space for the white collar worker,&quot; says
Steve Arcivolo, a commercial real estate developer who rents office space
at the HQ facility in One Oxford Centre. Arcivolo is a virtually self-sufficient
solo practitioner, with occasional support from the HQ staff.  <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have a dedicated fax line in my office, so I use my own fax, which
doubles as a photocopy machine. I have my own computer with a printer so
I can type my own letters. I would say I operate 90 to 95 percent self-sufficiently,&quot;
says Arcivolo. &quot;But if there's something I need them to do, they do
it for me. It's nice to know that it's there if I need it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Arcivolo has found the HQ setup ideal for a small, one person operation.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I could really just get established immediately, without having to
buy furniture or a lot of equipment, without hiring a secretary or even
looking for office space,&quot; says Arcivolo. &quot;They have a ready-made
receptionist/secretarial staff, office equipment, furniture. I have a conference
room if I want it, when I want it.  And I like the location.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is going to come a point in time, probably, when I'm going to
need my own office, I'm going to need my own secretary,&quot; he says. 
&quot;I'll have to try and judge when I'm ready for that.  But until you
build up that head of steam, this is a good place to be.&quot; <BR>

<B><I><FONT size=+2>Corporate Fitness<BR>
</FONT></I><FONT size =+1>Can Companies Save on Healthcare<BR>
by Motivating Employees to Exercise?</B></FONT><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Surprise, surprise. Healthy, active employees are better for a corporation
than sedentary ones. Studies consistently prove that introducing some form
of corporate fitness benefit improves productivity and morale while decreasing
healthcare costs, turnover and absenteeism.<BR>
<BR>
For instance: medical claims for corporate fitness program participants
at Steelcase were 55 percent lower - $478.61 for participants vs. $869.98
for nonparticipants - over a six year period. Dupont saw absenteeism reduced
47.5 percent over six-years among   participants in their fitness program.
Eighty percent of Union Pacific Railroad employees involved in corporate
fitness reported increases in productivity; 75 percent thought it increased
levels of relaxation and concentration at work. The Canadian Life Assurance
Company found job turnover among fitness program participants was 31.4 percent
lower over a seven-year period than nonparticipants. And in the first year
of its fitness program, the Scoular Grain Co. re-duced healthcare costs
by over $1 million - that's $1,500 per employee.<BR>
<BR>
Call the evidence anecdotal if you will. But in an area like healthcare,
where good fiscal news is infrequent, you'd think any economic cheer would
be embraced like a frosty beverage on a summer day. Yet in a Towers Perrin
survey, just 21 percent of mid- to large-size western Pennsylvania employers
reported supporting corporate fitness. Nationwide, that figure is a bit
larger - anywhere from 29 to 50 percent, depending on to whom you speak.
<BR>
<BR>
Hello, Corporate America. Anyone home?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think corporations understand that couch potatoes are expensive,&quot;
says Cindy Mendolia, director of marketing/membership for the Downtown YMCA.
&quot;But it takes money to save money, and they have to invest in their
employees. They've downsized, but they're not really taking care of the
employees who are left. Employees are putting in more time, but there's
no decompression.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A lot of managers are in tune, but they don't want to spend the bucks,&quot;
says Mendolia, quoting the Y's corporate subsidized membership at a low
    2 percent of its 2,100 members. &quot;The company spends more for employee
assistance programs - to handle issues that arise from stress.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
By then it's too late for prevention, in either health or spending. Locally,
GNC attributes healthcare claims by its employees that are 15 percent below
normative data to a combination fitness/wellness program instituted in the
early '90s. In addition to a fitness facility that's available free-of-charge
to employees at GNC's downtown headquarters, it has annual screenings for
cholesterol, blood pressure and weight. If employees pass normative standards
they are awarded $100 - an improvement can garner up to $50. Cash disincentives
are also used - smokers can pay as much as $65 a year more for healthcare.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Because the nature of our business is self care we have a strong corporate
philosophy that our employees should have healthy lives,&quot; says Eileen
Scott, vice president of human resources at GNC. <BR>
<BR>
The numbers of employees who use the fitness center is relatively low -
75 to 100 out of 500 employees at the site - but about 350 employees use
the screening mechanism. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've had people with very serious cholesterol problems they didn't
know about change their lifestyle and stave off heart attacks,&quot; says
Scott. &quot;And they like having the fitness center even if they don't
use it - it gives them a good feeling about the company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Others, too, tout fitness benefits as an attraction and retention tool.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We attract applicants of higher energy levels, competitive and disciplined,&quot;
says Terry Kelly, vice president of human resources for Federated, which
pays half of the $67 monthly dues at the DoubleTree fitness center for its
managers who want to work out there. About one-third of them do. &quot;We
thought it would be a good thing to do - management works hard and we are
always looking for benefits to enhance our package - but we didn't know
how well it would be received.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kelly herself takes advantage of the membership, working out three times
a week on the treadmill with her husband, also a Federated manager.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;It affords us the opportunity to exercise together and that means
a lot. When I leave work I have to kind of force myself to go over there
- but then I leave feeling better about my day,&quot; she says. &quot;The
benefits are hard to quantify, but we probably do have increased productivity
and greater morale. And camaraderie - people from different departments
meet each other working out together.&quot;<BR>
Chris Gibson, manager of the DoubleTree fitness center, says Federated's
location in the adjacent Liberty Center is key. Employees from Edgar Snyder's
law practice, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and accounting firm Schneider
Downs have corporate perks there as well.<BR>
<BR>
Fitness benefits can be as easy as hiring an aerobics instructor to come
in a few times a week after work, says KaDee Lewis, a local corporate fitness
consultant who does a similar program for a PNC Bank branch. She's also
in the process of setting up an in-house gym for Tomko Plumbing and Heating
in the South Hills. But both Lewis and Gibson are disappointed with corporate
interest here.<BR>
&quot;Companies are myopic,&quot; Gibson says. &quot;They're not assessing
the long-term behavior of their employees and the impact of that. They think
[a corporate fitness program] will encourage the people who already do it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've only looked at it informally,&quot; says John Kozar, manager
of  insured benefits at Aristech Chemical Corp. &quot;I'm sure bosses think,
'People can go home and jog.' It's something where you need a health fan
at the top. Pittsburgh in general has old line management; they don't get
into this stuff.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think it's a good benefit - anything you can do in terms of education
is good. In general, only the healthiest people will participate - but they're
setting an example.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
What can't be overlooked in all this is that even in the corporations that
do offer fitness benefits - whether through an in-house fitness center or
by subsidizing all or part of an employee's health club membership - participation
isn't the rage. 84 Lumber Company built a fully equipped fitness center
for employees in their 84 office in 1987. In 1989 they opened the center
to the public. Today, just 156 of the 1,100 members are company employees;
350 are eligible.<BR>
<BR>
Edgar Snyder's looking at a similar ratio: Just about half of the staff
in his Pittsburgh law office take advantage of a corporate fitness policy
which provides reimbursement up to $40 a month on health club membership
or other fitness/life-style memberships.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The motivation is simple,&quot; says Snyder. &quot;I work out every
day and believe that has helped me in my career. Working in a trial law
firm today creates tension - for me, this is an outlet.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;And,&quot; Snyder adds, &quot;I believe that people who keep themselves
in good shape are more productive - and for me, productivity goes right
to the  bottom line.&quot;                                             <BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>Employee Evaluations</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size=+1>Either Do Them Right<BR>
Or Don't Do Them At All<BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Jim Urban</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Attorney Robert L. McTiernan has seen a few employee perfor- mance
evaluations that came back to haunt the employer. So has attorney Thomas
S. Giotto. <BR>
<BR>
It's common: The employee is dismissed for a legitimate reason, but has
a handful of evaluations dating back several years that portray that employee
as dedicated, effective, productive or hard-working - the list can go on.
So if the evaluations were truthful, why was that employee even terminated
in the first place? And what will a civil-court jury hearing a wrongful
termination case think?<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;The problem with evaluations, if they're not done properly, is that
they will contradict a supervisor's point of view,&quot; says McTiernan,
an employment law attorney with Tucker Arensberg in Pittsburgh. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;You get to the point where you discharge someone, and the evaluations
conflict with why you are discharging them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I really haven't had many lawsuits where the performance appraisals
helped the employer,&quot; adds Giotto, a labor and employment law attorney
with Klett Lieber Rooney &amp; Schorling in Pittsburgh. &quot;Usually, they
harm the employer.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And both McTiernan and Giotto agree: If you don't do performance appraisals
right, don't do them. Period.<BR>
<BR>
That said, statistics show that an estimated 70 million employees receive
performance appraisals annually in the United States. The employees often
crave the feedback, believing any pay raise or promotion possibilities for
them will turn on how favorable their evaluation is. So employers large
and small engage in the annual process of taking time to evaluate the people
who work for them, many times bestowing undeserved praise on employees.
It's human nature.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Supervisors don't like to say negative things about employees,&quot;
Giotto says. &quot;It's not motivation. It's hard to do. The supervisors
usually overrate everyone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And that's were problems can start.<BR>
<BR>
Take, for instance, one federal lawsuit in which a female employee charged
sex discrimination after being terminated by her employer,  a television
station. The station said the woman's termination was based on poor performance,
yet the jury was shown performance appraisals that contained complimentary
language and rated the woman's performance as satisfactory. The jury eventually
awarded damages to the woman.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Evaluation Options</B><BR>
<BR>
There are four common methods of employee evaluation, each of which has
strengths and weaknesses:
<UL>
  <LI>	In the weighted responsibility method, employees are rated on how
effectively they carry out the position's responsibilities, which the employer
usually lays out for the employee. This method is particularly useful for
employees subject to merit-based pay, but also requires a time investment
that many supervisors won't make.
  <LI>	The weighted trait method utilizes standardized rating forms that
list qualities or &quot;traits&quot; of employee performance, such as &quot;Employee
works well with co-workers.&quot; This method is easily administered, but
tends to be general and focused more to personality instead of performance.
  <LI>	With the management by objective method, the employee and supervisor
agree on performance objectives for a set time period, monitor progression
toward the goals and ultimately base the evaluation on whether the goals
were achieved. This method includes no surprises, but is subject to the
limitations of forecasting. In other words, an unforeseen occurrence might
make it impossible for the employee to reach his or her goals. Then, how
do you evaluate?
  <LI>       The narrative evaluation method is just that, a written rundown
of the employee's performance, with no set formula. This tends to be the
most descriptive and informative for the employee, but also can be hampered
by a supervisor who lacks writing ability or does not have the time to invest
in the evaluation. If the supervisor spends 15 minutes writing an evaluation
that should take one hour, trouble is looming.
</UL>
<BR>
&quot;Unless you really train supervisors and oversee the system, the evaluations
tend to not be a useful tool,&quot; McTiernan says, &quot;either because
the supervisors give too favorable a review or they do not give an accurate
account.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The bottom line: Do evaluations right or don't do them.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's better not to do them at  all than to do them improperly,&quot;
McTiernan says.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If you are not good at putting things into writing, then don't put
them in writing,&quot; Giotto adds. &quot;If you are not capable of doing
performance appraisals properly, then don't do them.&quot;

<B><FONT size =+2>Evolving SAT Scores</FONT></B><BR>
<B><I><FONT size=+1>College Admissions Counselors Say the Standardized Test<BR>
Scores Still Carry Weight, Just  Not as Much as Before</FONT></I></B><BR>
<I>By Gretchen McKay</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Ask any college-bound high school junior what he's losing the most
sleep over, and chances are, he'll mention the Scholastic Aptitude Test,
or SAT.<BR>
<BR>
Those fears are well founded: SAT scores are required by virtually every
college and university for admission, and have become so important that
students spend hundreds of dollars on prep courses to bone up for the test.
In fact, more than 1 million students in the class of 1995 took the dreaded
exam last year, scoring an average of 428 out of 750 points on the verbal
section and 482 on the math.<BR>
<BR>
 Yet prospective collegiates waiting for those scores can relax - a bit.
Though SAT scores are often a good determinant of which students will be
admitted into a particular college, they're only one piece of the application
puzzle.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, most institutions consider SAT scores as just one in a whole laundry
list of admission requirements. Just as important are grades, class rank
and extracurricular activities, as well as college prep-type curriculum,
such as honors courses in English, natural sciences, history and mathematics.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;SAT scores do carry weight,&quot; acknowledges Kevin Altomari, executive
associate director of admissions at the University of Pittsburgh, &quot;because
it continues to be the one benchmark consistent for all students.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
However, he continues, colleges are less likely to rely on them as blindly
as they have in the past, especially since the test scores have been &quot;recentered&quot;
so the national average on each section will be boosted back to 500 next
year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's a tool to help us better understand an applicant, but we don't
put the scores into a computer and spit out who to accept,&quot; says Altomari.
Rather, an admissions committee meets each day to individually review the
more than 10,000 applications Pitt receives each year.<BR>
<BR>
At Pitt, grades are most important, followed by standardized test scores
and class rank. The school won't publish SAT averages for its incoming freshman
classes because then applicants would &quot;put too much weight on that
piece of the pie,&quot; says Altomari.<BR>
<BR>
Chatham College is more forthcoming - its students average 1050 and above.
But it, too, considers SAT marks as only part of the story.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Scores can be deceiving,&quot; says Annette Giovengo, dean of enrollment
management. &quot;Someone may not test well but have excellent academic
preparation.&quot; Conversely, a student may test well but have a transcript
that reveals she's not ready for college work, she says.<BR>
<BR>
As at Pitt, good grades are of significance, but Giovengo says they take
a &quot;good hard look&quot; at what those grade point averages tell them.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We look for commitment to academic achievement,&quot; Giovengo says,
noting some students struggle in the early years, pulling their GPA down.
&quot;We don't believe in penalizing a student for a bad experience she
may have had - such as a death in the family.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Extracurricular activities, too, are a big piece of the puzzle, as is community
service and leadership skills because they paint a picture of a student
who will contribute to a campus as well as enhance the educational product.<BR>
<BR>
To give prospective students a chance to sell themselves, Chatham recommends
that applicants complete one of five essays on what it takes to be a successful
student (for example, &quot;I have a lifelong dream or goal&quot; or &quot;I
am an independent thinker&quot;). In addition, Chatham encourages students
to submit portfolios, resumes, graded writing samples - anything that gives
a better picture of their background and goals.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We try to get as complete a picture of that student as possible so
we can make the best judgment we can about her,&quot; says Giovengo. <BR>
<BR>
At Seton Hill College, the number one criterion for admission is a successful
marriage of school grades and curriculum.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;We would prefer to have someone take calculus and earn a 'B' than
stop at algebra 2 and get an 'A', &quot; says Peter Egan, director of admissions.<BR>
<BR>
Seton Hill also looks for extracurricular activities such as sports, band,
clubs and student council, as well as community service because, as Egan
reasons, students who are involved in high school tend to be those who are
more involved in college.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;All activities are student-run,&quot; he says, &quot;so we're looking
for students who will contribute.&quot;<BR>
An essay, too, is suggested for those students who want to explain a circumstance
where they might need extra help, or would like to tell what they   hope
to accomplish at Seton Hill.       <BR>
<BR>
<B>What Admissions Counselors Consider<BR>
<BR>
1.	Grades and courses taken in high school<BR>
2.	SAT scores<BR>
3.	Class rank<BR>
4.	Essays included with the admissions application<BR>
5.	Extracurricular activities<BR>
6.	Leadership qualities</B><BR>

<B><FONT size=+1>Here's a Professional Athlete Who Shunned<BR>
Free Agency's Big Bucks to Stay in Pittsburgh<BR>
</FONT></B><I>By Bill Modoono</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>To his agent, it's a feel-good, &quot;dog-bites-man&quot; story that
never gets the publicity it deserves. To his general manager, it is simply
a case of someone looking at the &quot;total package&quot; and finding value
someplace other than the bottom line.<BR>
<BR>
Even Jeff King feels the need to remind people every once in a while: &quot;I
did not take a pay cut.&quot;<BR>
Indeed, he did not. In fact, since he stands to make $5 million for two
years work with the Pirates, he certainly qualifies as one of the highest-paid
residents of western Pennsylvania.<BR>
<BR>
In this era, that's not unusual for baseball players, especially for those
who have proven to be as productive and versatile as King, the Pirates first
baseman. What makes King unusual is that he could have made more - maybe
a lot more - but he chose not to explore the possibility. <BR>
<BR>
At the end of the 1995 season, with baseball in Pittsburgh in a state of
uncertainty, King showed his faith in  the Pirates. Rather than choose to
become an unrestricted free agent, which he was entitled to do, he instructed
his agent to make a deal that would keep him in Pittsburgh. <BR>
<BR>
In essence, he told his agent to make a deal without really knowing how
much he was worth. <BR>
And as someone capable of playing all four infield positions who has shown
steady improvement in power and production in his seven-year career, he
was likely to find he was worth plenty. In a Sports Illustrated poll of
Major League players, managers and general managers, King was selected among
the five most underrated players in the National League. In other words,
the fans don't necessarily know how good King is, but the rest of the league
does.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Possibly, I could have gotten him $1 million more and probably $400,000
to $500,000 more a year,&quot; says Alan Hendricks, King's agent. &quot;This
is a wonderful story about loyalty. We all have images of athletes chasing
the almighty dollar. This is the reverse of that story.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For the 31-year-old King, there were other concerns beyond money. A year-round
resident of Wexford, he enjoys the North Hills, as does his wife, Laura,
and his four children. He likes the Christian school that his children attend
and he very much likes his church, the Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance
Church of Allegheny Center.<BR>
 <BR>
He also likes the Pirates organization because of the way it's treated him.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Pirates have always treated me well,&quot; says King, who had
a career-high 18 home runs in 1995. <BR>
&quot;They supported and stuck by me when I hurt my back in 1991. I appreciate
that.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
He also appreciates his manager, Jim Leyland, and the fact that the Pirates
told him he could play first base full-time in 1996. As a free agent, he
likely would have generated most interest as a third baseman. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;He had a preference to play first, not third,&quot; says Hendricks.
<BR>
<BR>
Even the things that have previously hurt the Pirates in attempts to sign
and/or hold onto other free agents were positives for King. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Pittsburgh is the greatest place to play,&quot; King says. &quot;I
like the small-time atmosphere. I like the fact that there's not a big media
presence here. In New York or L.A., the media can break a player, but that
doesn't happen here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Pirates General Manager Cam Bonifay says for many free agents, &quot;the
money aspect is not always the thing that determines where players go.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Bonifay believes players - especially the more mature ones - look at the
total package, which includes the manager, the organization and the city,
as well as family concerns. He thinks the Pirates can attract some free
agent talent in the coming years by pushing the new ownership and the city's
commitment to a new ballpark.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I suppose you're always curious about how much you're worth on the
open market,&quot; says King. &quot;But it was no secret I wanted to stay
here. The deal we made was good for me and good for them. I got to stay
where I wanted. I didn't feel like uprooting my family. To me it was not
worth it to go to a situation that might not be as comfortable for me.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
His agent has another theory. &quot;I think he didn't want to be tempted,&quot;
says Hendricks of King's decision not be a free agent. &quot;He's a nice
man and I think he was afraid the offer would come back $4 million a year
instead of $2.5 million.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
King, however, is not easily tempted.  He looks at it this way: &quot;Sometimes
getting every last dollar is not the most important thing.&quot;<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Hold the Pickles,<BR>
Hold the Ketchup<BR></B>
</FONT SIZE><BR>
<I>By Richard Bierck</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>The Chernozem region of southern Russia is a farmer's dream, with
black, fertile soil extending more than 12 feet deep into the earth. Here,
about 1,000 miles from Moscow, the growing season runs about the same duration
as western Pennsylvania's growing season, but that's where the comparison
stops. Few, if any, agricultural regions in the world compare to the Chernozem.
It's that black, mineral-rich earth. Crops thrive in it.<BR>
<BR>
This year, many farmers in the Chernozem are growing buckwheat for H.J.
Heinz Co., the Pittsburgh-based multinational company that's more famous
for products from tomatoes and cucumbers - ketchup and pickles - than products
from buckwheat.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the Chernozem farmers, with that black earth imbedded under
their fingernails, will harvest their buckwheat this fall and haul it down
the country roads of rural Russia to an H.J. Heinz Co. plant in Georgievsk,
in Russia's Stavropol region.<BR>
<BR>
For at Heinz's Russian facility, it's not pickles or ketchup rolling off
the plant floor, but baby cereal. The company is hoping that mothers who
feed their children Heinz baby cereal now will develop brand loyalty - eventually
feeding their families Heinz soups or condiments as the company expands
in this huge market. They think it's a good bet.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The one way consumers are the same in Russia and the United States
is when it comes to babies,&quot; says Brian E. Falck, area director for
Heinz operations in Russia.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Parents are very cautious about the brands they buy and are willing
to spend money on those brands. That's money that they would never spend
on themselves. Even if it means sacrificing for the rest of the family,
infant feeding has to have a level of trust,&quot; Falck says.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Open Door<BR>
</B><BR>
Companies like Heinz began looking closely at Russia after December 1988,
when the Soviet Union passed a law allowing foreign majority holding in
businesses. This prompted a slew of U.S. companies to jump into Russia.
Many, like Heinz, had already sold some products there, but now manufacture
there, too.<BR>
 <BR>
Take Pepsi, the cola then-Soviet Premier Nikita Kruschev was photographed
drinking in 1959. It has long held a market edge over rival Coke in Russia
and is investing $550 million over five years to expand manufacturing and
distribution reach in central, northwestern and eastern Russia.<BR>
<BR>
And Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co., which supplies Russia with chewing gum made at
its plant in France, is spending $25 million to build a chewing gum plant
in St. Petersburg.<BR>
<BR>
For Heinz, the idea was to locate production near the raw materials - the
grains of the Chernozem - because the dry baby cereal could be shipped more
economically than the raw materials. Since Stavropol is a Russian tourist
attraction because of its inland springs, it has excellent rail and air
travel connections.<BR>
<BR>
And business-wise, a majority partnership in Russia was desirable to Heinz,
which   is resistant to releasing its trademark unless it controls the enterprise.
At the same time, however, Heinz executives say they prefer not to own 100
percent of a foreign partnership because they prefer a substantial local
commitment. Thus they echo the philosophy of CEO Anthony J.F. O'Reilly,
as he wrote in the Columbia Journal of World Business in the spring of 1988:
&quot;Above all other requirements for offshore joint ventures is our imperative
of majority interest. ... The key to our strategy has been to use the joint
venture as our entree to a region. A joint venture offers the twin advantages
of familiarity and facilities.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But there are disadvantages to working this closely as well - especially
between two cultures with a history like that of Russia and the U.S. Heinz
executives began the on-again, off-again project while communism still reigned,
and for six years navigated the regime's collapse and tumultuous aftermath
to achieve its fruition.<BR>
 <BR>
Today, about 180 Russians cover two daily shifts at the Heinz plant in Georgievsk,
producing box upon box of dry baby cereal in two flavors: buckwheat and
buckwheat with apple.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Genesis<BR>
</B><BR>
It was early July 1989, in Stavrapol,  the heart of the Chernozem. The scene
was the office of Alexander Gaevou. Several telephones, a status symbol
in the Soviet bureaucracy, adorned his otherwise stark desk, proving Gaevou
a figure of some authority.<BR>
<BR>
 Gaevou was director of the area's kombinat, a combination of farms and
factories established by the region's former governor, Mikhail Gorbachev,
as an incubator for agro-industrial reform. The Soviet government had pointed
to Gaevou when Heinz executives asked whom to contact concerning a partnership
in Stavrapol; this meeting followed several with other leaders, who had
seemed uninspired.<BR>
<BR>
Extending from Gaevou's desk was a long conference table that bore bottles
of mineral water (a Communist tradition since Stalin) and a jar of candy.
Sitting around the table were Englishman Michael J.B. Smither, operations
director for Heinz in eastern Europe; Tom MacMurray, a Scotsman who preceded
Falck as the company's area director for central and eastern Europe; Gaevou;
local government officials; and assorted bureaucrats, some of whom had traveled
1,000 miles south from Moscow.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They were deputies this and deputies that; they had obviously been
sent to watch us dangerous foreigners,&quot; Smither recalls.<BR>
<BR>
Why shouldn't they? The Berlin Wall wouldn't come down until the following
year; the Soviet Union was not dissolved until December 1991. And though
the Soviet Union was already embarking on the wrenching transition from
totalitarianism to the first vestiges of a free-market economy, old habits
- and hatreds - die hard. <BR>
<BR>
Heinz executives used this initial meeting to size up Gaevou, too. &quot;It
was exploratory,&quot; says Smither, a former attache in the British embassy
in Moscow who speaks fluent Russian.<BR>
&quot;We were feeling them out and they were feeling us out. The Cold War
wasn't officially dead yet,&quot; Smither says.<BR>
<BR>
After proceeding for about an hour, the meeting became mobile as Gaevou
proudly squired the Heinz people around state farms and processing factories.
The tours and meetings continued for weeks, often centering around a rustic,
wood-toned hotel. Many times, the entourage didn't sit down to dinner until
late in the evening.<BR>
<BR>
As MacMurray tells it, this was just as well, for dinner invariably involved
a good deal of toasting, with native vodka that was glycerine-slick from
freezer storage. &quot;Every time they toasted, they drank a glass of vodka
- and they toasted a lot,&quot; MacMurray recalls. &quot;The secret was
to take a small sip when someone else is toasting and to keep your own toasts
to a minimum.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the quintessentially Russian Gaevou didn't subscribe to this minimalist
school of toasting. To the contrary, as he grew to trust his American partners-to-be,
his toasts evolved into bear hugs - one so exuberant it broke two ribs of
Paul Corddry, then a Heinz senior vice president. &quot;Paul's eyes practically
popped out of their sockets,&quot; says Smither. &quot;When a Russian gives
you a bear hug after a few glasses of vodka, you know you've been hugged.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But even as Gaevou hugged his new partners, another squeeze was in the offing
- that of old-line Soviet bureaucracy on the strange new culture of open-market
capitalism.<BR>
<BR>
From 1989 to 1993, the fate of the project was directly in the hands of
the Russian government. Beyond the challenge of dealing with a bureaucracy
 designed to operate a state-regulated economic system, Heinz had to overcome
the obstacle of being pegged an outsider with an alien commercial  mindset.
Russian economics is different than American economics.<BR>
<BR>
Bruce Bowden, chair of Buchanan Ingersoll's international practice group,
has experienced the difference first-hand during trips to the Ukraine. &quot;They're
able to do the math,&quot; Bowden says. &quot;But they don't approach it
the same way.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Specifically, the Russians want to know how much finished product they'll
get, not how much money they'll make. Heinz found that out.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The biggest sticking point in the whole thing was that the Russian
economy was material-based, in which they think of the output of a factory
as so many things, whereas we tend to think of it in terms of a value,&quot;
Smither explains. &quot;So the concept of them receiving their share of
a business in money - in dividends - was foreign to them. If they had 15
percent of the business, for example, they thought they were going to get
15 percent of the product that the factory produced.&quot;<BR>
Could this cultural chasm be spanned by speaking in terms of rubles and
dollars? Hardly easy, considering that under the former communist system,
virtually all rubles ultimately belonged to the government.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They didn't instinctively understand that dollars and rubles are tools
in business and that you need to use those tools ... they knew the theory,
but it doesn't work that way,&quot; says Smither. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;[For a long time,]Russian industry didn't have any means of counting
work in progress. It just measured what came in and what went out. So you
can have a very efficient business with a high turnover, but there could
have been tens of millions of dollars tied up in work in progress that was
bankrupting the enterprise.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Other Cultural Gaps<BR>
</B><BR>
In the Soviet Union, building a new factory was naturally approached in
its societal totality. The project was viewed as the nexus of a new community
that would spring up around it - a community that, like the factory, would
be built by the state. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Historically, if the Russians built a factory on a greenfield site,
they would automatically include as part of that factory the costs of providing
accommodations for the workers: transportation, schools, medical and dental
care,&quot; says Smither. &quot;They would build a mini-city around the
factory, which means their critical mass of factories had to be pretty large
to make it worth doing. In a horizontally integrated economy, you build
a factory to do one thing only - manufacture products. But if you wanted
to have the permits to operate a factory [in the Soviet Union], people would
come along and say, 'Where is your hospital? Where is your fire station?
Where is your kindergarten? Where is your nursery school?' &quot;<BR>
<BR>
Though that expectation was, in reality, suspended with communism's fall,
the mindset remained. Tethered to Gaevou, Heinz executives trudged through
the moraine left by a glacier of Soviet-era bureaucracy. To make matters
worse, the deal was still not cemented when Soviet tanks rolled into Latvia
and Lithuania in the Baltic crackdown in 1991. Heinz's straightforward business
development suddenly assumed political connotations. A clean getaway was
even in doubt, because the ruble wasn't then convertible to dollars. Heinz
executives grew antsy about whether they'd be able to pull out their stake
if they decided to.<BR>
<BR>
And after this threat passed, another potential deal-breaker came when the
Soviets disbanded the kombinats. Suddenly, Heinz officially had no Russian
partners.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Then they went through the legal process of taking the rights to someone
else,&quot; says Smither, a process during which many previously resolved
issues were put back on the table. &quot;All that seemed to take about three
years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It was 1993, nearly two years after the USSR no longer existed, before the
Russian government gave the Russo-American partnership permission to proceed
with plans to build the factory. <BR>
And the fun was just beginning.<BR>
<BR>
Heinz secured a promise for  $3 million in grant money from the federal
Agency for International Development. The agency's interest was for Heinz
to transfer western technology in the form of construction methods and agricultural
techniques, and thus benefit Russian society. <BR>
 According to MacMurray, the grant money, $2 million of which was actually
used, was useful in defraying the cost of teaching basic construction methods
in a culture where quality was only consistent in prerevolution structures.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most Russian buildings aren't built very well. When they build a building
and take the scaffolding down, it looks about 20 years old,&quot; says MacMurray.<BR>
<BR>
Design commenced immediately, and the foundation was laid in late 1994.
 But Heinz's contractors had to begin at ground zero to get the right materials.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We decided to use western construction companies to teach the locals,&quot;
says MacMurray. &quot;One thing they were taught is how to make bricks.
We were rejecting about 70 percent of the bricks coming to the site. Then
they taught the brickies [masons] how to build walls; they had never used
plumb lines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
All this took time, especially considering the language barrier. Though
the different companies involved had some bilingual people on board, a new
way of doing something - once understood - had to be related to monolingual
co-workers. &quot;It takes twice or three times as long that way,&quot;
MacMurray says.<BR>
<BR>
The factory was finished as designed in 1995, but delays continued to bedevil
the project. Though free market ventures were getting the go- ahead from
the Russian government, the process was still replete with bureaucracy lingering
from the Soviet era. Add to this the new, strange animal of a Russo-American
partnership, and the result was mounds of red tape for even the most routine
items.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just getting safety certificates for simple thing like boilers would
take two or three months,&quot; MacMurray recalls. &quot;Electrical installation,
pipe work, sewers, drains - everything had to be inspected and it all took
two or three months longer than expected.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The farmers were another concern - obviously,  without buckwheat, there's
no cereal. Heinz executives have labored to consistently obtain quality
raw materials at the right price. The buckwheat must be of a precise grade
and be milled to the correct specifications. Also in demand is the right
kind of apple puree. &quot;You have to find out who's doing it [the best]
and then go work with them,&quot; Smither says.<BR>
<BR>
Shepherded by such hands-on effort, though, the crops are coming in as ordered,
and production is proceeding as planned. Heinz is now sending the dried
baby food initially to Moscow and St. Petersburg. The cereal sits beside
the Heinz baby food that is shipped in from other European     facilities.<BR>
<BR>
<B>A Homegrown Strategy</B><BR>
<BR>
The decision to produce pre-cooked baby food from and on Russian soil hinged,
for the most part, on the culture's ubiquitous cooking tool - the samovar,
which boils water used to make tea.<BR>
&quot;Baby food was their crying need in Russia, but we had to make baby
food safely and successfully using local ingredients and local processing
and yet still have an advanced recipe that met the needs of the society,&quot;
Smither says. &quot;The samovar doesn't make tea. It boils water. Because
of the samovar, boiled water is almost universally available across the
whole of the former USSR, whether in a tent on the steppes or in a railway
waiting room in Murmansk. So if you've got a mother with a baby and give
her a product to add boiling water to, she's got a precooked, ready meal
that's hygienic.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Neat, clean, efficient. But would the mothers buy it? In the Russian culture,
where time isn't so precious, would they care that the baby food was instant?
In America? They would. But this was not America, so that's where marketing
came in.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The convenience part won't appeal to all Russians because, unlike
the West, there are still many stay-at-home moms. Just as important, there
are still many grandparents living with the family. [The convenience] is
really our prime education job. The consumer has got to understand the convenience,&quot;
says Falck. &quot;But it's an opportunity, too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Heinz will buy some print advertising and hand out samples. It also will
try to educate the healthcare professionals who staff birth houses, the
Russian version of maternity wards.<BR>
<BR>
Who wins from this project? Both Russia and Heinz.<BR>
<BR>
In the country, some 1,200 Russians, apart from factory employees, received
the training that AID envisioned in trades such as masonry.<BR>
<BR>
Heinz, meanwhile, is building a new clientele in a vast market.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The name recognition Heinz has right now in Russia is principally
a result of baby food,&quot; Falck says. &quot;The consumer could continue
to grow up with other products, ketchup and soups. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;What better way to engender awareness and trust than with baby food.&quot;

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Atlanta's On Fire<BR>
</B></FONT SIZE><BR>
<I>By Linda A. Dickerson</I><BR>
<HR><B>Atlanta is More Than the Town Hosting the 1996 <BR>
Summer Olympics; This Town is a Hotbed of <BR>
Entrepreneurial Activity and is Growing Younger Daily<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>Don't confuse metropolitan Atlanta with Pittsburgh. Atlanta leads the
nation for the last four years in job creation, immigration, housing starts
and building permits issued. It's a city where well-educated twenty or thirty-somethings
go to launch their successful careers. It's a city that exudes an energy
and vitality antithetical to its sleepy southern heritage.<BR>
<BR>
Growth exacted an exorbitant price, however. Atlanta boasts one of the country's
highest metropolitan crime rates, while Pittsburgh proudly proclaims the
nation's lowest crime rate. And despite a six-to-eight lane bypass around
the city's core, traffic regularly chokes Atlanta, whose suburban sprawl
is unmatched. As Atlanta's burgeoning boundaries continue to  test its city
limits, Pittsburgh's topography keeps it relatively constrained.<BR>
<BR>
High growth versus low growth. Young versus old. Unsafe versus safe.  Expansive
versus contained. The differences between Atlanta and Pittsburgh are significant.
Yet, the most striking dichotomy between the cities is less apparent and
difficult to quantify. <BR>
<BR>
<B>It is attitude.</B><BR>
<BR>
The granddaddy of all entre-preneurs, Ted Turner, who brought CNN to the
world, describes Atlanta as &quot;having one of the most can-do attitudes
on the planet.&quot; A past riddled with social anguish and destruction
instilled a resiliency within Atlantans that manifests itself today in this
hallmark can-do temperament. Sherman reduced the city to ashes but failed
to defeat Atlanta's indomitable spirit.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Atlanta thinks that it can conquer the world,&quot; says Keith Melton,
vice president of development at the Atlanta Economic Development Corp.
&quot;This is a very opportunistic environment. We're opportunistic about
building wealth here.&quot; <BR>
 <BR>
This &quot;opportunistic&quot; environment makes Atlanta the lightning rod
for international investment. In 1994, the Association of Foreign Real Estate
Investors dubbed Atlanta the most viable city for investment. Over 1,400
foreign businesses representing 35 nations operate in Georgia. Metro Atlanta
is home to most of these enterprises.  Thirty-two foreign banks have a presence
in Atlanta, fueling this burgeoning international economy. <BR>
 <BR>
Because the nation will rivet its attention on Atlanta during this month's
Olympics, the city will secure its long-term position as a major player
in the game of global economics. The Olympics is the ultimate affirmation
that the city has come of age, adding $5.1 billion dollars to the Atlanta
coffers, creating 80,000 new jobs and attracting 2 million visitors.<BR>
<BR>
Behind it all is Billy Payne, an attorney-turned-community leader who lit
the Olympic torch for Atlanta. Payne mortgaged his home to raise the seed
capital to pitch Atlanta as the best location for the 1996 Summer Olympics.
Epitomizing the city's can-do attitude, entrepreneurial types like Payne
 abound.<BR>
<BR>
In its October 1994 issue, Entrepreneur magazine ranked Atlanta as the best
U.S. city in which to own a business. Fortune magazine validated Entrepreneur's
assessment when in both 1994 and 1995 it included Atlanta among the world's
top 10 cities in which to do business.<BR>
<BR>
As a testament to these rankings, more than 700 of the combined service
and industrial Fortune 1,000 companies have operations in Atlanta.  Melton
says that Atlanta is a new player on the world business stage.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Growth<BR>
</B><BR>
The confluence of many contributing factors spurred Atlanta's unbridled
growth. Aside from its upbeat approaches to development, the linchpin of
its success is Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. Attracting Delta to Atlanta
was a capstone event that altered the city's destiny.<BR>
<BR>
Since its auspicious beginnings in 1842, Atlanta anchored its growth strategies
in transportation. From a city whose original raison d'&ecirc;tre was the
convergence of two railroads, the emphasis that present-day leaders place
on transportation is not surprising.<BR>
<BR>
Boasting the nation's largest international terminal, Hartsfield is also
one of the world's busiest airports. Roy B. Cooper, vice president of economic
development at the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, says &quot;the airport is
undoubtedly our number one economic asset.&quot; Cooper cites superb transportation
as one of the top four reasons a company would locate in Atlanta. A modest
cost of doing business, the region's friendliness and a high quality of
life are among the other factors he says motivated over 1,500 companies
to relocate or expand within Atlanta during the past decade. <BR>
Hartsfield consistently ranks as the nation's premier airport and is pivotal
to Atlanta's extraordinary growth. Interestingly, on most rankings, Pittsburgh
International Airport rates a close second. <BR>
<BR>
However, Hartsfield's world-class air cargo capacity distinguishes it from
Pittsburgh. Hartsfield currently ships the nation's sixth largest tonnage
of air cargo and has the nation's only U.S. Customs model inland port and
the newest all perishable cargo facility. By contrast, Pittsburgh's air
cargo capacity is limited at best and is clearly not cost competitive with
other sites.<BR>
<BR>
Its aspirations to become the nation's port of entry for air cargo, and
the convergence of three major interstate highways in downtown, make Atlanta
a distribution powerhouse.  But transportation alone didn't produce Atlanta's
remarkable growth. Sweat equity also helped.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Atlanta businesspeople still think that they're on a frontier - that
there are opportunities here,&quot; says Sam Williams of Central Atlanta
Progress. He's right. Atlanta is a panacea for young entrepreneurs with
fire in their bellies to build a business. The city is growing younger,
while Pittsburgh grows older.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have such a strong, growing economy. People with ideas can get
them going here,&quot; says the Atlanta Chamber's Cooper.  &quot;From the
Atlanta Chamber's perspective,&quot; he adds, &quot;we would very seldom
have Pittsburgh as a competitor.&quot; <BR>
 <BR>
Why? Lots of reasons, but the most accurate and succinct reason is Atlanta's
reputation. &quot;People - especially young people - have heard that they
can get ahead in Atlanta, so they come here,&quot; says Melton, the economist.<BR>
<BR>
The centerpiece of incubator facilities, Georgia Tech's Advanced Technology
Development Center, is one of many magnets enticing the world's best and
brightest to launch their new business enterprises in Atlanta.  At least
70 percent of the companies hatched in Georgia Tech's incubator survive
the five year mark, garnering national respect. Companies launched at the
technology development center reportedly generated      $24 million in tax
revenues last year.  <BR>
<BR>
<B>Continued Growth<BR>
</B><BR>
Williams, of the Central Atlanta Progress, says,  &quot;Atlantans believe
that tomorrow will be better than today.&quot;  And, based upon the city's
recent results, they're probably right.<BR>
CAP is a private association representing business and downtown organizations'
interests. It works to make Atlanta safe, to develop market-rate housing
downtown, to capitalize on the economic development opportunities that the
Olympics present and to increase the number of jobs downtown.<BR>
CAP brings local and state government officials together on issues shaping
downtown development, promoting the downtown core in an environment where
no natural boundaries contain suburban sprawl.  &quot;This sprawl thing
- we just open a new upscale community every week,&quot; explains Carolyn
Boyd Hatcher, president and CEO of the Georgia Conservatory.<BR>
<BR>
Where suburban expansion becomes suburban explosion, solidifying a strong
and vibrant downtown becomes critical. Central Atlanta Progress and its
spin-off, the Atlanta Downtown Partnership, emerged as the ultimate champion
of the downtown's interests.<BR>
<BR>
Describing her organization as a cheerleader for downtown, Atlanta Downtown
Partnership head Ronnie French sadly comments, &quot;Without us [CAP and
ADP], there'd be nobody here to say 'Locate your business downtown, and
here's why.' &quot; <BR>
 <BR>
Endemic to its culture, Atlanta's boosterism is a legacy from the city's
past. In her famed work, &quot;Gone With the Wind,&quot; Margaret Mitchell
asserts, &quot;The people who settled the town were a pushy people. Restless,
energetic people  came with enthusiasm.  They were proud of the place, proud
of th.   growth, proud of themselves for making it grow.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lauded years ago by the editor of City Builder as Atlanta Spirit, the city's
celebrated boosterism is its most salient quality. A prominent display at
the Atlanta History Center defines &quot;Atlanta Spirit&quot; as &quot;What
is good for business is good for Atlanta, and what is good for Atlanta is
good for all citizens.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Rated last year by Fortune as the seventh best place in the world to do
business, Atlanta beat the odds to hit the world's radar screen. From its
largely agrarian background, Atlanta emerged as an industrial and entrepreneurial
powerhouse. One hundred years ago, Georgia was the Cotton State, and Atlanta
was a railroad stop.  Period. Nothing else.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the world looks to Atlanta to set the pace.  How did the city metamorphose?
&quot;The confidence of Atlanta's leadership that it can do anything it
wants to&quot; is the key reason that the city sprinted onto the world business
scene according to Sam Williams.  At the Atlanta Chamber, Roy Cooper summarizes
the city's success similarly.  He says, &quot;Leadership is the key. A great
climate won't do any good if you don't have any leadership.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With the fierce determination that typifies Atlanta, Cooper adds, &quot;We
don't let the [corporate] leadership 'not do' something; we get them involved.&quot;
 Williams adds, &quot;You really can't be a CEO in Atlanta and not have
a high level of community service. It's demanded.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
From a region that spawned &quot;the real thing,&quot; disingenuous leadership
is not tolerated. Describing his hometown as having &quot;a sense of soul,&quot;
Williams also acknowledges the role that committed government leaders played
in shaping the city's stellar success. During the tempestuous '50s and '60s,
a progressive mayor, Ivan Allen  put Atlanta 20 years ahead of itself according
to Williams.<BR>
Cooper freely recounts stories of governors who regularly recruit overseas.
Regarding Atlanta's impressive track record in growing its economy, he comments,
&quot;Over a prolonged period of time, government has been pro-business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For Atlanta's sake, thank goodness that the state drives most of its economic
development activities. The stories of local government in Atlanta sound
curiously like stories from the 'Burgh. The city and the county are constantly
at odds. The mayor and his 18 member council don't generally agree. And
a City Charter Review Committee is recommending changes in an outmoded government
structure.  Doesn't this sound familiar?<BR>
<BR>
However, in Atlanta, the business community coalesced to work in concert
with state government. AEDC's Keith Melton characterizes the cooperation
between state government and business as &quot;superb.&quot; He asserts,
&quot;Government has incredible respect for the can-do attitude of private
business.&quot; With a governor who Melton refers to as &quot;the best governor
in the history of economic development,&quot; early reports of 100,000 new
jobs created in 1995 alone seem not only feasible, but expected.<BR>
<BR>
By Atlanta's standards, the Pittsburgh region's job growth goals are diminutive.<BR>
 <BR>
The Working Together Consortium, an offshoot of the Allegheny Conference
on Community Development, last year established a job creation goal of 100,000
new jobs in this region over the next six years.<BR>
<BR>
The difference between Atlanta's results and Pittsburgh's expectations is
attitude. Atlanta not only thinks it can - it knows it can.<BR>
<BR>
Locked out of her office, Ronnie French exemplified the Atlanta attitude.
Of course she could interview sans her office.  But she burst into a neighbor's
conference room, taking over with great finesse. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Part of our success is that we never give up,&quot; she says.<BR>

<B><FONT size =+1>Rival Banks Feel They Can Lure Away  Customers of the
<BR>
Former Integra Bank; National City With <BR>
About $50 Billion in Assets Says, Not So Fast </FONT> </B><I>By Bill Modoono</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>Surely, it must rank as some sort of Pittsburgh first.<BR>
<BR>
A heretofore fiercely local enterprise is being invaded by an outsider and
the least important aspect of the enterprise - the least important part,
by far - is that the invader is from Cleveland.<BR>
<BR>
Not to belittle the longstanding Rust Belt rivalry, but it really does not
matter that National City Bank - the bank that acquired Integra Bank for
$2.3 billion in stock and renamed it National City of Pennsylvania on June
1 - is headquartered in Cleveland. <BR>
<BR>
Of far greater consequence is how Pittsburgh's parochial banking industry
will react to this new player and how western Pennsylvania customers -both
corporate and individual - will take to the newcomer. <BR>
<BR>
It's not that Pittsburgh's banking community is unfamiliar with acquisitions.
PNC Bank and Mellon have been spreading themselves into other markets for
years now. Those acquisitions helped place both banks among the top 20 largest
banks in the country at the end of 1995. <BR>
<BR>
Integra's acquisition by National City moves it to No. 17, making it a more
formidable force to be reckoned with in the marketplace. That is it should
be, assuming the Pittsburgh marketplace is open to outsiders.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In this marketplace,&quot; says Sy Holzer, executive vice president
of PNC Bank, &quot;the clients, we believe, much prefer to deal with a Pittsburgh-based
company.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We think the Pittsburgh market is unique and being a Pittsburgh bank
is a large advantage.&quot;<BR>
Certainly, that has been the conventional wisdom. But if there is one thing
National City's acquisition of Integra should definitely do, it is to either
prove or explode this long-held myth. Is the fact that until now the bank
acquisition movement has avoided Pittsburgh proof of the city's resistance
to outsiders, or just another example of how western Pennsylvania is always
late - but never entirely left out - when it comes to national trends? After
all, it may have taken a decade or so, but even Howard Stern eventually
entered the Pittsburgh market.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is a continuing trend. Pittsburgh's just catching up with the
rest of the country,&quot; says Joseph Duwan, a banking analyst for Keefe,
Bruyette and Woods in New York. <BR>
<BR>
If that is so, the Integra takeover is proof that it has caught up in a
big way. National City, a $35 billion diversified financial services company
based in Cleveland, purchased Integra, a $14 billion bank holding company,
effective May 31. With assets of $50 billion, National City compares favorably
with its new rivals, PNC ($61 billion) and Mellon ($42 billion).<BR>
<BR>
The merger made big news in terms of employment as well. Takeovers of this
kind are designed to streamline productivity, eliminate duplication of effort
and, essentially, save money as well as make money.<BR>
<BR>
 That generally means layoffs - as was certainly the case here, an area
feeling the effects of corporate downsizing longer than most of the country.
 Initial reports had the merger eliminating 1,500 jobs in western Pennsylvania.
The negative news fallout - the only negatives that have surrounded this
deal - caused National City to scramble and revise that figure to 1,200.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;That's just a result of any consolidation,&quot; says Thomas Golonski,
the former president of Integra, now president of National City Bank of
Pennsylvania. &quot;As the bank grows, those numbers can change. I see positive
hope for employment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Certainly, most other signs are positive. The main idea behind the acquisition
was that Integra's strengths - retail banking and dealing with small business
customers - be maintained while its weaknesses are offset by National City.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Integra was good with companies that have sales up to $10 million,&quot;
David Daberko, chairman and chief executive of National City Corp., told
Dow Jones International News. &quot;They were very minor players beyond
that. It happens to be a business we're very good at in all of our other
markets.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Despite National City's desire not to appear an outsider, there is also
an interest in stressing the fact that the new entity will not just be Integra
with a new name. To that end a longstanding company policy - a $15 million
in-house  lending limit - has been lifted, according to Golonski. The new
 &quot;to start&quot; limit will be $25 million.<BR>
 <BR>
Golonski says that while Integra was five to six years away from achieving
goals such as being No. 1 or No. 2 in this market, joining National City
will shorten the time span. &quot;With National City, we'll provide first-class
competition for the upper-end market.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What I see happening is intensified competition in an already competitive
lending market,&quot; says Henry S. Pool, an attorney with Tucker Arensberg
of Pittsburgh who specializes in representing financial institutions. &quot;The
battle for the small to middle market customer - up to $100 million in sales
- will be strong, and PNC and National City will go head to head.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;Historically, Integra and Union National were not aggressive in that
area.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Expanding into western Penn-  sylvania is a move that is consistent with
what Golonski calls National City's &quot;concentric&quot; growth pattern.
Prior to the Pittsburgh move, National City had gone into central Ohio,
northern Kentucky and Indiana.<BR>
<BR>
In keeping with that strategy, Pool sees National City as using western
Pennsylvania as an entry into a richer market farther east. &quot;National
City will try to move east incrementally,&quot; Pool says. &quot;Western
Pennsylvania is a particularly difficult lending market right now. The businesses
that are headquartered here - small and middle market companies - are very
cautious about going into debt.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Both National City on the corporate level and Golonski, in a personal sense,
understand how acquisitions work, or should work. One of the first things
National City did was to put Pennsylvania in the new name, and stress that
major decisions in the marketplace will be made by local officials.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;National City is careful,&quot; says Duwan, the industry analyst.
&quot;They have a lot of experience with acquisitions. They've obviously
learned a lot over the years and have a strong history of completing larger
transactions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They're quite careful to focus on business generation on the business
side and at the same time achieve cost savings in the back shop. Most of
the savings they will achieve will be invisible from the customer standpoint.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Golonski contends that most customers - even in a relatively stable market
such as Pittsburgh - have grown used to bank mergers and acquisitions. A
former president of Seneca Bank, Golonski has worked for banks that have
been acquired three times in his 33-year career. He maintains that changing
times and the concept of local autonomy will negate any &quot;outsider&quot;
image. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think the reason the National City transition is as smooth as it
has been is that we didn't change any rules or any of the lending authorities,&quot;
he says.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I remember when Integra took over Seneca, there was concern from our
opponents that Integra was getting too big to still be a community bank.
We went through some soul-searching, we formed industry groups and kept
our affiliates autonomous in the communities.<BR>
&quot;Since this merger has been announced, we've been growing. Western
Pennsylvania has the highest percentage of loan growth of all National City's
affiliates.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
One area of unquestioned growth will come in marketing and advertising.
First, National City must educate its new customers with a large ad campaign.
And, while that's going on, its competitors realize this could be a good
time to remind customers that they've been here all along.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This is a very exciting time if you're a marketer,&quot; says Joseph
B. Smith, senior vice president of marketing for Dollar Bank. Dollar Bank,
the second-largest savings and loan in Pennsylvania with $2.4 billion in
assets, is looking to cut into Integra's old retail business. And while
Dollar Bank isn't billing itself as the third-largest &quot;Pittsburgh&quot;
bank quite yet, it  is stressing historical themes in its advertising.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We feel well positioned to compete,&quot; says Smith. &quot;There's
a lot of unrest in this market. And anytime there's unrest, it presents
a good opportunity.&quot; Smith says Dollar Bank's advertising will emphasize
its 1855 founding and reassert its claim as &quot;the oldest bank in Pittsburgh.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Smith also understands that while the public is aware of the move to bank
consolidations all across the country, there could be strength in familiarity.
That's why Dollar Bank plans to be more aggressive this summer in marketing
its checking product. &quot;We're in a unique position in Pittsburgh,&quot;
Smith says. &quot;We're not going to be acquired.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the main competition for National City will come from Mellon and PNC
Bank. Mellon declined to be interviewed for this story, citing the company's
policy of not commenting on its competitors or its own strategies.<BR>
<BR>
If PNC is worried, it is not showing it. &quot;Frankly, it doesn't change
anything for me personally,&quot; says Holzer. &quot;We're a bank that is
able to compete nationally with other out-of-town banks. We have the dominant
share of the market.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Holzer cites his company's status as the No. 1 underwriter of munici-  pal
bonds in Pennsylvania in 1995 - $660 million - as indicative of how size
and strength can produce local results.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We have the product capability and service to match the requirements
of any client.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;They will be a good competitor ... but their being in Pittsburgh 
doesn't change what we do here.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Even before the merger was complete, National City showed it was serious
about competing by luring former loan officers from both Mellon and PNC
to the new bank. <BR>
<BR>
Because National City poses more of a threat to Mellon and PNC for big customers,
its existence could bring about big deals in which two of the banks join
forces to the exclusion of the third. That, in turn, could lead to further
consolidation of banking interests in Pittsburgh. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The unanswered question is, 'Who is the next merger partner for National
City?' &quot; says Pool, who does not see the bank as an &quot;ultimate
survivor&quot; in the market.  &quot;By the year 2000 to 2005, there will
be 12 to 20 super regional banks and 5,000 to 8,000 community banks. There
will only be one or two Pittsburgh banks. Two banks will merge one more
time or they'll be bought.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But in the short term, everyone tends to agree with Duwan of Keefe, Bruyette
and Woods. <BR>
&quot;I expect change to be gradual,&quot;    he says. &quot;Pittsburgh
is quite a concentrated market to begin with. Its  top three banks have
the highest  percentage of the business of any major market.<BR>
<BR>
According to Duwan, in 1993, Mellon, PNC and Integra had 71 percent of the
lending business. Compar-atively, Philadelphia's top three banks had only
43 percent and St. Louis' only 39 percent. <BR>
Golonski says the new bank's immediate goals will be to use National City's
extensive corporate banking capacity and its cash management expertise to
grow the corporate side of the business, while maintaining Integra's market
share in retail.<BR>
<BR>
On the retail side, the biggest  question Golonski has is: &quot;How do
  you prevent disintermediation of the depositor?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
National City's answer is to provide securities underwriting and other investment
banking services not offered by Integra. National City also has what Golonski
says are &quot;better  technical-oriented capabilities.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But perhaps the most important thing that National City has is a sense of
reality. With National City, there's  a &quot;been there, done that&quot;
attitude that  is reassuring.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Being acquired is very traumatic,&quot; Daberko told American Banker,
&quot;and that carries over to customers because if employees are uncertain,
customers are going to be uncertain.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Golonski agrees totally. &quot;Acqui-sitions can be traumatic.&quot; But
he believes because the practices of National City are compatible with Integra,
this transition will be smooth.<BR>
<BR>
As for whether this can work in such a unique market, Golonski thinks he
understands that, too, as a result of his  personal history.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I think Pittsburgh is unique. I think Cleveland is unique. I think
Erie is unique. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The winners in the long run deal with that uniqueness.  Pittsburgh
is definitely unique. Time will tell.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
One thing is certain. The invader from Cleveland, as Pool says, &quot;spells
competition in an already tight marketplace.&quot;<BR>
<P><CENTER><B>Should Banks Be Selling Insurance? The Debate </B></CENTER>
<P>You already let them hold or invest your money. You turn to them when
you need to borrow money to pay for your home. Would you want banks to handle
your life insurance, too?<BR>
<BR>
Many of the banks are pushing for such privileges.<BR>
<BR>
And it may happen someday, although as this issue went to press, the outlook
for a bill to expand banks' powers to sell insurance and stocks was thrown
in doubt. In Washington, two senior Republicans joined Democrats and the
Clinton administration in opposing the major overhaul to current banking
regulations.<BR>
<BR>
The proposal, sponsored by House Banking Chairman Jim Leach - a Republican
from Iowa - was attacked as the committee opened what was expected to be
a lengthy and tense debate. <BR>
Leach's bill would repeal a key Depression-era law that separates banks
from Wall Street firms and insurance companies.<BR>
<BR>
A Republican opposing the measure, U.S. Rep. Doug Bereauter of Nebraska,
argues that the bill should be tied with other important banking issues,
such as Bereauter's bill to cut red tape for the banking industry as well
as a package to rescue the deposit insurance fund for the nation's troubled
savings and loans.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We cannot deal with these issues individually, in isolation,'' says
Bereauter, one of the committee's  ranking Republicans.<BR>
<BR>
The other Republican opposing Leach's proposed reform is U.S. Rep. Bill
McCollum of Florida. McCollum is instead pushing an amendment that would
permit banks and insurance companies to affiliate, despite state law to
the contrary.<BR>
<BR>
Leach, meanwhile, was pushing on without their support, calling his bill
&quot;the most significant financial services modernization approach of
the century.''<BR>
<BR>
The Leach bill has had a turbulent history. The full committee in May 1995
approved a bill to repeal key parts of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act so that
banks could underwrite and deal in securities through separate affiliates.<BR>
<BR>
In June 1995, the panel passed a Bereauter's bill to reduce many regulations
for banks, including controversial revisions to laws that provide consumers
with consistent information about interest rates on savings accounts. <BR>
<BR>
But neither bill made it to the House floor because of intense fighting
between the bank and insurance lobbyists, who don't want bankers for  competition.<BR>
<BR>
According to Leach, the bill currently under consideration is &quot;in philosophic
harmony'' with the two measures approved by the committee last year, although
with major revisions to the insurance language.<BR>
<BR>
The Clinton administration sent a letter to Leach opposing the bill in its
current form, saying it would create &quot;needless regulatory burdens,''
hinder innovation and draw capital out of banks.

Honor Local Environmental Achievements<BR>
 </FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size =+1>Third Annual Three Rivers Environmental Awards Program
<BR>
Recognizes 29 Individuals and Organizations <BR>
Dedicated to Enhancing Western Pennsylvania's Environment</FONT> </B></CENTER>
<P><HR>The landscape of Western Pennsylvania was not always as clear and
clean as it is today. Before Pittsburgh's environmental renaissance, thick
black soot lined the streets and clouded the skies. However, thanks to the
efforts of many who started the environmental movement here, Western Pennsylvania
has become a cleaner, safer, and healthier place to live and work. <BR>
<BR>
These efforts were led by well-known local figures such as Richard King
Mellon, Mayor David L. Lawrence, and Henry J. Heinz. But a number of lesser-known
Pittsburghers played an equally important role in cleaning up the city and
surrounding areas - work that has led to substantial advancements in air
and water quality, as well as land conservation. <BR>
<BR>
Today, our friends, neighbors, and colleagues  are also playing an important
role in enhancing and     protecting our region's environment. Through their
 efforts in recycling, conservation, environmental management, and technology
development, today's  environmental stewards are helping to make Western
Pennsylvania one of America's most successful  environmental comeback stories.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Three Rivers Environmental Awards</B><BR>
<BR>
As a means of honoring the local individuals and     organizations who have
demonstrated their commitment to enhancing our region's environment, the
Pennsylvania Environmental Council and Duquesne Light Company established
the Three Rivers Environmental Awards    program in 1993. Recipients of
the Three Rivers Environmental Award have demonstrated a commitment to environmental
excellence, leadership, and accomplishment.<BR>
<BR>
The 1996 Three Rivers Environmental Awards Dinner was held on Tuesday, May
28, at the Pittsburgh Hilton and Towers. More than 600 business, civic,
and environmental leaders gathered to honor  29 award finalists, as they
competed  for top honors in 10 categories. These   29 finalists were chosen
from more than 100 nominations received. <BR>
<BR>
Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge was also on hand to deliver     the keynote
address at this year's awards dinner.<BR>
<BR>
The Three Rivers Environmental Awards are co-sponsored by the Pennsylvania
Environmental Council and Duquesne Light Company. Chairpersons for the event
were Joanne Denworth,   president of the Pennsylvania Environmental Council,
and Wes von Schack, chairman and chief executive   officer of Duquesne Light.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our goal in creating this program was to make   others aware of some
of Western Pennsylvania's most successful environmental efforts,&quot; said
Denworth. &quot;We hope to encourage others to emulate the achievements
of the finalists and winners - and improve the    quality of life in Western
Pennsylvania.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Those honored in the 1996 Three Rivers Environ-mental Awards are individuals
and organizations who have joined in accepting responsibility for the environment
- and their local communities,&quot; said Duquesne Light's von Schack. &quot;We
believe this commitment to environmental responsibility and stewardship
is very important, and we are proud to help recognize the accomplishments
of all our finalists.&quot;<BR>
In addition to the multimedia presentation honoring each finalist, the event
featured a video called There Once Was a Time, hosted by veteran CBS News
 correspondent Charles Osgood and produced     especially for the Three
Rivers Environmental Awards. The video chronicles the history of the regional
environmental movement throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, and complimentary
copies will be distributed to secondary schools throughout Western Pennsylvania.<BR>
<BR>
The 1996 Three Rivers Environmental   Awards program was open to individuals
<BR>
and organizations throughout Western Pennsylvania. Applications were evaluated
by an independent panel of judges based  on environmental need, environmental
impact, and evidence of impact, as well as planning and innovation.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to receiving an award, each winner was given a check for $1,000,
to  be donated to the local nonprofit environmental organization of his
or her choice.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Green Harvest Program,<BR>
Greater Pittsburgh<BR>
Community Food Bank</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank's &quot;Green Harvest Program&quot;
provides a renewable source of fresh, organically grown produce for low-income
families in Western Pennsylvania, making it one of the most novel food bank
programs in the United States. Using crops from its 20-acre Longview Food
Bank Farm in McKeesport, the Green Harvest Program distributed more than
32,000 pounds of fresh vegetables to the hungry in 1995 alone - nearly half
of it harvested by community volunteers. Equally important are the environmental
education activities which take place at Longview Farm and several community
gardens supported by the Food Bank. Together, these programs have quickly
become an important source of fresh food for those in need, as well as a
dynamic environmental classroom.<BR>

<BR>
For a quarter of a century, the Loyalhanna Watershed Association, based
in Ligonier, has brought together a wide range of volunteers to protect
and enhance the natural beauty of eastern Westmoreland County and western
Somerset County. Farmers, teachers, businesspeople, and legislators work
together to promote conservation, recycling, and environmental enhancement
- through hands-on efforts, as well as community education. Initiatives
include the beautification of the Route 30 corridor, the development of
a 37-mile bike trail in the Laurel Highlands, efforts to reduce acid mine
drainage in Loyalhanna Creek, and a recycling program which has diverted
more than a million pounds of materials from landfills. In addition, day

<BLOCKQUOTE>Winner:	Erie City Water Authority</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
Presque Isle Bay is significantly cleaner than it has been in many years,
thanks to the environmental stewardship initiatives of the Erie City Water
Authority. In response to growing public concerns about water quality in
the Bay, the Erie City Water Authority last year     elected to voluntarily
cut its wastewater emissions from 1.3 million gallons per day to zero! The
Authority moved quickly to install the necessary equipment at its two water
treatment facilities and, within months, had completely eliminated its permitted
wastewater discharges. As a result of this action, tons of suspended solids
- including aluminum, iron, and manganese - are no longer released into
the Bay. This effort has been cited as an excellent example of a municipality
going beyond federal standards to protect an important environmental asset.<BR>

Downtown Pittsburgh businesses are confirming that clean streets and sidewalks
can be good for business, thanks to the efforts of the Pittsburgh Downtown
Partnership's &quot;Pittsburgh's Picking Up!&quot; program. Since 1994,
the Partnership has been educating property owners and tenants about their
responsibilities to keep streets and sidewalks clean, as well as to enforce
city ordinances. Many property owners were concerned about the effect of
sidewalk trash on their businesses, so Partnership sidewalk cleaning crews
have literally been walking the streets picking up litter, adding new trash
containers, and helping to enhance the quality of life Downtown. Thanks
to the efforts of the &quot;Pittsburgh's Picking Up!&quot; campaign, more
than 600 pounds of trash and litter are removed from Downtown sidewalks
each week!<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Winner:	Recmix of PA, Inc.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
In stainless steel manufacturing, it is important to recover and      recycle
as much stainless material as possible from the residual slag. However,
conventional stainless steel slag recycling processes are inefficient, leaving
large quantities of useful stainless steel mixed with refuse material which
is discarded in slag piles. Fortunately, Recmix of PA has solved this problem
- with a highly efficient recycling  process that recovers far more stainless
steel than other methods. This process uses no chemicals, and yields a marketable
byproduct that has proven to be an effective alternative to lime as a buffer
in surface mine reclamation, and is also effective in reducing acid mine
drainage. To date, about one million tons of stainless steel have been removed
from Western Pennsylvania slag piles using this process.<BR>

<BR>
Each year, the steel industry uses millions of gallons of hydro-       chloric
acid solution as a cleaning agent during processing. In the past, this hazardous
waste was treated and then disposed of in landfills or deep wells - at great
cost to both the steel producer and the environment. In response, Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel Corporation, in partnership with the American Iron Oxide Company (AMROX),
constructed an on-site facility to separate pure hydrochloric acid for 
    re-use as a steel cleaning solvent. A byproduct of this innovative 
 process is high-quality iron oxide, used to manufacture washing machines,
televisions, and other consumer products. The AMROX facility safely regenerates
more than 21 million gallons of acid     solution each year - the equivalent
of nearly 200 million pounds of hazardous material that would otherwise
go into lready crowded landfills or wells.<BR>

Acid mine drainage is a widespread environmental concern   throughout Western
Pennsylvania, but Wexford-based Techniflo Systems has commercialized new
technology to help address the problem. Based on technical research conducted
by the US Bureau of Mines, Techniflo products achieve more effective and
reliable large-scale treatment of acidic water than conventional systems
- at a fraction of the cost. In addition, this system produces less solid
waste than competing products. Through this technology, Techniflo has enabled
coal companies to afford the water treatment operations they need to comply
with environmental standards and reduce the amount of disposable solid waste
material produced - a major step forward in the battle to clean up mine-contaminated
waterways across the United States.<BR>

Pittsburgh Voyager provides local students in grades five through     12
with hands-on lessons in the ecology of Pittsburgh's three rivers. The centerpiece
of this program is the Voyager - an 80-foot, 70-ton retired Navy boat that
has become a floating laboratory for young environmental scientists. The
Pittsburgh Voyager staff provides    training for teachers at participating
schools, as well as classroom tools such as wet chemistry kits and river
charts. Students receive classroom lessons in water quality, aquatic life,
nautical science,   and related topics - then they embark on a one-day river
cruise       to apply what they've learned. In addition to biology and other
life sciences, student voyagers learn valuable lessons in environmental
stewardship - and see firsthand how pollution can affect humans, as well
as river plants and animals. <BR>

The Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics at Carnegie Mellon University
is the only graduate architectural program of its kind in the US. The Department
of Architecture founded the program in 1981 to address environmental problems
associated with modern building construction - such as excessive energy
consumption - and to offer solutions aimed at sustainable development, design,
and construction. At the Center, faculty and graduate students work together
to overcome such challenges as poor air quality, inefficient use of energy,
and high operating costs. A key initiative is the &quot;Intelligent Workplace,&quot;
a 7000-square-foot facility under construction on the roof of an existing
campus building. This innovative facility will allow for real-world environmental
teaching and research - and encourage future architects to use environmentally
responsible practices in their own work.<BR>

For years, the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania has  conducted educational
programs for local elementary schools at Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve.
With environmental education now mandated by the Commonwealth, demand for
these programs is growing - while budgets for field trips are shrinking.
In response, the Audubon Society has developed a continuing education curriculum
that prepares elementary school teachers to conduct environmental lessons
at their own schools - teaching students about the natural environment of
their playgrounds. At participating schools, Audubon Society professionals
conduct Schoolground Teacher Workshops that introduce teachers, parents,
and administrators to natural resources, as well as instructional resources
that can help students learn about their environment. To date, nearly 350
teachers have participated in             30 workshops - and thousands of
students Ehave benefitted from this innovative program.<BR>

<B><FONT size =+1>Hiring a New Employee is a Costly Investment; Can You
Tell in Advance Whether an Employee Will Steal or Act Violently in the Workplace?
Some Employers are Subjecting Prospects to a Battery of Tests</FONT></B><BR>
<I>By Cynthia Bent</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>I thought he was the best thing since sliced bread,&quot; says Marty
Marra of a candidate who once applied to him for a managerial position.
Just as a formality, Marra gave the man a psychological profiling test his
company, Amarraca supermarket, administers to all managerial applicants.
But the test's results said the man was &quot;posturing,&quot; psycho-speak
for someone who tries to pretend he's something he's not.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;So I called one of his previous employers I happened to know, and
this guy told me, 'Marty, stay away from him. He's the biggest BS'er I've
ever met.' I said, 'Holy cow, these tests really work.' &quot;<BR>
Or do they?<BR>
<BR>
Stephen Whitlock, a young Briton, was well along in an interviewing process
with a small documentary production company until he was asked to go through
testing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I don't know about Americans, but the British are simply not used
to pouring their hearts out to people they don't know. I found the whole
process excruciating,&quot; he says. He found the psychologist to be &quot;completely
without a personality,&quot; the tests to be invasive and irrelevant, and
as a result, he clammed up. His testers told his employer that Whitlock
was arrogant and a cold fish.<BR>
&quot;They asked me if I would enjoy a vacation in Las Vegas,&quot; he says
scornfully. &quot;It was daft. I thought, the owner should have just taken
me out for a chat, I'd have been perfectly happy to talk to him.&quot; Because
of the bad taste in his mouth, Whitlock refused the company's subsequent
job offer.<BR>
To test, or not to test is a sticky question for many employers. Most people
have no idea what psychological testing is all about as it relates to employment.
And the myriad of testing options can be confusing. But with a little self-examination,
employers can easily decide what type of program to use or whether to test
at all.<BR>
<BR>
Good hiring practices, as any manager knows, can be critical because of
the heavy training investments in the new hire. An obvious clue to whether
employers can benefit from testing is whether or not they are satisfied
with their current hiring formula. Employers suffering from rapid turnover,
theft, excessive training costs, tension or inadequacies in large portions
of the work force may want to investigate testing. Otherwise, it may be
best not to upset a successful formula.<BR>
Psychological testing for the workplace can take many forms. Prospective
and current employees can be skill-tested for everything from math and verbal
skills to sales knowledge or customer service aptitude. &quot;Integrity
tests&quot; screen employees for traits such as honesty and likelihood to
abuse substances, even predict violent behavior. Other psychological profiles
attempt to measure applicants' job-related personality traits such as self-reliance
or organizational skills, or to try to determine an individual's fit with
the company offering the job.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There are costs associated with psychological testing, including the
employer's time and the costs of the test itself. But tests which measure
some personality traits, like conscientiousness and extroversion, do have
validity, and these traits tend to correlate with job performance,&quot;
says Dr. Susan Straus, a psychologist with the Graduate School of Industrial
Administration at Carnegie Mellon.<BR>
<BR>
Garry Hughes of PCI, a division of Performance Management Resources, Inc.,
says all businesses can benefit from using an industrial psychologist.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For small businesses, hiring is a critical issue because each new
person is a significant addition to the firm, and a good personal fit is
essential. And big companies just don't have the time to evaluate the way
I can,&quot; Hughes says.<BR>
<BR>
The first step in the process is to nail down exactly what the position
in question entails. Beyond the specific skills needed - math ability for
a cashier, typing or computer knowledge for a data entry clerk - industrial
psychologists help a client decide what skills are necessary.<BR>
<BR>
Does this position demand creativity? A great problem solver who thinks
systematically might not fit in. Is the office structured around teams working
for collective goals, or are employees asked to be self-motivated and independent?
Different types of organizational skills, ability to work in groups, or
with or without supervision will then be critical. A good testing company
will be able to tell employers what traits they haven't considered.<BR>
<BR>
Testing levels range from simple pencil and paper tests for entry-level
retail or clerical positions to hours of paper testing and interviews with
psychologists. Costs can range from $7 for a self-scoring test to $1,500
for intensive profiling of upper-level hires.<BR>
<BR>
Paper and pencil tests are used to scale applicants in a number of areas
by establishing a pattern of responses to simulations or statements. One
question will not &quot;knock someone out.&quot; Scales are drawn based
on the responses of productive employees to the same questions. All also
use a combination of evaluators, not just one test, for each trait or characteristic
they're testing.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;These are well-established tests in the personality area, used nationally,
hundreds of thousands of times,&quot; says Hughes. &quot;Our database has
about 30,000 to 40,000 cases so we can be pretty sure. It's not a guess,
not a gut feeling.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Much entry-level testing stops with pencil and paper tests. For more advanced
positions or for an especially thorough process, the personal interview
allows for more flexible questions. The interviewer might ask the candidate
to describe their favorite previous work experience, or even to solve a
problem with a team of other interviewees. They might describe certain characteristics
of the position - this job pays on commission rather than steadily - and
ask the applicant's preferences in this area.<BR>
<BR>
Industrial psychologists say the benefit of their interviews is the experienced
hand they lend to the process. They emphasize that each psychologist has
professional training in just this field, and does hundreds of interviews
per year, while the average personnel manager may do 10.<BR>
In the end the psychologist will go over the battery of results and explain
what they mean for the client. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;I usually try to give my clients an idea of the consequences associated
with their decision,&quot; says Hughes. For example, &quot;If they go with
person A, they're going to get someone who's ready to do a good job right
now, but they may not have any potential for developing five years from
now into more. Person B [is inexperienced and might need more] developmental
time, but they've got a great deal of potential.&quot; Giving clients more
information on which to base decisions, rather than picking or eliminating
candidates, is the name of the game.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Measuring Integrity<BR>
Can a test tell if you're honest?</B><BR>
<BR>
Integrity testing, despite changes in methods and design, is still surrounded
by controversy. <BR>
In general, research done for this article found that the only parties who
recommend integrity testing were those who sold the tests; others warned
about invalidity and legal problems.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;From a practical standpoint, these tests produce many false hits,
predicting too many people would not meet standards, and people are screened
out for the wrong reasons,&quot; says Bill Jackson, vice president of selection
and assessment services at Development Dimensions International, a human
relations firm based in Bridgeville.<BR>
<BR>
Other prickly issues include possible legal problems. Integrity tests are
currently restricted or banned in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and challenges
rise in other states, including Pennsylvania.<BR>
Jack Jones, vice president of research and service with McGraw Hill London
House, which publishes integrity tests along with other screening instruments,
says many misunderstandings fuel the controversy. He says many industries
suffer heavily from theft and other losses because of employee behavior
like drug abuse, aggression (especially towards customers) or time theft.
He points to a supermarket industry survey conducted by London House, which
found that an average 150-store company may lose $1.6 million per year to
employee theft.<BR>
<BR>
What integrity instruments predict, he says, is a whole potpourri of counterproductive
behavior, not just attitudes towards theft. Integrity tests measure the
responses of individuals to attitudinal studies - about stress response,
how to deal with others who steal on the job, etc., and then create scales
based on which of those actually steal or use drugs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But in a literal sense you're not measuring but predicting based on
social conformity,&quot; points out Jackson. &quot;So if you are less uniform
than most people, you're not going to look good. Some of the neatest, most
productive employees are screened out.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Jackson, Hughes and others think the estimate that 30 percent of the population
steal (given by Jones and other integrity testers) is way too high. Their
estimate is around 2 to 3 percent. They also point out that &quot;theft&quot;
could refer to taking a pencil home and &quot;time theft&quot; could mean
lurking around the water cooler for five minutes longer than the model office
worker. If your company is losing money to theft, they say, it's a management
problem.<BR>
<BR>
Jones' response is that if you're talking about a hamburger and coke, well,
those add up into thousands of dollars over a year, billions for the industry.
Independent research on the issue found that losses to all businesses due
to &quot;theft,&quot; which could be defined as anything from pens or long
coffee-breaks to embezzlement, run anywhere from $5 billion to $40 billion
per year.<BR>
<BR>
The claim that testing can predict and therefore prevent workplace violence
is also disputed. Jones says research shows well-designed testing can predict
whether a candidate is disposed toward disruption, based on whether that
person handles stress well, is likely to use drugs, or so on. Hughes says
the only reliable predictor of future behavior is past behavior, and that
if he had a method that reliably predicted violent behavior, he'd be rich
beyond his wildest dreams.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Violence is hard to predict because there aren't enough occurrences
to measure factors accurately,&quot; adds CMU's Straus.<BR>
<BR>
The whole controversy is further fueled by a 1990 General Accounting Office
report concluding, in a nutshell, that &quot;research on integrity tests
has not yet produced data that supports or dismisses the assertion that
these tests can predict dishonest behavior.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
That report sparked the American Psychological Association to do its own
study, which concluded that there is a demonstrated business need for the
tests, and that they have demonstrated predictive value. Other independent
studies have shown that integrity tests can have reliability and validity.<BR>
The APA also noted no test is perfect, and that such tests should only be
used as a supplement to other sources of information such as reference checks
and interviews. Jones, Jackson and Hughes also firmly recommended use of
more than just one test for any selection purposes. 
<H3><CENTER>To Test or Not?</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Employers considering psychological testing services should consider the
following: 
<UL>
  <LI>Tightly define the position before you look for a testing service,
including a description of duties and qualities your company wants in that
employee. 
  <LI>Define your goals for the testing service - such as saving time, preventing
theft, finding employees who make a better fit with your business. Look
for a tester who gives you extra information, not one who makes the decision
for you. 
  <LI>Look for credentialed operations, affiliated with the APA. Look at
the stability of the company, and ask for references from other businesses
who use their services. Make sure the tests they recommend can be shown
to have no impact on protected minority groups and have documented effectiveness.
  <LI>Always use all available information, and evaluate candidates on your
own. Avoid using the service as your only evaluator. Keep in mind the reactions
of some people to taking such tests, especially people from other cultures.
If a test result is surprising, back it up with reference checks or other
validation. 
  <LI>Take the tests yourself, so you know what you're asking of your candidates.
Do you think this test is something you would resent taking? 
  <LI>Use the tests not only to make selections, but as an aid for the employee's
advancement, training in weak areas and utilizing strong points. 
  <LI>Evaluate the effectiveness of the testing program regularly - are
the new hires more productive? Has the testing service met the goals you've
set out to accomplish? 
</UL>
<BR>
One guide to setting up selection services is Jones' book, &quot;Personnel
Testing, A Manager's Guide.&quot; Jones outlines several specific steps
in choosing a service, including worksheets. Good testing services will
sit down with you and go over these steps themselves, ensuring you know
what you're looking for. <BR>

<I>By Cynthia Bent</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>The task before Kevin McClatchy last summer was crystal clear: Come
up with $90 million dollars ... within two weeks. If he failed, he'd have
to take his dream of owning a Major League Baseball franchise and head back
to California empty handed.<BR>
<BR>
Today, McClatchy's hands are full, juggling management of the Pirates and
a schedule loaded with public appearances in his role as the managing partner
of the Pirates ownership group he assembled for the purchase.<BR>
<BR>
For the most part, McClatchy's quest to buy the Pirates gained steam in
that two-week period shortly after Major League Baseball rejected the bid
of cable magnate John Rigas, the original frontrunner to purchase the team.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was in California waiting to hear what the Rigas situation was,&quot;
McClatchy recalls. &quot;We were never told we were the group. I think initially
there were four or five groups. The idea was that we would come in and have
a two-week window to raise a huge amount of equity.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And once two weeks were up, the next player would step to the plate. But
McClatchy never gave anyone else a chance in the batter's box. He methodically
worked the deal for six months, finally scoring big this past spring when
the city, the team's former owners and Major League Baseball all signed
off on his bid to purchase the team.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the end, we were able to raise, in a short amount of time, a substantial
amount of capital. We also brought in some good local partners, such as
Chip Ganassi and Tony O'Reilly, which I think helped us in the mayor's eyes,&quot;
McClatchy says today.<BR>
<BR>
The Pirates purchase leads the lineup of Best Deals of 1995 that are being
honored by Executive Report and Price Waterhouse as part of an annual program
recognizing deals that have a positive impact on western Pennsylvania. The
program also recognizes the dealmakers behind the deals.<BR>
<BR>
The Pirates deal wins this year under the category Best Quality of Life,
joining that category's previous winners including Carnegie Science Center
and the Pittsburgh Zoo. For the judges (see sidebar list) and outsiders,
McClatchy's purchase was a no-brainer since the presence of the Pirates
in Pittsburgh serves as a source of entertainment, tourism dollars, job
creation and regional promotion. <BR>
 <BR>
&quot;It's a deal that's good for baseball and the city of Pittsburgh,&quot;
Mayor Tom Murphy says of the McClatchy group's purchase. &quot;We kept our
team, and we did it in a way that makes sense.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Adds Gov. Tom Ridge: &quot;Pittsburgh is a national landmark for our national
pastime, and the Pirates could play baseball nowhere else - just as the
Golden Gate Bridge could span no other waters, and the Empire State Building
could rise from no other city.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
It was June 1995 when electronics giant Sony joined Corning Inc. and Asahi
Glass America Inc. in a partnership to operate a television glass manufacturing
plant on the site of Sony's Pittsburgh Manufacturing Center in Mount Pleasant,
Westmoreland County. <BR>
<BR>
Today, the venture is known as the American Video Glass Co. and is being
honored for Best Regional Impact, joining previous winners Pittsburgh International
Airport, Union Switch &amp; Signal and the Pittsburgh Supplier Training
Center.<BR>
<BR>
The American Video Glass facility will employ about 500 people after production
begins at the plant next year. Representatives of the three companies broke
ground last fall after overcoming one key obstacle: the Clean Air Act and
its requirement that Penn-   sylvania manufacturers purchase emission credits.<BR>
<BR>
Sony spent about a year researching the availability of emission credits
before spending millions to actually secure the credits. Some credits were
purchased at a bankruptcy auction.<BR>
<BR>
Sony Electronic's Pittsburgh Manufacturing Center currently produces rear
projection televisions and is the company's world headquarters for the design
and engineering of that product. The facility, which opened in 1991, also
produces seven-inch cathode ray tubes for use in the rear projection sets
and has begun manufacturing aperture grilles used in Trinitron direct view
televisions. That plant employs approximately 700 people, across the street
from where the glass facility is being constructed. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sony, Corning and Asahi have growing operations in Pennsylvania, and
American Video will be a valuable asset to the three companies and the state,&quot;
says Donald Dicken, president of American Video.<BR>
<BR>
After a decade of planning, fund-raising, design and construction, the Historical
Society of Western Pennsylvania opened its new home, the Senator John Heinz
Pittsburgh Regional History Center, in late April.<BR>
<BR>
The 160,000-square-foot history center on Smallman Street in the Strip District
occupies the seven-story former Chautauqua Lake Ice Company warehouse and
two smaller attached buildings. <BR>
&quot;It's a great privilege to spend a decade of one's life building a
facility which represents so many positive things to a city and a region,&quot;
says John Herbst, executive director. &quot;We have had quite a team to
pull this off.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
A team indeed, as virtually every corporation in the region anteed up funding
for the history center. David McCullough, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author/historian,
served as honorary chairman of the capital campaign, which has raised over
$30 million of the center's $36 million projected cost. Mellon Bank Chairman
Frank Cahouet headed the capital campaign.<BR>
<BR>
The history center comprises a first floor Great Hall, 50,000 square feet
of gallery space, library and archives, children's Discovery Place, museum
shop, cafe and the historical society offices. The permanent exhibit, &quot;Points
in Time: Building a Life in Western Pennsylvania, 1750-Today,&quot; occupies
the second floor.<BR>
 <BR>
Previous winners for Best Community Impact include St. Francis Health System,
the United Way of Allegheny County and the Blue Cross Caring Program.<BR>
<BR>
The actual papers were signed thousands of miles away, but the effect was
felt in a West Mifflin plant. Zurich-based ABB Asea Brown Boveri, a world
leader in electrical engineering, merged its railway activities with those
of transportation systems giant Daimler-Benz AG.<BR>
<BR>
The result is ADtranz, with North American headquarters in Pittsburgh and
continued operation of a West Mifflin plant that at presstime employed about
1,000. The facility formerly operated under the name AEG Transpor-tation
Systems Inc., which was part of Daimler-Benz prior to the merger.<BR>
Previous winners for Best Merger/ Joint Venture include Federated Depart-ment
Stores, Mellon Bank and Michael Baker Corp. <BR>
<BR>
ADtranz executives say their merger creates the world's most complete provider
of railway systems, with a portfolio including electric and diesel locomotives,
high-speed trains, inter-city and regional trains, trams and underground
trains, people-movers, signal and traffic control systems and infrastructure
installations, as well as servicing and maintenance.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;With our product range, capabilities and the strong backup of the
parent companies, ADtranz is a strong and powerful railway supplier able
to meet all requirements of our global customer base,&quot; says Kaare Vagner,
president and chief executive of ADtranz.<BR>
<BR>
Just before presstime, Singapore awarded ADtranz a $202.1 million contract
to build Singapore's first light-rail commuter line, opening the door to
a possible $850 million in further business. The light rail cars will be
built at the West Mifflin facility.<BR>
<BR>
It probably didn't look like much of a &quot;gift&quot; at first, but the
Urban Redevelopment Authority, the Pittsburgh Economic and Industrial Development
Corp. and a company named GalvTech were able to look beyond the surface.
And inside the former Hays Ammunition plant, all three groups found opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
The plant was idled in 1970 and was the subject of little activity until
1993, when the U.S. Army donated the facility on Mifflin Road in Pittsburgh
to the URA. The URA moved quickly, selling it to the Economic and Industrial
Development Corp., which is renovating the facility and will lease it to
GalvTech, this year's winner for Most Innovative. Previous winners include
Taylor Development Group, the former Joseph Horne Co. and Duquesne Light
Co.<BR>
<BR>
GalvTech is a manufacturer of hot dip galvanized steel for the construction,
appliance, heating ventilation and air conditioning, and service center
industries. After about a $37 million investment in renovations, equipment
and infrastructure improvements, GalvTech eventually will employ about 80
people at the site.<BR>
<BR>
GalvTech's sister company is MetalTech, which renovated an abandoned mill
in 1984 at a site adjacent to the Pittsburgh Technology Center. It now employs
about 90 people there. Another sister company is NexTech, located in Turtle
Creek, which employs about 60.<BR>
<BR>
Some call it Silicon Alley, the section of Oakland near Carnegie Mellon
University that has become a hotbed of technology-based companies. It's
here that you find four companies the Best Deals judges feel are primed
for growth:  GALT Technologies, Internet Securities, the EnviroLink Network
and OnTV. Previous winners in the  Best Prospects for Growth category include
FORE Systems, Medrad and Respironics.<BR>
<BR>
 GALT is best known for NETworth, its popular Internet site that provides
investors with current mutual fund information, including prospectuses and
performance figures. A weekly investors' market outlook and an interactive
question-and-answer forum with industry professionals are also available,
and NETworth gives registered users the ability to track their investments
through a personalized on-line portfolio manager. <BR>
<BR>
 GALT's story is interesting in that it already has been acquired by California-based
Intuit, perhaps best known as the developer of Quicken and TurboTax software.
 GALT's NETworth will enhance Intuit's Quicken Financial Network, an Internet-based
financial services forum. Intuit plans to increase GALT's operations in
Pittsburgh.<BR>
<BR>
OnTV is a Pittsburgh-based company that produces sites for the World Wide
Web and provides Web presence to clients. What makes OnTV different is that
it is the world's first digital broadcaster of the World Wide Web.<BR>
<BR>
OnTV also is involved in custom software development aimed at making the
Internet more user-friendly. It developed MetroMap, which displays the location
of any street address, or the relative positions of up to three locations
in the Pittsburgh area. Other software, Webfetcher, allows users to download
web information on a schedule they choose. <BR>
<BR>
The future includes a strategic alliance with Transphone, a unique Internet
appliance that allows one-button access to the World Wide Web. The transphone
looks like a normal lap-top computer, but also includes an integrated telephone,
answering machine, fax, speaker phone and color monitor. OnTV will market
the devices in the U.S. and build and distribute servers used to support
the system.<BR>
<BR>
Internet Securities is an on-line information service that provides financial,
political and economic information on emerging markets. Through agreements
with a wide range of local and international sources - including newspapers,
news bureaus, government agencies, stock exchanges and analysts - Internet
Securities  provides comprehensive, up-to-date information on markets including
Poland, Russia, the Ukraine, the Czech republics, Hungary, the Baltic states
and China.<BR>
<BR>
The EnviroLink Network differs from the other three Silicon Alley winners
in that EnviroLink is a nonprofit organization. It provides 3.4 million
users worldwide rapid access to environmental information, experts, activists,
educators and environmentally conscious businesses. It also provides nonprofit
environmental organizations with on-line presence and Web development.<BR>
<BR>
The EnviroLink Network is probably the most powerful, useful and easy-to-navigate
source of environmental information. Anyone with a modest computer setup
can find any kind of environmental information with a few keystrokes or
clicks of a mouse.<BR>
<BR>
One is built, the other is well on its way.<BR>
<BR>
The judges selected the headquarters projects of Roadway Package System
and FORE Systems as winners for Best Real Estate Development. RPS and FORE
join previous winners Southpointe, Edgewood Towne Centre and Keystone Commons.<BR>
<BR>
Both facilities demonstrate each company's long-term commitment to the region.<BR>
The RPS headquarters facility, which opened last September, sits high atop
a hill on a 115-acre site in the Parkway West corridor. The 350,000- square-foot
facility includes three atriums, a 125-seat auditorium, a 300-seat cafeteria,
media studio, conference center and physical fitness center.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We feel,&quot; says RPS President Ivan T. Hofmann, &quot;that the
close proximity of our headquarters to the airport and the exceptional labor
pool available in this area have played and will continue to play a pivotal
role in our growth and profitability. RPS is committed to remaining in the
Pittsburgh area.&quot;<BR>
FORE broke ground last Halloween in Marshall Township for its three-building
headquarters, slated for initial occupancy this December.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The buildings will be like none that exist in the area,&quot; says
William Bates, director of facilities for FORE. &quot;We believe the unique
new headquarters will contribute to the growing visibility of FORE, while
improving recruitment and creating a sense of identity for employees.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
FORE is a repeat winner in Best Deals, having won last year for Fastest
Growing Company. <BR>
Price Waterhouse and Executive Report added a new category to Best Deals
this year: the Spirit of Pittsburgh Award. The category will honor groups
or individuals who have gone the extra mile for the economic good of the
region.<BR>
<BR>
The inaugural winner, the Working Together Consortium, is a broad-based
volunteer collaboration of civic leaders who have agreed to monitor and
review the implementation of the action recommendations in the 1994 report
entitled The Greater Pittsburgh Region: Working Together to Compete Globally.<BR>
<BR>
The consortium's genesis dates back to 1993, when the Allegheny Conference
on Community Develop-ment commissioned an analysis of the region's competitiveness
by a committee headed by Carnegie Mellon University President Robert Mehrabian.
<BR>
<BR>
The resulting findings touched on both the region's strengths and weaknesses
and led to the first community-wide strategic planning process for western
Pennsylvania, known as the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative.<BR>
<BR>
RERI recommended establishment of the Working Together Consortium itself,
along with implementation of the following regional strategies the consortium
oversees:
<UL>
  <LI>	Build on the strengths that hold the key to future job growth;
  <LI>	Invest in wealth- and 
  <LI>	job-creation assets;
  <LI>	Revive our entrepreneurial vitality;
  <LI>	Make greater Pittsburgh a leading destination for world visitors;
  <LI>	Create an economic climate for the 	21st century;
  <LI>	Establish a new spirit of teamwork in economic development;
  <LI>	Connect workers and students to the jobs of the future; and,
  <LI>	Build one economy
</UL>
<BR>
&quot;In benchmarking other regions, one fact becomes clear: In successful
regions, everyone understands  the region's goals, and everyone works together
to make those goals happen,&quot; says Allegheny Ludlum Chairman Richard
P. Simmons, who also is chair of the Working Together Consortium.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;If our region is to be successful, we have to adopt an attitude of
cooperation among ourselves, a can-do attitude,&quot; Simmons says.  <BR>

<B><FONT size=+2>This is Where It's Happening</FONT></B><BR>
<B><FONT size =+1></FONT></B><BR>
<I>By Jim Urban</I></CENTER>
<P><HR>They say the heaviest traffic is on Sunday mornings, when people
venture from their homes to go to church or buy a newspaper. The cars might
be lined up four or five deep at a stoplight - a downright inconvenience
by local standards.<BR>
<BR>
So you know that typical 10-minute trip down Route 30? Well, you better
allot yourself an extra minute or two to get through that congestion at
the stoplight near Westmoreland Mall<BR>
<BR>
Welcome to Westmoreland County: small towns, country setting, relaxed atmosphere,
low crime rate, but a big-league player when it comes to economic development
in western Pennsylvania. That's right. Amid the forests and rolling fields
- which cover about 70 percent of Westmoreland County - are businesses large
and small that have created more than 2,500 jobs in the past two years<BR>
&quot;This,&quot; says long-time County Commissioner Terry Marolt, &quot;is
where it's happening.&quot;<BR>
Indeed, it is. Here's a sampling:
<UL>
  <LI>	Kennametal, the Latrobe-based manufacturer of industrial tools and
tooling systems, is moving its North American metalworking operations from
Raleigh, N.C., to Westmoreland County, including about 300 jobs.
  <LI>	Sony continues expansion of its Technology Center in East Huntingdon
Township. It already employs about 1,200 people, with another 500 to start
next year when the American Video Glass Co. plant comes on-line across the
street from the existing Sony facility.
  <LI>	Robicon, a maker of power conversion equipment, stayed in the region
last year after outgrowing its 30-year site in Plum Borough, Allegheny County.
The company moved its operations and 400 jobs across the county line to
a new $7.7 million facility near the Alcoa Technical Center in Upper Burrell
Township.
</UL>
<BR>
And those are only the big hitters. While Westmoreland County has shown
a knack to lure those bigger employers, it also is convincing its smaller
but growing firms to sit tight instead of looking elsewhere. These companies
add five jobs here, 10 jobs there - they add up after a while.<BR>
<BR>
 Meanwhile, the existing jobs of these growth companies - an estimated 2,500
positions - have been secured by keeping the companies at home.  <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've attracted new companies,&quot; says Larry Larese, the county
planning director, &quot;but we've also been able to keep the ones who were
already here and are expanding. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;Keeping the existing companies,&quot; Larese says, &quot;is just as
important when you talk about economic growth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
What's Westmoreland's secret? A combination of things, according to planning
officials and the business people who deal with them. Collectively, they
provide insight into the county's fast-paced economic growth.<BR>
<B><BR>
The Pitch<BR>
</B><BR>
It starts with the bait, then comes the hook. The bait brings prospective
businesses in for a look, and here's a sampling of what they hear:<BR>
<BR>
Westmoreland economic development managers are quick to note the county's
proximity to Pittsburgh, but in the same breath will quietly point out what
differentiates Westmoreland County from greater Pittsburgh.<BR>
<BR>
Take the cost of electricity. West Penn Power, which services Westmore-land
and all or parts of 22 other counties, boasts an industrial utility rate
of 4.54 cents per kilowatt hour, below both the national average of 4.96
cents and Duquesne Light's rate of 5.94 cents. The figures are based on
data about 200 utilities report to the Edison Electric Institute, a Washington,
D.C.-based association of shareholder-owned electric companies.<BR>
<BR>
Sony has cited the low power costs as one of several reasons it located
in Westmoreland County. In Robicon's case, electricity rates played a role,
too. Robicon's new plant uses about 20 percent more electricity than the
old facility in Plum Borough, yet its costs are unchanged since it now is
serviced by less expensive West Penn.<BR>
<BR>
West Penn credits its low cost to a decision the utility made over two decades
ago. When other electric utilities were investing in nuclear power, West
Penn remained loyal to coal and to this day still fires its power generation
plants with coal.<BR>
<BR>
Another piece of bait: the small town atmosphere only a 45-minute ride from
the big city. Of the 10 Pennsylvania counties with populations in excess
of 300,000, Westmore-land - with a population of about 390,000 - has the
lowest rate of crime, according to FBI statistics. The crime index of 1,593
incidents per 100,000 inhabitants is less than half of Alle-gheny County's
rate of 3,582 incidents.<BR>
Prospects like the low energy costs and high quality of life, so they visit
Westmoreland for a closer look. Now comes the hook: Westmoreland's ability
to sweep prospects off their feet by presenting a complete package: land,
facility, infrastructure, permits and financing, all on a silver platter.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They buy the land, put the utilities in place, lay out the parcels
and sell them at really good prices,&quot; Robert Bryan, a real estate consultant
in Westmoreland County, says of the county's development team. &quot;They
put the financing in place. They go to someone, they really have a package
for them. You can build a building and set up shop pretty quickly.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Strategically, they've done a really good job,&quot; Bryan says. &quot;It's
been a good effort. I can't personally say enough.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The county's development arm - the Westmoreland County Industrial Development
Corp. - even ventured into the railroad business by purchasing and rehabilitating
rail lines previously owned by Conrail, PennDot and CSX. Prospective businesses
see the rail system - consisting of about 38 miles of track - as a plus
because of its use in receiving parts and shipping a finished product. It
was a key in landing the American Video Glass plant at the Sony Technology
Center.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;I like to think we are one of the leaders as far as providing available
sites that are ready for prospects,&quot; says Joseph Sisley, marketing
director for the WCIDC. &quot;We do the infrastructure, permitting and utilities.
The wetlands issues and archeological studies have all been taken care of.
<BR>
&quot;We also have a very good working relationship with various agencies
that put financial packages together. Often times, when we meet with prospects,
we pull in all these key people to not only answer questions on available
sites, but also financing available for the project.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Advanced Manufacturing Tech-nologies, for instance, worked with the county's
development team in securing a $263,380 state loan so it could build a 11,520-square-foot
building at the Westmoreland Industrial Park III in Penn Township, one of
seven county-run industrial parks. Advanced Manu-facturing, an expanding
company, manufactures electronic assemblies such as cables for televisions
and employs 25.<BR>
<BR>
At the same park, vinyl graphics manufacturer Endagraph Inc. used a $312,888
state loan to finance its expansion. The company employs 25, but hopes to
add another 40.<BR>
<BR>
All seven Westmoreland County industrial parks consist exclusively of greenfield
sites, meaning there is no environmental remediation necessary. At presstime,
three of the parks were full, including the previously mentioned Penn Township
park, whose last parcel was optioned to developer A. Richard Kacin and will
likely be occupied by a security firm. The park is home to 19 businesses
involved in manufacturing and distribution.<BR>
<BR>
Many of the smaller companies take more land than they initially need, allowing
them to easily expand as growth occurs. It also prevents them from looking
for another location.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Bigger Fish<BR>
</B><BR>
Sony has been everything Westmoreland hoped for and more. The electronics
giant and its partner, Corning Asahi Video Products, swallowed several million
dollars in Clean Air Act costs when they decided to build the glass plant
at the Technology Center (For more on the Sony glass venture, see the Best
Deals winners on page 46). In addition to the glass plant, the Sony Technology
Center also has spawned Sony Chemical Co., which manufactures thermal transfer
tape coatings and employs about 100 in nearby Hempfield Township.<BR>
<BR>
Fred Ishii, vice president of American Video Glass, confidently shrugged
off the Clean Air Act costs when questioned about them at a groundbreaking
for the glass plant last fall. The utility costs were low, Ishii says, and
there were other positives that outweighed any negatives.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We liked this location because of the skilled work force available
and the infrastructure,&quot; he says.<BR>
<BR>
The Sony Technology Center is about a five-minute ride from the junction
of the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Interstate 70 in New Stanton. Parts manufactured
in Southeast Asia are flown into Columbus, Ohio, and trucked to Sony. While
that's an indictment of Pittsburgh International Airport's freight-handling
capabilities, it's also an endorsement of the infrastructure Sony touts
at the Westmoreland site.<BR>
<BR>
Kennametal's activity is about 15 miles to the east of Sony, near Latrobe.
The company is spending about $20 million on construction of a new corporate
headquarters building and improvements on two existing structures along
Route 981. Once complete, Kennametal's three-building headquarters complex
will total approximately 380,000 square feet of space, house approximately
700 employees and allow the company to become more efficient and competitive.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For Kennametal, this is a wise decision,&quot; says CEO Robert McGeehan.
&quot;We always have been headquartered in Latrobe. We have deep roots in
western Pennsylvania, but today we are a different company and are competing
in a different world. This consolidation will make us even stronger and
better than we are today.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Residential Growth<BR>
</B><BR>
With economic growth comes population growth. At the next census, Westmoreland
County planners expect the county's population to exceed 400,000, and many
of the big growth areas are communities with close proximity to Allegheny
County, such as Murrysville, Penn Township and North Huntingdon. One indicator
of the growth: Voter registration for the most recent primary election showed
jumps of several thousand in all three areas since the previous presidential
primary in 1992, county officials say.<BR>
<BR>
Many newcomers to western Westmoreland work in Pittsburgh and make the daily
commute on the Parkway East.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Lower property taxes are really a big incentive, plus utilities are
generally lower when you compare Westmore-land to Allegheny,&quot; says
Terry Ruta, a Coldwell Banker agent based in Murrysville. &quot;A lot of
people also like the small town atmosphere.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Deerfield Estates in Penn Township, with homes starting at $170,000, is
now in Phase III of construction, according to Ruta.<BR>
<BR>
Homebuilding also continues further east in the heart of Westmoreland. In
Youngwood, for example, Millstein Industries Inc. is entering Phase II of
its Cherry Creek development near Westmoreland County Community College.
Homes starting at $170,000 surround a 4,500-yard, 18-hole golf course. In
addition to 162 single-family units, the development will also include 138
multifamily units.<BR>
<BR>
n Hempfield Township, Logan Dickerson, father of Executive Report publisher
Linda A. Dickerson, is subdividing and developing 304 acres at the Lindwood
Farm. Phase I includes 22 homes starting at $285,000. Eventually, the development
will include 205 upscale single-family homes, plus 60 upscale condominiums.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's about 13 to 15 minutes from Murrysville, and the setting is upscale
rural,&quot; says Bryan, who consulted on the Lindwood project. &quot;The
attempt there was to make a statement to the people who live in Westmoreland
now and are ready to move up.<BR>
 <BR>
&quot;It's also an attempt to get people who work in Pittsburgh and are
willing to go as far as Murrysville. Maybe we can get them to come another
15    minutes,&quot; says Bryan.<BR>
<BR>
Not far away, Samaritan Health-Care Inc., a subsidiary of Lutheran Affiliated
Services, is building a retirement community that initially will feature
104 senior condominiums and a 98-unit assisted living facility. The community,
known as Crown Point, is one of four Samaritan is building in western Pennsylvania,
with the others in Cran-berry Township, Sewickley and the South Hills of
Pittsburgh.<BR>
<BR>
Eventually, the Samaritan site will include a 120-bed skilled nursing facility
for acute care and Alzheimer's care.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;When it's all said and done, we expect to have about 400 folks living
on our campus,&quot; says Samaritan President William Pratt. &quot;Westmoreland
County is a strategic location in our master plan.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>The Future<BR>
</B><BR>
With growth comes growing pains, but Westmoreland is taking steps to limit
those. It already has in place the Amos K. Hutchison Bypass, a tollroad
linking New Stanton to Delmont. And commissioners continue to lobby for
construction of the Laurel Valley Expressway, a limited access highway that
would link New Stanton to Latrobe.<BR>
<BR>
In May, the county also floated bonds to finance expansion of the county
airport in Latrobe, not far from Kennametal's campus. Airport Manager Gene
Lakin says the $4.75 million project will double the public areas of the
airport terminal and likely attract another major carrier.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, USAir Express provides daily commuter service to Pittsburgh International
Airport, with eight roundtrip flights each weekday. Lakin says a new carrier
may establish direct commuter service to another hub or direct service to
another city, such as Philadelphia.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We see great potential with this,&quot; Lakin says. &quot;With the
space we have now, we really are limited to one commercial carrier in there.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This project really opens it up,&quot; Lakin says.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the aggressive recruitment of business continues, with many companies
listening intently.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The tax structure is more favorable, the utilities are less expensive.
And some of these properties the county develops - they are put on the market
at really competitive prices, sometimes half of what the private sector
would sell them for,&quot; says Jeffrey Ferris, a vice president for Kacin.
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;These are the deciding factors for a lot of businesses.&quot;<BR>

<B><P align=center><font size=+2>The First Step
</font><BR>
<font size=+1> Many are Embracing Proposed Changes,<br> and That's Good Sign for this Region 
</font><BR>
<i> By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</i></b>

<P>
<hr>

We weren't proclaiming the death of Pittsburgh when we placed a tombstone on our January cover, but we were offering this hint: If this region doesn't get its act together, its residents  are facing a grim future.<P>Some readers chastised the magazine for kicking the region when it was down. Others told us we were courageous to package the message the way we did: on the face of a tombstone.<P>Our goal throughout the Resuscitating the Region series has been to point out in what areas our region is lacking, while identifying windows of opportunity through which we can help ourselves.<P>This month, we discuss the importance of highway infrastructure (see page 14), most notably how other regions have benefited from building a beltway and the feasibility of circling Pittsburgh with our own beltway.<P>As 1996 has progressed, other parties have offered their own opinions or recommendations on how this region can become - as a whole - more competitive. Executive Report Publisher Linda Dickerson toured southern cities during the month of January, interrogating 107 people from Greenville, S.C., to Jacksonville, Fla., about how their regions have gained an edge. You'll read her findings next month.<P>The Committee to Prepare Allegheny County for the 21st Century culminated a year of benchmarking with recommendations of far-reaching changes to the way Allegheny County government operates. Among the recommended changes was a call for consolidation of suburban municipalities.<P>The biggest surprise of this all? The response from the public, which seems to be embracing the recommended changes.<P>When Linda Dickerson invited 50 community and business leaders to hear her and Carnegie Mellon University economist Don Smith discuss her southern trip, 85 people showed up. That's right: 85 people.<P>As for the ComPAC 21 report? The Republican commissioners slowly have warmed up to the report, and the reception in the suburbs was better than expected.<P>Jim Turner, who coordinated the study and the compilation of its findings, says he feared suburban communities would protect their turf and resist the ComPAC 21 committee's call for suburban consolidation. Instead, Turner says the early response from suburban leaders has been, "How can we get moving on this?"<P>Let's hope it continues, because there indeed is reason to think this region can land on its feet. Milwaukee - a Rust Belt city against which the ComPAC 21 committee benchmarked Pittsburgh - sure has.<P>Since 1987, Milwaukee has edged steadily upward in job growth and remains among the nation's top 20. The unemployment rate, once more than 13 percent, was at just 3.5 percent by the early part of this decade. Yet the industrial heritagee remains in Milwaukee, a city whose skyline, beyond a smallish downtown area, is mostly smokestacks and church steeples.<P>Naysayers may claim we can't compare Pittsburgh to southern boomtowns because of the climate difference. As Turner says, that excuse doesn't work when comparing Pittsburgh to Milwaukee. Same climate. Same Rust Belt history. Milwaukee just has a different way of doing things.<P>I mentioned the suburban consolidation. Milwaukee leaders think they have too many municipalities in Milwaukee County. They have 19, to our 130. <P>Enough said.<P>Let's not fear change. Let's continue to embrace it.  We all will benefit in the long run.                                                <P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+2>The Right Time<BR>Good Leaders - Like Robert Mehrabian -<BR>Know When it's Time to Move On 
</FONT SIZE>
<font size=+1></font><BR>
<i> By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher </i></b>
<hr>


Late last year, in his office overlooking the construction site of the University Center, a hallmark of his presidency at Carnegie Mellon, Robert Mehrabian reflected on the characteristics of great leaders.  Accustomed as I am to receiving Robert's sagacious counsel, somehow I sensed that this conversation was different. First, his back was to me.<P>Robert is a captivating conversationalist who never fails to make eye contact. But his penetrating looks were directed at the campus, not at me, as he spoke on this early December day.<P>The words he uttered were deliberate.  "Linda," he said, "the job of a university president is tough." <P>He was silent. I was uncomfortable, sensing that this dialogue between friends was a departure from the many that preceded it.  After what felt like an interminable wait, Robert continued.<P>As if to prepare me for his decision to leave CMU, he began reciting a litany of the qualities unique to strong leaders. Tucked obscurely among the list he recounted was the leader's ability to recognize when to turn the reins over to another. An important dimension of leadership is, after all, planned succession. <P>Yet many good leaders miss the opportunity to become great leaders because they linger too long. To themselves and to many others, these  leaders become indispensable. But in today's world, sustained leadership can easily stifle organizations.<P>As we all know by now, Robert Mehrabian will not fall prey to this fate. <P>Who's to say how long is too long?  Only the great leader knows the answer to this question. And only a great leader has the conviction to leave at the pinnacle of his or her success. When no one else thinks a leader should resign is precisely the time that the most extraordinary depart. Leaving on an upswing affords a successor the       optimal opportunity to succeed. True leaders recognize that perpetuating    the organization's success supersedes amassing individual success.<P>If the time is right, the temptation to stay and enjoy the fruits of one's labor does not dissuade a true leader. This impeccable sense of timing seems to many almost an uncanny ability to see the future.<P>At a university where presidents' tenures regularly exceed a decade, Robert's imminent departure seems premature. But his announced resignation is nothing more and nothing less than a testament to his tremendous leadership capacity.<P>Some may view "leaving for personal reasons" as placing self before institution. In Robert Mehrabian's case, the opposite is true.<P>

</FONT SIZE><br>
<font size=+1>Current Brownfields Act Still Needs Work
</font><br>
<font size=+1>to Really Help the Economy</FONT><br>
 <i>By Laura Schleich Irwin
</b></i>

<HR>


Recent issues of this magazine have questioned the economic viability of the greater Pittsburgh region, and  painted a dreary outlook for western Pennsylvania. <P>A better view would be one that focuses on the positive aspects of this region and recent developments that  look forward, not back.<P>One example is the Land Recycling and Environmental Remediation Standards Act, known to many as Brownfields legislation. This law is not only a means to improving our region economically, but also shows that government and business can join forces to make the region a competitor for new businesses. <P>Enacted by Pennsylvania's legislature last summer under the strong guidance of Gov. Tom Ridge, the Brownfields legislation facilitates recycling abandoned industrial sites by linking site remediation to the risk connected with its intended use. In other words, the long-overdue act finally recognizes that former industrial sites intended to house another industrial operation do not require cleanup to the same extent that, say, a day care center would require. <P>Other provisions of the legislation provide lending institutions with protection from environmental claims for contaminated property in which they own a security interest. It also offers the new owners limited release from liability for historic contamination.<P>Abandoned sites, formerly home to businesses ranging from steel making to chemical manufacturing, are typically contaminated with materials considered harmful to human health, such as metals and coal derivatives, that remain in the soil and often the groundwater for years. Traditionally, state and federal environmental agencies imposed onerous cleanup standards for these sites, often requiring cleanup  to "background" levels.<P>For you and me, "background" level means we could picnic on the site without fear of contaminating our lunch. To property owners, however, achieving this standard meant no economic gain reselling these sites. Abandoning them became common, and in some instances the only wise and viable option for businesses.<P>Logically, prospective buyers and developers weren't interested in these  contaminated sites. As we can see up and down the three rivers of Pittsburgh and elsewhere, redevelopment of these sites rarely occurred. Instead, companies looked to pristine properties for industrial development. Urban blight, a declining tax base and a sense of doom for our region - once an economic powerhouse - followed.<P>Advocates and critics alike point out shortcomings of the Brownfields legislation. Chief among these are that that the legislation does not provide prospective developers with three crucial commodities: time, money or a full release from liability for historic contamination. These points are well taken and require attention from legislators.<P>Although the act includes a limited release from liability for historical contamination, the release provision may not insulate an owner from actions by third parties or by all enforcement agencies. For prospective buyers and sellers to be comfortable signing on the dotted line, state lawmakers must revisit this provision.<P>Time is also a significant concern for prospective buyers. The current act does not alter the administrative details of seeking and obtaining approval to investigate and remediate an abandoned site. This process, which can be tedious, costly and sometimes frustrating, must be amended to provide priority treatment by state agencies.<P>Likewise, money is an ever-present consideration. This Brownfields act provides no financial incentive to tip the balance in favor of an abandoned site. At a minimum, abandoned sites will require an initial capital outlay to conduct an investigation and cleanup of the site and negotiate releases from historical contamination. To bridge the gap, an investment tax credit, tax abatement plan or other financial incentives should be considered by the legislature.<P>In short, lawmakers must remember that the developer's choice often is between a virgin site and an abandoned site. Given the excellent location of many Brownfields sites, legislative action to rein in these negative aspects of the Brownfields legislation can tip the balance in favor of abandoned sites.<P>Pennsylvania has emerged as a leader in the move to redevelop abandoned industrial sites. While the Brownfields legislation is not a panacea for our region's complex economic and social problems, it is a start. Indeed, it demonstrates that things are looking up in western Pennsylvania.  n<P>Laura Schleich Irwin is an associate with the law firm Babst Calland Clements and Zomnir in Pittsburgh.<P><P>

<H2>Giving Business What it Wants</h2>Carla Brownell draws a simple pear in 3-D, rotates it and does a drive-by, which makes you feel like you're in a plane flying low over it. Then, with a click of the mouse hooked to the Silicon Graphic workstation, she shades it blue. Brownell used to be an art student, used to be a computer programmer. Now, she's both, as the graduate assistant to John Shepherd, head of Duquesne University's new multi-media master's program.<P>"USA Today ranked computer animation as one of the top jobs for the year 2000," says Shepherd, looking over Brownell's shoulder, delighted with the computer program. "Computer animators starting out make $60,000."<P>It just so happened that Duquesne President John E. Murray Jr. heard that multi-media - the use of interactive audio, video and computerized graphic techniques - was the way of the future. He asked John Shepherd, a professor in the school of health sciences, known among his colleagues for his multi-media enthusiasm, to investigate starting such a program. <P>Shepherd looked to the business community.<P>"I called the people I knew doing this stuff in Pittsburgh, and asked them who else did it," says Shepherd. He ended up with an advisory board, which he uses to shape curriculum and, because the field is so new, to actually teach. He's also hoping they'll be a boon to graduating students.<P>The program, now a master's, is shaping a certificate program at the encouragement of Mellon Bank, which sent six of its training designers over to take classes this semester.<P>"Students have to shoot and edit video, shoot 35mm, record audio - they learn all the basics, then integrate them by designing a home page on the World Wide Web," says Shepherd, showing off a student's design for the local Warner Bros. cable channel. <P><P>Others have done home pages for the Steelers and the Tribune-Review.<P>But the real draw are classes like the one Brownell's demonstrating: Computer Animation 101. <P>"It was a big decision to buy these really expensive Silicon Valley workstations, which are the computers they used to dothe animation for 'Jurassic Park'," says Shepherd. "Because they gave us such a huge break, we could buy two, and the <P>software." <P>The classes are double the enrollment he expected, and Shepherd says he needs a third, and possibly even a fourth workstation. <P>Shepherd hopes to train not only artists, but technicians, to make the programs run, and authors, to design programs for training and education. He's even incorporating an elective in computer game design. And he's planning for the future.<P>"Seems like one of the emerging areas is virtual reality, creating 3-D animation for use on the Internet," says Shepherd. It's already made the short list of tentative electives.                       <P>- Lydia Strohl<H2>Corporate Shootout at Diamond Run</H2><P>Executive Report, Coldwell Banker and Diamond Run Golf Club are teaming up to host the first annual         Corporate Team Shootout golf        tournament July 1 at Diamond Run's Gary Player signature course in the North Hills.<P>Thirty teams from businesses in southwestern Pennsylvania will square off in a shotgun-start, best ball tournament followed by a sudden-death shootout among the top finishing teams to determine the champion.<P>"We've always covered golf, because it was and remains a critical part of doing business," Executive <P>Report Editor-in-Chief Jim Urban says. "We are glad to hold an event like this at Diamond Run, one of westernPennsylvania's most challenging golf courses."<P>The event is open to four-person teams comprised of players with <P>current USGA handicaps who are <P>affiliated with the company they are representing. <P>Look for further details about the Corporate Shootout in next month's issue of Executive Report. <H2>Is the Pittsburgh Marathon<br>Running Out of Steam?</H2>Like the spring weather, the Pittsburgh Marathon has been buffeted by the winds of change since its inception in 1985. Some of the changes have been pretty stormy, including the takeover of the marathon by the city in 1991 and drops in attendance since then.<P>This year, a kinder breeze may blow on the event; Larry Kuzmanko, founder of the race, has been asked back on the planning board, presumably to work the same magic that brought the marathon to its summit as an Olympic Trial event in 1988.<P>Runner's World called it the best first-year marathon in the country. The first year attracted 2,510 runners, followed by 3,000 the second year, 1987. <P>"There was a time when what we did here actually influenced Boston," remembers Kuzmanko. "We had Ray Flynn, the mayor of Boston, come here and run one year, and the next year, Boston put forth prize money. We were able to show this city off in terms of our people, the neighborhoods, the creativity, in a light that was comparable to Boston, New York, and I think that that's one of the reasons why the marathon is good."<P>Part of his magic was his ability to recruit people like Allan Steinfeld, director of the New York City Marathon, one of the premier running events in the world. Kuzmanko coaxed Steinfeld into playing the role of technical coordinator during the early years here, and the expertise Steinfeld lent the Pittsburgh Marathon played a great role in the event's success in the 1980s. <P>"Larry knew how to take care of people," says Steinfeld. "You have to make the top athletes feel like they're being catered to." That "caring touch" was part of what fell apart when Kuzmanko left. Many sponsors left with Kuzmanko.<P>The city, by most accounts, simply never got along with Kuzmanko's flamboyant style and outspoken character. From long, flowing hair and jeans with suit jackets to tactics like giving kegs of beer to pubs to recruit crowds along the routes - none of that sat well with the powers that were.<P>"From the get-go with the marathon, it wasn't just the last year, I had difficulties with the bureaucracy. And I just don't think that we shared the same vision," says Kuzmanko. "When Mayor Caliguiri died, it was very difficult because, in effect, I lost the person who could share a vision." <P>The Masloff administration decided it would run the event, and pushed Kuzmanko out. "My dilemma was, do I just continue to butt heads with the city and make it impossible to have an event, or do I let it go, and the event survives. Although it didn't continue to flourish the way it did, it still continued, and that's important, because no one likes to see something that they start ruined."<P>Whether the Marathon was "ruined" or not depends on who you talk to. It is the case that before 1991 Pittsburgh attracted some of the top runners in the world; now, it does not. The top attendance in 1990 was 4,385; last year, that number was 2,700.<P>"It's nice to have a director like Larry who's fair and takes care of the athletes. That was the reason I enjoyed it," says elite runner Maureen Custy-Roben. "I was going to come back in 1992, but the guy who was [athlete coordinator] at that point promised things and then went back on them. Then no one else went, either."<P>    Today, she says, the Pittsburgh Marathon doesn't have the prestige is once held among the sport's elite athletes. <P>     "There's a working chemistry [at a successful event] that nobody wants to upset, or you can lose it all," adds Steinfeld. "I think that's what happened in Pittsburgh's case. The political people who got involved brought it down."<P>  This year, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center gurus Dr. Freddie Fu and Larry Grollman, himself a former disciple of Kuzmanko, head up the marathon board in yet another changing of the board. Kuzmanko says that formula is promising. This year's organizers hope to attract 5,000 runners to the May 5 event.<P>The race will be held entirely downtown, <P>which some feel slights the neighborhoods that made the race in years past. The board hopes to attract more people by making it easier to see both the start and finish. Also featured will be a relay race, allowing groups to run the marathon in shifts. <P>Steinfeld thinks it may be possible for the Pittsburgh Marathon to regain its former glory if it is properly promoted. He says the sponsors should campaign to get the backing of the local running community. He says that it's good Kuzmanko is back on the board.<P>Kuzmanko's take on the matter?<P>"I'd take a polygraph on Grant Street that the city was 100 percent wrong with the way they handled things, but the issue is not one of the past, the issue is one of the future - that the event continues to enhance Pittsburgh, that the event is still good for Pittsburgh.<P>"If you care about something, you want to see it succeed and continue to do good things. The problem is, how much bureaucracy and how much government can I take? There are some people who can drink it in glasses - I have to take it in little teaspoonfuls. Whether I'm the problem or they're the problem, I don't know. Let's say it's me."                              n<P>- Cynthia Bent<P>

<font size=+1>Riverboat Gambling Legislation<BR>Is Taking on Water in Harrisburg                

</font><BR>
<i>By Jim Strader
</i>

<HR>

<P>
Early last year, supporters of riverboat gambling felt their ship had come in. Gov. Robert P. Casey, a longtime opponent of the idea of casinos floating on Pennsylvania waterways, had left office and had been replaced by Tom Ridge. The new Republican governor was not an avid advocate of riverboat gambling, but, with his business-friendly attitude, had given signs during the campaign that he would not stand in the way.<P>Developers responded to the potential change by buying up riverfront tracts along the Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio rivers in Pittsburgh, as well as property in Philadelphia and Harrisburg. Prices for land along the riverbanks shot up.<P>But now, more than a year after Ridge took office, hopes for riverboat gambling seem to be dead in the water, at least for now.<P>The supporters of legalized riverboat gambling pointed to a potentially huge windfall for the state and host communities. Detractors warned of criminal influences and other woes often associated with gambling. Those concerns were countered with proposals - backed by Mayor Tom Murphy in Pittsburgh and Mayor Ed Rendell in Philadelphia - that the casino developments would have to anchor larger improvements along the rivers.   <P>The first sign of rough sailing for gambling proponents came when <P>Ridge stated flat out that he favored a statewide referendum before riverboat gambling would be legalized.  The  governor said <P>he would veto any bill that passed without such a provision. <P>Legislation sponsored by Rep. Frank Gigliotti, a Democrat from Brookline, was introduced in the House of Representatives last year. It didn't reach the House floor for a vote before lawmakers broke for the summer, and was slow to get back into play in the fall. Though the proposal never got to the point where a vote was called, it seemed that the bill might have played a part in Ridge's effort to get education reforms passed.<P>The governor was having trouble amassing enough votes for his education package - rooted in a tuition voucher plan - and the word heard around the Capitol was that Ridge was trying to enlist the support of those eager for riverboat gambling. Both initiatives fell short by year's end.<P>Parliamentary politics played a big part in keeping the idea from gaining much steam. Republican leaders in the House - like Ridge, having other priorities - sent the riverboat gambling proposals to a committee chaired by Rep. Paul Clymer, a gambling foe from Bucks County who ensured the demise of the bills. He was content to take minimal action.<P>Clymer did hold two days of hearings on riverboat gambling in Philadelphia, with a field trip of sorts to Atlantic City to see casino operations there. Clymer indicated that his goal was to air the issue publicly, taking in all points of view. But he never wavered from his point of view, leaving no hope that any of the proposals would make it through his committee.  They haven't. Gigliotti thinks the hearings were a farce, and refused to testify or take part.<P>Early this year, other issues dominated the attention of the governor and lawmakers. Snowstorms and flooding hit much of the state in January. The annual budget process began in February, focusing the work of the legislators and the Ridge administration on spending priorities for the coming fiscal year. As for riverboat gambling? It remained low on the priority list. <P>The governor renewed his position that the state's votersshould ultimately decide the issue, but did not push to get the gambling question on the November ballot, when the presidential election is likely to draw a large turnout. Ridge indicated that legislators seemed to have had their own referendum on the matter by not bringing the bills to a vote.<P>Meanwhile, some developers in western Pennsylvania gave up waiting for their lucky number to hit in Harrisburg. Parcels of riverfront land once staked out for access to floating casinos are being turned to other uses.<P>"The land was just sitting there and it was prime land," says Wade Fox, data services manager of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Planning Commission. "They wanted to get something out of it and decided it's best to move on."<P>

<P>
Back in the 1960s, Rich Engler, drummer for the local band Grains of Sand, turned his hand to drumming up venues in which the band could play. If his band was booked, he'd offer the gig to another band - soon building a stable of groups, taking a small commission each time he made a deal. <P>From that grain of sand Engler has built a rock empire. Twenty-two years ago, he partnered with his largest competitor, Pat DiCesare, to create DiCesare Engler Productions. Though he says the crystal ball on his desk doesn't work, you'd never know it: The company's the largest promoter in the region and one of the top 20 nationwide. An ardent Beatles fan, he sports a McCartney-esque hairdo as well as the visible enthusiasm and drive of that famous Beatle. But scratch the surface, and Engler's just a nice guy from Creighton who keeps the pulse of the music industry worldwide from his office in the Strip District, bringing in and creating the events that shape thelocal music scene. ER's Lydia Strohl talked to him about it.<P>Executive Report: How'd you get started in this business?<P>Rich Engler: I played drums. I booked my band into clubs and colleges, and as my band started to become relatively popular, when we were booked I would call another band. I would take $20 or $30 commission for a $500 engagement. That really started to build, and it ended up that I had a corral of attractions under me.<P>The union called me one day and said 'You're doing all these bookings and you should have a license.' That was in late 1967. I got a booking agent's license and a bond and everything I needed. <P>The industry really started to explode at that time. There was a surge of talent trying to jump on that Beatles/Rolling Stones English movement. I just happened to be there at the right time to create a great agency. <P>I had a booking agency for several years, and then I decided to start promoting. The difference is that in booking, you sell attractions to another person. Promoting, you buy an attraction from a major agency and then try to resell it by the way of tickets and so on.<P>My first concerts were in Johnstown, Erie, Cumberland and Baltimore, because at that time Ihad a competitor in town, Pat DiCesare. Pat was a well-established promoter: He had a lock on the Civic Arena and the Syria Mosque. I was able to make a deal at the Stanley Theater to do two or three shows a year down there.<P>Being the money conscious person that I am, in my early years, when I started making the transition from having the booking agency to actually promoting shows, I put my act on as the opening act. So I not only was the promoter and organizer of these events, but I was also the opening act. Things were really rolling for me, at a relatively young age.<P>One day I got a call and it was Pat DiCesare - he said, "Let's meet and talk about the future." We struck a deal and formed DiCesare Engler in 1974. I really had to put my nose to the grindstone, strictly on the business level. There was really no room for me as a musician. The drums went on the back burner and I went with this all the way.<P>ER: How is your firm structured?<P>RE: DiCesare Engler Inc. is the mother company. Within that we have Premier Advertising, headed up by Ed Traversari, a partner with Pat and myself. They do all the advertising for our events. We have Festival Consultants of America, which is headed up by MonicaPatcharis, and she puts together all these festivals. DiCesare Engler Attractions is a booking agency; if you are getting married, or have an event at your college or your club, Steve Juffe has his people downstairs that handle that. We also have a management team that helps manage the A.J. Palumbo Center at Duquesne University; we own and operate the IC Light Amphitheater at Station Square,  and we have a booking association with Star Lake Amphitheater. We also do the Celebration of Lights, at Hartwood Acres and in Philadelphia.<P>Our staff is around 15 or 16 - it's not as big as you think. Whenever people meet me, they think DiCesare Engler is a huge operation -  but we like to keep it lean, that's what works for us. We hire people on the street level as we need them - even in other cities. We would do all the advertising for a show in Harrisburg, for example, and the booking, from here.<P>ER: How does Pittsburgh rate at getting attractions?<P>RE: It's not in the top five, but it's definitely a must stop - every major record company looks at Pittsburgh as a great market and every attraction really wants it on their tour. <P>Usually we end up with about 42 to 44 shows at Star Lake, and about20 at the IC Light Amphitheater. We've done a series of festivals the last three years called Pepsi Fest, and we're planning six festivals this year, mostly around the IC Light Amphitheater. We do one at the stadium, the Rib and Music Festival, which will be at the end of June this year. We'll probably do 10 to 12 shows at the Civic Arena, 16 to 18 at the Palumbo Center. <P>Three Rivers Stadium is always a big question mark. Back in 1994, we had the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Elton John and Billy Joel. The next year the Grateful Dead was the only show. At this point there doesn't look like there will be any stadium shows this year. Everything's based on artists, albums, album release dates and if they want to do stadium tours. But they've been booked as late as June for a September date, so it's not a dead issue.<P>ER: How has your company grown over the years?<P>RE: Our business, at least the promoting of the concerts, is based on how strong the music business is at the time, and how many acts tour. 1994 was our 20th anniversary; it was also one of our best years. We didn't plan it that way, it just happened that there were a number of major attractions out there. That was the best year, not just for us, but for the music business across the U.S. Will we continue to climb? We hope so, but it's hard to tell. But will our revenues continue to climb? Yes, because we have more profit centers. We have diversified with our booking agency, with the Celebration of Lights department, with our festivals. <P>We're working on a couple of other surprise festivals now that I can't reveal at this time. But that's a major move for our company. We're looking not only to do them here, but out in central Pennsylvania, eastern Pennsylvania and expand upon that. With the shrinking profits in the entertainment business, we had to diversify. With the festivals, we create the event, we own the event. It doesn't go away and maybe not come back the next year. It will come back the next year, and even stronger, because we own it.<P>ER: Do you think Pittsburgh is in step with the rest of the country when it comes to taste in music?<P>RE: Three or four months ago, I was very disgusted with the radio scene. But now with the X (106.7 FM) and the Revolution (104.7 FM) it's a whole new life out there, with a lot of new bands. This new generation of kids, they're finally picking up and holding onto some bands of their own. They're tired ofdad's bands, all these dinosaur acts. I mean, they're all great acts, and they've made a lot of money for us and the industry over time, but we really need to build new attractions. These new radio stations are the key. If a kid's not exposed to a certain kind of music, he's never going to buy it. <P>MTV's out there, but they give too much away. Some kids are satisfied by seeing a concert on MTV. You still can't replace that feeling of seeing a live show, but MTV took a lot out. I'm not totally putting down MTV, because I think they've done a great job for the business, too. But I think anytime there's overexposure on video, that's a deterrent to live. <P>On the other side, I'm excited about the Internet. DiCesare Engler was the first promoter in the country to be on the web, with our own site. You can, on our site, bring up a band that's coming, get their picture, bios, and if you have the right equipment at home, get 15 to 20 seconds of their hit song. <P>ER: Has the industry changed? <P>RE: What has happened is that over time the attractions have been taking more money from our business. You used to be able to buy a show for $10,000 and that would be it. Flat charge. People would come through the door, and after people came through the door andyou paid all the bills you would maybe make 40 percent. The acts have really eroded away our profit centers. That's why sponsorships and the ancillary incomes, the food and the parking, come into play.<P>Now, it's not uncommon to guarantee $250,000 to $500,000 on huge shows, versus a huge percent, like 90 percent of the door - whichever is greater. The percentage they get is after expenses, so they do allow us to subtract the expenses for the show, but not for office costs. <P>That has really escalated, against the promoters and the companies producing events. So with the creation of the amphitheaters, and so forth, [sponsorship] was a way of helping the bottom line. In the last 10 years it's become a major part of our business; not only the promoters and facilities have corporate sponsors, but the acts are finding sponsors for their tours. <P>So Fruit of the Loom might present Charlie Daniels at the IC Light Amphitheater. There can be a harmony, corporate sponsors can live together. But if Budweiser was presenting at the IC Light Amphitheater, that doesn't work.<P>ER: How competitive is your industry?<P>RE: It is very competitive, because there are only so manydates out there. If an act is going to do a 40-city tour, in the summer especially, there are probably 100 amphitheaters. It becomes very difficult for everybody to get a date. We may be bidding against Cleveland; we may be bidding against a city in South Carolina. Bidding does go on. <P>Our business, years ago, used to be very territorial - we respected the Cleveland promoter, and they would respect us and wouldn't come into Pittsburgh. But the past few years there's been a lot of national promoters that buy a major tour and come through the market without tying in the local promoter. <P>There are three or four companies that do shows in the Pittsburgh area; there are a few national companies that come into Pittsburgh throughout the year - free enterprise, that's the way it goes. And we get into bidding with these other companies.<P>ER: You said that as the industry has gotten bigger, it's gotten less personal. What role do you still play in the process?<P>RE: I scan the globe daily. I feel like I have a pulse on what tours are happening, what tours are being planned, and what acts or shows might be out there, because I'm on the phone all the time. When the time comes for the booking, we getour date for Pittsburgh and we do real well. I make all the deals with the performers.<P>I do go to all the concerts if I'm in town. I do not attend all of the club dates, because it becomes a little too hectic for family life. I usually make my way to say hello to the attraction or the manager or agent, whomever might be in town. If they want to go out to dinner afterwards, and we can, we do.<P>ER: Do performers make wild requests?<P>RE: Bands used to go absolutely crazy. Fleetwood Mac wanted five limousines around the clock, at their beck and call. Stevie Nicks wanted a white one, Christie McVie wanted this one and Mick Fleetwood wanted this one - it was out of hand. In their rider they wanted all kinds of Dom Perignon and Remy Martin, and next thing you know, their catering bill was $6,000 for that night, and their limousine bill was $5,000 to 6,000 for the limos.<P>There's the old famous story of Van Halen. They wanted one of those oversized brandy glasses filled with M&Ms, with all the brown ones extracted. We were doing this show at the Aladdin Theater in Las Vegas. My partner called and said, 'Do you realize there are two color brown M&Ms - the dark ones and the tan ones. What should I do?' I think heended up taking the dark ones out.<P>The acts paid all these bills, then tour accountants said 'Hold on.' Because the way the deal is set up, they're paying 85 to 90 percent of these bills. So now we find that they don't go overboard too often. Certain acts, when they get their first piece of fame and stardom, they overspend. But a lot of the veterans now are realizing that they can save outrageous amounts and go home with more in their pocket. It means more for everybody. On some of those bigger shows, it's still not uncommon to have a $20,000 catering bill on a stadium show.<P>ER: What's ahead for the industry and for DiCesare Engler?<P>RE: Our five-year plan is to keep expanding into our festivals, and in more markets. Probably within 500 miles from Pittsburgh - it's easier to handle from our main offices here. Whenever we get out too far, it becomes  a little tougher. Ours is such a hands-on business - we don't send a product that sits on the shelf until somebody comes in and buys it. We really have to sell it, and everything is dated. We make an investment in a product; we have about 30 to 60 days to sell that product. And once it's gone, there's no resale. We're onto the next thing. We usually have about20 irons in the fire at a time, 20 or more events that we're selling tickets for.<P><P>

<font size = +1>A Bust at Fist Bite, Valentino<BR>Antes Up for Lunch
</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl
</I></B>
<p>

<hr>
Many restaurants have come to the third floor of Walnut Street's Hartwell Building - and gone just as quickly. The newest is Valentino, which opened there in January.<P>Fashioned as an Italian bistro, the restaurant, faux-painted to resemble a courtyard, is trendy and relaxing. As you come up the stairs, an array of beautifully laid out dishes greets you. <P>Unfortunately, Valentino is as inconsistent as the human heart.<P>Though the menu looks creative, on closer examination it is astonishingly devoid of details. On our first visit, our waitress knew nothing. She did offer her opinion, when we asked - but we should have known her tastes differed from ours when she indicated pleasure with the sun-dried tomato pate, which she brought, along with a white bean pate, to accompany a small crusty loaf of bread. The bread was unremarkable and the pates bland - the tomato tasted like tomato paste direct from the can.<P>We bit when she recommended an appetizer of grilled shrimp on the half shell, with marinated peppers and artichokes. But they were grilled to a crisp. By the time we pried off the skins, there was precious little left. <P>We also tried the angel hair frittata with seafood, a house specialty. It was a big, dry omelette, with the angel hair pasta and other ingredients in the middle. The menu touted shrimp, crabmeat, peppers, scallions and shittake mushrooms in the middle, but there was little of anything. Perhaps, we thought, we just don't like breakfast before dinner. We ordered a glass of wine from the wine list, which is nice (but go for the bottle, because the glasses are small and pricey). And we waited for the entrees.<P>Again, in vain. The Pappardelle pesto chicken pasta sounded wonderful - but because I don't like heavy cream sauces, I asked how much cream was in the pesto cream sauce. Our waitress said not much. She lied. It was laden with cream. The doughy overdone squares of pasta (since changed to a different noodle, according to executive chef George Harris III) all stuck together, taking on the shape of the plate. The grilled chicken was good.  <P>What we had been waiting for were the crab cakes served with asparagus in a red pepper sauce. They looked beautiful, but they were also laden with egg, perhaps for frying, which had been done incompletely.  <P>We didn't eat much. So naturally, we eyed the dessert tray ravenously - and decided to splurge on a chocolate decadent called chocolate windmill. It was wonderfully rich, creamy and smooth. The cappuccino was frothy, though the espresso might have been filtered with dishwater. <P>Lunch, a week later, was better. The ribolita soup, which a different, more knowledgeable waitress described as minestrone in nature, was thin but passable.<P>We ordered sandwiches this round, which are not on the dinner menu. The chicken pesto sandwich involved no cream; the grilled chicken was topped with herby pesto, asparagus, portabella mushrooms and asiago cheese. The grilled portabella sandwich featured plump stripsof portabella, marinated and grilled, topped with wide planks of roasted red peppers and asiago cheese. In each dish, the assemblage of tastes melded together perfectly. Both were served on wonderful, chewy and crusty in all the right places Chibata bread. The sandwiches were accompanied by homemade chili pepper penne, mixed with regular penne in a light vinaigrette, al dente, but tasty and unique.<P>Again, the food was beautifully presented. A jug of water, topped with a whole lemon, is a nice touch. But the menu and the consistency need some work. Chef Harris, formerly of Diamond Run Golf Club, says he's made staff changes and increased his time there to try to evolve the young restaurant. But everything is a la carte; dinner for two with wine was $80. So try it for lunch first.<P>

<B><font size=+2>Location Vs. Savings</font><br><font size=+1>Does a Prime Location Justify the Added <br>Expense That Accompanies Being Downtown?<br>
</font></B><i>By Henry Lipput</center></i><P>


<HR>

<P>
After paying steep rent in downtown Pittsburgh for five years, Frank Marmion moved his advertising agency to the Southside, purchasing the building in which he now conducts business.<P>What a difference, financially speaking.<P>"I only have seven employees, but I was picking up parking for five of them, so parking was costing me $1,000 a month, plus my rent," says Marmion, president of Marmion Advertising. "My [current] monthly outlay is the same as it would have been in town for rent plus parking.<P>"From a financial standpoint it just made a great deal of sense to me,"  says Marmion, one of many small business owners who have found it lucrative to locate outside the central business district.  <P>Marmion says he doesn't worry about his clients having to leave the city to come and see him. <P>"They don't come to me as much as I go to them," he says. "I didn't need to be in town, although I do need access to town. And that was another thing that appealed to me about the Southside.  A lot of my suppliers are in town, and a lot of the art houses and the production houses that I use are in town."<P>Al Thompson, a retired PPG executive and volunteer for the Service Corps of Retired Executives, says one of the most important things a small business must consider in choosing a location is its target market. <P>"You look at the area and whether it produces the demographics and other dimensions that [you] need to market your service or products," he says. "Then you start getting into specific site selections. And then you ask: Does the site provide the type of amenities and benefits that you're looking for? Adequate parking? Ease of access? Those sorts of things. You would probably want to - from a customer's standpoint - consider making it accessible to a major thruway."<P>Beyond the fringe markets like the Strip District, North Side and Southside, some suburban communities are marketing themselves as good business locations. Carnegie, for example, buys and resells buildings to businesses that locate there.<P>"We're the only small town between Pittsburgh and the airport on the Parkway," says Allen Turske, Executive Director of Chartiers Valley Area Community Development Inc.  "[Our charter is] basically to promote Carnegie and to develop Carnegie by various means, including purchasing properties so that we can offer them for development and give incentives, for example, on the the price of the land or the way it would be paid back. Also, to foster development through advertising or any other way that we can do it.  But our primary thrust is to get Carnegie redeveloped, if you will, renovated, renewed.   <P>"There are advantages to being here in Carnegie because of its location and also because of the prices of real estate," says Turske.  <P>Solutions 21, a training and organizational development company, is located in Carnegie. Buddy Holbart, the firm's President, loves the convenience.<P>"Carnegie is 15 to 20 minutes from the airport, [and that's important] because our business is national and international. In off-hour traffic, we're 15 minutes from downtown.  I couldn't beat the location from that standpoint." He had thought about establishing his company downtown, "but I live out west and the reality is Greentree Hill every morning.  And the base of my business isn't in town."  <P>Another reason for his selection, according to Holbart, was the availability of old homes that had been converted into office space. "Carnegie brought a whole different flavor, if you will, to my office," he says, "because I was able to put it in a building that has a great deal of character. So it's not an office environment, it's in an old Victorian home. Training participants who are coming here - when they take a break and walk out and have a cigarette or just to stretch their legs - they walk out onto a wrap-around porch and not into some lobby somewhere."<P>Holbart is not concerned about asking city-dwelling clients and their employees to visit him. "I have had absolutely zero problem getting people to schedule appointments in my office," he says. "There's certainly not a parking issue." <P>But consider if Holbart was located downtown.<P>"Say I'm doing a training class for your company and you're sending five  employees here, and I'm in downtown Pittsburgh. Each one of those five  employees is paying $10 to $12 a day to park," Holbart says. "So your business now has a $60 expense, because they'll expense that to your business. But sending them here avoids all that."<P>

<B><font size=+2>Purchasing Problems</font><br><font size=+1>When the Purchase Order Conflicts<br>with the Sales Acknowledgement, Who Wins?<br>
</font></B><i>By Jim Urban</center></i><P>


<HR>

<P>

When a carpet retailer started receiving complaints about the quality of rugs it was selling to the public, the retailer did some investigating and discovered the rugs shipped by one of its suppliers were made of low quality fiber.<P>Weeks later, Carpet Mart went to court, suing the supplier for $450,000 in compensatory and punitive damages. It looked like a simple breach of contract case - the rugs were not up to the quality the two parties had agreed upon - but in reality, the case was anything but simple.<P>The supplier pulled out the acknowledgment form it sent in response to the purchase order initially sent by Carpet Mart. On the back of the acknowledgment, in plain English, was a clause stating that any disputes between the supplier and its buyers would be settled in arbitration. In other words, Carpet Mart had waived its right to sue, and the supplier did not have to defend against the lawsuit.<P>The dispute would be settled in arbitration.<P>The case represents a common predicament for businesses large and small. When buying from another business, the standard practice is to cut a purchase order and send a copy to the supplier, who responds with the acknowledgment form confirming the order.<P>The reason such preprinted forms are used is simple: It's not efficient to negotiate, draft and sign a contract for each transaction between merchants.<P>But here's the problem with the preprinted forms: Buyers' purchase orders often include terms that expressly protect warranty rights or the right to sue - just as Carpet Mart wanted to do - when a dispute arises. The sellers, on the other hand, build in terms in their acknowledgment forms that severely limit warranties and damages or mandate arbitration.<P>So when these forms are exchanged - as is standard practice among American businesses - who wins when a dispute arises?<P>"I talk to purchasing managers from major corporations, and many of them don't know about this problem," says Duquesne University President John E. Murray Jr., a nationally recognized expert in contract law who also writes a monthly column for Purchasing magazine.<P>"These purchasing managers for major corporations leave me saying, 'This is one more thing I now have to worry about,'" Murray says.<P>In transactions between merchants, the buyer's purchase order often operates as an offer to which acceptance is expressly limited to its terms. So when the seller responds with an acknowledgment form with different terms, it operates as a counteroffer and no contract is formed under contract law.<P>"This is a common occurrence," Murray says. "The parties think they have entered into a contract, when in actuality they have not."<P>What complicates matters is that the seller then ships the goods to the buyer, who accepts them. So although no contract was formed, both parties have acted as though they are under contract. <P>The solution lies in the Uniform Commercial Code, which keeps the dickered terms the two parties agree upon - price, description and quantity for example - but excises the conflicting terms such as warranty or damages provisions. Those gaps are then filled in with UCC terms that in most cases favor the buyer.<P>For instance, the UCC's implied warranty of merchantibility covers goods for four years in most states, compared to most sellers' preprinted acknowledgment forms that limit the warranty to 90 days.<P>In Carpet Mart's case, it could proceed with the lawsuit against its supplier even though the supplier's acknowledgment form mandated that disputes be resolved via arbitration.<P>Lawyers refer to the purchasing predicament as the "Battle of the Forms."<P>There are other variations of the scenario, and the UCC addresses most of them in favor of the buyer. Revisions to the UCC are due in 1997, when Murray hopes resolving the battle of the forms will be simplified.<P>

<B><font size=+2>March Madness</font><br><font size=+1>The NCAA Tournament Comes Here Next Year and<br>Brings With it Plenty of Ouside Dollars<br>
</font></B><i>By Bill Modoono</center></i><P>


<HR>

<P>

With little more than a third of 1996 passed, the biggest sporting event of the year in Pittsburgh has already taken place. Super Bowl XXX had the hype, the drama and the local TV ratings to make it a mega-event in western Pennsylvania and overcome its only real drawback: It was not actually held in western Pennsylvania.<P>But then Pittsburghers are used to having major events involving their local teams decided in locales far away. They have no problem accepting that. Here's something that might not go down so easily: The early leader in the race for Pittsburgh's top sports event of 1997 figures to be one with no - count them, none - local teams or athletes involved.<P>Two first-round games from the 1997 NCAA basketball tournament (aka "March Madness") are scheduled for the Civic Arena on March 14 and 16. The price is steep - $105 for three separate admissions to see six games, and you have to buy all three - but no one expects any of the 17,500 seats to go unsold.<P>This is precisely the kind of event that Pittsburgh almost never gets, despite its tendency to congratulate itself for being a great sports city. Apart from the once-a-decade appearance of the U.S. Open at Oakmont - an event that has more to do with the historical and competitive significance of the course than with western Pennsylvania's passion for golf - and the once-every-two-decades appearances of baseball and/or hockey all-star games, Pittsburgh is seemingly never viewed as a potential venue for events with national cachet.<P>But that was not the way Brian Colleary saw things. "The NCAA tournament is probably the top event in college athletics and I thought Pittsburgh was a great site for it," says Colleary, the athletic director at Duquesne who will serve as tournament director for the games at the Civic Arena. "It will put Pittsburgh and Duquesne in the public eye." <P>Colleary backed his belief in Pittsburgh by nominating the city two times unsuccessfully before finally winning NCAA approval on his third try.<P>Eight teams will play six games that weekend next March - four on Friday in a day/night doubleheader and two on Sunday. The winners advance to the regional finals and then to the Final Four, more prestigious events that the city could conceivably bid for in the near future.<P>What makes Pittsburgh such a strong site is not only a sizable arena and a vast number of hotel rooms in the area, but the number of hotels in close proximity to the site of the game. "The farthest any team will be from the Arena is eight miles," says Colleary.<P>Pittsburgh is such a good site it's a wonder it has never hosted this event before. According to local legend, the city's infamous 10 percent amusement tax was a deterrent, but Colleary says the tax (now at 5 percent) was "never a topic of conversation."<P>Joseph McGrath, president of the Greater Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau and a member of the board of directors of the Pittsburgh Sports and Festival Federation, says the amusement tax was never the "real reason" the NCAA did not come before, just one of several reasons. Among the factors he cites was a lack of interest from previous owners of the Penguins, previous managers of the Arena, and the athletic departments of Pitt and Duquesne. <P>"What you have now is a jelling of personalities and desires and agendas. All involved feel this will be beneficial to them," McGrath says.<P>McGrath likes to point out the economic advantages of events such as these that draw large numbers from outside the immediate area. While big events in general can add to a city's amorphous sense of "vitality," big events can bring concrete, short-term financial gain. Big-spending sports fans can spend as much as $200 a day for food and lodging and assorted souvenirs, McGrath estimates.<P>One other advantage is that an event like this, where upwards of two-thirds of those attending will likely be from out of the area, "can bring with it a significant amount of money," McGrath says. Big events that draw mostly locals compete with existing local attractions and do not add to the local economy. <P>"This is exactly the kind of event that creates tourism and adds vitality," says Louis B. Kushner, chairman of the Sports and Festival Federation, which was formed to attract events of this kind. "It's an excellent event for Pittsburgh."<P>

<b><font size =+1>Sports Medicine is No Longer<br>Just for the Athletes</b></font><br>
<i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
</center><P>


<HR>
Last fall, Rose Ravasio had anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction just days before Steeler Rod Woodson did. But unlike Woodson, she was not hoping to play in the Super Bowl against Dallas. Her goal? To be able to walk a little bit, and someday to do low impact aerobics. <P>So did she need the assistance of Dr. Patrick DeMeo, director of sports medicine at Allegheny General Hospital? Absolutely, according to DeMeo.<P>"The goal of sports medicine is to keep people athletically viable whether they're 7 or 70, because we know that inactivity is deleterious to the quality and the length of life," says DeMeo. "That ligament wasn't going to kill her, but she couldn't do everything she wanted to."<P>Sports medicine brings cutting edge techniques, developed to get top athletes back to play, out of the locker room. It's not just for sports-related injuries anymore.<P>"Even if they're going to sit behind a desk the rest of their life," agrees Steelers' athletic trainer John Norwig. "Especially if they're a young person - they could end up with arthritis."<P>"Sports medicine is basically the practice of medicine in motion - looking at the whole human being and the demands and needs of individuals who are dynamic," says Dr. Doug McKeag, director of primary care sports medicine at UPMC. "Our diagnoses are enhanced because we see more sports-related injuries, and better understand biomechanics. The ancillary diagnostic tools we use are better, so we don't ill use resources. It eliminates the need to shot gun therapies, and we have an unbiased view because we're not surgeons."<P>Sports medicine practitioners also tout its comprehensive care; most clinics have consulting primary care physicians, orthopedic surgeons, physical therapists, athletic trainers, chiropractors and nutritionists.<P>In all of these arenas, what makes sports medicine different from traditional health care is the goal of the injured patient. Some clinics, such as St. Margaret's, define sports medicine patients as those who have been injured while engaged in athletic activity, or who have aspirations to return to a high level of activity. But others have a more lenient yardstick. <P>"We're a very active society," says Dr. Paul Michael Hoover of AGH's Back Institute. "We're not just passive observers, thus injuries become more significant. Traditional medicine is geared towards maintaining activities of everyday living. Sports medicine far surpasses that - to run or to throw or to make contact requires greater strength and agility, so our rehabilitation techniques have to go beyond."<P>"We have to be a lot more aggressive and a lot more creative," agrees John Duffy, district director of Health Trax Rehabilitation Services, overseeing nine regional clinics. "There's a lot more problem solving because the forces at work are much more dynamic and powerful. Why does a guy who runs 20 miles with no problem start to feel pain when he runs 22 miles? It's a lot easier to figure out why a guy who never ran, then ran five miles, hurts. We try to get to 100 percent strength and 100 percent range of motion - but we need to find out what the patient's goals are. If all they're going to do is walk around, clean house, if that's their 100 percent, then maybe they don't need to be paying for a session."<P>Sports medicine uses both traditional and innovative treatment protocols, personalizing the program to the patient. Take Woodson and Ravasio, both with ACL reconstruction. After surgery, Woodson's job was to heal: He devoted himself to recovery, working one-on-one with an athletic trainer two or three hours a day. Ravasio, who works in PR for Duquesne University, attended physical therapy three hours a week. Woodson had superior strength and agility to start with. Ravasio had a history of knee problems. <P>Different treatment for different goals? You saw it. In January, Woodson played in the Super Bowl. Ravasio still limps some days. <P>"The actual treatment varies minimally," says Greg Campbell, coordinator of sports medicine at St. Margaret's Hospital. "But when it comes time to functionally progress them, they may not have the time or the resources. If your HMO only pays for six visits, what can your goal be?"<P>Not everyone needs sports medicine - and for some its techniques may be damaging. So buyer beware - for along with the vagueness of the term, sports medicine also suffers from its popularity. "Sports medicine" has turned up in clinic names and ads with increasing regularity - but there are as yet no mechanisms in place to regulate their veracity.<P>"There is no specialty in sports medicine. Other specialties, like internal medicine, family practitioners, pediatrics, have a certificate of added qualification [in sports medicine], and there is an orthopedic fellowship in sports medicine," says UPMC's McKeag. "But it's not well regulated - many of these people who hang out shingles don't have these qualifications."<P>And that's bad news for consumers, because it doesn't stop practitioners from throwing the term sports medicine into an ad as a sexy way to sell physical therapy. The consequences can be dire.<P>"If you use bad sports medicine, as with any charlatan type of care, you can have greater dysfunction," says Hoover.<P>So far, say the experts, Pittsburgh's sports medicine market doesn't have a lot of imposters, but they do recommend checking qualifications and the actual activities of a clinic to assess its capabilities. Many local clinics have contracts with high school sports teams to provide training and rehab services. Local colleges and universities have clinics for their own teams which also service the public. Many hospitals are developing programs too.<P>Physical therapists may have a certificate in sports medicine, or be certified athletic trainers. <P>But in this fledgling field, title isn't always indicative.<P>"If someone spends four years here learning under me, they will definitely learn sports medicine," says AGH's DeMeo. "Knowledge passes boundaries, and it doesn't mean they're not in tune if they're not a sports medicine specialist.<P>"What we're doing in sports medicine today will benefit the general population tomorrow."<P>

<B><I><font size=+1>A Law Degree Is a Marketable Asset Even If You<br>Don't Become a Lawyer
</font></I></B><br>
<i>By Paul Nutcher</i></center>

<HR>

<P>
When Carol Loncar decided on a graduate degree as a way to improve her future employment prospects, she decided on a law degree even though she didn't necessarily plan to become a lawyer.<P>"I felt it was one of the most skill-oriented types of degrees you could get.  It was a great professional choice," says Loncar, currently dean of admissions at Point Park College.<P>So while working as a school administrator during the day, Loncar also attended law school at Duquesne University in the evening. It was a grind: Classes were often five nights a week. At best, she'd have Friday evening free, and that was it.<P>Loncar made it through the four-year program and today credits the law degree with making her more marketable. In many cases, a law degree can lead to improvements in salary and job security, she says. There's also the added knowledge: The study of law includes topics like corporate structure, environmental issues, basic contract principles, the tax code, immigration and property law, all of which are applicable in today's global economy.<P>"On a whole, it's nice to know the law," Loncar says. <P>Both Duquesne and the University of Pittsburgh offer flexible law degree programs for working people. Pitt has a reduced credit-load daytime program; Duquesne's program is geared toward the evening student.<P>"I leave my residence at about 7:30 a.m. and return around 9:30 p.m.," says Luigi DiIanni, a U.S. Steel environmental engineer and second-year evening student at Duquesne. "It can be a long day, and it's tough because I have to perform on all cylinders while I am at work, then face the same expectations at school at night."<P>But, DiIanni adds in the same breath, without an evening program many would not be able to go to law school in the first place.<P>Pitt does not offer an evening program, but allows students in its flex program to reduce their credit load and take up to five years to finish, according to Fredi Miller, dean of admissions, adding that no one has ever taken longer than four years. The program has attracted physicians, business owners and parents who cannot leave their kids alone in the evenings but can squeeze in classes during the day.<P>"Students say, 'Had it not been for the flex program, they would not have been able to go through law school,' " Miller says.<P>In addition to time, the law school commitment is also financial, as much as $40,000 over the four years. Some companies, like U.S. Steel, will pick up all or part of the cost for their employees as part of their benefit package. Most students have to foot the bill themselves. And facing those loan payments motivates one to enter the field of law.<P>Those who do go on to practice can be very marketable provided that they held a position of substance as they attended law school. At Duquesne, many evening students are over the age of 30 and have life experience that may give them an edge while searching for jobs in the tight Pittsburgh market, according to Professor Ronald Ricci, dean of admissions at Duquesne's law school.<P>"They tend to have experience that helps them to gather contacts," Ricci says. <P>From the law firms' perspective, many seek individuals who have the poise to sit down with clients right away. Joe Vater, managing partner of the Pittsburgh law firm Meyer Unkovic & Scott, says that experience in the working world is a plus, but don't forget good grades.<P>"Someone who works 40 hours a week with high grades shows they are able to balance a lot of things well," Vater says.<P>Vater is often asked about what he looks for in a hire, but says he doesn't have a cookie cutter mold.<P>"If you were good in law school and doing 40 hours a week in an executive position, that person is going to get a serious look," Vater says. "I'm constantly impressed with people who can hold down a job, family and finish after four years with a law degree."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+>Bayer Corp. Chief Executive Helge Wehmeier is <br>Executive Report's CEO Communicator of the Year
</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i>
</CENTER>
<hr>


<P>
It was the first working day of 1994, and Helge Wehmeier was on his way to Minneapolis to schmooze a customer. Heavy snow closed Pittsburgh International Airport, so Wehmeier - the president and chief executive officer of what then was known as Miles Inc. - suddenly had some time on his hands and was wondering how he would spend it.<P>Then it came to him, maybe from the sight of employee cars lined up in the snowy parking lot. Wehmeier set off through the campus, walking department to department, desk to desk, pumping hands like a politician in an election year.<P>"I wanted to shake hands with all the people who struggled through the snow drifts to get to work and take the orders from our customers," Wehmeier says, looking back. <P>An isolated incident? Hardly. There he was again this past January, shaking many of the same hands in what has become an annual tradition for Wehmeier on the first working day of each year.<P>The main differences: the weather wasn't nearly as bad this year, and Miles now calls itself Bayer, the name to which it reacquired U.S. rights last spring.<P>Because of the importance Wehmeier places on employee communication, and  the effective way his corporation handled its name change from Miles to Bayer, Executive Report selected Wehmeier as its CEO Communicator of the Year.<P>The magazine annually honors a chief executive who not only personally excels in communication, but also pushes the company to display communications excellence. The award ispresented in conjunction with the Renaissance Awards sponsored by the Pittsburgh chapter of the Public Relations Society of America. Previous winners of the CEO award include Duquesne University President John E. Murray Jr., PNC Bank CEO Thomas O'Brien, DQE CEO Wesley W. von Schack and the late Blue Cross CEO Eugene Barone.<P>And while the list of the previous winners is impressive, few, if any, can say they've faced the type of communications challenge Wehmeier and the employees at Bayer faced one year ago this month.<P>The Name Change<P>The reason Miles changed its name to Bayer dates back to World War I. At the end of the war in 1918, the U.S. government confiscated the Bayer name and U.S. assets as enemy property, eventually auctioning off the name to Sterling Winthrop, which held the rights until late last year.<P>So for 76 years, Miles' parent firm Germany-based Bayer AG used the Bayer name everywhere else in the world except the U.S.<P>In January 1994, Sterling finally sold its over-the-counter medicine business - including the Bayer rights - to British pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham, which turned around and sold the Sterling business to Miles for $1 billion two weeks later.<P>And on last April 3, 1995, Wehmeier and Bayer AG chairman Manfred Schneider flipped a six-foot high switch, illuminating the new Bayer sign that sits on the edge of Mount Washington in Pittsburgh.<P>Miles was forever gone.<P>"All of a sudden, all the Bayer entities that had been under wraps, so to speak, in North America, all came out in the open," Wehmeier says. "All was revealed about what really we are doing and what our plans were in the United States."<P>And it sure didn't hurt that the lesser-known Miles name was being replaced by one with which most Americans had grown up. Even though  Tylenol and other nonaspirin pain relievers had crept into medicine cabinets throughout North America, Bayer remained a name most people easily recognized.<P>"What we acquired with the name Bayer, was not a corporate name but a product name: Bayer aspirin," Wehmeier says. "Our challenge was to continue to strengthen the brand name Bayer, which will always be ourflagship brand, but also to strengthen the corporate name Bayer."<P>Bayer pulled out all the stops, heralding the name change in television, radio, print and direct-mail advertising a few weeks before Wehmeier and Schneider threw the switch on Mount Washington. A Chicago-based ad agency, Foote, Cone & Belding Communications, came up with a catchy slogan: "We cure more headaches than you think." <P>The ads employed the well-known Bayer cross, which shows the Bayer name spelled horizontally and vertically and appears on each aspirin tablet. <P>One print ad included the headline, "After all these years, we think it's time you called us by our first name." <P>As effective as the advertising was, Wehmeier says a big key to pulling off the change wasinternal communications. After all, this company is undergoing its second name change in a decade:  A few years earlier, Bayer AG replaced the name Mobay with Miles.<P>First Mobay? Then Miles? Now Bayer? Employees had to be wondering what was going on, right? Not so, says Wehmeier. The Bayer management team knew employees would have to buy into the change. Once they did, customers would follow.<P>"We did it in the right way," Wehmeier says. "We said, 'We cannot hope to convince our customers that this name change is good for our customers if we do not have our employees on board.' So the bulk of the communication was not on the customers, but was initially focused on the employees. We knew that only if we captured the hearts and minds of our employees would we be able toconvince our customers that this is the right thing to do.<P>"It was very well executed, in part because we already [changed names] once, but also because we focused it properly. Our employees saw this and appreciated that they were the target and focus of management. They did not learn things from the newspaper. They learned things directly from management."<P>The employees bought into it.<P>"To the great credit of our employees, they are pragmatists," Wehmeier says. "They have wonderful attitudes even though we asked a lot from them. We asked them to change their identity from Mobay to Miles, and then from Miles to Bayer. That's asking a lot.<P>"The upside was that we had practice. We had changed namesbefore and done it effectively. "<P><P>The Personal Side<P>Wehmeier knows a little bit about communicating. Born in Goettingen, Germany, in 1943, he joined Bayer AG in 1965 at the age of 22 and spent his early years with the company marketing products. During one stint in New York City from 1969 until 1974, Wehmeier was responsible for the marketing of synthetic fibers in the United States and Can-ada. He later managed the marketing division of the Fibers Division for Scandinavia and the British Isles from 1974 until 1978.<P> So perhaps em-ployees shouldn't have been surprised when the snowbound Wehmeier showed up at their desk in January 1994. Wehmeier knows how to communicate, whether it be in the workplaceor in public. And being a CEO has taught him how to work a crowd. It's part of the job he had to work at, Wehmeier says.<P>"It did not come naturally to me," Wehmeier says. "I had to get going on this ... I am not the type of person who walks around with an outstretched arm. But again, this comes with responsibility. I am the standard bearer for Bayer, so I have to reach out, especially coming into a community like Pittsburgh.<P>"I can't wait for them to come to me, especially because I am the new kid on the block."<P>A shining moment for Wehmeier occurred late last year. Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel came to Pittsburgh to speak as part of the Three Rivers Lecture Series, of which Bayer was a sponsor.<P>The Wiesel speech almos

<b><font size=+1>A Beltway: Advocates Say Build it<br>
abd Businesses Will Come</font></b><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i></center>
<hr>

<P>

Dan Campbell tries to lure business to the suburbs near Greater Pittsburgh International Airport. He says there's always interest, that is until the prospects take one look at a map.<P>Then, forget it.<P>"They like the skilled labor, but then they look at the lack of access and the inability to get people to the jobs," says Campbell, executive director of the 22 West Progress Group Inc. "These companies then discount Pittsburgh."<P>In other words, those jobs go elsewhere instead of coming here.<P>In Part IV of Executive Report's six-month series entitled Resuscitating the Region, ER looks at how transportation offers a window of opportunity to spur regional growth. In previous months, the magazine talked about the importance of entrepreneurship, exporting and education. In coming months, ER also will look at tax reform and tourism.<P>This month: transportation. Is a beltway the road to success?<P>Do We Compete?<P>When a consultant hired by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission compared the Pittsburgh region to 16 other metropolitan regions in the East, the findings were sobering.<P>Eleven of those regions were surrounded by beltways, and every single one realized both population and job growth from 1980 until 1990. Among them, Columbus, Ohio, and Baltimore saw employment jump 21 percent, while Indianapolis jumped 18 percent.<P>Five other metropolitan areas with "grid" highway systems all realized job growth even though three of them - Detroit, Cleveland and Buffalo - lost population over the decade. Grid systems consist of parallel series of interstate highways, allowing travelers to easily move to an alternate route if the highway they're traveling on is blocked.<P>Then there was Pittsburgh with its node highway system consisting of the Interstate 376 Parkway for east-west travelers and Interstates 79/279 for north-south travelers. Pittsburgh was the only of the 17 regions studied to lose both jobs and population. <P>"Where the interstate service is good, those places are growing like weeds," says Roger Carrier, the former district engineer for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation who now is president of Triline Associates, a traffic engineering firm in McMurray.<P>"If we had the right roads here, this place would be in a frenzy [of economic development]," Carrier says.<P>But the region is not growing. And although a beltway sounds like a massive undertaking, it isn't that farfetched a proposition. One link already is in place, and another is on the Turnpike Commission's agenda.<P>The Clock<P>The easiest way to look at a beltway is to picture it as surrounding the face of a clock. And looking at Pittsburgh, one already sees roadway stretching from noon to 3 o'clock in the form of the Pennsylvania Turnpike from Exit 6 in Monroeville to Exit 3 at Cranberry.<P>Another section, covering 6 o'clock to 9 o'clock is the proposed Southern Beltway that would stretch from Route 60 near Pittsburgh International Airport and connect with the Mon-Fayette Expressway near Finleyville in Washington County.<P>Beltway advocates envision another 12-mile leg connecting Cranberry to Pittsburgh International Airport (9 o'clock to noon) and the other final section stretching from the Mon-Fayette Expressway east to the Pennsylvania Turnpike either in Irwin or Monroeville (3 o'clock to 6 o'clock). There is also talk about running the Mon-Fayette Expressway all the way into Pittsburgh.<P>At worst, it would be mucheasier to move around the region. At best, development would occur along the sections of the beltway, beefing up suburban tax bases and creating employment opportunities.<P>Consider what happened along the beltway that surrounds Washington, D.C.: A study by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments, commissioned by The Washington Post, shows that in a five-year period from 1979 through 1984, a total of $832.6 million worth of commercial projects were started within roughly a mile of either side of the 66-mile-long beltway. <P>The overall construction during the 1979-84 period translated into about 17.6 million square feet of new office space, retail stores, hotels and educational and medical facilities.<P>Granted, development along a Pittsburgh beltway would never mirror the nation's capital, but what happened in Washington does show how infrastructure improvements can be an economic catalyst.<P>Southern Beltway<P>The section of the would-be beltway closest to construction is the 28-mile section that would bend behind the South Hills, connecting the airport to the proposed Mon-Fayette Expressway. The section stretches from 6 to 9 on the clock face.<P>Planners have narrowed the choices where the road would be built to a corridor along the Washington-Allegheny county line. The question remains: Will it be built? <P>North Strabane Township supervisors approved a resolution in December opposing plans to lay the Southern Beltway across the northern tier of the township.<P>Some residents were so against the road that they told township officials to raise their taxes by 1 mill to fight the road. Other residents offered to make personal contributions to a legal fund.<P>Supervisors in Cecil and Nottingham townships also have passed resolutions condemning plans to have the $630 million road pass through their communities.<P>As with most projects of this size, a fear of property condemnations have driven the opposition to the road.<P>Council meetings and public hearings are peppered with comments about the road "cutting through my home" or "leveling my backyard." But beltway advocates say the reality is that there is a price to pay for saving this region from economic debacle, and some unlucky people won't have a choice in the process.<P>"I have tremendous empathy for those who will be displaced, but we've come to the time when sacrifices have to be made for the good of all," says Larry Simpson, immediate past president of the western Pennsylvania chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties, a group that strongly supports the beltway concept.<P>"I fully understand the fears of those impacted by the road," adds another beltway advocate, state Sen.   J. Barry Stout, a Democrat whose district covers Greene County and parts of Beaver and Washington counties.<P>"I don't know where we'd be if we did not have the interstate system to move people and goods today," Stout says. "We would be strangled with traffic. I hope at some point in time that people will realize that a beltway is important for the future of this region."<P>Without the beltway, the region is doomed to economic death, advocates say. And the western suburbs of Pittsburgh near the airport are a prime example of why. Currently the townships stretching from the airport into the South Hills are a maze of winding, two-lane roads dotted with no-passing zones and weight-restricted bridges.<P>"If you get behind a coaltruck, you are there all day," says Carrier, the traffic engineer.<P>Property that might be prime for a manufacturing or distribution facility lacks access, probably one of the main reasons the new airport terminal has not been the economic catalyst that many hoped it would be.<P>Paying For It<P>Stout admits that talking about a beltway is one thing; actually funding a series of projects that create a beltway is another story.<P>"You are into a very costly transportation network," the senator says.<P>At presstime, Gov. Tom Ridge proposed a gasoline tax as a means of funding infrastructure improvements, among other things. Beltway advocates, who feared Ridge might steer clear of such a tax to fund highway construction, were somewhat relieved. With legislators up for re-election next year, it was unlikely they would push the gas tax had Ridge not supported it.<P>    It remained unlikely at presstime that the gas tax would generate sufficient funding for all the projects the state would like to begin.<P>   The reality: Stout says there is more work planned than there is money to pay for it.<P>   From Carrier's standpoint, the only way the beltway will become a reality is if the Turnpike Commission undertakes the project as a toll road that will pay for itself over the years.<P>    And highway projects don't happen over night. There are years of planning, public meetings, impact studies and bidding before the first bulldozer ever moves one pile of dirt.<P>That's why, beltway advocates say, the time to move aggressively on such projects is now. The first step is the Southern Beltway.<P>"We have a belief that Pittsburgh can do better," says NAIOP member James Storer, director of development for Mosites Development Co. "We believe western Pennsylvania can do much better.<P>"We have not, in the past, done what we need to do in order to do better as a region."<P>Build it, Storer and other beltway advocates say, and businesses will come.<P><P><P>

<B><font size =+1>Remember the Boring Pittsburgh Zoo? Those days are <br>long over; The Zoo has Thrived Since Being<br>Privatized, and Director Barbara Baker has big plans</font></b><br>

<P>
One day back in the late 1980s, Bob Luffy took his kids to see the Pittsburgh Zoo. He was terribly disappointed with what he found. He told his friend John Burgess about it a little while later - not knowing that Burgess was president of the Board of the Friends of the Zoo.<P>"I said, 'It's dirty, it's run down, it's a shame.' He said, 'Why don't you come on board, get involved?' I said, 'Why not?' " recalls Luffy.<P>At that time, the Friends of the Zoo was only a fundraising arm of the city-run facility. Since then, the changes that have taken place can only be described as revolutionary. The Zoological Society of Pittsburgh Inc. now owns and runs the zoo as a nonprofit corporation - commanding an annual budget of over $6 million.<P>Major renovations have changed the face of the zoo, including the addition of a brand-new Kids Kingdom. Attendance has increased 55 percent, with all-time high reached last year of over 680,000 visitors. Secure funds for the futurehave given the zoo the ability to plan the next 10 years with an end goal of becoming one of the top 10 zoos in the country.<P>And Bob Luffy is now chairman of the Zoological Society board. <P>"It's been a tremendous transition," says Luffy. "There's a world of difference between knocking-on-doors fundraising to an administration with a staff of 80 full-time employees in charge of a $30 million animal collection, with our own finances, marketing, and so on."<P><P>What's New at the Zoo<P>The 10-year strategic plan, in the works for over a year, reveals an ambitious vision of a rapidly changing zoo where visitors will never be bored again. The primary goal is to reach one million visitors per year sometime in the next five years by tapping the regional market. At the forefront is an effort to make the zoo kid-friendly.<P>"I've pushed since the beginning ofmy involvement to make this the biggest and best children-focused zoo in the country," says Luffy, emphasizing the link between families and increased membership. "Nothing else would generate that kind of return on the investment for us, for one thing, and really, the zoo is for kids."<P>With first changes since privatization - Kids Kingdom and the Discovery Pavilion - the rubber hits the road. The first phase, Kids Kingdom, opened last May. A phenomenal hit, Kids Kingdom has outdoor playgrounds, where kids can climb on webs like a spider, swing down a rope like a gibbon or slide down a windy tunnel like an otter. The play areas surround petting corrals, where kangaroos and goats get up close and personal. One might lick you on the face.<P>Part II, the $2.2 million Discovery Pavilion, is slated for unveiling in May 1997 with more upclose experiences in the animal habitats. For instance, visitors will walk through a bat flyway - a 40-foot long tunnel with caves at eitherend - so close to the bats they can feel the breeze of their beating wings. <P>Another tunnel in the exhibit will be underwater - visitors will stroll through a glass tube beneath tanks of freshwater alligators and fish in wildlife-like surroundings. It will feel like being surrounded by a marsh and all its creatures.<P>One other attraction, the Meerkat Village, will showcase what it's like to be a little prairie-dog-like African mammal that burrows underground. Human burrows will run under the village, with pop-up windows for eye-to-eye contact with the animals.<P>Other exhibits will change regularly to keep visitors coming back again and again. Kids can peer through microscopes at an invisible world, and see what a junebug looks like or explore the skeleton of mammals, finding out what makes them tick and roar.<P>The rest of the zoo will gradually undergo a revolution as well. Graphics all over the zoo will be smartened-upboth visually and content-wise to provide education about the animals. Instead of seeing just the animal's name, or maybe even no sign at all, visitors will learn where tigers prowl, what giraffes eat, how many snow leopards are left in the wild and more.<P>This May, the zoo's train ride also gets a major facelift, with the help of faculty and students from the Pittsburgh Art Institute. Professor Alan Assad will enlist the help of students in the school of Industrial Design Technology to make the train ride into a safari education about the world's endangered species. The train will trundle by dioramas of life-like creatures in their wild habitats, like cats peering out of the jungle or wolves playing with their pups.<P>Assad says the school is excited to get their first chance to demonstrate the talents of its students, who study design of amusement parks and museum exhibits just like this one. It's rare, he says, that students get the chance to add projects like this to their portfolios.<P>Then comes the renovation of the AquaZoo. December saw the introduction of a new AquaZoo curator, Jim Prappas, a veteran of Walt Disney World and the Texas State Aquarium. He's jumped in with both feet, revamping and cleaning. A bevy of chambered nautilus, brightly-colored shellfish related to squid, set up shop in late winter. All over, tropical plants, waterfalls and fish have appeared in nooks and crannies. Divers swim through the tanks polishing the glass. Extensive future planning for major changes is now underway, though no solid decisions have been made.<P>Construction will next begin in 1998 for the South America and Asia exhibits. No one's quite sure what that's going to look like, because the American Zoological Association has not assessed the situation yet; the animals brought in will depend on what's available around the country. The most anyone knows is that the exhibit should have both indoor and outdoor components, to try to make as much of the zoo hospitable in wintermonths as possible. And 2001 will see the raising of an animal health and research complex, which won't be open to the public but will push the zoo to the forefront as a national research and health facility in the next century.<P><P>Other Strategies<P>Animal welfare and conservation have evolved into the zoo's primary raison d'etre. The goals in this area are to continue to provide top-notch care for the animals in the collection, and to focus on research and breeding programs for selected endangered or threatened species the staff has singled out for concentration. Two species the zoo has already begun to develop include the African elephant and the orangutan, because of staff expertise in these areas.<P>The five elephants are very young; zoo staff hopes to begin breeding them soon. It won't be long, they hope, before film clips of baby elephants born in Pittsburgh show up at the end of newscasts around the country. Likewise, the zoo aspires to become a breeding and research center for orangs.<P>Then there's educational programming, which is of utmost importance to the zoo's mission and already an area of explosive growth. Under Margaret Markas, curator of education, the program has increased from 454 students in 1990 to 38,000 last year.<P>Markas, a former animal keeper with the zoo, remembers a time when she did both special events and education, before the Education and Administration Complex was built, before there was even a place to hold classes. Now, with an MA in education from Duquesne under her belt, the redirected mission of the zoo to free her and provide resources, and with a five-classroom, 250 seat auditorium at her disposal, she's challenged just to keep up with the demand.<P>Markas runs programs for every age student, from age 3 through 103. The zoo teaches classes, holds workshops for teachers, runs summer camps, overnights, tours, even a cruise on the Gateway Clipper. The Oldsmobile Zoomobile travels throughout the region doing in-school visits. There are lecture series, night safaris and programs in conjunction with the Carnegie, Phipps Conservatory and the University of Pittsburgh, all developed in the last five years.<P>Other goals of the plan include more fundraising, marketing and membership drives. For instance, the zoo has just started group tour sales - parties or business groups can book the zoo for tours, conferences and meetings; while groups meet in the Educational Complex, spouses can tour the zoo with families. The zoo has already generated $259,000 from only eight months of group sales. Zoo Director Barbara Baker notes that 47 percent of Kennywood's business is done in prebooked groups, so the zoo's potential should be huge.<P><P>The Privatization<P>The story of the zoo's privatization is a classic tale of what the private sector at its best can accomplish. The first meeting Luffy attended, the group discussed its search for a new director, who would turn out to be a force that Luffy and others credit with making that change possible. Barbara Baker, a South Carolina native, lured from Riverbanks Zoo in Columbia, started as director in July 1990.<P>Baker says the zoo was at a crossroads when she came, ready for changes. The city had poured $26 million into renovations, and after 10 years of construction, it was time, she says, to take off. But the zoo was hampered by the limitations of being city-run. For instance, the city could never provide marketing for the zoo, so no one knew how it had already changed.<P>The zoo was ready to come to life as a major asset to the community - provided, of course, it could be set on sound financial footing, sheltered from the high and low tides of political maneuvering. Other zoos around the country were moving in the same direction; in1990, 47 percent of zoos were privately administrated already. Now, that number is 56 percent. Privatization was, in the zoo's eyes, a key to the future.<P>It finally became apparent around 1991 that the city needed to spin off some of the drains on its finances, and the board jumped at the chance to take over the zoo. Jeff Stilson, then president, co-chaired a task force with Jim Stalder of Price Waterhouse to push the zoo into privatization. Negotiations for that change took two years.<P>It was a long and difficult road, not least because the mayor's office changed hands just as the deal was ready to be inked. The board had to start all over, convincing the new administration of the wisdom of the deal. <P>Pete Hodgkins, director of the Philadelphia Zoo, which has always been privately administered, made the trip to Pittsburgh to testify before the council on the board's behalf.<P>"They would have the best of bothworlds, private management and some public support," he recalls. "I was strongly in favor of this move for them."<P>In the midst of the negotiations, Stilson asked Luffy to take over as president of the board, wanting to move on to other projects. Luffy asked him how much time the commitment would take.<P>"He said, 'About one hour or two a week.' He lied. A lot." Luffy has nevertheless remained dedicated to the zoo's mission ever since. <P>At about the same time another key to the zoo's future was being forged. The Regional Asset District funding project was in the works, a concept that could provide the zoo, along with a myriad of other public facilities, with stable funds that would mean the difference between stalled development and a bright future.<P>In the end, the zoo got both its wishes. The Regional Asset District Initiative was signed the same day as the privatization deal - December 14, 1993. The zoo had been given its wings; now it had to learn to use them.<P><P><P>New Order<P>The first year after privatization was a busy one. The zoo staff spent 1994 adjusting to the climate change, and preparing for its next big moves, says Baker.<P>Baker brought on board Saul Markowitz, a former director of public relations for CMU's College of Fine Arts who can only be described as "Mr. Energy." Markowitz set about rehabilitating the zoo's dusty image with the energy of the Tazmanian Devil. His team came on board in April 1994 with painfully little time before its busy season (see sidebar, page 18).<P>After revitalizing attendance and getting used to its new wings, the zoo was ready to take on the next phase: the next 10 years.<P>"We needed a master development plan to reflect the Regional AssetDistrict, the membership growth, the momentum we had, to keep it all going and bring in new projects every year," says Luffy. Mark Vernallis, a board member with a background in strategic financial planning for venture capital firms, decided to take on the job.<P>The plan took about six months to nail down. Vernallis traveled around the country with Baker, visiting successful zoos to peek at how they formulated their own strategic plans. His committee then put down into words where they were and where they'd like to go.<P>"The security of the RAD fund made Pittsburgh's plan unique," explains Vernallis. "While other zoos are questioning their survival from year to year, wondering where winds of political change will leave them, we are able to plan to make this zoo an awfully positive asset to the region."<P>A shift in the philosophy behind the zoo's mission was also involved. Over the past quarter century, the focus of zoos has changed from "stamp book" collections, as Baker puts it - having at least one of everything - to a focus on conservation and education, to help keep all species around in their own habitats, in the wild, for all time. As a result, zoos have grown their educational programs into centerpieces of their missions. Pittsburgh was starting in this direction with the addition of the Educational and Administrative Complex in 1993, but needed direction.<P>The Into the Future plan is a study of these assets and challenges, designed to push the zoo to top capability. The specific goal, in order to make the zoo the best asset to the region and to the greater zoological community, is to be recognized as one of the top 10 zoos in the country.<P>It won't be easy. Pittsburgh is, of course, at the mercy of the weather. The terrain is rough and hilly for some. The zoo traditionally has had no focal animal to research or exhibit, something the board identified as a mark of a top zoo. Some of its facilities are outdated, like the AquaZoo. <P>But these are seen as opportunities for improvement, not downers. Some of their challenges - such as the youth of their marketing and educational programs - have already provided those opportunities. <P>"This is not a bookshelf plan," emphasizes Baker. "We live with this document day to day, and refer to it whenever we make a decision. Every so often, the staff sits down, takes a page, and tries to come up with a way to make it happen. I think we're well on our way."<P><P>The Present Zoo<P>Baker and Vernallis did some benchmarking of the Pittsburgh Zoo while traveling around the country researching. Baker says they'd already  succeeded in putting the zoo in the top 20, maybe top 15 facilities in the country. Cracking the top 10 won't be easy.<P>"You pretty much have to knock someone else off the list to be considered top 10, but we believe where we'restarting from is a pretty good platform," says Vernallis. The plan lists some of the zoo's assets: its sound financial base due to the RAD, great new educational facilities and the best children's zoo in the country (on completion), already high attendance (the zoo is currently second in attendance only to the Pirates). Vernallis, and everyone connected with the zoo, whether board member or staff, would list another asset near the top of that list: Baker.<P>"Much of the success we've had can be credited to Barbara, as well as the board," says Luffy. "She's assembled an excellent staff."<P>"I can't see the zoo ever going backwards with Dr. Baker," agrees Markowitz. "She's allowed us to do crazy things. What would most people say if you came to them and said, 'We've got this great idea. It's about a clam?' "<P>"Dr. Baker is a dynamo, with great zoological knowledge and sound business sense," agrees Philadelphia's Hodgkins. "They take their conservation and educational roles seriously, and business too. To meet our lofty goals, we need to stay in business. They're doing all the right things."<P>Baker herself credits the foresight of the board, and the community.<P>"It's been so exciting," she says. "Within two months of privatizing, everyone was calling to see how they could help. We had sponsors calling us."<P>Vernallis says, "Vibrant organizations have an ability to attract people and to accomplish. The zoo is in that phase. There's lots to keep the momentum for a long time."<P>Their motivations may vary; some want to see a pearl for the region, some work for the love of animals or the excitement of their job. All, however, are committed to the zoo with a passion, and all have the ability to work as a team with a precision that almost seems flawless.<P>"Look at the results," says Luffy. "We've got great new projects, a great educational complex already built, we'recertainly known better now than four years ago. Now the zoo is someplace the community is proud of and will go to on a regular basis. There's a lack of restrictions; the staff makes the future of the zoo limitless. I think it will be a top 5 zoo. It will be a real treasure to the Pittsburgh region."<P>"We had to find ways to get people back through those gates again, to pique people's interest in what's happening," says Pittsburgh Zoo Marketing Director Saul Markowitz. His method? Take a shoestring budget and mix marketing, public relations and advertising whenever possible by generating stories with unique advertising.<P>Anyone who was around during "The Clam Campaign" of spring 1994 will surely remember it - the fast-paced, colorful ads bursting onto the screen with wild animal sounds punctuated by periods of quiet blurping noises and a deep-voiced narrator: "Have you seen the Quahog Clam?"<P>"The idea was," says Markowitz, "it got people talking. It was the first time that the zoo had really done anything that was really different." <P>The marketing department since has generated much-needed membership and attendance, and sponsors as well - over $1.1 million in sponsorship support in 1995, including advertising time, and cash donations of over $260,000. Baker points out that privatization was one of the best things to happen for the zoo in the arena of sponsorship.<P>"Some people are leery to give to government-run facilities," Baker says. "They're more comfortable with corporate entities - that the place will be around and not run by politics, that the money will go to what it's supposed to and be used efficiently, and that they will be well recognized and treated."<P>"We couldn't do without sponsors," adds Markowitz. On the zoo bandwagon are companies like AT&T and the Body Shop, sponsors for last winter's ZooLights festival, WTAE, which has produced TV spots for the zoo and sold countless hours of airtime toyet more sponsors, and the Grand Olds Gang, which has been on board since 1994 and recently  donated a $25,000 Zoomobile for educational outreach.<P>Hank Anderson Sr., president of the Grand Olds Gang, couldn't be happier about their relationship with the zoo. He says they'd been looking for a new project to get involved with in the community, and when WTAE proposed the zoo, "It was a no-brainer." <P>"They made a very good impression the first time they walked in the door," he remembers. "I haven't met one person there yet who's not friendly, helpful and capable ... that's very rare these days. They're on the right track, and they're the kind of exciting people we want to be associated with."<P>The relationship has been so productive that the Grand Olds Gang just recommitted for three more years. As far as Anderson is concerned, the zoo improves the community, and the stronger the community, the better for his, and everyone's, business.<P>

<P>

Good EVE-ning racing fans!<P>The booming, baritone voice of track announcer Roger Huston rumbles around the clubhouse and grandstand of Ladbroke at the Meadows, the harness racing track located about 15 miles south of Pittsburgh in North Strabane Township, Washington County.<P>The effect is like listening to a foreign film dubbed in Sensurround: Huston's voice rolls over the on-track loud speakers as it's going out on the airwaves via satellite and then back again to dozens of track television monitors that are tuned into the Meadows Racing Network.<P>The reverberations are most intense in areas still filling with people arriving for the live racing card. It's worst in the grandstand, where three-quarters of the 4,500 bleacher seats are empty. <P>But the competing cadences aren't as jarring in the spots already jumping. There's the simulcast areas in the grandstand and lower level, where as many people watch the races on track TV monitors as those who watch live out the windows.  Here Huston's cadences blend into a cacophony of chitchat, bettors' chalktalk and clinking glassware to produce a loud but ignorable dull roar. <P>On an average night, the on-track crowd will number some 1,300, who collectively wager some $92,000 on the live harness races, and spend an average of four bucks each for food and beverages. A nice night for a Pittsburgh area restaurant and nightspot, but hardly the stuff of big business, right?<P>Wrong.<P>The lost-in-time, state-fair atmosphere of horses circling the Meadows' five-eighths-mile limestone track is deceptive. These days, racing at the Meadows is very big business indeed. Certainly bigger than in horse racing's heyday in the 1960s, when the sport was the only legal gambling outside of Vegas. Sure, the crowds at the little track founded by Hall of Fame horseman Del Miller were bigger then.<P>But the action wasn't.<P>    Today,  the Meadows is the hub of the American activities of United Kingdom-based Ladbroke Group PLC, a huge multicontinent conglomerate operating one of the largest racing and gaming companies in the world. In 1994, total operating profit for Ladbroke Group, which also operates Hilton International, was about 315.1 million pounds. That is $491.5 million in U.S. dollars.<P>    More locally, the little track nestled between Route 19 and Interstate 79 is the crown jewel of Ladbroke Racing Pennsylvania. LRP, headquartered in a recently renovated administrative building in the track's stable area, also owns and operates five (soon-to-be six) off-track betting parlors and a burgeoning home-telephone wagering network.<P>But that doesn't mean LRP is standing still.<P>"The key in this business is that every year we have to find the next button to push to make something happen here," says LRP Vice President Michael Jeannot.<P>The focus this year will be home-telephone wagering, and western Pennsylvania will benefit because of it.<P>The Meadows Racing Network carries Huston's booming voice into millions of homes and dozens of simulcast wagering sites across the United States and Canada by satellite and cable TV. Every time Huston's voice booms into a simulcast site in Florida, a track in Nevada or a home in Canada's Maritime Provinces, it is a little bit of free publicity for Washington County and for Pittsburgh. Ladbroke Racing Pennsylvania is fast getting a reputation in the racing and gaming industry as one of the most aggressive, technically up-to-date operations in the nation.<P>Residents of big racing states like New York and California are stunned when they hear that people sitting at home in Squirrel Hill can watch and bet on the races from Belmont Park and Santa Anita, something few of them can do themselves.<P>Ladbroke at The Meadows also will be taking on a higher profile nationally as phone-wagering hub of the new American Championship Harness Series. Plans for the series call for 30 one-hour nationwide telecasts of about 100 races from the United States' top tracks with at-home wagering for the TV viewer through the Meadows. The first telecast is set for July 13 on ESPN2. <P>Together, telephone, off-track and simulcasting are referred to in the U.S. racing business as convenience wagering - a way for racing to take its game to fans who no longer go, or never have gone - to the track.<P>Home betting can be as simple as picking up the telephone to wager off entries in a program or newspaper, using money stashed in a track account. Or, in a couple places outside Pennsylvania, it can be as complex as watching the races on TV while wagering via an interactive remote control. OTBs range from the countertop-only storefronts of New York City to the posh restaurant/sports bar/lounges favored by Ladbroke.<P>Simulcast sites are any place - race tracks, theaters, OTBs - that display the  video simulcasts of live racing from other locales, and accept wagers.<P>Ladbroke Pennsylvania<P>In terms of growth, Ladbroke Racing Pennsylvania is the star of Ladbroke Racing Corp., the U.S. umbrella company. Though headquartered in the Holiday Drive business park in Greentree, Ladbroke Racing Corp., is quite far-flung. It includes  thoroughbred tracks Detroit Race Course and Golden Gate Fields, a card club in San Pablo, Calif., and recently closed Valley Greyhound, a dog track the company is trying to turn over to locals in Texas.<P>The U.S. corporation is a relatively new venture for Ladbroke Group's gaming division, which is best known for the dozens of betting shops and gambling casinos it operates across the United Kingdom, Ireland and Belgium. The firm bought its first American racing properties in the mid-1980s, just in time to take advantage of the proliferation of laws legalizing off-track and simulcast wagering. It purchased the Meadows from Ed Ryan of Ryan Homes and Joe Hardy of 84 Lumber six years ago.<P>In terms of Ladbroke's influence on the region, consider these numbers: In 1995, total handle - or money bet into or through LRP - was more than $314.5 million. That represented more than 7 percent growth over 1994 total handle of $293.5 million. <P>That increase was due primarily to even bigger growth in Call-A-Bet, Ladbroke's name for the telephone wagering system it operates for both live races and imported simulcast signals. Call-A-Bet handle increased from $18.4 million in 1994 to nearly $23 million in 1995 - more than 24 percent - after live programming from the Meadows was expanded to a 12-hour, seven-day-a-week program, including race simulcasts from tracks across the United States.<P>LRP also had substantial revenue growth selling the simulcast signal of its races to other tracks and betting outlets. "Our signal sales totaled $74 million last year, and that was literally $10 million three years ago," Jeannot says. "That's huge."<P>Additional, perhaps even more spectacular growth is likely in 1996. New regulations allow LRP to accept  out-of-state telephone wagers, and LRP's executives have vowed to go after that huge untapped audience of stay-at-home gamblers in a big way. They'll feed the Meadows show to more cable networks and into more homes, perhaps by direct satellite delivery, for more hours a day. A new website on the Internet also will play a major role.<P>"It was easy a year ago to say, 'Well, if people wanted to bet they'd go to OTB. They'd find a way,' " Jeannot says. "But that's not the case. It's distribution, distribution, distribution."<P>Ladbroke Pennsylvania also recently got site approval for the sixth and final OTB parlor it is allowed by state law. The 20,000-square-foot facility planned for a former supermarket in Century Square Plaza, West Mifflin, would be the largest of the chain, which also includes sites in Moon and Harmar townships, Greensburg, New Castle and Johnstown.<P>New Castle, the first and, by total handle, most successful OTB, also is in line for expansion. In addition to adding some jobs, expansion means more tax dollars for Pennsylvania, which gets an average of 2.2 percent of every wager made at the state's tracks. <P>"We paid over $690,000 in state pari-mutuel taxes last year," says Anthony Mediate, director of marketing and communications for Pennsylvania.<P>Local municipalities cannot tax pari-mutuel wagers (the school district around Pocono Downs harness track in eastern Pennsylvania recently tried, but the courts said no). Still, there are many other ways to get in on the action.<P>"We pay mercantile tax, occupational privilege tax, real estate tax, school tax and business privilege taxes," Mediate says.<P>"We pay occupational and real estate taxes to Washington County for Ladbroke at the Meadows and these 40 people up here [staff of LRP].  And for the OTBs, we pay mercantile, occupational, real estate, school and business privilege tax in other counties."<P>Randy Edmonds, general manager of the Meadows, guesses that the track is the second or third largest employer in the county. <P>If you look at the figures the way Pennsylvania's tracks did during the massive lobbying effort to legalize OTB a few years ago, he's probably right.<P>At the height of the racing season, which runs late spring through early fall, the Meadows employs 500 people. Another 500 people work independently in the stable area as trainers, drivers and grooms.<P>An additional 100 people or so provide ancillary services: veterinary care, shoeing, feed, equipment and so on. Add all those together and you get 1,100 people dependent on the Meadows for a living. <P>That puts Ladbroke among the region's top 25 employers.<P>"Ninety to 95 percent of the people working for us live within 15 miles of where they work," Mediate says. "So wherever we have an operation, our employees, directly or indirectly, are impacting those communities. It's the churn effect. It's going through and churning that economy."<P>But the biggest impact on Washington County and greater Pittsburgh may be in the realm of public relations generated every time Huston's voice is heard in another part of North America.<P>The only fly in the ointment could be legalization of riverboat gambling, the most recent rage among states hungry for new revenue and gamblers looking for more action. The incursion of riverboats has meant trouble to competing racetracks in other states.<P>Though casinos and gaming companies have been lobbying hard for riverboat legalization in Pennsylvania, there's been a dramatic slowdown in casino expansion the last couple years. Here in Pennsylvania, the movement has been slowed by opposition in Harrisburg (see Eye on Harrisburg, page 9).<P>But if it does get approved, Ladbroke is confident it could survive the challenge. Thanks in large part to intense lobbying by Ladbroke, the pending bills grant racetracks a riverboat license if riverboat gambling becomes legal in their market. So if one of those bills passes, Ladbroke will expand further.<P>"We're a major Pittsburgh-area employer, a major gaming company, and we've done a good job of telling the state that. If it comes in, we want the legislature to look at us first. And I think we're on favorable ground," says John Swiatek, who oversees government relations as vice president, operations of Ladbroke Racing Corp.<P>"We can utilize it to benefit our existing businesses, to bounce people to and from the riverboat operations to the off-track betting facilities to the racetracks, maybe put an off-track betting facility on a riverboat operation. We think that's what we need to have occur if riverboats do come to Pennsylvania."<P>Ladbroke has gone beyond the "what-if" stage: Swiatek confirmed the company has optioned land it could use for docking. Though he declined to reveal its location, it is believed to be near Three Rivers Stadium on the North Side.<P>"We've done that more defensively," he says. "We feel in order to protect and grow our business we have to have land and be prepared to go forward."<P>If it does, Huston's resonating voice and the rest of Ladbroke racing no doubt will go along.<P>

<P>
Patty Kelly doesn't step foot inside a bank. That's why she is a typical banking customer, banking instead at automatic teller machines or by phone.<P>Anything but a trip inside.<P>"With an ATM, I don't have to go inside the bank to do my banking," says Kelly, 33, a Mellon Bank customer. "And I can use it off-hours and on the weekends. Telephone banking enables me to check the status of my accounts whenever I want, any time of day or night."<P>Banks know that. So financial institutions large and small are offering up a  host of traditional and nontraditional services as part of a common strategy to best deliver the widest array of services - or convenience - to consumers like Kelly.<P>Consider the activity at some the region's banks:<P>	Mellon, which was one of the first banks in western Pennsylvania to employ ATM technology, currently offers videoconferences so customers at suburban branch offices can talk to financial counselors in downtown Pittsburgh. It also offers telephone banking.<P>	The other regional giant, PNC, is launching on-line banking and is heavily into telephone banking.<P>	Smaller banks like First        National Bank of Herminie and First Western have branches inside retail stores.<P>"Convenience has always been driven by the customer, but with the rapid pace of new technology, banks today can now offer many services that will make them even more convenient," says Fritz Elmendorf, vice president of the Consumer Bankers Association.<P><P>The Giants<P>It's not surprising that convenience has become all-important in banking. With an increasing number of single-parent and two-earner households, time is tight.<P><P><P>This new age of banking started with automatic teller machines, which allowed customers to deposit and withdraw funds when the bank was closed, or at a location where there was no available branch office. <P>Mellon was an early player in ATM banking and 15 years later has one of the largest ATM networks in the region, serving one of the largest customer bases with over $41 billion in balance sheet assets.<P>"New technology has enabled banks to offer a whole host of options to the customer, in addition to services offered through ATMs, but it remains the bank's responsibility to determine what services are best for its customers," says Paul Beideman, vice president of Retail Financial Services for Mellon Bank.<P>Mellon's interactive video conferencing lets customers connect from any branch or store office to investment experts or a mortgage banking official at another Mellon location.<P>Interactive video also allows Mellon customers to interact with Mellon's planned Financial Centers - libraries offering financial information and access to personal financial investors and business bankers.<P>"These Financial Centers will be strategically located throughout the Mellon system and will also offer walk-in services to customers who wish to take advantage of this type of service," says Beideman. "Inter-active video allows customers to interface with experts from their location, bringing this service to the customer rather than the customer having to make a trip to another location," says Beideman.<P>     Mellon also has Direct 24, full-service bank-by-phone capabilities, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Using their phone, Mellon customers can establish loans, open new accounts, transfer money between various accounts or seek additional information about other Mellon products.<P>At PNC Bank, similar strategies are progressing just as quickly. One current focus is the Spring launch of on-line banking through which customers will be able to bank from their home computer with software such as Quicken or Microsoft Money.<P>"PNC strongly believes in Internet technology as a vehicle in which to conduct business, and we wanted to give our customers the flexibility to choose their own software," says Judith E. Campbell, a PNC senior vice president. With a few keystrokes from home, PNC PC bankers will easily be able to apply for loans, buy mutual funds and deposit money into CDs and checking and savings accounts.<P>With the formation of the PC banking, PNC is taking their customers' view that convenience is no longer location, but rather time-driven. PNC managers also feel that their investments in many other nontraditional services, such as their downtown telephone banking center, puts them ahead of the competition, at least for now.<P>PNC offers technology services such as telephone banking and telephone bill-paying services; the latter allows the customer to designate merchants to whom the bank may automatically pay bills from the customer's checking account. PNC is also developing a technology that will create a "smart card" for use in all types of customer purchases.<P>For this type of transaction, funds are transferred from the customer's checking account to the smart card for payment of items ranging from airline tickets to chewing gum.<P><P>Tweaking Traditional<P>Not all convenience-oriented measures are high tech. Some are no tech.<P>Mellon's Beideman, for one, touts the overall importance of technology-based services, but in the same breath points out that a balance must be achieved. You can be just as convenient to some customers by simply staying open a little longer.<P>"Institutions must consider the advantages of traditional services such as extended hours of operation and location of branch offices, as well as those consisting of nontraditional technology-based services."<P>Mellon and Integra - being acquired this spring by National City Bank of Cleveland - have long had presences in retail stores, a relatively inexpensive strategy that community banks also have employed.<P>Locally, Mellon started this trend several years ago with the opening of a new branch inside a Giant Eagle supermarket. "Retail stores appeal to customers who don't want to make a special trip to do their banking," says Mellon's Beideman. "Customers can go into a Giant Eagle to do their grocery or other shopping, and stop by the bank to open an account or perform another service. It also affords the supermarket an opportunity to get the Mellon customer's attention who may come into the store to predominantly perform banking services. Any way you look at it, it's a win-win situation."<P>Maria Brady, marketing officer for First National Bank of Herminie, agrees. "Supermarket banking builds upon the principle of the multiple sale, and it increases impulse buying."<P>Two years ago, First National of Herminie opened a retail store in the locally owned Davis grocery store in Greensburg. Like its larger counterparts, First National's retail store branch offers full-service banking, such as the bank's ability to make a car loan or provide home equity financing.<P>Brady suggests that the approach banks take to retail store banking is a little different than its traditional "brick and mortar" counterparts.<P>"In a retail setting, banks can be proactive. That is, they can go out into the aisles of the store, or use the PA system to greet people and tell them what the bank has to offer," says Brady.<P>One reason the smaller banks can open retail store branches is that they are less costly for the bank to open and maintain than traditional branch offices, which usually require several million dollars in investment capital. Retail store branches, in comparison, can be opened for about a quarter of a million dollars. <P>First National has also partnered with Redstone Highlands, a long-term nursing care and residential living community in Greensburg, to offer branch service banking on Redstone's campus.<P>"This venture provides a community service to Redstone's older adults, who want the convenience of face-to-face banking without the inconvenience of having to drive off-campus to the bank," says Brady.<P>"The establishment of First National's branch on our campus has enabled us to use our resources to take better care of our residents - and it's enabled our residents to better manage their care by providing a facility on campus for their banking needs," adds Ron Barrett, president of Redstone Highlands.<P>Other banks are expanding into the retail and nursing home environments or making plans to do so. First Western Bancorp, which has offices in western Pennsylvania and Ohio, recently opened a full-service retail store in New Castle at a Wal-Mart Superstore. PNC Bank is also seriously considering retail store service for its customers and has plans for an opening possibly by the end of 1996. <P>Mellon not only has 66 retail stores throughout Pennsylvania and New Jersey, but operates an office in the South Hills at Friendship Village, a long-term care facility and retirement community.<P>Another small bank, Pittsburgh Home Savings, opened a supermarket-based branch inside a Shop N' Save grocery store, says J. Ardie Dillen, president, Pittsburgh Home Savings Bank. Dillen sees this as a way to pull in $6 million in deposits and make $6 million from loans over the next few years.<P>"There is a real challenge for community banks the size of Pittsburgh Home Savings to compete with the technological services that the larger banks offer," says Dillen.<P>The retention of traditional banking while moving high tech shows there still are those who want banking to have a personal touch, according to Steven R. Sant, vice president for retail banking for First Western.<P> "We still feel that our customers want that element of face-to-face banking. The difference is that the tradition of the branch office has created a more retail-oriented approach to banking," says Sant. And in fact, First Western calls these new branches, like the one in Wal-Mart, "retail stores."<P>"We believe that in addition to the retail store environment, First Western must offer its customers services that meet their needs," added Sant. "That is why we've added a 24-hour customer service line and a 'loan by phone' line, both of which offer added convenience to our customers."  <P>In addition, First Western is considering PC banking and telephone bill-paying technology as possible offerings to their customers. "Even though we're considering new technology, our feeling is that our customers still want to know the person they're dealing with  at the bank one-on-one." <P>Subtle Technology<P>Some of the convenience-oriented technology doesn't even require consumer participation. Last year, First National Bank of Herminie began to offer its customers "image processing."  This service, which relies on optical technology, gives a copy of customers' checks in sequential order rather than sending cancelled checks with the monthly statement.<P>"This service saves time for our customers in two ways," says Brady. "First it eliminates the need for customers to place checks in numerical order before balancing a checkbook, and secondly, it gives customers the ability to call in and check on the status of individual checks, because we now have a permanent record of the customer's checking account." Before image processing, First National would typically have to go through microfilm files to find the check in question.<P>First National's main objective, with all of the services it offers, is  to increase its loan base. They therefore try to offer services that appeal to people in the 25 to 45 age group, those most likely to take out significant loans.<P>Banks all over the country are using various methods to sell their products and compete for customers. According to Fritz Elmendorf at the Consumer Bankers Association, "It's important not only for banks to compete with the widest array of technical services, but important to offer price considerations in the form of lower service charges and fees as well." <P>The CBA cautions, however, that those institutions that don't offer a balance of both traditional and non-traditional services invite disaster.<P>"Nationally, we're seeing a trend away from the traditional branch-based service toward the nontraditional technology-based services," say Elmendorf. "As much as 40 percent of bank customers don't want to have to go inside their bank to perform transactions, and that figure will probably continue to climb."<P>Says Patty Kelly, the Mellon customer: "I like the availability of service I have at my fingertips. It gives me the option to change the way in which I do my banking if I find it's more convenient."<P>Or to change banks, for that matter.<P>

<B><font size =+>Many Firms Like the Lower Rent<br> and Better Parking That's Just Outside<br>Pittsburgh's Central Business District</font></b><br>

<i>By Jim Urban</i></center>
<hr>


<P>
Thomas McKinney's problem was elevators. With ICF Kaiser International employees rotating from team to team for different projects, the employees spent a lot of time at his firm's offices in downtown Pittsburgh riding up and down. <P>The solution for McKinney, group senior vice president for ICF Kaiser, lay across the Monongahela River at Gateway View Plaza. The engineering, construction and consulting services firm will relocate in July, moving its Pittsburgh operation that includes 250 employees from four floors of Four Gateway Center to the new site on West Carson Street.<P>"We've signed a lease to rent 75,000 square feet on one floor in the new facility, which will offer a larger work environment that is more versatile than our current space on four floors," McKinney says.<P>"Our new space will offer great flexibility with respect to space planning and future growth. It also will accommodate more conference and proposal rooms, video conferencing, updated networking, cafeteria and workout center, nearly unlimited <P>storage space and free parking for employees," says McKinney.<P>That's a fairly lengthy list of reasons to move. And ICF Kaiser is not the only company settling in Pittsburgh's fringe real estate markets.<P>The downtown office market remained tight in recent months, so some firms have been content to set up offices on the North Side, Southside or in the Strip District. For one, locating just outside the central business district tends to be cheaper, as much as $3.50 less per square foot for Class A space. <P>"Cost is always a factor in this," says McKinney. "We will see a cost savings in moving out of the central business district. We needed to look for something that is more cost-effective."<P>"There's no question that the fringe areas are considerably lower [in price]," adds Duke Kingsley, executive vice president of real estate firm Grubb & Ellis/Axiom. "And the concessions will benefit the tenant."<P>Space availability also plays into the mix. For instance, the large amount of space at Gateway View Plaza was simply not available for ICF Kaiser downtown. In fact, it has been virtually impossible in recent months for any company to find contiguous blocks of Class A space over 20,000 square feet in the central business district.<P>So they look elsewhere.<P><P>The Fringe Markets<P>It's hopping outside the central business district.<P>Integra Financial, currently set to be acquired by Cleveland-based National City Bank, was an early mover across the rivers. In 1993, it relocated mortgage and data processing operations at space formerly occupied by Sears at Allegheny Center.<P>Last summer, telecommunications giant AT&T consolidated part of its regional operation in 64,000 square feet of space at Station Square's Commerce Court. Wesco, an electrical equipment supplier that spun out of Westinghouse Electric Corp., took 53,500 square feet at the same location.<P>"We've definitely seen an increase in absorption rates for these fringe markets," says Jeffrey Ackerman, vice president of Arnheim & Neely Inc. "This is attractive space for engineering firms or companies that needed space to house back-office operations. It is a very attractive alternative."<P>So much so that at presstime, several credit card companies were looking at the city's fringe markets as a possible location for phone centers, according to Ackerman.<P>The average cost for Class A space in the fringe markets was slightly over $18 per square foot, compared to $21 to $22 in the central business district. Spread that per-foot savings over 30,000 square feet and it adds up.<P>That's primarily why fringe market growth becomes more obvious every day. On the North Side, for instance, the influx of office workers mixes nicely with tourists visiting attractions such as the Warhol Museum and Carnegie Science Center, making sidewalks much more crowded than a decade ago.<P>"It's improving," says Glen Schultz, an architect with Williams Trebilcock  Whitehead, a firm that's been on the North Side since 1959 and in its current space - a nicely renovated turn-of-the-century warehouse just off the Ninth Street Bridge - for 12 years.<P>"With the Warhol Museum, the SMS [Engineering] building and others, there are a lot of people around during the day," Schultz says. "It's a pretty active community. That's really the sense, it's a community."<P>The five-story, $6 million SMS Engineering facility sits across the street from the Warhol Museum near the Seventh Street Bridge, right next to where Alcoa has proposed building its $20 million world headquarters. The new Alcoa building, to be located on a 2-acre riverfront site between the Seventh Street and Ninth Street bridges, will house about 550 headquarters employees. Another 250 Alcoa workers located at Two Allegheny Center, also on the North Side, are staying at that facility. <P>An added plus for the North Side will be $6.5 million in infrastructure improvements the city promised in conjunction with the Alcoa project.<P><P>Back Downtown   <P>There are those who simply cannot leave the central business district, such as the corporate law firms in the city. But that doesn't mean these firms are without flexibility.<P>Even businesses as image-conscious as law firms can consolidate critical, high-profile operations in Class A space while putting some back office operations in less plush, less expensive offices.<P>Buchanan Ingersoll, for instance, realized significant cost savings despite its move to upscale One Oxford Centre. About 320 attorneys, legal secretaries, legal assistants and support staff work at One Oxford, but another 60 back-office personnel work out of offices at 441 Smithfield Street.<P>"In fact," Managing Partner William Newlin says, "on a per-lawyer and cumulative basis, we will pay less rent during the next five years than we have the previous five years."<P>Grubb & Ellis, in its annual forecast on the regional real estate market, predicts new development of Class A space downtown sometime before the end of the year.<P>Last year's major deal, in which Lazarus vacated its store and planned construction of a new facility on Wood Street, tightened an already tight market. Blue Cross is taking most of the Lazarus space, and some office space is being lost at the new Lazarus site.<P>Kingsley says the financing industry is more amenable to funding a project for new Class A space since the market is so tight. And it doesn't hurt that the city is willing to offer incentives for development.<P>One thing is for sure: As the market remains tight, rental rates will slowly climb and concessions will be a thing of the past<P>

<B><P align=center><font size=+2>Regulation
</font><BR>
<font size=+1> Should We Believe Clinton's Promise<br> of a Kindler, Gentler OSHA 
</font><BR>
<i> By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</i></b>

<P>
<hr>

The people sitting around the hearing room in the Dirksen Senate Office Building liked the sound of the words coming from Joe Dear's mouth. They hoped these words were coming from Dear's heart.<P>Dear, the assistant U.S. secretary of labor and head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, was telling how the days of over-regulation by OSHA inspectors were long gone. He held up the standard OSHA poster that - by law - must hang in every workplace.<P>"Before, there was a $400 fine if you didn't have this poster hanging," Dear told a group of small business owners from Pennsylvania, who traveled by bus to Washington, D.C.<P>"In one year, we fined 5,000 businesses for not having this poster hanging," Dear told the group. "Not any more. If you don't have it hanging, we just hand you the poster and say, 'Please hang this up.' "<P>Dear's comments are a good sign, considering the chances for significant OSHA reform are growing slimmer; it appears there will not be enough votes in the House of Representatives to override a promised presidential veto. <P>In this election year, the Clinton administration is coddling the labor unions, so the president will stand hard against any reform the unions don't bless. And the unions don't bless much.<P>Milder reform may squeak through, but that would leave it to Dear and OSHA operatives to effectuate any significant changes in an agency that has long been an albatross for businesses large and small.<P>The only reform the White House will support beyond codification of OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program is Dear's plan to provide a defense for employers when trained employees deliberately disobey safety regulations. <P>"I'll meet you halfway," Dear told the small business owners, there in March as part of a lobbying effort organized by SMC/Pennsylvania Small Business. "I don't think we can go after the employee who is trained and properly equipped with safety equipment, yet disobeys safety regulations. What we can do is allow that to be an affirmative defense for the employer if the employer can prove it."<P>Businesses big and small rightfully argue that OSHA's role in the American workplace should be diminished. Today's workplace is much safer than in the past.<P>In a way, it seems the Clinton administration is pushing OSHA in much the same direction Gov. Tom Ridge is pushing the state's environmental regulators. Ridge wants environmental regulators to help employers comply, as opposed to pouncing on them when they don't. Ridge even dumped the old Department of Environmental Resources and replaced it with the Department of Environmental Protection.<P>The problem is this: Some die-hard environmental regulators still practice like they are working for the old DER. They  pounce.<P>We can probably expect the same  at the federal level, from some old-time OSHA regulators. Some will still inspect like they're getting paid a commission on the amount of fines levied against a company.<P>Joe Dear will tell us otherwise, and only years later will we know what truly transpired.<P>As Dear spoke in Washington that day, sitting about 10 yards away was U.S. Sen. Conrad Burn, a good ol' boy Republican from Montana who tells it like it is. Burn turned up his hearing aid so he wouldn't miss anything Dear was saying.<P>Burn's take: "They sure say the damnedest things in an election year, don't they?"<P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+2>Tommy Fell Asleep<BR>But the Rest of Us Must Listen Closely When<BR>Entrepreneurial Opportunities Present Themselves</FONT SIZE>
<font size=+1></font><BR>

<hr>


Tommy fell asleep. Because he is 4 and the meal was taking longer than usual, everyone accepted his lackluster response to the dinner conversation. If the chocolate ice cream didn't arouse him, exploring the creation of a burgeoning new industry certainly wasn't likely to waken the child.<P>The discussion that Tom missed was about the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative, a comprehensive strategy to turn tissue growth into business opportunities. Dwindling federal dollars are converting researchers to entrepreneurs. From their fledgling operations at Carnegie Mellon or Pitt  Medical Center laboratories, tissue engineers hope to "privatize" research formerly the domain of the National Institute of Health. <P>Tommy's sleepy response to all of this unfortunately reflects Pittsburgh's typical attitude toward entrepreneurial endeavors. Yawn. A few eyelids may flutter, but generally, our risk-adverse community snores rather than roars. An exception to this rule, the tissue engineering initiative has the potential to create a whole new industry. <P>The mastermind of this effort is a brilliant man whose unassuming nature obscures his intellect, Dr. Peter Johnson, a.k.a. Tommy's dad.<P>After a frustrating year of being a one-man band fueled solely by vision and conviction, Johnson is convinced that Pittsburgh can lead the charge to build a $400-billion-a-year industry. <P>A potential impetus to spur this growth, the tissue engineering initiative is Johnson's brainchild. Through the advancement and commercialization of tissue engineering and related technology, the initiative seeks to pair researchers and academicians with entrepreneurs. With this marriage of business acumen and academic prowess, the PTEI hopes to enable this region to build upon its distinctive competencies in healthcare, specifically, organ transplantation. New companies and new jobs are bound to result.<P>Motivated by the potential for personal financial gain, this type of cooperative economic development is as important as other espoused cooperative efforts. The anticipated return from consolidating the region's economic development agencies pales in comparison to the return this community could realize from the PTEI.<P>Like Tommy, most Pittsburghers fall asleep when big ideas are discussed. They miss the best part of the meal. <P>Wake up and smell the potential. Nurturing the Peter Johnsons of this area is like fanning a spark. Eventually the spark bursts into a flame that emits tremendous energy. <P>Life is too short for us to be so shortsighted.<P>

<font size=+1>If You Own a Family Business,
</font><br>
<font size=+1>Get Some Advice From Outside the Family</FONT><br>
 <i>By Joseph E.Morando
</b></i>

<HR>


Without a doubt, the single best business decision I've made in the last 30 years."<P> A new strategic alliance with a customer or supplier? A new program of international expansion? How about "C. none of the above." The business decision this real-life family business owner is referring to involves nothing new at all. He simply took advantage of a resource that has been there all along and is required by law - his board of directors.<P>Prior to restructuring, this family business board consisted of the usual suspects - family members, two employees and the corporate attorney. These were people who either were incapable of contributing anything to the business or were knowledgeable contributors to the business already.<P>Most family business boards resemble this company's former board. The structure is popular, because it is convenient and comfortable. When and if the board meets, it does not challenge the CEO/owner's decisions. <P>Without an active outside board, his company is surely missing business opportunities that could enhance its market position.<P>Most business owners I talk to object to an outside board because "nobody knows my business as well as me." This is true, but irrelevant.<P>The board is not another layer of day-to-day management. It is not there to give advice on how to make a widget better or faster. The board's role is to be involved in major decisions and strategic issues and to act as a reviewing body for management decisions.<P>Another common objection to the use of an outside board is a concern over loss of control. This concern is generally unfounded. Although the CEO reports to the board, the board in turn reports to the shareholders.  So a board cannot exert any greater control beyond the controlling shareholders. Ultimately, it is the controlling shareholders who have the final say in any decision.<P>Obviously, if the business owner is not willing to listen to the counsel of the outside board, the board may as well not exist. In the end, however, the typical family business board cannot exert final control.<P>Who should be on the board? An effective board is composed of non-self-interested, risk-taking peers. Directors of effective boards are usually successful business people who have no vested economic interest in the company. A company's specific needs should also be considered in selecting directors. For example, if overseas expansion is under consideration, the obvious choice is an executive whose company has already taken this step. <P>Other family business owners, particularly of larger businesses, often make excellent directors. In addition to the seasoned business advice they can offer, they also understand the importance of the emotional family issues which are unique to mixing family and business.<P>Putting qualified outsiders on the board will also lend critical objectivity.  It is almost impossible for an employee or company attorney to be completely objective, perhaps running the risk of offending their meal ticket.  <P>On the other hand, a qualified outside director has only one reason to be involved - he sincerely wants to help.  Thus, he is willing to look the CEO/owner in the eye and tell him exactly what he thinks. This objectivity is critical in all business matters.<P>It is extremely difficult for a business owner to be objective when evaluating his or her children. It can be gutwrenching to choose one child over another as the ultimate successor. Having a group of independent,   objective directors involved makes     the whole process less stressful for all parties and significantly increases the odds of a sound business judgment being made.<P>Who should not be on the board? Outside advisors such as accountants, attorneys, bankers, etc., who are paid for their advice. It is not necessary to have them as directors. The same is true of employees.<P>Putting in a truly legitimate outside board of directors is a major cultural change for any family business. <P>Most business owners have operated in a secretive and unexamined environment for so long that the thought of opening up to an outside board of directors is scary and uncomfortable. <P>I am not so naive to think that this article alone will make you business owners run out and set up a board. Perhaps you think a board may be beneficial when your successors are at the helm, but not while you are in charge. Most of you will stick with the comfort of the status quo. Just hope your competition does too.<P><P>Joseph E. Morando is a partner with Arthur Andersen in Pittsburgh.<P>

<H2>Everyone Should Read This Diary</H2><P>Anita Brattina tells a story that probably sounds familiar to quite a few working professionals.<P>"I had a new boss, and my job description was being dismantled a little more every day," Brattina writes in her recently released "Diary of a Small Business Owner" (Amacom, $21.95).<P>"The climate at work had really been getting worse over the last year. I felt less and less control over my department. The idea of running my own company with no bosses, no board of directors and no political gamesmanship was more alluring."<P>The rest was history, so to speak, which Brattina lays out nicely in this first-person account of her evolution: from employee to start-up business owner, and then finally to the point where her Pittsburgh firm - 11-year-old Direct Response Marketing -  eclipsed annual sales of $1 million.<P>By early spring, the book was in its third printing.<P>One reason for the demand: in each chapter, tucked amidst detailed diary entries, are "Lessons Learned." <P>A sampling:<P>l	Lesson No. 17: Rising Above the Basic Need for Money: "Somehow I had to learn that it was okay to make more money than my parents made, more than my friends, more than the sum of our monthly expenses. ... Once I set my sights on growing the business large enough to support a well-paid staff, pension and health benefits, enough money in reserves for slow times, and a paycheck I could be proud of, then the numeric goals changed. It was easier to set my sights on building a company that did $1 million, $5 million, $10 million in gross annual sales."<P>l	Lesson No. 39: Hiring the Next Person in Line: "In more than one instance, I made hasty hiring decisions because we were so understaffed. ... I seemed to hire anyone who fell into my radius within a few days of the position being created. Looking back, I realize that if I had simply forced myself to put an ad in the Sunday newspaper, I probably could have had a choice of more experienced people. But I never thought I had the luxury of time."<P>l	Lesson No. 52: Going National: "The way we got the national accounts still started locally. It was because I called on the local sales office of these national companies and did successful local projects. Then I started talking to the regional manager, national man-ager ... and so on."   <P>Who says you can't learn from  others' mistakes?<h2>More Healthcare:Cost Cuts vs. Health</H2>      <P>Most people have felt the effects of healthcare's move to managed care and the cost-cutting that has gone hand-in-hand.<P>Now this: a recent study says HMOs that steer their patients to cheaper prescription drugs are actually increasing the cost of care in the long run, because some of these people are getting sicker.<P>The study challenges the belief that cheaper medicines, such as generics or older formulations, reduce costs without degrading quality of care.<P>As restrictions on drug choices increase, "researchers found more patient visits to physicians, more emergency room visits and more hospitalizations, all of which would likely lead to an increase in medical costs,'' says the study, conducted by the Institute for Clinical Outcomes Research in Salt Lake City.<P>The message: Researchers argue that health plans must pay more attention to a patient's overall treatment program, not just to the individual components of care, like the cost of drugs. That's funny, we thought coordination was a benefit that plans promised.<P>The study was published in the American Journal of Managed Care. It covered 13,000 members of six health maintenance organizations in various areas of the country, and was paid for by the HMOs and by the National Pharmaceutical Council, which represents drug companies. The HMOs agreed to cooperate only if they could retain anonymity.<P>More than 125 million Americans belong to HMOs or other health plans that require or encourage doctors and patients to use drugs from a preferred list, called a formulary.<P>Health plans can make more money by sharply limiting their formularies to just a handful of drugs in each category, because they can demand big price discounts from the drugmakers for the right to be in the formulary.<P>The researchers say patients covered by plans with the most restrictive formularies used other medical services twice as often as patients with no such restrictions.<P>Patient advocacy groups say the study findings don't surprise them.<H2>I'm Going on Vacation ...to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania'</H2><P>This month, ER discusses the importance of tourism to the regional economy (see Resuscitating the Region on page 16). <P>And if you think Pittsburgh doesn't rate as a tourist destination, check out the following excerpts from Washington Post travel writer James Yenckel's review of Pittsburgh as a tourist destination:<P>As an avid sightseer, I'm a collector of curiosities - that is, offbeat sights (or sites) that are unique or at least very rare. So I was pleased to discover, early into a recent first-time visit, that the city of Pittsburgh is a treasure trove of the unusual. <P>In pursuit, mostly on foot, I explored its historically rich streets with increasing enthusiasm, acquiring many intriguing additions to my mental collection. <P>To name but a few: <P>l	Cinderella's glass palace, which is the impression I got anyway of the soaring PPG Building - a 40-story glass skyscraper in a modern Gothic style with fairy-tale towers, a lush inside winter garden and a regal courtyard. This is the kind of place that a princess who owes her marriage and throne to a glass slipper would build.   <P>l	The Stephen Foster Memorial, acclaimed - as a brochure puts it - as "the world's only concert hall, museum, research library and archive devoted to an American composer." Foster's cherished melodies are playing while you examine memorabilia from his short but productive life that began in Pittsburgh. <P>l	A permanent exhibit called "Eating" at the Carnegie Science Center, which overlooks the Ohio River. An informative, often humorous examination of international dining habits, it is sponsored by the H.J. Heinz Co. Foundation, an offshoot of the old Pittsburgh firm famous for its ketchup. <P>l	The Monongahela and Duquesne inclines - twin thrill rides from the past. They still do useful duty as public transportation in hoisting riders up the steep green slope of Mt. Washington for panoramic views of the city and its three great rivers - the Allegheny, the Monongahela and the Ohio. <P>Ethnically diverse, Pittsburgh is a city of close-knit neighborhoods - about 90 by one count - where many of the old customs (as well as the bakeries and cafes) still flourish. At the top of the Monongahela Incline, which was an easy walk from my downtown hotel, I stepped out onto Shiloh Street, a quiet little Mt. Washington byway that seemed decades removed from the urban bustle far below. Inside Knell's Bakery [now out of business], I treated myself to a sweet strawberry tart with definite Old European origins. <P>To add to the city's flavor, Pittsburgh enjoys an unusual variety of sophisticated cultural organizations, such as the Carnegie Museum of Art and the Pittsburgh Symphony, a well-respected, much-recorded orchestra. And the city's universities, among them the giant University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University, en-liven the sidewalks and the night life. The current hot spot on the South Side (south of the Monongahela River) is East Carson Street, a turn-of-the-century commercial strip several blocks long lined with funky shops, small bookstores, eateries and pubs.<P>I spent two days in Pittsburgh, and even by hurrying I could not take in all it offers.<h2>'... And Maybe I'll Make a Stop in Fayette County'</h2><P>As we point out in this month's Resuscitating the Region story (page 16), tourism is a recession-proof industry of which we must get our share.<P>Long before the state made its recent push with tourism, Fayette County - the rural, somewhat mountainous county that borders West Virginia - was already building tourism into its strategic plan.<P>It was a wise move, considering Fayette County is home to the Nemacolin Woodlands and Seven Springs resorts, whitewater-rafting hot spot Ohiopyle State Park and Frank Lloyd Wright's architectural masterpiece, Fallingwater.<P>What's lesser known is the county's potential to attract tourists interested in American history. For instance, there's Fort Necessity, where George Washington nearly ruined his military career by surrendering the fort during the French and Indian War. <P>There's also the National Road Heritage Park. The National Road was the first federally funded highway in the United States, and the only one entirely built by the federal government. When completed in 1852 (construction began in 1811), the road ran for over 600 miles from Cumberland , Md., to Vandalia, Ill., and was the first major artery of the great American westward expansion.<P>Fayette County's Heritage Development Plan, prepared by the Fay-Penn Economic Development Council and the Fayette Heritage Committee, projects significant opportunity to develop tour packages that will link heritage sites to lodging, camping, restaurants and other services.<P>With the tourism comes the merchandising opportunities that - combined with promotional materials - keep the visitors coming back.<h2>Creating Interest in Commercial Checking Accounts</h2><P> The Federal Reserve Act prohibits banks from paying interest on what it defines as demand deposit accounts -commonly known as free-access commercial checking accounts. The result? Companies that carry large daily balances in their checking accounts accrue no interest on that money unless they sweep the unused balance into other accounts each business day.<P>In a typical sweep arrangement, idle balances are transferred daily to money market deposit accounts, certificates of deposit, bank mutual funds, trust accounts or commercial paper. The banks charge a fee - sometimes heavy - for the service, which for years was exclusive to big business.<P>And old banking habits die hard. The easy money to be made on commercial checking accounts has kept many banks from making an aggressive move into cash sweeps despite account erosion, some executives say. In recent years, however, banks began feeling more competition from nonbanks that can offer similar services to the small and midsized companies whose yearly revenues range from $2.5 million to $25 million.<P>One suburban Pittsburgh firm, BusinessAmerica/Pittsburgh Metro East, is offering the Commercial Banking Service Link Program, which reduces or eliminates service charges while allowing the customer to accrue interest on the entire account balance, not just the unused balance.<P>"It turns what traditionally has been a cost of doing business into an income generator," says BusinessAmerica principal Rick Rohac, whose office is in Murrysville.<P>Some savvy small business owners have known they can collect interest on the checking accounts and have demanded sweep arrangements from their banks. Many others, however, mistakenly believe their commercial checking accounts are drawing interest, when in reality they're not.<P>Many banks award what are known as earnings credit - a dollar amount that appears on bank statements. To many businesses, it appears as though the dollar amount is real money. In reality, the amount can be used only to offset bank service charges. It never turns into cash for the account holder.<P>A comparison: a firm with an average daily balance of $62,000 would earn about $152 worth of earnings credit monthly, compared to $286 in interest at a rate of 5.5 percent via Service Link. That's $3,434 annually.<P>

<font size=+1>Ridge's Second Budget is Business Friendly,<BR>But Takes a Different Approach From Last Year                

</font><BR>
<i>By Jim Strader
</i>

<HR>

<P>
Tom Ridge made his budget debut with a package of tax cuts for Pennsylvania businesses amounting to more than $280 million.<P>But that was a year ago. This year,  Ridge's encore was awaited eagerly by business. <P>How would it play? Would the governor get a curtain call or the hook? Right now, it's too early to tell. <P>Ridge's latest budget proposal offers a decidedly different approach toward the business community. Gone is the big tax break, replaced with other forms of tax relief and a new look and new name on the marquee at the state commerce agency.<P>Ridge's efforts last year, much applauded by Pennsylvania businesses, also had the effect of quietly eliminating a revenue surplus, which the outgoing Casey administration says amounted to about $400 million. So in his latest budget proposal, presented for legislative and public consideration in February - with a June 30 deadline - Ridge has less to work with in the way of cash. <P>Nevertheless, the administration continues to push its business-friendly agenda in other ways.<P>Topping the list of benefits for business is a $15 million plan to offer a tax credit for job creation. The administration pushes the idea as a no-lose proposition, saying the $1,000 per job tax credit would be available only for new jobs.<P>"Taxpayers won't spend a cent unless there is a family-sustaining job to show for it," the governor says.<P>But critics say the fine print in the proposal - a minimum of 25 new jobs required before a company can claim the first $1,000 tax credit - means it is geared toward bigger operations, and would not help small businesses.<P>Democrats in the House of Representatives, itching to get back in power but still one vote shy of a majority, were quick to jump on the governor's idea, calling it a "tax incentive that isn't an incentive." They assert that the average Pennsylvania business employs 20 workers. Larger companies are downsizing, the Democrats say, while small businesses produce the most jobs and deserve attention from Ridge.<P>Ridge's budget plan contains two other direct tax cuts aimed at businesses. One initiative would reduce the capital stock and franchise tax, and the other would eliminate the computer sales tax on the manufacturing, processing, agricultural and public utility sectors of the economy. <P>And in a move to make an indirect cut in the cost of doing business, Ridge used his budget speech to call on lawmakers to reform the workers' compensation system. <P>"We can no longer pretend that our workers' compensation system is helping our workers," Ridge told the assembled House and Senate members. "Tragically, ironically, the system we designed to help injured workers is now costing healthy workers their jobs."<P>A broader move laid out in Ridge's budget plan is the reorganization of the Department of Commerce, which he wants to convert into a new agency - the Department of Economic and Community Development. The Commerce proposal characterizes Ridge's main economic goals in the coming year. Like the spending proposal, the suggested departmental realignment is subject to legislative approval.<P>The plan involves folding <P>the Department of Community Affairs - long the funnel for the "walking around money'' grants Ridge targets for extinction - into the new department.<P>The governor also proposes a new business resource center and nearly doubled state spending for job training - money for regional "skills centers" to make training and educational programs more accessible. He also proposes  creating a "business retention" team to help spot and solve problems before companies move operations out of Pennsylvania.<P>The Ridge administration started a budget sales job right away, traveling across the state and speaking to groups with a stake in the outcome. And the governor - who speaks highly of <P>competition in corporate settings -found that competition squaring <P>off in the statehouse as budget <P>deliberations began. <P>As with many business propositions, the wide range of special interests chasing limited budget dollars means Ridge's plan is sure to be evaluated as much on its merits as on its politics<P>

<P>
"You seem to have a drive-by shooting every day," a British businessman visiting  Pittsburgh commented to former county commissioner Tom Foerster last year. <P>Viewers of the evening news have perhaps noticed how frontloaded with abuse and murder it's become, compared to years ago. Through TV goggles, it really does seem that Pittsburgh has become ridden with crime and violence. <P>But while there's no denying that homicide and violent crime do exist, statistics show their levels have actually decreased in recent years. The National Institute of Justice attributes that in part to a decrease in gang activity - and in Pittsburgh, we can thank the Gang Peace Council for that. <P>It started in 1992 when a group of Muslim men, concerned with the devastating connection between drugs and gangs and the violence sweeping our neighborhoods, decided to confront the problem head on. <P>Khalid Raheem, head of that effort, knows firsthand what it's like to be caught up in gangs and the criminal justice system - and uses his background as a bridge to reach young people now enveloped in gang activity. <P>This month, they hold their annual Gang Peace Summit. Lydia Strohl talked with Raheem about Pittsburgh's gang activity, and how his group is attacking the problem.<P>Executive Report: What is the Gang Peace Council?<P>Khalid Raheem: The Gang Peace Council is a social service agency and social advocacy group dealing not only with gang- and drug-related violence but also the social causes contributing to young people participating in acts of drug- or gang-related violence. <P>ER: How did it start?<P>KR:  A group of Muslim brothers met every week and one problem that kept coming up was gang violence. Some of us having been more familiar with gang culture, some coming through the criminal justice system, we thought it was important to address it. <P>We decided to form a group that would focus on gang- and drug-related violence, working with young black kids in our neighborhoods, educating parents, professionals and people in the communities about gang violence. We started the Gang Peace Council.<P>Initially our membership was  exclusively Muslim. Now we have a very diverse membership of about 500.<P>ER: What did you do first?<P>KR: The most important thing initially was to educate the community. We held a series of Gang Awareness Seminars that I would facilitate. We would invite parents, other community leaders and activists, teachers and administrators. I would talk about the history of the gang culture in America, about gang prevention and intervention, specifically addressing certain groups. For instance, if I was talking to a group of parents, I would point out things they should be looking out for. If their child comes home wearing certain colors, if they look a certain way, have a certain disposition, if their school performance has fallen off drastically, if they're no longer interested in extra-curricular activities, but seem more prone to hang with some newfound friends that you know nothing about. I would talk about the different neighborhood rivalries that gave birth to contemporary gang culture. <P>Keep in mind, this was several years ago, so many people didn't know what it was to see a youngster wearing red flannel, blue flannel or all black, so we had to educate them. We had to teach people to read the walls - what it meant if they saw RIP, with an equal sign with somebody's name, with another equal sign with $500. That someone is not necessarily dead; that's a contract on that person's life for $500.<P>We had a tremendous response. <P>ER: What is the gang situation in Pittsburgh today?<P>KR: Not as bad as other parts of the country. Part of that is that the contemporary gang situation is not very old. We're talking about a culture that really came to the forefront in 1989. Whereas  in some of the major cities -  New York, L.A., Chicago - you're talking about a gang culture that goes back several generations and is deeply rooted.<P>There were Pittsburgh gangs in the '50s and '60s, but the gang culture today is markedly different. Then it was based on neighborhood affiliation. Violence was a fistfight. Guys probably drank an occasional beer, but there was no link between being a gang member and 'hustling,' selling drugs.  <P>The gang culture that we see now, we believe, is a direct result of the socioeconomic conditions that came to bear in the '80s. If you look at the gang migration, they really started to grow in those particular regions where you had economic deprivation. Where parents for the first time found themselves working two or three jobs. If you look at southwestern Pennsylvania, for example, once the steel industry collapsed a lot of economic hardship fell on families and communities, which made them ripe for gang penetration and drug penetration. If people were not as vulnerable, the Crips and Bloods would not have been able to move outside southern California. <P>And to make things even worse, somebody came up with crack cocaine. You can use it yourself, or sell part of it to supplement the income you're making at McDonald's, because you're not making $14 an hour working for U.S. Steel anymore.<P>You now have gangs throughout the city of Pittsburgh, North Side, East End, Greenfield, Homewood, Hazelwood and also the Mon Valley. <P>ER: Do you have any idea of the numbers that are involved?<P>KR:  No. Several hundred consider themselves to be gang members. Thousands more are affiliated with gang culture only because their neighborhood is. They wear gang colors, and are obligated in many ways to support one another. But they are not hard core 'gang bangers,' gang members.<P>ER: How did the gang culture take root in Pittsburgh?<P>KR:  It started in Homewood, as an outgrowth from some gangs that did exist, predicated on old neighborhood rivalries. About 1989, some people from Homewood came into contact with people who knew something about the gang culture, and they in turn brought that information back to Homewood and used it as an opportunity to organize younger boys to facilitate the drug business. I think they saw it as an opportunity to make some quick and fast money. Juveniles could not be prosecuted the same way as adults, so juveniles could be used.<P>Also, it gave these young adults a tremendous sense of power; they would give the teenagers gifts, advice, look out for them. These young drug dealers, future leaders of the New Jack gangs, started undermining parental authority. It opened a floodgate.<P>We have a deeply rooted gang culture here in Pittsburgh. It has not yet become a serious generational gang culture, only because it is so new. <P>ER: Obviously, one key to success is respect. How have you gained that?<P>	KR: Part of it is just being honest. Another part has to do with your willingness to listen, your willingness to connect. And last but not least, it could have something to do with who you are. I'm part of them. Based on my past, coming up through the gang culture, through the criminal justice system, I can relate. What he's going through, I've already been through.<P>ER: What does the gang provide  to these young people?<P>KR: It provides protection. It provides a sense of identity. It can provide an opportunity to make money; illegally, but nevertheless, an opportunity.<P>For some it's a boost in self-esteem, because now they can finally say they belong to something that is respected, that is revered, or that is feared.<P>We do not seek to destroy gangs. The mission of the GPC is to transform the essence of gang culture. To move gang bangers along the road to becoming just gang members, and from gang members to productive human beings. It takes a lot of work.<P> A gang banger is someone who is actively engaged in a lifestyle that is destructive to his family and community, involved with drug using, drug selling, violence, murder, robbery, disrespect of elders, seniors, children.<P>A gang member is someone who has this affiliation because of his neighborhood, because of his past, but is willing to move away from those self-destructive behaviors, look at other options, and make some commitment to change. If we hadn't taken some steps, in 10 or 15 years we'd have a generational situation, where people would grow up not knowing any options but the gang.<P>We do conflict resolution, crisis intervention. We have summits, truces. But we need permanent organizational things that people can look to: for example, businesses that are owned and operated by people from the community, former and current gang members who see owning a business as a viable option to doing robberies and selling drugs. Mentoring programs and rites of passage programs, which provide a viable option to being jumped in, or sexed in, to your neighborhood gang, or having to commit some kind of atrocity, like a drive-by or a mugging, or a burglary to be part of your neighborhood gang, so it doesn't destroy you, or somebody else.<P>ER: Replacing the organizational tenets of the gang culture must be incredibly intensive work.<P>KR: Always. It's very difficult to get kids from rival neighborhoods and gangs to sit down and talk, because they've taken each other through a process of dehumanization. Like two opposing armies who've been brainwashed to not see one another as human beings - that's the same process many gang members go through. The enemy is not a human, so you can shoot, maim, rape or fire bomb them.<P>So we have to bring young people to the table, to recognize we're all human beings, and we have a lot more in common than in difference.<P>ER: It is most often this disregard and sense of lawlessness that the media portrays of the gang member,  implying a disregard for human life in general. Is that an accurate depiction?<P>KR: No. That's a stereotype. Many times, the violent acts commited by gang members are acts of self-defense and retaliation. And often, these acts are done under the influence of drugs and alcohol. I'm not talking about violent acts connected to crimes of property, like robbery. <P>The first gangsters actually came from the Old West - Billy the Kid, the Earp brothers. The first gang to wear bandanas were the Outlaws. We have to break the stereotypes.<P>A young black male can be coming from the gym, coming from school, and because he has a hoodie on, he's tall, he's angular, people say, 'He's a gang member.' He's not a gang member, he's a child. He's on his way to doing all the things teenagers, black or white, do. <P>But it's very difficult to get the media to back off that, because America is profit-driven. If the newspaper or magazine or radio station can sell more advertising by constantly playing on how dangerous it is out there, how hiding in every corner and crevice is the boogie man, black male, Latino male, gang member, then they're going to continue to poke that. <P>I can tell you about white boys that are Crips and Bloods. I can tell you about the Irish Lynch Mob, based in Greenfield, or the Wood's Run Crips, an all-white gang on the North Side across from the penitentiary. I can take you to Hawaii and introduce you to Asian gangs. I can take you to the Native American reservation, the New Jack culture is there. The gang culture now is geared toward youth, whether they're black, brown, red, white or yellow. It even transcends gender; there are girl gang members. It's a class issue.<P>I've never seen so many people in the city of Pittsburgh homeless. I've never seen so many people standing on street corners, begging, who don't have jobs. Elderly people working in Burger King,  who need extra to make it. <P>And now we have generations of young people coming up who see this, and  think, 'Hey - you graduated from high school, you graduated from college, and you're still not making it. What are my chances?' Some of them have decided on a life of crime. It's sad.<P>ER: What do you tell that kid?<P>KR: I tell that person to make a commitment to do what is right, and not what is expedient. I tell that person that for them to do anything other than what is right is to basically emulate the very people that they criticize. <P>When I talk with young African Americans, I ask them why European people enslaved people from Africa. They say, 'The white man didn't like us,' or 'The white man didn't understand us.' And I say, well, that could very well be true, but the bottom line is that at that particular point, slavery was one of the most economically profitable businesses you could get in. So the reason white people sold black people was that they could make tremendous profit.<P>Then I switch it back to them, and say, 'When you decide to sell drugs, most of them are going to people from your own neighborhood. You're basically functioning off of the same logic that the slave master used.' You have to rise above it, make a serious commitment to change, and then  come together and change the forces that created the madness.<P>ER: The work that you do validates the gang culture. That bothers some people. What's your response?<P>KR: First of all, the gang culture is real, whether they want it to be or not. We don't validate the gang culture, but we do validate people's social reality. When I do a home visit, I'm not saying 'Check this out, home boy, it's okay for you to be a Crip.' <P>I come in and try to find out what's going on with that young man, and how we can get him away from that. But in order to get to that point I have to recognize his social reality.<P>I may be called to talk to a group of kids who are about to fight each other. We go to the school. We hold conflict resolution sessions. We get these young men, or women, or both, not to kill each other, at least not on school grounds. They've already identified themselves with the gang culture. The best we can do is intervene so they don't murder each other, so perhaps at some point we can get the transition from gang banger, to gang member, to regular human being. <P>ER: Will the proposed changes in the public schools affect your work?<P>KR: It's going to make our work a lot more difficult. I hope it's modified. If not, we're going to be bringing students together from neighborhoods with serious blood feuds. We are concerned for the safety of the young people, and school personnel. Young people can't be expected to learn if there's always a threat of imminent violence.<P>What I hope to do is to educate the educators. A young person will not listen to you if they're trying to tell you, 'Well, hey, I hurt, because my friend got his brains blown out last night, and I saw it. So I'm acting up at school today. I'm slouching, cussing in class because I hurt.' If you say, 'Go over there and sit down.' It's like 'Your pain is not real for me.' If a teacher is not willing to recognize and validate the pain, they can never steer that child in a positive direction. <P>ER: Does the business community have a role in this?<P>KR: Consider hiring young people from communities that are riddled with gang violence. Don't turn them away because they're from a certain zip code. Don't turn them away because they are black, or male, or wear their hair in a certain style. <P>Last but not least, you can support the Gang Peace Council, either with cash or with other resources.<P>

<font size = +1>Corked Off at Restaurants That Mark Wine<BR>Up Out of Sight? Try the Carlton Instead
</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl
</I></B>
<p>

<hr>
If you have a grateful heart, show it by directing the bearer to the best wine in town, and pray, let not this highest point of sacred friendship be performed slightly, but go about it with all due deliberation and care, as holy priests to sacrifice.<P>		- John Wilmot<P>Second Earl of Rochester, English poet, in a letter to diplomat <P>Henry Savile in 1673<P><P>he Carlton, in One Mellon Bank Center, the wine list is longer than the menu. About 10 times longer, in fact. And another curious thing: the prices. A bottle of Dominus Meritage  for $52.30. Frog's Leap Merlot, $31.09. Gloria Ferrer Chardonnay, $26.99. What's going on? Savvy restaurateur Kevin Joyce woke up and smelled the sediment.<P>"As restaurateurs, we're always schooled that you have to make certain numbers with the beverage," says Joyce. "But with wine, that doesn't make sense. Because that pushes people into lesser wines in a restaurant. When they're eating great food, that's when you should let them enjoy great wine."<P>So the Carlton marks up every bottle of wine just $10. Exactly. And because he makes the same profit on every bottle, his mission is to look for the best wine in taste and value, not markup-ability.<P>It's a bold move, but his customers love it. And it wasn't his first. <P>Eleven years ago, Kevin Joyce opened up the Carlton - named for the Carlton House Hotel that once stood on the corner of Forbes Avenue and Grant Street - for Levy Restaurants, a Chicago company.<P>Last summer, Joyce, who had risen to a partner in the company, traveling constantly to open new markets for Levy, decided to make a change. He was tired of traveling 37, 38, 39 weeks a year. He didn't spend enough time with his five kids. And he had lost track of his other baby, the Carlton. So he bought it.<P>And he's made a few changes. To complement the 200-wine list, he holds monthly wine dinners, featuring themes or visits from vintners, hand-picked wines and special dishes. The regular menu also changes frequently, depending on what's fresh from purveyors, such as one who sends fish direct from the Atlantic each Friday.<P>"Not everything changes every day, but it allows us to rely on seasonal food and challenges our cooks to stay active," says Joyce. <P>One night, we tried the lobster cod cake with basil beurre blanc for starters. Though thick, it was perfectly cooked, with a gentle, rich flavor. To follow, an endive salad, which was topped with a honey Dijon vinaigrette, balancing its tartness, bleu cheese and walnuts. And, in the dead of winter, ripe tomatoes.<P>Next, we chose swordfish, that night layered with crab, spinach, tomatoes, saffron cream and basil oil. The fillet was perfectly grilled, no flavor overpowered another. But in the veal portobello, the medallions sauteed in a  sundried tomato buerre blanc were tough. The Cabrillo bass was a bit bland, grilled and advertised with tangerine piccata butter - if you don't like heavy sauces, ask for it on the side. This place has a heavy lean toward butter and cream.<P>For lunch, more pastas and salads are added to the menu: The mushroom chicken salad was delicious, featuring sauteed seasonal mushrooms and grilled chicken with greens, red peppers and a sundried tomato vinaigrette. <P>The presentation and the service here are delightful, as is the rich, formal dining space. The coffee was sour, and one dessert - an apple tart - had a tasteless pudding-like base and a lardy, undercooked crust. The chocolate cappuccino torte, however, was food art. <P>A note of caution: Fridays and Saturdays are often packed, as Joyce offers free limos to cultural events. Likewise, hockey nights. Joyce admits that in the rush to put out timely food, it's not always their best product.<P>

<B><font size=+2>Sayonara</font><br><font size=+1>The Longer it Takes to Pass Workers' Comp <br>Reform, the More Business We Will Lose<br>
</font></B><i>By Henry Lipput</center></i><P>


<HR>

<P>
Rob Rost's family has been running St. Charles Refractories since the 1970s. The company itself, located 60 miles north of Pittsburgh, has been in business for over 100 years and manufactures a ceramic that is used to bottom-pour steel. <P>However, this may be the company's last year in Pennsylvania. Rost, the current plant manager for St. Charles, is considering moving the company to Maryland because of the high price of workers' compensation premiums in Pennsylvania.  <P>"We have a facility in Maryland now," says Rost. "We don't make the exact same product, but I know the cost of doing business down there. It's so much cheaper - the savings on  insurance alone would pay for almost the complete move in just five months."<P>Rost is not alone: Business owners throughout Pennsylvania sing a familiar tune when the topic of workers' compensation comes up. Like Rost, they talk about the high premiums. And they complain about  abuse of the system by workers.  <P>"I have a couple of outstanding cases now that are ringing up some serious bills. It keeps adding to our premium," Rost says.   <P> Gov. Tom Ridge is seeking reform that will lower workers' compensation costs for employers while protecting the interests of injured workers. It's an issue  through which Ridge must tread carefully. He has business on one side and the unions and the plaintiffs' attorneys on the other side of the issue.<P>"There is no greater economic development tool - there is no greater investment the commonwealth can make to retain and create jobs - than to reform workers' compensation," says Ridge. The governor's proposals, if enacted, would add to other recent workers' compensation reforms, including the Act 44 legislation passed in 1993 and last year's state-mandated 9.43 percent rate reduction.  <P>Ridge's plan emphasizes five main principles. Keys to it include a timely return to the workforce of those capable of working and the payment of benefits only to legitimately injured workers. He also wants to ensure that benefit payments are commensurate with preinjury earnings so that workers do not earn more while receiving benefits than they did on the job. Another point calls for the reduction of costs associated with litigation and administration of claims. And finally, the governor wants to guarantee that reform savings will be passed through directly to the employers who pay the premium and benefit expenses. <P>Ridge says his principles stem from employers' common complaint that under the current workers' compensation system there are too many obstacles to getting a recovered worker back on the job.<P>Workers' compensation costs are cited as one of the main reasons that businesses leave Pennsylvania and are discouraged from locating here in the first place.  <P>"The governor wants to make sure that people get just payment to replace lost wages when they're hurt, but right now there are some loose factors in the system [so] that people get more than they should," says John Currie,  spokesman for the state Department of Labor and Industry. <P>Cash pay-outs to injured workers are, by law, usually two-thirds of the employee's salary.  According to statistics from the Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania workers' compensation costs are notably higher than elsewhere in the country - including our bordering states. <P>"Workers' compensation definitely costs more in Pennsylvania, in almost all categories, than the six neighboring states," says Currie. "We still have too high medical costs, even though we're cutting them, and our cash payments are still high."<P>But Currie also had some good news: work-related injuries in Pennsylvania have decreased over the last five years, from 158,000 claims in 1990 to 130,093 in 1994. <P>"It's slowly, incrementally going down," he says.  "People are paying more attention to safety, and the     costs are getting so high, the compa-nies and employees are taking more responsibility."  <P>One recent nationwide survey found that businesses in the rest of the country have seen their workers' compensation costs flatten or even decline in the last few years due to workers' compensation cost-containment initiatives, primarily worker safety programs and case management.<P>But this information may come too late to change the fate of St. Charles Refractories. <P> "The state is definitely trying to improve," says Rost, "but I have a problem that's long-existing here, and I see I can move the whole facility down to Maryland and save this much money."  <P>Just one more business saying so long, Pennsylvania. Thanks for the memories.<P>

<B><font size=+2>Licensed to Sit</font><br><font size=+1>Would Sports Fans in Pittsburgh Pay Extra Money<br>Just for the Right to Buy a Ticket?<br>
</font></B><i>By Bill Modoono</center></i><P>


<HR>

<P>

The first reaction of the typical western Pennsylvania sports fan is the natural one: It can't happen here.<P>Oh, sure the concept of Personal Seat Licenses, or PSLs, may be a revenue-producing trend sweeping pro sports across the nation, but it would not work here. Can you imagine paying money simply for the right to buy tickets to the Steelers, Penguins or Pirates? Never happen?<P>Don't be so sure. In fact, some experts argue that if Pittsburgh fans really love their teams, then they should embrace this concept.<P>This much is certain: In sports, the cost of doing business as well as the cost of keeping up with your rivals are ever-increasing. The franchises that stay afloat - both on the field and in terms of money-making - are the ones that are most creative in terms of finding new revenue streams. The old Pittsburgh way - strict fiscal prudence - is not enough these days.<P>The money-maker of choice, in markets large and small, is the new stadium. Baseball teams want to emulate Baltimore's Camden Yards, which has become a mecca for fans in its short existence. Football teams want to emulate Dallas' Texas Stadium, with its corporate sponsorship and theme-park atmosphere, which is altering the experience of going to games.<P>Paying for the stadiums is a different matter. With state and local money tighter and taxpayers and big corporations in less generous moods, pro teams have looked elsewhere for financing. For several National Football League teams, PSLs saved the day.<P>In Charlotte, for instance, the expansion Panthers financed a facility that will open this fall primarily through PSLs. Ninety percent of its 72,500-seat capacity stadium has been bought by fans, who paid from $600 to $5,400 for lifetime rights to purchase season tickets to Panthers' games. In Oakland, the Raiders were lured back to their ancestral home by the promise of revenue generated by the sale of 11-year PSLs that range from $250 to $4,000, depending on the location of the seat.<P>In both cases, Charlotte and Oakland did not have teams, so fans understood that a willingness to purchase PSLs could help them get one. Nashville is doing the same thing to lure the Oilers out of Houston.<P> In Pittsburgh, things won't be as simple. The team most in need of a new stadium is the Pirates, but PSLs have no track record in baseball. "Really it's an untested idea in baseball," says Ethan Green, assistant editor of Team Marketing Report, and an expert on PSLs. "But there is a strong possibility it could work. It depends on the pricing. Actually, it could be more of a value for the fan, because in baseball, they're getting more games."<P>Mark Schneider, chairman of Pittsburgh's Stadium Authority, says the San Francisco Giants are attempting to finance a new stadium through PSLs, but it's too early to say if that will work. He believes the key to a new Pirates stadium lies in finding the right location and then getting strong financial backing from the state.<P>As for the Steelers, Schneider says, "No one's done a PSL in an existing stadium." But, regardless if the Pirates get a new stadium or not, the Steelers have expressed interest in making more money from Three Rivers Stadium. The team's lease expires in 1999 and, as Art Modell recently proved, NFL owners have options.<P>What the Steelers could do, Schneider says, is sell more expensive "club seating" in premium seat locations and give club members access to a private facility - much like the Igloo Club at the Civic Arena - reserved parking and other amenities. The money raised through club seats would not need to be shared with the rest of the league and could be spent on such modern necessities as free agents.<P>If the Pirates get a new stadium, and the Steelers want to reconfigure or expand Three Rivers, it is conceivable that PSLs could be used to pay for it. Green sees PSLs as the "fairest way" to do such things.<P>"I don't look at it as a tax. Really, PSLs take the tax burden off the taxpayers who have nothing to do with the sports teams. With PSLs, the fans of the teams pay to build the stadiums."<P>Actually, a plan similar to PSLs already exists in this market. Pitt, like a number of major colleges, requires scholarship fund donations from fans who want to buy the best seats to basketball and football games.<P>Would fans support pro teams beyond the simple ticket price? Who knows. Just don't say it can't happen.<P>

<B><font size=+2>The Firing Line</font><br><font size=+1>Mishandling a Legitimate Employee Termination<br>May Push the Employee to File a Lawsuit<br>
</font></B><i>By Jim Urban</center></i><P>


<HR>

<P>

When a Connecticut hospital let go of one of its social work managers a few years back, security guards met the woman at her office and escorted her to the parking lot, leading her past co-workers who stared in disbelief.<P>Her co-workers thought the way the termination was handled was unjust. So did the civil court jury that awarded the employee $105,000 for the emotional distress she suffered as a result of being paraded past friends and co-workers when she was terminated.<P>The Connecticut case is one of several in recent years in which a fired employee has pursued a lawsuit or collected damages over the manner in which he or she was fired.<P>Other examples:<P>l	In New Jersey, middle managers for a major pharmaceutical company fired a sales representative inside a diner, then followed him home and retrieved the employee's company car and drug samples. A jury awarded him $8 million in punitive damages.<P>l	In Minnesota, a fired healthcare worker sued for defamation after his supervisor made him pack his belongings in view of other employees, then escorted the employee to his car. An appeals court overturned a lower court's dismissal of the defamation count, paving the way for the defamation count to proceed to trial.<P>These cases show how fired employees can and will sue over the way they were fired. But more importantly, the cases illustrate how an employer can mishandle an otherwise legal employee termination and motivate the employee to consult an attorney. In the end, the employer may spend thousands of dollars to defend a lawsuit that might not have occurred if the termination was handled properly.<P>"In advising clients on how to terminate employees, I've always told them to do it with fairness and dignity," says attorney John E. Lyncheski, head of the labor and employment law practice at Cohen & Grigsby in Pittsburgh. "I've since added the word 'class.' <P>"If you effectuate a termination with fairness, dignity and class, you are ahead of the game," Lyncheski says.<P>Rarely, Lyncheski and other attorneys say, will an employee sue solely over the way he or she is fired. Quite often, however, it's the way the termination is carried out that motivates the employee to seek legal counsel. <P>"You have to be sensitive to how the employee is going to react, or you are going to spawn a lawsuit," says Clare Gallagher, a partner at Doepken Keevican & Weiss in Pittsburgh.<P><P>Some Common Mistakes<P>A crucial part of an employee termination is explaining the reason for the move. Lyncheski says some employers use the wrong person to handle the termination; perhaps the messenger is someone who tries to cushion the blow for the employee.<P>"The person hedges on the reason, and not communicating a clear message creates suspicion," Lyncheski says.<P>Gallagher echoes that statement.<P>"You must explain to the employee the real reason," Gallagher says. "A lot of times, in attempting to make it easier on the employee, the employer creates mistrust."<P>Another common mistake: employers overconcern themselves with security measures and in the process humiliate the employee, as the Connecticut hospital did. Make no mistake about it, employers have an absolute right to protect their property and have a duty to protect the employees who remain on the job. But at the same time, they must not overdo it.<P>"The really bad examples," Lyncheski says, "are where employers use excessive security or supervisors to escort the employee off the premises."<P>One method of avoiding litigation is to offer the employee compensation in return for the employee's waiver of his or her right to sue the employer. But courts will not enforce such arrangements that are not bargained-for exchanges. In other words, the employee who waives his or her right to sue must get, in return, something beyond that to which they already are entitled.<P>Employees also must have adequate time to review the waiver.<P>Some employers offer outplacement services as a means of helping terminated employees think about the future, instead of dwelling on what has just occurred. Outplacement firms, which assist the employee in finding a new job, usually charge a percentage of what the employee made - commonly 15 percent - if the employee was upper management. Outplacement of lower level employees usually is handled on a flat-fee basis.<P>"We reduce the risk of employee litigation," says Dale Urban, vice president in the Pittsburgh office of Right Associates, an outplacement firm. "That's a high payoff for employers. They are buying insurance against potential higher costs of litigation."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+>Kevin McClatchy Mixes the Enthusiasm of a Sports Nut With <br>a Serious Business Demeanor; He's a Good Fit for the Pirates
</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
</CENTER>
<hr>


<P>
<P>It is Saturday afternoon at the Ross Park Mall. A crowd has gathered, in the opening under the escalators, between the Limited and NRM Records, for a fashion show featuring spring wares from the mall shops. For openers, the Pirate Clubhouse models do a turn around the runway, pivoting, as models do, so the entire audience can glimpse their head-to-toe logoed regalia. <P>Then a young man gets up on stage, in a striped Roberto Clemente jersey over baggy jeans, and, slouching a little, does a runway circle. His amble turns into a bit of a scurry as his turn ends. As he nears the mike, he takes off his ballcap in recognition of the applauding audience, revealing a head of dark blonde hair that has clearly been encapsulated all day. He beams at the crowd sheepishly.<P>"I must admit," says Kevin McClatchy, the Pirates new owner, as they quiet, "that was a first for me." <P>Maybe he never did a runway show before, but even before McClatchy, 33, signed off on the Pirates deal on Feb. 14, he's been center stage. His mug has been all over the papers since last fall, when his intent to purchase the team became serious.  Pittsburgh intently watched the pursuit, with its last minute requests, stays and requirements, like die-hard fans in the last inning of a very close game. <P>McClatchy caught every fly, fielded every grounder and rounded every base. Sincere yet firm with the city and the then Pirates owners. Enthusiastic and decisive with the team assembled for the deal. Smart and convincing with potential investors. Graceful with the media. Diplomatic with Major League Baseball.<P>He scored. <P>But it wasn't easy.<P>Batter Up <P>Kevin McClatchy first came to Pittsburgh last summer after hearing from an investment banker of the opportunity to purchase the Pirates. McClatchy, then a resident of Sacramento, Calif., had taken a leave of absence from his family company, McClatchy Newspapers Inc., to further pursue a career in sports ownership. (He already owned a 45 percent interest in the Modesto A's, a minor league baseball team, and for a time pursued acquisition of the Oakland A's, but failed to secure enough dollars to complete the deal.) He came to Pittsburgh on reconnaissance, meeting initially with the mayor and other parties. <P>Nonetheless, McClatchy had thrown his hat in the ring. Then Major League Baseball rejected cable magnate John J. Rigas' bid and, very suddenly, McClatchy became a top contender. <P>"I went back to California, waiting to hear something," McClatchy remembers. "I didn't know things were going to evolve this quickly. I remember getting the call and jumping on a plane to Pittsburgh. After that it seemed like a roller coaster. We had two weeks to raise $40 million. I don't know if we were given two weeks to succeed or to fail, but we were given two weeks."<P>McClatchy pulled together a group that included attorneys from Reed Smith Shaw & McClay, financial advisors from Arthur Andersen and Charles H. Gesner, Jr., of Lehwald, Orosey & Pepe, to get the job done.<P>"It became a team process," says McClatchy. "My role was really to get out and sell the concept to investors to get them to believe in what we were doing, and that it was possible to turn around the franchise." <P>But how to convince local investors of that? He armed himself with financial projections, item-by-item changes showing a turnaround could, in fact, be achieved. <P>"You could generally get the meeting, because [the team has] been such a big part of the city. But you can only pull on people's heartstrings so long. Anybody who's been successful in business wants to know the bottom line. I was convinced it could work. The question was, could we put a substantial enough group together in what appeared to be a short window of time? I wasn't necessarily convinced we could do that."<P>He did make that deadline, partnering with local investors like Tony O'Reilly and the H.J. Heinz Co., Blade Communications and race car owner Chip Ganassi. The pressure, however, was not alleviated but turned up, it seemed: As the weeks progressed, demands from the owners, Major League Baseball and the city drew out the deal. <P>"I have done a lot of deals, but never anything quite like this," acknowledges David L. DeNinno, partner, Reed Smith Shaw & McClay. "The principal complicating element was lack of time. He had to convince the mayor and investors that he had the wherewithal and the business sophistication to pull it off, and convince the bank that he would be able to complete the transaction and operate the team successfully. And he had to deal with a somewhat difficult existing ownership, and convince Major League Baseball to let him become the youngest owner. <P>"Other than that, it was a piece of cake." <P>Mayor Tom Murphy, who had favored Rigas, admits he was not initially impressed with McClatchy. Like many, he feared that because McClatchy was from out of town, his goal was to move the team. <P>"Our first meeting was not particularly good," says Murphy. "He said very little; the people he was with spoke. Then in the fall, the Pirates gave Bart Fisher a week, then Kevin two weeks. It was a way to get rid of them. But we met every day for two weeks for lengthy periods of time. He came by himself, or occasionally with an attorney. We engaged him on complex issues, and he was prepared to make decisions. We ended up very actively working with him. <P>"Early on, it became clear that this was a life decision for him; he wanted this as his career. And if he could make it work in Pittsburgh, he wanted to."<P>Out of the Frying Pan <P>McClatchy says that from the beginning, he really believed the team should stay in Pittsburgh. In fact, that was one of the elements which initially attracted him to the team. <P>"Having looked at the A's and very briefly the Giants, I thought they had better fans here - not a large base, but the fans they had were very dedicated, which is very important when they're your customers," says McClatchy. "There's no question the Pirates should stay here. I grew up a Giants fan, and about five or six years ago, the Giants were talking about moving to St. Pete. I remember, being a fan, it felt like the worst thing, that your team that you had grown up with, was going to move. So I'm not very keen on franchises moving. When you grow up with a team, someone else might own it, but it's your team. I wouldn't want to put the people here through that. And I don't think you have to. I think you can change things."<P>And that's just what he intended. But the hoops continued to pop up. And he continued to jump through them. One challenge came from U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum, who was concerned about reports he had read in the Sacramento Bee, one of the McClatchy Newspapers, that Kevin McClatchy was involved with building a stadium in Sacramento that met minimum Major League requirements. Santorum brought the issue to the attention of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, sparking a flurry of media attention early this year. He met with McClatchy.<P>"We talked about [the situation],"says Santorum, who's now clearly McClatch-inated. "The most logical team for Sacramento would have been the A's, but there was no way they could support it. He told me all the things I needed to know."<P>McClatchy continued to rise to every challenge. Not enough capital? He secured more. A guarantee on a new ballpark? Okay. But there were less concrete hurdles, too.<P>"Kevin was an outsider," opines Murphy when asked to pinpoint McClatchy's greatest barrier. "In other places, people are not under such scrutiny, but Pittsburgh is very insular. I think it surprised him, the politics of it all. People were encouraging, then would try to cut off his legs."<P>The McClatchy camp continued their roller coaster ride. <P>"There were dark moments," says DeNinno. "A number of times we were close to the breaking point, but Kevin quickly rebounded, through sheer determination and will power." <P>Privately, however, McClatchy wasn't always so certain his bid would make it. Kevin Rios, a close friend of McClatchy's (and keeper of his dog, Bo Jackson, during the deal) says there were definite peaks and valleys. <P>"He'd call and say, 'It's over,' " says Rios, a Sacramento private investigator. "He was frustrated at times - it seemed like each time they asked for a deadline, they changed the rules."<P>But like the Energizer bunny, he kept going and going and going. Then, on Valentine's Day, all parties gave the nod. McClatchy prevailed.<P>"Kevin just refused to let his dream go," says DeNinno. <P>The Pirates were his.<P>The Sporting Life<P>So why would Kevin Soerensen McClatchy, born on Jan. 13, 1963, in Sacramento, Calif., want to put himself through all that for the opportunity to work like hell to save a flailing ball club? Odd as it sounds, it's almost as if the Buccos are McClatchy's Rome: All roads led here.<P>"He was always very athletic, interested in every sport there was - football, basketball, junior tennis, baseball," says Grace Kennan Warnecke, McClatchy's mom. <P>"I'm one of those sports junkies that, before I could read I knew people's batting averages," says McClatchy. "It's funny, because my family are all intellectuals. Sometimes I think I was hatched."<P>The youngest of three children, McClatchy lived with his mother  and his sister, Adair, after his parents were divorced in 1966. He spent weekends and summers with his father, Charles Kenny McClatchy, called C.K., editor of the Sacramento Bee. The Bee, founded by the McClatchy family in 1857, is the flagship of McClatchy Newspapers, which Fortune estimates at $600 million net worth. Now publicly held, McClatchy Newspapers, with Kevin's uncle Jim McClatchy at the helm, publishes 12 newspapers in California, Washington, Alaska and South Carolina.<P>In Sacramento, the McClatchy clan is known for their community spirit, which they are not afraid to take to the extreme, sometimes earning them the label "eccentric." They are benefactors of the arts and champions of the environment. C.K., who died in 1989, was a fiery liberal who ran the Bee with strong presence. An obituary in Time magazine credits C.K., who died jogging at the age of 62, with "infusing his papers with a competitive edge and liberal views."<P>"We spent a lot of time together. He was very intelligent, very caring," says McClatchy, who spent most of his childhood in California, except for a few years in Washington, D.C. <P>Grace, Kevin's mother, attended Radcliffe and is a former freelance photographer. Later, she was a photo editor of "A Day in the Life of the Soviet Union," and founder of the first American-Soviet Youth Symphony. Fluent in Russian, she now works with companies wishing to establish business in the former Soviet Union through her New York-based firm Sovus Business Consultants. That interest comes from her father, George Frost Kennan, a Pulitzer prize and National Book award-winning intellectual. Kennan spent 27 years in the foreign service, including posts as Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Credited with seminal ideas in U.S.-Soviet relations, Kennan is author of some 18 books on Russia, diplomacy and nuclear issues. His published personal travel accounts reveal an insightful curiosity in humanity and love of community. And it was he who set the family precedent in baseball: Interned in a German camp for six months during World War II, George Kennan encouraged baseball games among embassy personnel to keep them active and sane. <P>In 1969, McClatchy's mother married architect John Carl Warnecke, and took his name. Warnecke's work, which includes the J.F.K. Memorial in Arlington Cemetery, Logan Airport and the Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores, moved the family to Washington. It was there, in the fifth grade, that McClatchy got his first job - following in his dad's footsteps, so to speak: a paper route. <P>"I did it to get some money. My dad was very cheap, in a positive way. He didn't throw money around. He  had a [small] apartment in a place that wasn't all that great. I remember once I went home and asked my mom if we could send him some money." <P>"Kevin has an entrepreneurial streak. He didn't have to have that paper route, but he got up at 5 a.m. every day. And it wasn't easy, because it was complicated getting paid," says his mother, imparting a warm, deep laugh, which she does often in the conversation. "Kevin would get frustrated and he does have a temper, though he's become much more even-tempered." (On that subject, Mayor  Murphy credited McClatchy, saying that McClatchy kept his temper in check at times when Murphy himself would have become emotional.) <P>It was also in the fifth grade that McClatchy was diagnosed with dyslexia, which seemingly explained his inclination toward sports - dyslexia makes book learning difficult. He often says that toppling dyslexia built the determination he so publicly displayed pursuing the Pirates. It did force him to make what he calls his first step toward growing up - at 14, McClatchy went away to boarding school at Trinity Pawling High School in New York. His mother was getting a divorce from Warnecke, and thought it would be better for McClatchy to be with other kids. More importantly, TP had a special program for dyslexic students.<P>"It was my choice - in eighth grade I was reading at a sixth grade level. It was not good. Sports gave me confidence, but I was not good in school so I cut up a little bit. I was dealing with a fair amount of frustration, and I knew this was my only chance," says McClatchy. At TP, he roomed with Dan Rooney Jr., and came to Pittsburgh for the first time for Thanksgiving at Rooney's home. At the end of McClatchy's freshman year, he received an award for being "outstanding citizen." <P>"He was so proud," recalls his mother. (With the caveat: "Mothers are never the best ones to ask about their children. There's that special bond.") "Before that, he was popular, happy-go-lucky. After that, he showed real leadership. He worked with younger kids, worked with Big Brothers & Big Sisters. But Kevin always had a zillion friends. Just ask him how many weddings he's been in." (fifteen or so.)<P>"He was a quiet kid," says his uncle Jim McClatchy. "But he was always doing something."<P>The Comeback Kid <P>The Pirates aren't the first team McClatchy's brought back. As a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara, he raised money and worked with administration to re-establish their football program, discontinued since 1971 due to lack of support in the Vietnam "anti-establishment" era. <P>"He was instrumental in bringing it back, against a clear lack of support," says Steve Colvin, a fraternity brother of McClatchy's who remains a close friend. "Kevin's very easygoing and jokes around a lot. I mean, he wasn't the guy in the corner with the lampshade on his head, but he has a good sense of humor. Then he has a flip side where he can shift gears and work hard to get things done." <P>McClatchy played cornerback. "I always wanted to be an athlete when I was younger. Then reality comes in, things like speed and leaping ability - I think I knew that then," says McClatchy, who has also been through shoulder and knee surgeries. It wasn't until later that career and sports meshed - during college, McClatchy worked summer jobs like construction in Alaska. ("You could make just ridiculous amounts of money.") After school he spent the prerequisite months as a waiter in a ski resort town, then held jobs as a reporter in Bend, Ore., in sports production for WPLG in Miami and in advertising for the Miami Herald newspaper, where he started off on the phone, taking classified ads.  <P>Until, in 1989, his father died. McClatchy went back to California for a few months, to take care of family business, and ended up staying with McClatchy Newspapers. "I had no plans to do that, but I felt a responsibility," says McClatchy. "I always planned I would go there and work with him. This just moved it up. <P>"Two years before, my best friend was killed in a freak accident. He       was like my brother. That really changed my perspective - I realized things had an end. Then my father  died unexpectedly. His leadership and guidance suddenly weren't there. It was me at that point. It made me grow      up quicker. That was a bad three or four years." <P>At McClatchy Newspapers, which had gone public a month before his father died, Kevin came up through the sales department to become advertising director. In 1992, he helped found the Newspaper Network Co., which consolidates daily newspaper buys nationwide. McClatchy became national sales director, remaining in Sacramento. While the family name was well-known there, McClatchy did not have the kind of face recognition he has here, he says. But he did take on some of the family's civic tradition: McClatchy worked to complete funding and build an amphitheater in Sacramento's underprivileged Oak Park, a project his father had begun, which Kevin dedicated in his father's name. His financial responsibility was also increased, with an inheritance from his father that increased his net worth, which he confirms is currently about $20 million. <P>"I bought a house," says McClatchy, claiming it didn't really affect his lifestyle. "I eventually bought part of a minor league baseball team. And I bought really good seats for the Sacramento Kings [basketball] games."<P>His friends say he was as low profile as it comes, back in Sacramento. Recreation drove the social calendar - to the beach, local sports events, travel to Dodgers and 49ers games, and time at his family house in Lake Tahoe, where he spent summers growing up. <P>"He's a good talker," says Rios, who shared the Kings seats. "He has an awareness of the world, and he's fascinated by other people, especially in high positions. He aspires to be able to speak to people at all levels. He's not a big reader, he learns from talking."<P>"He's an upright guy, modest and decent," says Jim McClatchy, his uncle and former employer. "He doesn't profess to be a scholar, but he is interested in the world. He's got a good group of buddies, he's outgoing, he likes people, likes to have a beer, likes girls."<P>One day he made a spur of the moment call which eventually changed his career direction. <P> "I read about this guy who was buying a single A team and was talking about moving them to Sacramento," recalls McClatchy. "So I called him, out of the blue, and told him I thought he was making a mistake. He invited me out to talk about it."<P>"He just showed up at this meeting. It became clear to me that he was one of the most capable and willing to get this thing going," says Fred Anderson, a Sacramento manufacturer of building materials who jokes that he's spent more than Steve Forbes did on his political bid trying to bring sports to that town. They bought the team, the Modesto A's, and McClatchy became president. McClatchy then took a leave of absence from the Newspaper Network, and the two started the Northern California Sports Development Group to acquire more  franchises.<P>"I thought he was out trying to get a team for Sacramento, and he ended up in Pittsburgh," chuckles Anderson, who's invested in the Pirates as well.<P>"We'll lose him - Major League Baseball has suggested he decrease his involvement with the minor league," Anderson says. "But I have to think that in some ways I'm responsible for getting him involved in baseball. I think that's one of my greatest achievements in sports."<P>A Stand-Up Guy <P>Pittsburgh sure thinks so. At a recent reception for season ticket holders, for which 800 RSVPed and 1,400 attended, people stood in line for three hours waiting for autographs.<P>Days later, on a disgustingly bone-chilling Saturday, there was a line out the door of the Ross Park Mall's Pirate Clubhouse for autographs. McClatchy signed and signed, smiling all the while.<P>"I came over to say thank you," says Judy Stupak, a middle-aged woman with her teenagers in tow. "He saved the Pirates for us. If it wasn't for him, the heritage of baseball, a part of Pittsburgh history and our history, would be gone. My parents took me to games, I took my kids. It kept us close." <P>McClatchy sits and talks with fans until the last one leaves; the staff has to cut them off ("He'd sit there all day if we didn't," says one employee) and hustle him to another event. <P>This willingness to listen is endearing about McClatchy. As is his wide smile, which turns a nice looking but unremarkable white male face into a recognizable personality.<P>"My mother said, 'He's such a nice kid. I wish he was my son,' " says Mike Kelly, Ketchum Public Relations vice president and counsel to the Pirates. "Thanks, Mom." <P>McClatchy's youth is generally seen as an asset, and, in his own words, can be disarming in negotiations. He doesn't hide the fact that he has an aggressive agenda, but that fact does, at times, get overlooked because he's just so darned nice. Potential opponents or critics would do well to remember Mark Sauer's sidestepping upon McClatchy's arrival: McClatchy even took Sauer's office. He may have great dimples, but he's no pushover. <P>"Kevin's down to earth, no hidden agenda. He actively seeks input before he makes decisions," says Kelly. "He's a hell of a guy to do business with, you tell jokes and have fun, and you don't have a fear of offering a differing opinion. He will listen to it." <P>The combination is winning. In two short months, any skepticism once raised about McClatchy's intentions for the team has been dispelled. City Council, once a major critic, named April 8, opening day, 'Kevin McClatchy Day.' It was, appropriately for the Pirates, the day after Easter. McClatchy, however, is modest about it. <P>"I think once people have gotten to meet me, they realize I'm pretty much a regular guy," says McClatchy, his well-cut suit and starched white shirt humanized by scuffed bucks and the paper clip holding the ends of his tie together. "I get tired of seeing 'newspaper heir.' I've worked my whole life. If I sat around and counted money and didn't work, sure, call me an heir. But if I'm putting in 16 to 18 hours of work a day, I think I deserve to be called a business person." "If anyone can tell he's from a prominent background I'd be surprised. He drove an old car in college, and didn't have any more than anyone else, except maybe a nice place to go for holidays," says Colvin, a stock broker in Los Angeles. He and McClatchy have for years talked every day, about sports, mostly. "His priorities were school, family and friends - not necessarily in that order." <P>The family is close, albeit not geographically, but they gather for holidays, get together as often as possible and are wired on e-mail. Charles, McClatchy's older brother, owns and directs two homeless shelters in Sacramento; his sister, Adair, is studying environmental science at San Francisco State. One family base is Princeton, where George Kennan, now 92, lives. Grace Kennan Warnecke came to Pittsburgh for the opener, as did many of Kevin's friends, and has already suggested taking the Pirates to Russia.<P>"I was very surprised when he said he would like to buy the Pirates," says Kevin's mother. "It seemed like an incredibly big step. I lived that with him, though, and by the time he actually bought the team - well, I'm just happy it worked out. I really think he's thinking of making baseball better. It's such a big part of American life. I think Kevin, through all of this, just wants to leave the world a better place, which he gets from both the McClatchys and the Kennans." <P>"You know," says Kevin's mother, "a lot of his sense of community and team spirit comes from sports."<P>Which is getting it back in     spades.<P>Play Ball <P>When the deal was done, McClatchy launched into the Pittsburgh community like a jet-propelled rocket, visiting groups in all corners of the region. "The key to all this is the fans," he says. All fans. <P>One day in March, the fifth graders at Haine Elementary, clad in black and gold, graciously told their guest, Kevin McClatchy, what they know about him. He's 33, single, paid $90 million for the Pirates and needs $150 million for a new stadium. Then it's their turn to ask questions. He listens intently.<P>"Do you have a dog?" Yes, a yellow lab, who was 4 years old on April 25. "What's your favorite color?" Dark blue. "What's your favorite Italian food?" He names a complicated dish, explaining it's black pepper fettuccine with shrimp and duck - maybe kids don't like it.<P>"Where do you live?" In Point Breeze, in Pittsburgh. "What kind of car do you drive?" A jeep, which is good in the snow. "What books do you read?" He likes John Grisham's novels. "What music do you like?" Bruce Springsteen. Of course, the Boss. "Do you like MTV?" Yes, he says, and names a few shows, which they agree are good. <P>"Are you tired of all the meetings you have to go to?" No. He shows them his schedule, runs through a typical day. Radio shows, meetings, appearances, interviews. "Are you signing any new players?" He runs down the latest, explaining that the key is the pitching, and he'd like to see revenue sharing.<P>They have some advice: They've thought up a number of ways to raise money for the new stadium. And 'If you ever feel like buying the Pirates was a mistake, keep your head up.'<P>He smiles, hands out ballcaps and has his picture taken with each one of them, then with the whole class. Above the blackboard is a sign.<P>"In a world full of followers ... Dare to be a leader."<P>

<P>

Molly Stahlman was in the midst of her MBA program at Carnegie Mellon when she decided what she wanted to do with her degree upon graduation: She would start a company offering trolley tours of Pittsburgh.<P>That's right: Her business - which provided its first tour last month - depends on people who want to board a motorized trolley and ride around greater Pittsburgh seeing the sights.<P>Sound like a reach? It's not, according to the 27-year-old entrepreneur. And she's not the only person voicing that opinion.<P>The Allegheny Conference on Community Development's Working Together Consortium sees tourism as a means of triggering economic growth in the region.<P>Stahlman is banking on it. Pittsburgh Trolley Tours Inc. is starting out small - only two trolleys right now - but she is projecting growth in coming years. She'll initially cater to private groups, corporations or hospitals and the such that bring people into town for conferences or conventions.<P>"I've found that people do want a really classy tour of Pittsburgh," says Stahlman, who tapped the expertise of several CMU professors when developing her business plan.<P>"There is a rich history here," Stahlman says. "People who don't know Pittsburgh don't have a high opinion of it like we do. So let's show them. Half of it is the packaging. We will be a top packager, give them a really classy tour of Pittsburgh."<P>In Part V of Executive Report's six-month series entitled Resuscitating the Region, ER looks at how tourism offers a window of opportunity to spur regional growth. In previous months, the magazine talked about the importance of entrepreneurship, exporting, education and transportation. Next month, ER will end the series with a look at tax reform as a window of opportunity.<P>This month: Tourism.<P><P>Tourism Economics<P>Statistics show that travel and tourism have long been important parts of the American economy. Dollars spent by tourists produce a ripple effect  felt in every aspect of a community, as well as the overall economy.<P>The plus about tourism - in contrast to other industries - is that it rarely suffers stagnation. Even during recessions, tourism has been a winner. Consider these statistics:<P>u	The American Automobile Association estimates that 47 million people belonged to an automobile club for travel services in 1994, the most recent year for which statistics were available. AAA travel agency sales that year totaled $2 billion, up from a previous high of $1.8 billion the year earlier.<P>u	Also in 1994, travelers spent  $399.6 billion on travel in U.S. destinations, an increase of 5 percent from the previous year. Revenues in the hotel industry increased 7 percent over the previous year.<P>u	In Pennsylvania in 1994, 164,000 people were employed in tourism-related jobs, the ninth most among the 50 states. California was No. 1 with 591,400 tourism-related jobs.<P>u	Travelers spent almost $2.2 billion in 1993 in Allegheny County alone, second only to Philadelphia County at $2.3 billion, according to state statistics.<P>"Attracting visitors is a practice growing throughout the world," says Richard Stafford, executive director of the Allegheny Conference. "If we even just kept our share of this market, we will continue to have dollars. In addition, I buy into the idea that we may do a notch or two better.<P>"This is known as a European city in America," Stafford says. "It's an interesting place for a lot of people to      visit. Because of philanthropy over the years, we have a lot of attractions - The Carnegie and all its branches,       for example."<P>Tourism insiders say their industry is important because it brings wealth into the region, much like the business practice of exporting does. Instead of shipping a product elsewhere and bringing dollars into the region in return, tourists simply spend the dollars here personally.<P>"It's no different than if they bought a $100 widget made here in the region," Stafford says. "We are importing dollars. What you are talking about is jobs."<P>Joseph McGrath, executive director of the Greater Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau, says about 50 percent of visitors to Pittsburgh are business travelers who come here to visit the likes of USX, Mellon Bank, PNC Bank or other large companies with significant operations here. Another 30 percent are traditional tourists, and 20 percent are conventioneers.<P>The traditional tourists range from actual vacationers, to those attending a special event in the cultural district, to day-trippers who enter the city to shop and eat.<P>The real eye-opener for locals is the actual vacationers. Many do come, and what they see in Pittsburgh is often quite different than what the locals see.<P><P>An Outsider's View<P>Back in mid-1995, Washington Post travel writer James Yenckel spent two days in Pittsburgh and subsequently gushed about it as a tourist destination in an article that appeared not only in the Post but also in the Los Angeles Times and other newspapers nationwide that subscribe to the Washington Post-Los Angeles Times News Service.<P>Yenckel's conclusion: "Given Pittsburgh's rich historical heritage, I probably shouldn't have been surprised by the abundance of fascinating things to see." (For more excerpts of the Pittsburgh travel review, please see Chronicles on page 7).<P>	You'll hear no argument from the Conven-tion and Visitors Bureau's McGrath, who thinks greater Pitts-burgh can better take advantage of the "fascinating things" to which Yenckel referred by doing a better job of "bundling" these various attractions.<P>	"Individual attractions are usually not strong enough to attract someone to a destination," McGrath says. "But if you package the attractions together, there's a better chance that they'll come."<P>	So a younger family may spend part of the day at Sandcastle or Kennywood Park, then head to a Pirates game in the evening. A couple with interest in the arts, meanwhile, may spend the day at The Carnegie in Oakland, the Regional History Center or the Warhol Museum, then take in the symphony that evening.<P>John Herbst, executive director of the Regional History Center, is counting on tourists being a significant part of the center's audience. <P>"Anyone who travels to a place wants to know about where they are," Herbst says. "They'll want to know about Pittsburgh, and the History Center is ready to play that role."<P>The best economic opportunity with tourism lies in conventions, and anyone who has ever attended a convention knows why. Conventioneers tend to be on expense accounts, so they spend more money than the traditional tourists and the business travelers.<P>Geographically, Pittsburgh is a good location for conventions since approximately 40 percent of the U.S. population resides within a 500 mile radius. And the fact that USAir has a hub in Pittsburgh allows many people to take direct flights here. In some instances, USAir may provide special air fares for conventioneers.<P>Now the problem: the state-owned David L. Lawrence Convention Center's relatively small exhibit hall tends to limit its ability to bring in conventions. That's why Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy moved to scrap plans for a $6 million entrance lobby intended to beautify the convention center and use the money instead to buy land to at least double the exhibit hall's size. <P>The Convention and Visitors Bureau's sales department studied 13 cities that are considered to be most competitive with Pittsburgh, including Baltimore, Columbus, Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis and Cincinnati. All 13 cities had more gross exhibit space than Pittsburgh, and seven of them had more total hotel rooms within walking distance of the convention center. These factors are weighted heavily by convention planners.<P>The convention center expansion here will beef up both exhibit and meeting room space. The expansion likely will go west toward the Cultural District, with later expansion east toward the Strip District. The expansion was still being studied by a local group at presstime. <P>As for the hotel space, McGrath says there is a glaring need for a large hotel that could add anywhere from 500 to 1,400 hotel rooms in the market. The closer to downtown the better.<P>How urgent is this? Pretty urgent when you consider that conventioneers who don't come here are probably going somewhere else.<P>Just ask Andrew Young, the former mayor of Atlanta, who pushed tourism and to this day credits a third of corporate relocations to Atlanta to people whose initial experience in Atlanta was a visit there for a convention. They came back later, Young says.<P>"It's forced tourism," adds the Convention and Visitors Bureau's McGrath. "You are forced to go to that destination. Then they say, 'It's not bad, maybe I'd come back.' "                        <P>

<P>
Andrew Carnegie went from rags to riches, literally.<P>The man who would become the biggest name in steel was born in Scotland and got his start as a bobbin boy in a Pittsburgh textile mill at $1.20 a week. Before his death in 1919 at the age of 84, Carnegie would plant the seed that grew to become USX Corp. And with his millions, Carnegie would build the sprawling libraries and museums that bear his name and still attract thousands annually.<P>Yet he remains an enigma.<P>"Carnegie was a very complex guy," says Duquesne University Provost Michael Weber, a historian. "No one has put the finger on him real well. He was without question a business genius. He didn't make steel himself, but he put together all the pieces to make it work, using what would later become common business methods."<P>Carnegie's feats as an investor and steel magnate have been well-chronicled. But until recently, information about Carnegie's early, formative years was somewhat limited. That changed with the opening of the Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center in Pittsburgh's Strip District. Just weeks before opening, the history center became the repository for letters and other Carnegie documents dating back to 1853.<P>USX, the steel and energy giant that evolved from steel holdings Carnegie sold to J.P. Morgan in 1901, gave the regional history center 14 boxes of papers USX had been keeping at a constant temperature in a limestone mine.<P>Prior to USX releasing the documents, only two historians had seen them in the last 40 years.<P>"It is not for me to comment on the value of these historic documents," says USX Chief Executive Thomas J. Usher. "I'll leave that to the historians."<P>So will we, and the early reviews from some paint the letters as classic Carnegie.<P>"I see him as being kind of a contradictory man," says Professor Daniel John Santoro, a University of Pitts-burgh at Johnstown professor who has studied the evolution of the steel industry. <P>"I don't want to say that he talked out of both sides of his mouth, but he was also kind of strapped by the realities that faced him as a businessman. <P>"Take the Homestead steel strike: Carnegie had criticized competitors for not allowing the union in the workplace. He asked why they would deny workers what he and other businessmen claimed as a right. But when it came to his own business, he abandoned that position quite quickly."<P>The Homestead Works near Pittsburgh was one of the largest plants in Carnegie's steel empire. He had acquired it in 1889 with the purchase of the H.C. Frick Coke Company. Along with the plant came Henry Clay Frick himself and the plant's union, the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers. <P>By 1892, Carnegie and Frick were so worried about falling prices and overcapacity in the steel industry that they sought to cut wages at Homestead, which led the union to go out on strike. At the same time, they hoped to dislodge the Amalgamated as the bargaining unit at the plant. Their plan included bringing Pinkerton security men into the plant, inviting the strikers to return to work, and hiring nonunion labor if they did not respond. Getting wind of the plan, the workers block-aded the works and fought a pitched battle with the Pinkertons in which more than a dozen people were killed. The violence continued for weeks until the governor sent 8,000 troops to Homestead. Only then could the plant reopen with a large complement of nonunion labor. <P>The strike and the battle captured national attention and permanently tarnished Carnegie's reputation as a progressive employer.<P><P>The Letters<P>The letters were penned long before Carnegie ascended to power. The correspondence started in 1853 - when Carnegie was 18 - and lasted four years. Carnegie aggressively chided George "Dod" Lauder, his cousin in Scotland. Lauder's father suggested that the boys debate via mail about the politics of their respective countries.  <P>"One can note the tremendous energy Carnegie had as a youth for this environment that he would exploit when he grew older," says Professor Allan Zeman of Robert Morris College.<P>Carnegie and Dod debated the characteristics of their countries - from governmental structure to social policy - each defending their country's weaknesses and pointing out the strengths. Carnegie touts the superiority of American know-how, even though years later he would use European technology - the Bessemer converter - to build his steel empire.<P>Carnegie signed the letters "Naig." The following are excerpts.<P><P>Defending Federalism<P>Carnegie had only been in the country five years, but studied and embraced the system of federalism, under which some powers were reserved for the states. Europe, for the most part, still toiled under feudalistic rule. Carnegie went right to the point, explaining why federalism works and slipping in a slam against the systems of government present throughout Europe.<P>"Our revolutionary fathers were afraid to create a powerful government. They argued it might be turned into an instrument of oppression as it had in Europe and they thought that the states could legislate for themselves and know their own wants better than any other.<P>"Accordingly you will find a clause in our present constitution to that effect. I send you a copy of it.<P>"I have no doubt you will be surprised at its simplicity and won't believe that such a nation as this composed of  25 million from all the ends of the earth can be governed by such an insignificant looking document. But that's because you have been brought up to think a constitution should have something mysterious about it as it is the case with your own - a thing to be talked about but never seen. Our constitution was made by the people and can be altered, amended or done away with by them whenever they see fit."<P><P>Rubbing It In<P>In a subsequent letter, Carnegie responded to information from Dod about reforms taking place in England. Carnegie inferred that England was following the lead of the United States. Carnegie also writes words he definitely would not write were he alive today: proclaiming the efficiency of American politics.<P>"I can think of no reform which you have that we do not possess. We have all your good traits which are many, with few or none of your bad ones which I must say are neither few nor far between. But we go ahead. We now possess what the working classes of your country look forward to as constituting their political millennium.<P>"Now all these great reforms were gained without threatening to revolutionize. Oh No. Our political engine works so smoothly, no puffing and blowing but everything easy about it. It would amuse you to see our politicians bowing and scraping to their masters, the dear people.<P>"But the best proof of the superiority of our system is seen in the general prosperity and progress of its citizens. Among a multitude of similar instances I will mention the following: We have now in the national treasury nearly $22 million. Our debt is being paid off as fast as it becomes due. Our receipts annually exceed our expenditures. Towns and cities spring up as if by magic. Mind is freed from superstitious reverence for old customs, unawed by gorgeous and unmeaning shows and forms.<P>"This doing of a thing 'because our grandfathers did it' I can assure you is not an American institution. We have little veneration for those rules and principles rendered sacred by the seal of the ancients whether in church or state.<P>"Now we don't look upon Government with any peculiar reverence nor regard it as a science. Our aim is to continually simplify and moderate what little we have got. We regard Government merely as the body through which the Nation acts and think that it should be as absolutely under its control as our body is under our mind. ... The time is near at hand in this country when our president will be considered (as he really is) only the head clerk of our establishment and his cabinet as under managers."<P><P>Foreign Affairs<P>When Dod prodded America for not playing a larger role in the world, the 19-year-old Carnegie responded by telling Dod that America's role is to lead by example instead of imposing its views and beliefs on other countries.<P>	"Great and good men in every nation glory in its prosperity and would lament over its downfall. Our mission as the representative of a new era, as the pioneer of liberty is to serve as an example to other nations to incite them to come up to the true standard, to impel the people to ask and obtain new reforms and go on steadily progressing. For our own sake as well as theirs, we ought not to impair our strength or retard our progress by laying down the ploughshare of peace or the sword of war unless compelled to do so in self-defense."<P><P>On the Defense<P>Dod finally put Carnegie on the defense by chiding Carnegie about America's use of slaves. Carnegie concedes the argument, but says America should not be condemned.<P>"We hate slavery as much as you do and have abolished it as you did as far as we had the power. It is true our southern states urged on by British Demand for cotton, cherish the curse in their bosoms. 'Tis horrible to think of one man trafficking in the flesh of another and to think of the wrongs, crimes, and cruelties committed by and inherent in this institution. Men like ourselves bought and sold in the 19th century. Women and children lashed like cattle. It is sickening to think of. When nations are called upon to render an account of the deeds done in the body, when the recording angel looks upon the workings of this accurst system what think you will be the enquiry? Will he begin at the beginning and say, Whence came this monster? Who is its author? How and by whom was it established? And then we will reply, when we were in the helplessness and innocency of childhood entirely under the guidance of the mother country this system was forced upon us. We think we did our duty. We demonstrated earnestly against it. We made a tax on every negro that entered to discourage it. We solemnly declared that the 13th colony would be shielded from the curse. <P>"Since we became our own masters we have declared the trade to be piracy. State after state has liberated its slaves till now, from being 80 years ago all the victims of this hereditary curse, two-thirds of our population live in states where there is no such thing as slave. This much we have done since we had the power and although the system has spread in the South, in comparison with the population it has been rapidly decreasing and we all know how hard it is for us to uproot bad habits engrafted upon us in youth and especially so when taught from a parental hand."<P><P>A Nation's Destiny<P>Carnegie ponders what would come true - America becoming the world's dominant nation - and how that role would play out. <P>"We are possessors of a mighty nation, a land we think marked out by the finger of destiny to become the greatest among the nations of the earth. Its mission we believe is not only to continue as asylum for the poor and honest of the world, to stand as a vast receptacle of all the oppressed and downtrodden, gathering them under its paternal wing as a hen gathering her chickens and feeding and nourishing the famishing brood, high though such a destiny be, we still look higher. She is chosen to stand forth in the van of every reform calculated to elevate the human race and serve as a burning shining light to others."<P><P>More Politics<P>Carnegie compares politicians to employees. He says they either do what the people want, or find a new job.<P>"In order to attain this position certain [things] must be carried out. We want our machines built in a certain manner. We go to work, advertise for workmen, inform them what we want done and how and when, name the wages, (we pay our workmen) length of service etc., take those we like best and if they enter our employ, insist upon our wishes being carried out in every particular. We must have our way when it is we who bear the burden."<P><P>Dear Andrew Carnegie:<P>You will be pleased to know that after 100 years your legacy to this wonderful city is still legendary. Our children study your contributions to Pittsburgh as a business leader during the early decades of the Industrial Revolution. You will also be pleased, however, to learn that they are equally aware and appreciative of your role as a champion of literacy for all people and as a benefactor of the arts.<P>Libraries across this country bear your name because you above all others recognized the importance of universal literacy and donated huge sums of money to make books of all kinds available for public use. In Pittsburgh today, our local Carnegie libraries are an important partner in the education of the city's youth, providing warm, quiet places for young people to study, conduct research or merely to enjoy a good book. You would be especially proud, I believe, <P>of today's libraries which are promoting a new technology-based literacy that can open new worlds for everyone. "A library outranks any other one thing a community can do to benefit its people," you said. "It is a never failing spring in the desert."<P>You also recognized the importance of the arts to society, and their inextricable link to education and literacy. Today, performing halls around the country bear your name, a testament to your desire to make arts accessible to the public. In Pittsburgh the Carnegie Institute represents perhaps your most visible legacy. As you once said, "The success of library, art gallery, museum and music hall - a noble quartet in an immense building - is one of the chief satisfactions of my life."<P>Your community investments, which totaled $350 million in your lifetime, continue to pay huge dividends today. All of us are the beneficiaries, and we are grateful. We are also hopeful that the spring you tapped in Pittsburgh will never run dry and that generations to come will be able to reap the benefits of your contributions to a literate society and your appreciation of the arts.<P><P>Sincerely,<P>Louise R. Brennen<P>Supt., Pittsburgh Schools<P><P>Dear Mr. Carnegie:<P>What I have always admired the most about you is the hundreds of thousands of jobs you created.<P>You helped raise a golden age of heavy manufacturing. Large corporations like your Carnegie Steel Company dominated the economy in Pittsburgh and across the country. For decades, sons and daughters assumed from early childhood that they would work for the same large industrial concerns that hired their parents.<P>But if you returned to western Pennsylvania today, you might shake your head in amazement. You would see daily reports of large companies making massive layoffs of tens of thousands of employees at a time. You would learn that employment at what are now called Fortune 500 companies is down substantially from the levels of 10 and 15 years ago, despite enormous economic growth nationally.<P>You would see that unemployment is relatively low, and you might ask yourself, "Where is everyone working?"<P>The answer, Mr. Carnegie, is at small businesses.<P>Some are service companies, some manufacturers, some retailers. Some are making and selling things like software and facsimile transmission machines that you could not have imagined possible when you resigned your job at the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1865 to start your first business, the Keystone Bridge Company. Together, these small companies create about 90 percent of all new jobs.<P>Somehow, I doubt you would wring your hands in despair. I have a feeling you would roll up your sleeves and start looking for an underserved market niche. You would think about how you could deliver a better product or service at a lower price faster than your larger competitor. You would figure out how to get into international markets. You would, in short, join the ranks of the small but aggressive entrepreneurs who are the true engine of growth in America in the 1990s!<P><P>Sincerely,<P>Leo R. McDonough<P>President,  SMC<P><P>P.S. Thank you very much for your gift of the Carnegie libraries. You have generously given to the people of this community the precious resource of knowledge and ideas which will endure as long as Pittsburgh itself.<P><P>Dear Mr. Carnegie:<P>Most people remember you as an entrepreneur and business leader. But before you started your first business, Keystone Bridge Company, in 1865, you were an employee.<P>Your success working for other people shows today's workers what most <P>successful business people know: that the best employees make the most successful entrepreneurs.<P><P>Despite a limited education, you rose quickly in every company that employed you, be it a cotton factory, a telegraph office or a railroad. You treated the resources of your employers as if they were your own. You worked tirelessly to get the job done, whatever it was. By aligning your own goals with those of your employers, your employers thrived, and so did you.<P>Industrialization and technology were rapidly changing America. Rather than worry about if new technology would change or end your job, you embraced technological advances, like the Pullman sleeping car, and later as an entrepreneur, the Bessemer process for making steel.<P>You also learned from your employers about how to build and run a        company. You moved up the ranks at the Pennsylvania Railroad, ending up as the head of the western division. You saved some capital and bought shares in the company. With the profits from your investment, you financed your first  enterprise.<P>As a captain of industry, you applied the lessons you learned as an employee, and built one of the greatest industrial concerns the world has ever seen.<P>Yours is the story of the good <P>employee who sees an emerging market opportunity and grabs it. It excited me as a child, and it still excites me. As one of the thousands of employees turned business owners who has used your life as a <P><P>model, I thank you.<P><P>Respectfully yours,<P>Michael L. Bussler<P>Algor Inc.<P><P>Dear Andrew Carnegie:<P>For nearly 100 years, people have celebrated you for building an important industry, endowing public libraries, founding educational institutions and supporting myriad charitable causes. But some have vilified you as one of the major exploiters of labor in your era.<P>You would be surprised at how the pendulum has swung since you were active in business. In your day, labor unions, to the extent they existed at all, were struggling to survive.  Govern-ment laws protected employers against organizing.<P>But since then, a massive body of regulations has emerged to foster union organizing and protect union activity. The percentage of the workforce that is unionized hit a peak of more than 30 percent in the 1950s, and has now leveled off at about 17 percent.<P>As you knew all too well, a union is a third party that positions itself between employees and their employers, and stifles a cooperative working out of problems together. Unions insist upon work rules and inflexible contracts, which make it harder for employers to operate at peak productivity. Unions also can make it harder for employees to pursue the lifestyle they now desire; for example, by making job-sharing and flex time unachievable. Unions have been very slow to respond to the needs of the young, women and minorities, and they often negotiate away the future of younger workers to protect their most senior members.<P>Unionized companies are often at a competitive disadvantage, as seen in a recent strike at one General Motors plant that rocked not just GM, but the economy of much of the Midwest.<P>And the pendulum continues to swing to the side of unions. Our current president, Bill Clinton, is working to pass a law to ban the use of replacement workers. This law would make it much harder to operate during a strike, giving unions enormous negotiating leverage and power. The National Labor Relations Board (which didn't even exist until decades after you retired), has recently begun to swing toward organized labor. Unions are exercising political influence beyond their numbers.<P>Most union leaders have an adversarial mentality forged in the steel mills built by you and your business partners. Yet a team partnership attitude is needed to remain competitive in today's global economy. I believe that if you were alive today, you would understand that attitude and do all you could to provide employees with a fair wage and a good working environment, foster the teamwork approach to employee relations, try to meet the needs of the workforce and comply with the large body of laws and regulations governing employment. You would work to make American industry more competitive in the global economy, despite the efforts to the contrary by organized labor.<P><P><P>John E. Lyncheski <P>Chair, Labor and <P>Employment Group<P>Cohen & Grigsby<P>

<center><B><font size=+2>The Flex Office
</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+1>Some Developers Have Carved Out a <BR>
Niche by Building High-EndFlex Space<BR>
for Use by Office Operations</font></b><br>

<i>By Jim Urban</i></center>
<hr>


<P>Bill Corace's first foray into flex space left him a little worried. Early into the project, the warehouse tenants who Corace figured would line up to get into the space were turning up their noses.<P>As it turned out, the traditional warehouse tenants weren't necessarily concerned about the landscaping and architectural appeal that Corace was including in his project.<P>"I thought my primary tenants would be taken from warehouse space," says Corace, principal of Secon Corp., developer of Abele Business Park in South Fayette Township.<P>"What I found out was that the warehouse tenants were interested in lower rent and were not concerned about aesthetic appeal," Corace says. "Then we switched gears and marketed it to office tenants who pay higher rates but want the better access, storage space, loading docks and other things associated with light industrial. That turned the project around.<P>"I goofed up in such a way that it was much better in the long term," Corace says.<P>Yes it was. Flex space has been around in one form or another for a couple decades. In its original form, a lot of warehouse space or light industrial space was mixed with a small amount of office space. And in many locations here and nationwide, that still holds true. Nationally, the average blend of use is 40 percent office and    60 percent industrial.<P>But Corace and other western Pennsylvania developers - such as Burns & Scalo Real Estate Group - have carved out a niche by developing flex space that caters more to the office user than the warehouse tenant. So image-conscious tenants can combine upscale front-office operations with less plush back-office operations. And with office space tight in both the central business district and the fringe markets, prospective tenants are seriously considering flex as an option.<P>"The demand is increasing," says Jack Donahue, vice president of commercial real estate firm Grubb & Ellis. "The market is getting a lot tighter, and office tenants are considering flex space because the occupancy cost is less than Class A office buildings."<P>Today, Corace has 100,000 square feet of flex space at Abele filled primarily with small firms that on average take up about 3,000 square feet of space. Some use as little as 1,200 square feet, and none use more than 9,000. <P>Corace is breaking ground this spring to add another 60,000 square feet and keep up with market demand.<P>Burns & Scalo Real Estate Group, meanwhile, already has 275,000 square feet of flex space at Bursca Business Park, plus another 100,000 square feet at Southpointe. Both sites are in the Interstate 79 corridor south of Pittsburgh.<P>Burns & Scalo will add more flex space at Southpointe and break ground this year to build a 100,000-square-foot facility in Cranberry Township.<P>"When we first started this, we thought there was going to be a small percent of office use versus a lot of warehouse," says Burns & Scalo principal Jim Scalo. "But the market trend as these products become better located, as the product has matured, is that we are finding it's heavier office use."<P><P>Why Flex? <P>The hot niche product here has been the flex space that's geared more to predominantly office operations.<P>What's it got over traditional office space? For one, an office building is not easily accessible for deliveries and is too expensive - in Pittsburgh, as much as $10 per square foot more than flex space - to use in part for storage or light assembly operations as many firms do. The traditional industrial warehouse, on the other hand, lacks the desired upscale image of an office building.<P>At Burns & Scalo's Southpointe site, Columbia Energy Services has executive offices plus a less plush trader's pit where commodities traders work the phones and watch the ticker board overhead.<P>Not far away, Synergistic Technologies mixes front-office operations in its space with a wide-open light assembly area that's large enough to fit a van inside.<P>At Abele, rust block buildings with cedar siding blend in with the wooded landscape.<P>From the outside, the front of the buildings look upscale and classy. But drive around the back, and there are the loading docks.<P>The tenants who are finding flex space suitable include sales and service operations, home healthcare offices and distribution centers for high tech products such as electronics and computer items.   <P>"In that scenario, this is a guy who wants to blend his rental rates," says Scalo. "He needs an office and needs a shop. By bringing them together, he blends the high office rental rates with the low shop rental rates, into a medium rental rate."<P>In the Pittsburgh market, that medium rental rate usually ranges from $8 to $13, depending upon how much of the space is actually used for office. The more office space, the higher the price.<P>Some tenants are smaller, service-oriented organizations that need high-end space but cannot be in pure office buildings because they require the loading facilities. At the same time, industrial buildings lack the image that these tenants want to project.<P><P>Happy Campers<P>You won't hear the flex developers complaining about their tenants being predominantly office users. Simply stated, the developers get a better return on their investment from office users since the rates are higher when the space is predominantly office.<P>"No matter how these buildings are used, it costs the same to build these buildings," says Jeremy Kronman of Gold & Co. "Take Burns & Scalo, for example. When the space is used for all warehouse, the tenants pay $9 per square foot, versus $13 per square foot for using it all as office. So the more office space, the better the return for the developer."<P>And it doesn't hurt that western Pennsylvania's topography makes it tough to build flex. Developers need to find large tracts of flat land so they can build the long, one-story buildings  typical of flex structures.<P>Insiders say most of the good spaces already are taken,  overpriced or improperly zoned. That tends to limit competition and keep the market tight.<P>The topography of hills and valleys is perhaps the dominant factor. Donahue of Grubb & Ellis says national investors see the western Pennsylva-nia terrain and start looking elsewhere. <P>Could that change? Possibly if the market remains extremely tight, according to Tom Black, a commer- cial real estate analyst with the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Land Institute.<P>"I think national investors tend to view easily supplied markets as being more risky for obvious reasons - there's more competition," Black says. "So in the sense that the Pittsburgh market is tough to supply, national investors may view it as less risky and come in here."<P>And if the high tech industry continues to develop, that would only fuel the demand created by the tight office markets.<P><P>The Office Users<P>When people like Scalo or Corace present their pitch to office users, it's pretty simple and to the point. They hammer away at cost and convenience.<P>In traditional office buildings, tenants split the cost of space used for stairwells, elevator shafts and lobbies. So the tenants are paying for gross square footage over and beyond what they actually use.<P>"When you take the single-story product, you eliminate the cost of unused space," Scalo says. "A lot of customers can take less square feet because they don't pay for the residual waste."<P>"The operating expenses are higher in traditional office buildings," says Donahue of Grubb & Ellis.<P>There are also other benefits, such as parking, which is often plentiful and nearby. And some business parks featuring flex space have other amenities such as walking trails or fitness centers that make these parks pleasant places for people to work.<P>"It's absolutely the product of the future," Scalo says. "This product makes sense, which is why it has had success."<P>

<center><B><font size=+2>The Summer Term
</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+1>Quick and Painless</font></b><br>

<i>By Gretchen McKay</i></center>
<hr>


<P>Taking Classes During the Summer is an Easy Way to Continue One's Professional Education or to Accelerate a Degree Program Already in Progress; For the Schools, It Means Exposure and Dollars<BR><BR>Summer school.<P>It's a concept bound to evoke groans from anyone under the age of 18.<P>But to some Pittsburgh adults, the opportunity to take courses in the summer is anything but a vacation buster. In fact, summer school makes sense, allowing students to continue their professional education, accelerate a degree program already in progress, or play catch up after a particularly demanding spring term. <P>It also enables high school seniors looking to jump-start their college careers and "visiting" students, those home on break from colleges outside of Pittsburgh, to pick up a few extra credits to transfer toward their degrees.<P>Make no mistake: summer sessions can be demanding. Matriculating during the summer usually means learning the same amount of material, and chalking up the same number of contact hours, in a much shorter period (typically over the course of 5 to 6 weeks instead of a semester).<P>And there's no break when it comes to cost.<P>Still,  summer programs are business as usual for most institutions, despite a smaller student body. There may be fewer courses to choose from - fewer students mean fewer tuition dollars - but the schedule of classes is almost always an extension of what's offered during the rest of the year.<P>The exception is upper-level courses, often limited because they may be too difficult to digest in such a short period. Students may also have to get used to new faces, since most schools rely on part-time or adjunct professors - who don't earn benefits - to teach many of the classes.<P>Deciding which courses to offer involves something that Dr. Jo-Ann Sipple, vice president for academic and student affairs at Robert Morris College, calls "magic." Administrators must study patterns of enrollment and course sequences to ensure a "break-even" number of students in each class. They must also determine which courses will be attractive to visiting students, a large percentage of any summer program, as well as what faculty will be available to teach.<P>At Robert Morris, summer students can sign up for most of the school's regular course offerings during a three-week intensive spring session, two five-week sessions or one 11-week evening session.<P>The roster includes everything from accounting, communications and computers to management, marketing and finance. As a result, notes Sipple, those who want to make progress toward their degree can pick up what's required without having to wait for fall term. <P>Community College of Allegheny County, too, offers a "meat and potatoes session" at 13 different locations. The schedule, offered in two six-week sessions and one 10-week session,  comprises a little over 500 classes in nearly a thousand sections.<P>"Summer is a pretty big deal," says Academic Dean Rich Betters, "and an integral part of many degree programs for our students." It's important to visiting students, as well: Up to 38 percent of CCAC's summer clientele are degree-seekers at other institutions.<P>Yet adults aren't CCAC's only customers; it also markets a few special programs for area youth. Their "Come to College" program for children and teens offers a blend of academic, recreational and exploratory classes. In addition, kids can sign up for a summer military camp and a "Come Fly With Us" course exploring careers in aviation.<P>Chatham College, too, seeks the nontraditional student during its three-, five- and seven-week sessions. Nearly one-quarter of its total summer offerings, in fact, are unique to that semester.<P>Here's why: Chatham only opened its campus up to summer school in 1992, and as the new kid on the block, "You have to position yourself as unique in the marketplace," says Shaik Ismail, dean of continuing education.<P>So in addition to more than 50 traditional courses, Chatham students can choose from 10 innovative programs and workshops, such as a mothers-and-daughters program in performing arts, a course in marine and freshwater ecology for high school girls and a Spanish class focusing on health and medical terminology.<P>The college also has a six-week summer day camp, with sports, music and the arts, for children in grades one to nine.<P>Point Park College strives to set itself apart from its competitors by offering several accelerated programs during the summer in addition to the traditional courses in English, science and theater arts. Summer students can "stack" courses by taking two on the same night, earn three credits in three weeks through the Saturday seminar  or take courses "special delivery," which are once a week for ten weeks.<BR>How do colleges go about filling those vacation-time classrooms? Most go the traditional route, advertising in local newspapers, magazines and on radio, and by mailing the schedule of classes to corporations. <P>Others go one step further. Chatham, for example, purchases lists of students with Pittsburgh addresses who attend other schools, then sends them their summer circular; CCAC mails a course brochure to nearly every resident zip code listing in Allegheny  County and places ads in college newspapers within the tristate area.<P>The effort pays off: Though summer programs aren't necessarily cash cows, they do account for a substantial amount of revenue. At Point Park, for example, summer students generate about 10 percent of the tuition revenue for the year, according to James Errett, vice president of finance and administration; at Chatham, summer programs pull in about $500,000 of the college's $14 million budget.<P>"It has to be profitable," says Chatham's Ismail, noting the school must still cool and clean the campus, as well as pay the faculty. "It would be impossible to carry off if we didn't more than break even." <BR><BR>

<font size=+1> A CEO who Wants to Grow<BR>the Company, Not Downsize it 
</font><BR>
<i> By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</i></b>

<P>
<hr>

An executive search firm recently studied the trends of its clients and came up with this shocker: The demand is slowly declining for chief executives whose primary concern is the bottom line. <P>Let's hope so. Cost reduction at most companies has hit the wall. The fat is gone. <P>Many of these CEOs battled the bottom line via downsizing. For some, the process became analogous to a jogger going on a crash diet just before a marathon. Consider that runner, trying to get by on less and less while demanding maximum performance from the body. In the end, the body can't function like it should, and the rest of the runners jog on by.<P>In business, it's the competitors -- those lean enough to be efficient, productive and customer-oriented at the same time -- that pass you by. And loading up on carbohydrates won't do you any good by that time. It's too late.<P>It's fine to concentrate on operational efficiency, restructuring and downsizing for a period of time in order to survive. But when the short-term gains have been realized, companies must pursue an agenda of growth and new business development with as much passion. They must, without question,  pursue the long-term future. <P>"If you call a quarterly earning a result, this quarter and next quarter, yes, [companies] are getting the results they want [from downsizing]," says consultant Alan Downs, author of the book "Corporate Executioner" and former counselor of companies that used  downsizing strategies.<P>"[The companies] are trimming expenses and they are seeing profits increase," says Downs. "If you're looking at the long-term -- let's say five years -- in almost every case they're not seeing an increase in profit, they're not seeing a reduction in expenses. They're seeing a decrease in customer service, they're seeing a decrease in productivity."<P>They're also seeing their competitors pass them by as growth strategies are ignored.<P>Downs cites Eastman Kodak as a prime example. Anorexic Kodak has restructured five times since 1985, cutting 12,000 employees in the process. Through all this, revenues have increased only slightly. The same scenario has played out at many other companies, including one I know that recently introduced a new product without having sufficient marketing and sales personnel in place. The new product was a good one, but the target markets knew little about it. <P>Hopefully, that is changing. Christian & Timbers, the same executive search firm that says bottom-line-oriented CEOs are "out" also says there is a demand for CEOs who are customer driven. Giving the customers something they want is definitely a growth strategy.<P>Companies that do not try to please customers by anticipating and fulfilling their unarticulated needs and that do not think differently about competitiveness had better prepare for their next wave of restructuring and downsizing. These companies will become less and less competitive in the future, necessitating yet another downsizing. It eventually becomes a vicious cycle, cutting until there is nothing left.<P>The irony is that yesterday's stars -- the CEOs who attacked the bottom line via downsizing -- are becoming today's laggards. Some will be reluctant to rethink the organization and unwilling to overthrow the very systems that have supported their ascendancy. Their organizations are doomed to failure.<P>Let's hope they check their egos at the door and think about growth. Or they won't have much of a company left in five years.                	     	    <P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+2>Back From the Road<BR>We can Learn From Our Southern Neighbours 
</FONT SIZE>
<font size=+1></font><BR>
<i> By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher </i></b>
<hr>

After 4200 miles over 28 days with stays in 17 different hotels and 100 interviews, I return to Pittsburgh with new insights to the factors contributing to the South's impressive growth. I headed south to study our high-growth neighbors: Atlanta's 100,000 new jobs created last year and South Carolina's $1 billion in new investment lured me to investigate the secrets to their successes. I needed to know whether all that glistens is gold.<P>The Interstate 95 corridor's growth record doesn't just glisten. It shines. Michelin and BMW, two of South Carolina's newest recruits, don't make location decisions casually. Pittsburgh's southern competition is undeniably formidable.<P>Atlanta's burgeoning crime rate, gridlocked traffic and intense pockets of poverty do not deter development -- at least yet. Likewise, South Carolina's abysmal public education system and sleepy pace do not  impede growth. All these communities I visited are fraught with problems as they compete for private investment dollars. Yet, they do compete.<P>The key to success lies in advancing opportunities commensurate with the problems. Those areas that used their problems to foster opportunities ultimately prevailed and prospered.<P>In almost every case, periods of significant hardship became the impetus for change. Crises paved the way for new and unorthodox approaches in economic development.<P>Business as usual became business as unusual, transforming sleepy towns into industrial powers. Business led the charge with help from government. Not vice versa. Politicians played a critical role, but were not the orchestrators of success.<P>In addition, our high-growth neighbors shared other commonalities as well. Most importantly, they saw themselves as connected to the outside world.  A deep water port, a world-class airport or easy access to interstate highways served as the vital connection to the outside world.<P>These communities view themselves from the outside in and are entirely customer-driven in their new business solicitations. Furthermore, their efforts are precise and calculated.<P>Alternatively, Pittsburgh views itself from the inside out. It applies old, but proven solutions to new problems. <P>Our June and July issues will feature a detailed description of the key factors causing the South's stellar performance. This magazine will examine, in particular, key success factors that Pittsburgh can best apply.<P>Crises prevail here. Let's use them to our advantage as agents for change.<P>

<font size=+1>Forget About a Baseball-Only Stadium;
</font><br>
<font size=+1>The City Needs a Sports Complex</FONT><br>
 <i>By Jim Mitnick
</b></i>

<HR>

Over the past several years, we have heard much about the need for a new baseball-only stadium, the need to expand the David L. Lawrence Con-vention Center, the need to develop the theater district, expand retail and shopping downtown and develop the riverfronts.<P> Very few disagree that our rivers are one of Pittsburgh's greatest assets, and any development must provide access for the public to enjoy. The expansion of the convention center will increase convention trade shows, hotel occupancy and support restaurants and local business. Additional retail will provide added diversity to downtown and expand one's experience when visiting downtown.<P>But what would happen to us if the Pirates, in five years, moved to a larger market because the team could not afford to be competitive in this market?<P>Consider what would happen if the Penguins no longer had an outstanding team and could not support themselves because of inadequate facilities.  <P>Consider this nightmare: the Steelers moving to Cleveland.<P>As strange as this seems, it can all happen, and then what would become of downtown? People would go downtown for work, then return home. That would be it. Downtown would open at 9 a.m. and close at 5 p.m.<P>There are too many examples of cities that have ignored the aforementioned possibilities. And as Cleveland is finding out with the Browns' proposed move to Baltimore, if you wait too long to act, sometimes it will be too late.<P>Now may be the best time in Pittsburgh's history to consider building a sports complex that would guarantee professional sports in Pittsburgh for the next 50 years and anchor future development in downtown.<P>If a new baseball park is inevitable, then where is the best location?  The options are limited to the land adjacent to Three Rivers Stadium along the Allegheny River, land in the Strip District, an area at the end of Grant Street, a suburban site or perhaps the South Side.<P>The one area that has never been considered is the current location of the Civic Arena. The advantage of such a plan includes its adjacency to downtown, the Port Authority busway, Crosstown Boulevard, light rail transit, utilities, easy access to downtown services including shopping and dining, the convention center, theater district ... the list goes on.<P>What about the Civic Arena? Good question. This all means what many of us have known for a long time: The Civic Arena should be replaced. Let's face facts: The Civic Arena is now 35 years old and no longer meets the criteria for a major sports facility or entertainment center. It pales in comparison to facilities in other cities.  <P>At the same time, Pittsburgh would have the opportunity to fix an eyesore that has existed at 6th Avenue and Grant Street for over a decade. You have USX Tower on one side, One Mellon Center on the other and vacant property in between.<P>Here's the plan: Let's consider including the baseball-only stadium in a new entertainment facility for hockey, basketball, indoor soccer and other sports above the subway station at 6th Avenue and Grant Street between the Crosstown Boulevard and Ross Street.<P>These plans -- although bold -- would still allow for the riverfront        to be used for private development with public access and would permit a hotel to be built at 6th Avenue           and Grant Street to support the downtown business district and the convention center.<P>This also opens up the possibility of renovating Three Rivers Stadium to allow for the reconfiguration of the lower bowl seating for football and    the enjoyment of the fans. Football  was not meant to be played in round stadiums.<P>If this could be accomplished along with other economic development currently planned, our downtown will become a destination point and truly an asset to Pittsburgh and our region. We should give people a reason to come downtown, not to stay away.<P>But this will only happen if planners think long-term. We can't just hurriedly drop a baseball-only stadium in the first convenient site. The Civic Arena is just as much a dinosaur as Three Rivers Stadium. Let's think long-term and develop a plan that addresses several of the city's impending problems at once.                                          n<P>Jim Mitnick is vice president of the Pittsburgh office of contractor Turner Construction Co.<P>

<HR>
<b>A Peek At the History Center</b><p>The public won't get its first look at the Pittsburgh Regional History Center until it opens late next month in the Strip District, but ER got an early peek. Here's our advice: Make sure you check out the history center after it opens April 28.<P>The building -- the former Chautauqua Lake Ice Co. building on Smallman Street -- is worth seeing alone. The brick walls are two or three feet thick in some places, and the structure is supported by massive wooden pillars and beams that were brought in from the Northwest when the 160,000-square-foot building was constructed in 1898.<P>They don't build structures like this anymore.<P>"The pillars and beams are spruce," explains John Herbst, executive director of the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania. "Back then, we didn't have trees here that were this large. We did have a good rail system, so this lumber was brought in from the Northwest by train."<P>Of course, the real attraction will be the exhibits, which will include homes from the region's different eras. The timeline starts with a log home, circa 1780, that is a reproduction of an actual log home built by a Whiskey Rebellion insurgent from Cecil Township, Washington County. From there, the next stop is a 1908 millworker home from Homestead. And finally, a 1952 brick home from West Mifflin.<P>Herbst says actors will welcome visitors to the homes and explain to them the history.<P>The main floor includes a 1940 trolley car that actually rolled into the building on tracks left from when Chautauqua Ice occupied the building. Years ago, trains carrying ice from Lake Chautauqua rolled into the structure for unloading.<P>The main floor is wide open, and Herbst says groups will be able to use it to host receptions or dinner parties. The dinner capacity is 300, but it jumps to 1,000 for cocktail receptions.<P>Upstairs, other attractions include a classroom equipped with a kitchen that Herbst says eventually will be used for ethnic cooking classes.<P>And most importantly, don't miss the business archives, which include letters written by Andrew Carnegie. Other larger collections include business and commercial records from Alcoa, H.J. Heinz, Horne's, J&L Steel, Mellon Bank, Kennywood Park and the Allegheny Conference on Community Development.<P>The history center is named for late U.S. Sen. John Heinz.    <p><b>Workplace Violence: One Study Says it<br>Can Be Prevented</b><p>                 A computer stolen, personal property destroyed, even bomb threats or violence in the office ... the stress of problems at home exploding in the workplace is a manager's worst nightmare. Workplace violence at least causes property damage and stress on the whole office. At its worst, the results can be tragic.<P>And according to one new study, the possibility of violence is very real, but can be prevented if the right steps are taken ahead of time.<P>The University of Southern California's Center for Crisis Manage-ment conducted a study of violence in the workplace, aiming to find  solutions through better management. The study was sponsored by the International Facility Management Association, PepsiCo, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. <P>Forty-three percent of companies responding to the survey reported at least one violent incident in the last three years, including employee theft, weapons in the workplace, fraud and bomb threats. <P>But the study also found that violence can be avoided with some pro-active measures: One recommendation is to build background checks into hiring. Employee assistance programs also can help lower the chances of violent incidents. For instance, the study found that an effort to identify hotspots and help employees manage stress, drug problems or other personal or work-related problems lowers threats and heightens productivity.<P>It's also important to communicate company strategies or initiatives to employees, rather than leaving them to draw their own conclusions about the future. <P>The study's sponsor, the IFMA,  conducts research and educates businesses on management strategies for human resources, organization and real estate assets, and has branches throughout the U.S. and Canada.     <P><b>More Growth Companies</b><P>In the December issue of ER, we told you that Saxonburg-based II-VI Inc. was the region's No. 1 growth company. II-VI's staggering growth rate of 62.36 percent over the past five years placed it atop the sixth annual list.<P>The Top 10, compiled by Parker/Hunter Inc., gauges public companies on the growth of their earnings per share over five years. What we didn't mention were the names of some other companies with strong growth that did not make the list because of "technicalities."<P>Medrad, for instance, had a five-year growth rate of 20.33 percent, which would have placed it at No. 5 had it not been acquired by Schering AG.<P>And where was Fore Systems? It was among five companies that have shown substantial growth but did not make this year's list because of insufficient history. The others were American Eagle Outfitters, Black Box Corp., Cable Design Technology and General Nutrition Centers. The requirements for consideration are pretty simple:<P>1.	The company must be headquartered in southwestern Pennsylvania.<P>2.	Shares must be publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange or NASDAQ.<P>3.	The company must have five years of historical earnings per share data available.<P>4.	After excluding all extraordinary gains and charges, a company must have reported earnings in each of the past five years, and estimated 1995 earnings must exceed the prior year's.<P>5.	Those companies with peak earnings prior to 1990 are excluded.<P>6.	The company must show positive revenue growth over the past five years.<P>7.	The five-year growth rate is calculated using the least-square method. The data points are the past five years' earnings per share data and the current year's analyst projection. If an analyst projection is unavailable, we use analysts' consensus data from Zack's Investment.<P>8.	All earnings per share data are for the fiscal year end of each individual company.<P><b>A Shock Jock In The Market</b><P>Howard Stern went on the air on WXDX 106.7 FM in Pittsburgh in November, exposing listeners to the belches and dirty words that have made him the most famous disc jockey in the country. Stern predicted he would be No. 1 in the ratings in Pittsburgh within a year.<P>But was Secret Communications, owner of WXDX, taking a gamble? It slotted Stern opposite Scott Paulsen and Jim Krenn, the region's top-rated morning team at WDVE, which Secret also owns.<P>"Conventional radio wisdom doesn't apply in this hyper-competitive market," says Gene Romano, operations manager for both stations. "Our long-term goal is to have the dominant rock combo in the U.S., and that requires two dominant morning shows. Howard will help the X own new rock in Pittsburgh."<P>During Stern's on-air press conference last year, Stern, who traditionally declares war on the top DJ in each new city by holding a "funeral" for them,  asked about the competition, but was for the most part restrained. No funeral was held for Paulsen and Krenn.<P>"Times have changed for Howard," says Romano. "I don't think that's a major priority for him anymore."<P>Romano's priority is to entrench Secret Communications at the top of the Pittsburgh rock market. Romano says changes in communications law mean that Secret can pursue the goal of controlling the rock segment of the airwaves here. In other words, more advertising dollars would be paid to Secret.<P>Currently WDVE plays rock, while WXDX has an alternative music format. Plans may be in the works to acquire another station pursuant to  new regulations allowing ownership of more than two stations in a market. WXDX will eventually move to 105.9 FM, currently held by WAMO, and boost its wattage from 47,000 to 72,000. WAMO will move to 106.7 FM in a swap that includes a $14 million payment from Secret to WAMO owner Sheridan Broadcasting.<P>Romano says the strategy pitting Stern against Paulsen and Krenn makes long-term sense, and that he has great confidence in Paulsen and Krenn to get better and better. As for Stern? In his first month on the air, he rocketed into third place among 25- to 34-year-olds with an 8.6 share, while Paulsen and Krenn maintained a solid domination with a 21.4 share.                                 n<P>

<font size=+1>Respironics' Strong Month Proves Its Doubters Wrong
</font><BR>
<i>By Doug Thomas
</i></b>

<HR>
Respironics is on a roll.<P>The company capped a phenomenal period of announcements in early 1996 with perhaps the best of them all: The Food & Drug Administration cleared the company to market two new masks designed for use with its airway pressure delivery systems. It was just another affirmation of Respironics' leading position as the world's leading maker of respiratory medical products.<P>Earlier, Respironics had posted record results for its fiscal second quarter, which ended Dec. 31, without sacrificing its investment in research and development. Sales rose 27 percent while earnings increased 30 percent. Gross margins remained strong at       56 percent. Sales in Europe were also higher than analysts had predicted.<P>The FDA also granted Respironics approval to market its Aria CPAP System in the United States. The Aria is the most technologically advanced and patient-friendly device on the market for sleep-apnea sufferers. <P>All of this is vindication for chief executive Dennis Meteny and the rest of the management team, who as recently as last summer were fighting off ridiculous accusations from short-sellers. In these pages in the July issue, we correctly predicted the resurgence of Respironics and its stock price. At the time, the stock price was 13 1/2. It closed in early February at 23 5/8.<P>Around the Index<P>	Performance was mixed among ER Index companies for the month ended Jan. 19, with technology companies and stainless steel producers doing well and with banks and healthcare companies generally performing poorly. Declines of 10 percent or more in General Nutrition, Mylan, Northstar and Tuscarora offset solid performances from Westinghouse, Universal Stainless, Cable Design and Mine Safety, leading to a 1.18 percent decline, slightly worse than the S&P 500's decline of 0.73 percent.<P>Since inception, however, the ER Index has maintained an edge over the S&P 500, returning 33.84 percent to the S&P 500's 32.65 percent.<P>u	One of the newest members to the index, Universal Stainless & Alloy Products, posted an exceptional       13.1 percent gain in the month to        11 7/8. Universal Stainless, headquartered in Bridgeville, is a mini-mill that manufactures and markets semi-      finished specialty steels. <P>For its fourth quarter and full year ended Dec. 31, the company reported dramatic increases in sales and earnings. Net income for the fourth quarter increased to $1.2 million or 24 cents per share, versus a loss of $1.3 million or 44 cents per share a year ago. Sales for the period increased 139 percent to $12.5 million. For the full year, net income reached $2.7 million or            57 cents per share on a 718 percent increase in sales to $46.9 million. The primary driver of this growth is the explosive demand for stainless steel, resulting in in-creased volume and a growing customer base. Many larger competitors who have been unable to meet demand and are unwilling to invest to expand capacity have chosen to outsource production to specialty steel companies like Universal Stainless.<P>u	After a poor performance last month, technology stocks staged a comeback. II-VI Inc. announced results for its second quarter ended Dec. 31, with net income jumping 40 percent to $834,000 or 14 cents per share, on a 34.7 percent gain in revenue to          $7.9 million. Bookings for the quarter increased 56 percent to $10.5 million. Says Francis Kramer, the company's president: "The record bookings for the quarter reflect the ever increasing demand for our products. We have recently completed a major manufacturing expansion program and are poised to meet the challenge."<P>u	Cable Design Technologies continued its strong performance with its second month of double digit increases, appreciating 15.4 percent. Taking full advantage, the company announced on Jan. 23 that it plans to sell an additional 5.7 million shares of stock. It will mark CDT's second secondary offering since the company went public in November 1993. <P>u	Shares of Mellon Bank fell 4.66 percent, after the company announced earnings that fell a penny short of analysts' estimates. Net income for the fourth quarter of $164 million or $1.18 per share came in below the average estimate of $1.19 per share. One factor contributing to the shortfall was an increasing provision for loan losses that reached $35 million.                         n<P>Doug Thomas is vice president of research for Lancaster, Pa.-based Emerald Asset Management.<P>

<hr>
If you call the number on a jar of Davide pasta sauce you'll likely get David(e)'s wife. For Davide's 18 pastas and eight jarred sauces pass the true litmus test for homemade: They're made in David Calamosca's basement -- outfitted with commercial stirrers, cookers, pasta drying racks and the like -- from fresh ingredients he procures daily through local produce vendors.<P>Still a cottage industry, Davide's business plan is based on sweat and serendipity -- he not only hand makes, but hand delivers his products, which appear in local retail stores from GNC to Food Gallery to Pennsylvania Macaroni Co. But where once he filled 12 quart containers and sold them out of a Coleman cooler, now he's brewing up to 5000 pounds of sauce a day in his basement to fulfill contracts with hotel chains, which put his pasta on menus from Albany to San Francisco.<P>His secret? "Never compromising," says this former teacher and singer of Italian ballads. But it's been a rocky road -- early on, he made sauce exclusively for a developing chain called the Italian Oven, which led to a lawsuit that remains in civil court. Though he wouldn't talk about that dispute, he admits entrepreneurship hasn't been easy. ER's Lydia Strohl talked to Calamosca in his Penn Hills basement.<P>ER: How did this all start?<P>DC: I always tinkered around in the kitchen, since I was a child. About seven years ago, I took public my skills in making Italian food, and people began to embrace it. I only made one red sauce, and I wanted to make it with the highest quality ingredients of any sauce on the market. I think it's still true today: I don't know if people use the amounts I do. They'll say olive oil, but there might be more salt than oil, or they won't say if it's cold press. <P>I got started on a challenge. I was going to go to Nashville. I had been working as a musician for several years -- I do ballads, songs of life -- and I had some contacts there. The man that worked for Mr. Rogers at that time --  the Purple Panda, Lenny Meledandri -- owned a restaurant in New Kensington. He had just come back from Italy, and he said, David, I've never tasted food this good in my life.' We met through Mr. Rogers, who I met when I working at Turner's Dairy, here in Penn Hills. The two of them teamed up and gave me the push to market the sauce that I was making. Otherwise, I was ready to go to Nashville. I had a job lined up at a health club, I had met the guitar player for the Judds.<P>So I didn't go. I stayed and launched the business from nothing, with a Volkswagen Rabbit and Coleman coolers and a stove. I stood on the streets and in supermarkets sampling for several years before it took hold. It was tough.<P>ER: How much sauce were you making when you first started?<P>DC: I bought plastic containers down in the Strip District. I think I bought 50, and I made like two dozen and wondered, Will I ever sell all these?' I went down to the Strip and went to a store and they said they'd try it. I sold 24 pints of sauce, and I was amazed. <P>ER: And how much sauce and pasta are you making now?<P>DC: On certain days we . Otherwise, I was ready to go to Nashville. I had a job lined up at a health club, I had met the guitar player for the Judds.<P>So I didn't go. I stayed and launched the business from nothing, with a Volkswagen Rabbit and Coleman coolers and a stove. I stood on the streets and in supermarkets sampling for several years before it took hold. It was tough.<P>ER: How much sauce were you making when you first started?<P>DC: I bought plastic containers down in the Strip District. I think I bought 50, and I made like two dozen and wondered, Will I ever sell all these?' I went down to the Strip and went to a store and they said they'd try it. I sold 24 pints of sauce, and I was amazed. <P>ER: And how much sauce and pasta are you making now?<P>DC: On certain days we can make close to 5,000 pounds. We have about 18 pastas now, and eight different jarred sauces and six frozen sauces. The frozen are very small, and we're trying to reduce those. We still sell them in Pennsylvania Macaroni because I sampled there for a year. They're good, they're just hard to sell without the marketing.<P>The sauces are variations on a theme. We take the original sauce and add spice, or a little bit of mushrooms. About four years ago we started making pastas too. Very unique pastas, with fresh vegetables added, fresh garlic -- I call them accent pastas. Some of them are multi-grain, which offers nutrition. Some are made with egg whites, for people who don't want the cholesterol. They have to be one of the freshest pastas on the market, because we have such a small inventory. We're always making food.<P>ER: How wide is your distribution network geographically?<P>DC: For our retail trade, mostly in the Pittsburgh area. We first started making our sauce and putting it in plastic containers and freezing it. But we found that people don't generally look for pasta sauces in the freezer. Where I would go and sample, people would remember and come back and buy it. But I have two degenerative disks and it's hard for me to sample every day.<P>We bought a couple of pieces of equipment so that we can jar our sauce and put it out on the shelves with the other sauces. So at least we're in the same neighborhood. But the stores we haven't expanded much. We're still in the Strip District at Pennsylvania Macaroni, Benkovitz, places like the Shadyside Market, Food Gallerys. We sell a certain amount of pasta to basket companies -- Basket of Pittsburgh in the South Hills -- they send things made of Pittsburgh products. Generally we try to cater to the specialty stores. We also draw attention from the health food stores. It's an all-natural product, it fits into the Italian category, we fit into the gourmet arena, so there's three or four main avenues for the sauce. But unfortunately, other than direct sales, I really haven't spent any time or funds on marketing. I think that's why we're sitting in my basement now. <P>     Maybe I was an idealist, but I had hoped that people would read labels more, that people would look at the product itself -- but when you get a sauce that might end up costing 30 percent more than commercial sauces, then you look at it and say, Well, what's the difference?' And people don't have time to look at it and read the label -- some people don't. They're not going to experiment for $3. But the people who have tried it, my goodness.<P>ER: How did you raise money to get the business started?<P>DC: There was no money. A friend of mine had a pizza shop and I was licensed to make the product there. I've never taken a loan for anything. The traditional Italian way is to buy as you can afford. That's the way I did it. My car was paid for. I bought Coleman coolers. I bought the pot. I bought the gas to put in the car and drive around. This house was half this size. It was paid for. This is an old community -- my grandparents lived here, my father came from Italy. We've lived in this community since the '20s. I think I got one loan, for the Ford out there. It's mostly sweat, drive and conviction.<P>I'm glad I did it this way. People said, You can't do it. You'll never sell a sauce. Your ingredients are too expensive. You can't keep up with the volume.' Obviously, you can't provide for all of America, or all of Pittsburgh, out of a basement. I'd like someday to sell it to the whole country, that's my goal, to show people la verita de la cusine Italiana -- the truth of the Italian cuisine.<P>I lived in Italy many years. If you went to Italy and showed them the commercial sauces, they wouldn't know what you were talking about. I've had people come many times and just for jokes we'll open jars of commercial sauces. They'll say, What's that?' And I'll tell them, That's what the Americans call pasta sauce.' And they just laugh, and we eat our homemade sauce, and go on with life.<P>ER: Do you still do all your own face-to-face marketing?<P>DC: Yes. I have Rusty, who's been here about a year, and Janet, who's been here for five years, my mother -- bless her she's 73 -- comes over and helps. We got hit hard in 1991, we lost about 90 percent of our business. My mother and father both came over here -- if it wasn't for family I would not be able to survive. <P>ER: What kind of profit can you make?<P>DC: It's not that big. The gourmet stuff is $2.45 a jar, for 14 ounces. We started selling the pints for $2.75 seven years ago. Now they're $2.45. I haven't raised my prices extravagantly. I buy more, so it costs a little less, but that was seven years ago.<P>It costs me almost $2.00 to make it. I make a whopping 50 cents on the jar, maybe $6.00 on the case. But it's all straight forward, it's legitimate. You can't hide taste. There's no fine print. It's real honest.<P>But let's face it, some people can't afford it. Even if it's a lot better, to raise a family on a 14-ounce jar of gourmet stuff is snobbery.  So in 1995 I came out with a 26-ounce jar that is really good. It is not a compromise. So what if it just has pure olive oil. So what if I put a little water in with the tomatoes. So what if I don't use carrots, I just use onions and garlic, so I don't spend all that time chopping. It's still really good, but it's a Chevy, it's not a Mercedes. <P>The 26-ounce jar sells for about, on average for a good mark-up for a store, about 30 percent. The consumer can get it for $3.49. That's about          50 cents more than the closest competitor. You can get a Classico for about $2.69. <P>But that $3.49 sauce, I promise you, anyone with a scrutinizing palate will love it. For crying out loud it costs $2.99 for a bag of chips. They're getting olive oil, onions, fresh tomatoes -- I still use the best tomatoes in all my sauces. I'm hoping it's going to pull this business to another level.<P>ER: The bulk of your sales is wholesale? What's the percentage?<P>DC: Probably about 70-30. We've been fortunate to pick up a number of hotels. One particular buyer came to us from an international company about three years ago. They have quality people and a master chef. They said, This is the finest sauce we've ever tasted.' I still service them, they're my largest account. There are a number of hotels that use it -- Marriots, Sheratons, Holiday Inns, Don's Bar, New York Palace -- from Key West to Albany. There are a couple of restaurants here that use it too.<P>We have so many calls where people have said, I just want you to know this is the best stuff I've ever had.' <P>ER: How do you let people know that?<P>DC: I don't. I'm a stone age marketer. I don't run coupons or specials. A part of me is prideful in that respect, because I'm thinking of how it was. <P>I was very prideful. It had to be the best. But I've gone from extra virgin to pure olive oil -- that to me was a step down. But by most people's standards -- my gosh, you can buy sauce with  hydrogenated soy bean oil in it. When you're not using it, you got a leak in your radiator?<P>But it's my face on that jar. This is homemade, we're sitting in my home. It's not home-style, it has no lady on the label who probably never existed. It's the truth.<P>I'm a tangible guy. I work with vegetables, with things you can see. This business represents anybody who wants to strike out on their own and do it better, do it with honesty and integrity. It is becoming increasingly difficult, because there is a drunkenness and a stupor that has blinded a lot of us to the truth. I think we're all compromised. The whole country has just sort of said, We don't care any more.'<P>ER: How do you stick to that as your company grows?<P>DC: You end up in your basement, in Penn Hills. You're with your children, you haven't made them orphans. I want to make a difference in the way people eat and the way people think. I'm just getting back to good old American values.<P>The way I expand my product line is just to do something that's good, and to try to do it better than anyone else. Cooking is an art, it goes through you. My seafood sauce is based on my dad's recipe, but it's the way I interpret it. At the level we're at, we're as homemade as -- it would be like if you came in to buy shoes and we took that shoe and built it around your foot. That's how we do things. Four thousand gallons -- do you know what commercial plants make in one day? It's 200 miles wide and 400 miles long just where they grow tomatoes. They produce like 10 million cases of tomatoes in six weeks. I'm like a grain of sand.<P>ER: What are your plans for the future?<P>DC: This is January, we just had two or three feet of snow. I don't know, I guess I'm waiting for a Messiah. <P>One thing is to continue to invest in my employees, give them a good environment, create more products, keep my family together, keep my health. Basically do what I've been doing for seven years. There are probably a lot of people like me. I don't know how many people make Salsa Italiano in their basement. <P>ER: Do you want to always keep it here in your basement?<P>DC: My goodness, no. There are times, before we had improved our ventilation, that you'd smell like garlic all the time. It's been hard. Even if you want to take a day off, people come to your house. It's a quiet little living and it's convenient. But my goodness, I would love to get into another facility. I would like to do that, and to hire someone to do the sales. I'm beat up. I'm burned out. I'm waiting for something beyond my ability to happen.<P>This kind of stuff is what made America. You can be a philosopher, you can be a dreamer, but you have to have a trade. Or else you're just a cream puff. What I would like to see is I do what I do best, that I make the food and someone come along and use it. I just want to make it, and go for my walks in the woods, and go to Italy.   <P>

<font size = +1>A Native Pittsburgher Brings Some Unique Flavors Home
</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl
</I></B>
<p>

<hr>
He's been 'round the world twice, worked with  Wolfgang Puck and Robert Carrier, pioneered "spa" cuisine, and fed celebrities like Jack Nicholson and Woody Harrelson. Now, Pittsburgh native Eric Melley is back, to serve his mother.<P>Yes, his mother, Nina, after whom his new restaurant in Highland Park is named. Formerly La Foret, the restaurant was sold to Melley by friends Candace and Michael Uricchio last fall. After a lightning quick facelift, Nina opened in late December. <P>Like a lot of the restaurateurs coming to town, Melley knows how important the little details are. The service is remarkably friendly; the ladies' room boasts real towels, and a self-service concierge desk is in the offing. Melley is contracting with local artists to show work on the walls of Nina's two dining rooms, which will seat about 65. Downstairs is casual, but the upstairs room is elegant, painted in shades of cream and taupe and furnished with the original chairs. <P>But Melley is first and foremost a chef, and the food is Nina's shining star. His "New American" cuisine blends tastes from the world over. <P>The menu reads easily. Rather than spending time coming up with fancy and confusing names, Melley titles appetizers simply potato sandwich, portabello or shrimp.  Entrees include gnocchi, beef, chicken and salmon. In the subtext, however, we find that a potato sandwich is not just a couple of russets on Wonder bread, but "built with smoked salmon, lemon creme fraiche, sevruga caviar and warmed chive sauce." <P>The important thing to note here is that Melley not only creates a dish to sound good on the menu -- his cook staff really delivers. The dishes we tried were cooked to perfection -- no underdone meat, no half-hearted herbing, no afterthought side dishes. They also plan to offer, for $49.96 (in honor of the year), a tasting menu of a minimum of five courses, made with the best and most exotic ingredients available that day. And Melley promises to be rigorous about quality control.<P>"If I'm not here, we're not open,"says Melley, 34, who lives on the restaurant's third floor. <P>For appetizers, we chose the cavatelli, a penne pasta graced with smoky prosciutto chunks and tawny nuggets of pumpkin, creamy goat cheese and a sage sauce. The ingredients were fresh, and the tastes nicely balanced. We also tried the antipasti, which will rotate, but this night consisted of a sweet red pepper and goat cheese spread with crusty baguette, roasted garlic and grilled asparagus with frisse (a green resembling chicory) topped with lemon vinaigrette. Although not remarkable, it was beautifully balanced. The Nina salad is a nice mix of greens with a lemon herb dressing. The dressing is light and conservatively applied, accentuating the differing textures and tastes. <P>For entrees, we chose the salmon, seared to perfection, served on a bed of creamy leeks and surrounded by a port basalmic vinegar sauce. Dots of hand-crafted artichoke gnocci circled the fish -- they were smooth palate cleansers, with a hint of citrus. The beef was the killer, a perfect filet encrusted in pepper, coriander and herbs, also on a bed of creamed leeks. The wine list is quite expansive and reasonable, but is mostly what was left from La Foret's cellar. That will change, but hopefully the innovation and reasonable prices will not.<P>Stick around for dessert. The espresso granite resembles a gourmet sno-cone, shaved ice flavored like the richest coffee ice cream imaginable. We also tried the chocolate macaroon sandwich, a chewy hunk of macaroon enclosing white chocolate and vanilla bean mousse and slices of mango, in a raspberry puree.<P>Melley's talking about another restaurant, and about cooking classes on days the restaurant is closed.<P>Seems he's here to stay.

<font size=+1>With Foerster Out, Who Will Pull the Strings in Harrisburg?                

</font><BR>
<i>By Jim Strader
</i>

<HR>
In the not-so-olden days, one of the surest ways to get things done in Harrisburg for the Pittsburgh area was to see Tom Foerster.<P>The longtime political potentate had ties to the Capitol forged as far back as his days in the Legislature and tempered over the quarter-century he served as chairman of the Allegheny County Commissioners. Working relationships with governors and fellow Democrats in the General Assembly  helped the region gain needed attention and dollars over the years.<P>But last year's political shakeup changed all that. <P>Oddly, the political demise of Commissioners Tom Foerster and Pete Flaherty was started within their own party. In the spring primary, Democrats ousted Foerster and Flaherty and chose state Sen. Mike Dawida and Colleen Vuono to run in the fall. Voters in the general election finished the job, by giving the commission majority to Republicans by re-electing Larry Dunn and pairing him with Robert Cranmer.<P>Fresh from the Senate, with plenty of Capitol contacts and connections, Dawida seemed poised for Foerster's mantle. Instead, he picked up Dunn's cloak as minority member of the board and Dunn began building his own regime.<P>The unexpected turn of events poses the question: Who gets things done for Pittsburgh in the Capitol?<P>"I think a rising star will be Jack Wagner, though he's still a <P>quasi-freshman senator," says political observer William J. Green. <P>Wagner, a Democrat, succeeded the late Sen. Eugene Scanlon after serving as Pittsburgh City Council president and losing a bid for mayor. Hart, a Republican from the North Hills, heads the Senate Finance Committee.<P>"Given the turnaround, you have to look at people like Jack and Melissa Hart," Green says. <P>As for the state House, Green sees things as "a little more muddled." A slight Republican margin last year forced the ouster of Democrats Bill DeWeese of Greene County and Ivan Itkin of Allegheny County from majority leadership positions. Republican Matthew Ryan of Delaware County replaced DeWeese as speaker. Itkin lost the majority leader's job to John Perzel of Philadelphia. <P>"The seniority has really taken a beating out here on both sides," Green says, also noting the loss of Scanlon, a longtime lawmaker. "DeWeese, I think, still holds up this end of the state and western Pennsylvania fairly well."<P>"You really have a new game here," says political consultant Dennis M. Casey. "You have new troops coming on the field. We've got a new governor in Harrisburg; you've got new county commissioners here."<P>Power brokers of the past, Casey says, built alliances on shared experiences, such as efforts to soften the decline of the steel industry. Today's leaders lack that kind of common history and the authority that comes with it, he says.		<P>"Nobody seems to have yet emerged to be the policy wonk of western Pennsylvania and as I think about it, it's a little bit scary," Casey says. "That relationship just isn't there anymore."<P>Mayor Tom Murphy came to city hall from the statehouse. But  Murphy's tenure has not given him the opportunity to do much with his Harrisburg links, Casey says. <P>"He's sort of exhausted his clout. I think Tom's like a guy who's on a ship that has 18 holes in it and he's busily running around plugging holes. The ship's still afloat, but everybody knows that it's sinking," Casey says.<P>"Murphy has to go to Harrisburg hat in hand now. He's not going up there to bring them something, he's always asking for something."<P>Others from the Pittsburgh area are in key positions in Harrisburg. Tom Corbett, the former U.S. attorney, is now attorney general. Upper Saint Clair's Mike Fisher, the Senate majority whip, hopes to succeed Corbett. <P>And the region can rely on Gov. Tom Ridge, Green maintains, no matter that the governor's home is in Erie and that he spent a dozen years in Congress fighting for the interests of the state's northwest corner.<P>"Gov. Ridge, born in Munhall, is still deferential to western Penn-       sylvania," says Green, who was an aide to the last governor Pittsburgh sent across the Susquehanna, Dick Thornburgh.<P>"There's still a friend in the governor's mansion," Green says.                 <P>

Really Cooking</font></B><br>
<B><I><font size=+1>As More Families Elect to Eat Out,<br>Culinary Schools Find Their Students in Demand
</font></I></B><br>
<i>By Gretchen McKay</i></center>

<HR>
Amie Ruffner knew what she wanted when she graduated from high school last year: a good job, fast.<P>College? Not quite. She enrolled at the Pennsylvania Institute of Culinary Arts in downtown Pittsburgh.<P>"I didn't want to stay in school too long, and I've always loved to cook," the 18-year-old says. But the biggest draw was the potential for work.<P>"Even a college degree doesn't guarantee a job today," Ruffner says. "But the culinary field is filled with opportunity. People are always going to be eating."<P>Ruffner knows of what she speaks. The future is bright for those considering careers in the culinary field, thanks to the increasing number of two-income families and working mothers who've come to rely on eating out. The U.S. Department of Labor predicts the number of jobs in the food service industry to grow by 30 percent in the next decade, from 9.5 million jobs in 1990 to 12.4 million in 2005.<P>What's more, the demand for professional cooks and chefs will jump by 35 percent during that period, from 602,000 to 879,000 positions. <P>Though it's not a particularly lucrative career at first -- culinary students typically earn between $15,000 to $20,000 their first year out of school -- it holds potential. Top chefs can easily pull in six figures, and motivated young cooks can expect to double their starting salaries within five years. <P>There are five schools in the region that offer degrees in the culinary arts, with programs ranging from 16 months to three years of study and costing between $4,300 and $20,000. Ruffner's school, the Pennsylvania Institute of Culinary Arts, accepts more than 700 students from 36 states each year. They choose between two associate degrees in food service: specialized technology in culinary arts and specialized business in restaurant management. <P>Both accredited tracks take 16 months, or four semesters, to complete. They include a four-month paid "externship" at the end of the program.<P>Restaurant management students also get hands-on experience operating the school's street-front restaurant, Brendan's, on Liberty Avenue.<P>But the real selling point, says PICA vice president Tom Pasternak, is their 100 percent placement record. <P>"We spend time and effort in each and every student, and it pays off," says Pasternak. "Recruiters come back year after year because we train cooks who are able to work hard and know what they're doing."<P>The tuition cost of $18,962 covers books, materials, uniforms and cutlery for the entire program.<P>Only a few blocks away is the International Culinary Academy, which accepts 250 students a year. There, the four-day school week is headed up by executive chef Joseph D. Parrotto Jr. Over the course of the 18-month program, students spend 75 percent of their time in the kitchen lab.<P>They also study the business side of the culinary world, with courses in business math, entrepreneurship and kitchen operations. Both tracks end with a paid externship.<P>ICA boasts a 99 percent placement rate for its graduates, placing cooks and pastry chefs in all of Pittsburgh's top restaurants as well as five-star resorts and restaurants around the country. <P>"We have established a strong reputation because employers know we have well-trained people," says Parrotto. "We do not put students out of this school who can't do the work."<P>ICA's total tuition cost is $15,550, which covers books, materials, uniforms and cutlery. <P>Relatively new on the scene is the Indiana University of Pennsylvania Academy of Culinary Arts, located in Punxsutawney. It accepts between 85 to 100 new students each fall. <P>IUP, which started its culinary arts program in 1990, offers a 16-month, four-semester certificate program under the direction of Chef Albert Wutsch. The 2,250-hour curriculum also emphasizes the business aspect of professional cooking, with courses in management, computers, purchasing, accounting and menu design. Students must complete a paid externship prior to graduation.<P>What sets IUP apart from its competitors, says Wutsch, is the fact that the culinary school is a division of a full university, thereby affording students access to everything on campus. Culinary graduates can transfer 36 credits toward a bachelor of science degree in hotel, restaurant and institutional management.<P>The cost of $14,792 includes textbooks, uniforms and equipment.<P>On a budget? The most affordable culinary programs in the area are those offered through two community colleges: the Community College of Allegheny County and the West- moreland County Community College.  Like the more expensive schools, the community colleges include kitchen training under professional chefs and paid externships at the end of the programs.<P>The main difference is cost: CCAC is $4,300 for the three-year apprentice program and $3,760 for the two-year associate degree program. WCCC is even less expensive, topping out at about $3,000 for its programs.              <P>

<B><font size=+2>Protect the Business</font><br><font size=+1>Small Businesses That Tap Foreign Markets Have a<br>Built-in Safewguard When Domestic Markets Go Flat<br>
</font></B><i>By Henry Lipput</center></i><P>


<HR>
When executives at Bricmont Inc. sat down to develop a long-range strategy a few years back, they knew they had strong domestic markets, but still wanted to broaden the company's horizons.<P>Smart move.<P>Small businesses like Bricmont leave themselves vulnerable when they limit the markets in which they can sell their goods and services. It's the proverbial putting all of your eggs in one basket.<P>Bricmont would have none of that.<P>"The domestic market has been fairly good, this [exporting] is really on top of our traditional business," says David C. Gilbert, senior vice president of sales for Bricmont, a construction engineering firm.<P>"We sat down a few years ago and decided to do a strategic plan, and the <P><P>strategic plan really involved a commitment to do more and more offshore work.  Not necessarily because the market was flat at the time, but traditionally, the industries we deal with here are very cyclical.  We wanted <P>to expand our business to help <P>offset some future low point in the U.S. market."<P>Now, only a couple years later, overseas work accounts for about 60 percent of Bricmont's total sales. The Washington County firm specializes in combustion and heat transfer, catering primarily to steel, glass and aluminum producers.<P>The impetus for the current <P>surge of foreign orders was a recent domestic job that involved a new kind of furnace.<P>"The main product we've been successful with offshore, at least to start with, is a tunnel furnace that is a specialized type of furnace that fits into a new process," says Gilbert. <P>The furnace was developed by a German company, but its first purchaser was an American company.  Bricmont got the order to install the new furnace and has used it as a springboard to attract other clients, mostly foreign, who were interested in the new process.<P>"As a result of our involvement we had a very good competitive advantage," says Gilbert.  "People in Mexico wanted to do it, the next thing the people in India wanted to install one, and obviously we were one of the preferred bidders for the furnace then as a result  of our experience in doing the first."<P>Gilbert believes that beginning an overseas marketing effort can be a very <P><P>expensive proposition unless you have something unique to offer. <P>"In our case, we got involved with a new technology that was timed perfectly in the industry and was needed by a lot of the third world countries," he says. "We sort of rode the coattails of new technology."<P>Other companies are less deliberate about exporting. Bally Design of Pittsburgh, for instance, had foreign jobs fall in its lap as a result of previous relationships. Founder Alex Bally, through his employment at Westing-house's Corporate Design Center and teaching at Carnegie Mellon University, has acquired a number of foreign contracts, including one for athletic shoemaker Adidas.<P>"One of my former students, who worked with us, left Bally Design and eventually ended up at Adidas," Bally says.  "He heard that they had tried to design a robot, a testing robot, for soccer shoes and soccer balls, and that they couldn't find anybody who could do it or dared.  He suggested to them Why don't you call those guys in Pittsburgh, they might do it. They'll do anything.'"  	<P>It wasn't a job that Bally sought, but it wasn't one that he was going to turn down.<P>"Our view has been more of going where we're wanted, and where we're needed, and where the projects are, and where we can make a difference.  And if they happen to be overseas, great.  We're not really actively pursuing that in the sense that we have foreign marketing strategies or something like that. But we have a pretty successful track record [with our foreign clients] and they keep coming back.  It seems to have its own momentum."<P>The Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Development Council created international trade development to provide support to local companies that hope to export.  In 1994, the Council surveyed 700 local companies concerning their export activity and found there was a "lack of commitment" on the part of small and medium-sized businesses in the region when it comes to international trade.  Although there are a relatively small number of experienced exporters in the region, the council concluded that a majority of businesses could increase their level of international business fairly easily and, in the process, also help the local economy.<P>The bulk of companies not ready to export were those with less than 50 employees and without the resources to begin an overseas marketing effort.  The council recommends that businesses work together to establish small trading networks as well as mentoring cycles, trade alliances and client tracking systems to help each other to increase the export capabilities of <P>the region.			    <P>

<B><font size=+2>No-Complete Covenants</font><br><font size=+1>Did a Pennsylvania Appeals Court<br>Ruling Limit Their Effectiveness?<br>
</font></B><i>By Jim Urban</center></i><P>


<HR>
Shortly after Insulation Corp. of America fired Richard Brobston in 1993, the former ICA general manager ignored a noncompetiton agreement he previously had signed and went to work for a competitor.<P> ICA, in turn, went straight to civil court in an attempt to enforce the no-compete agreement.<P>A Lehigh County judge upheld the contract, which barred Brobston from working for any competitor within 300 miles for three years. But the Superior Court of Pennsylvania had other ideas. On appeal, the court reversed the decision and sided with Brobston in a ruling that some say is bad for employers.<P>"It had long been thought that such agreements were enforceable whether the employee left the company voluntarily or was terminated. That is, until now," says attorney Thomas Madigan of Cohen & Grigsby. <P>In Brobston's appeal, the Superior Court turned the case in his favor because Brobston was fired for the declining or stagnant sales among his accounts. The court reasoned that if Brobston was of little value to ICA, then ICA should have no concern about his working for the competitor.<P>"The employer who fires an employee for failing to perform in a manner that promotes the employer's business interests deems the employee worthless," Superior Court Judge James Kelly wrote for the appeals court panel. "Once such a determination is made by the employer, the need to protect itself from the former employee is diminished by the fact that the employee's worth to the corporation is presumably insignificant."<P>For years, employers have required their technical and sales employees to sign no-compete agreements. Penn-sylvania courts traditionally recognized such agreements as business necessities, enforcing them as long as the employee received something in return for signing and the no-compete prohibitions were reasonable in terms of duration and geographic scope.<P>"In one sense, the [Brobston] ruling gives employees subject to noncompetition agreements job security," says Madigan. "Employers will have to think twice before terminating an employee subject to a noncompetition agreement, letting him or her free to work for a direct competitor."<P>Arthur J. Schwab, a veteran litigator for Buchanan Ingersoll, says the Brobston ruling mirrors those in other states and is not that surprising. <P>"The courts have always applied equitable principles," Schwab says. "It's always been more difficult to enforce no-compete agreements when you terminate an employee without cause, especially for lack of performance."<P><P>Make It Enforceable<P>A key to enforcing no-compete agreements is narrow construction, according to Schwab.<P>"Particular customers, products, particular market segments," says Schwab, "the more narrow the covenant the more apparent it is to the court that the employer has a legitimate, protectable interest."<P>Most employers can start with a standard form, but it should be modified so it is unique for that specific employee, Schwab says.<P>"Don't try to get more than you need," adds Robert McTiernan of Tucker Arensberg. "If you need a period of time to get someone trained and acquainted, that's the amount of time you put in the agreement.<P>"Courts will wonder if you are just trying to burden a future competitor or really protecting your own business interests," McTiernan says.<P>As with any contract, each party must receive something in return for what they're giving up. Pennsylvania courts say mere continued employment is not adequate. Thus, it's wise for employers to include some sort of promotion, bonus or salary increase in consideration of the employee's signature on the no-compete agreement. In the Brobston case, Brobston received a $2,000 raise when he signed the no- compete covenants, and the court said that was adequate.<P><P>The Future<P>Labor attorneys say they see  employers using the no-compete agreements in an increasing variety of industries. And in a way, the increased use is turning these agreements into double-edged swords.<P>While no-compete agreements do protect the employers, they also limit the pool of talent from which employers can hire. There may be four good candidates to fill a position, but all four may have signed no-compete agreements with their employers.<P>So what's the employer who is looking to hire supposed to do?<P>"Anymore, I get almost as many calls from perspective employers     who are trying to hire someone        who is subject to one of these agreements," McTiernan says. "Many are reluctant to challenge an agreement in court. You hire the employee, and         it creates litigation for the employer. You are immediately sued. You incur legal fees.<P>"But one client fought this and won. As it turned out, this was a very good em-ployee for the client and I think the client felt it was well worthwhile in the end."  <P>

<B><font size=+2>Athletes and Restaurants</font><br><font size=+1>Here's One Guy Who Smiled When<br>Rod Woodson Blew Out his Knee<br>
</font></B><i>By Bill Modoono</center></i><P>


<HR>
It's probably safe to say that Bill Dieterle was the only person in Pitts-burgh who could see the bright side when Rod Woodson was felled by a season-ending knee injury early in the 1995 season.<P>OK, he's from Cleve-land, but this was not Browns' love at work. This was strictly business.<P>"When he got hurt, I smiled," Dieterle says. "I knew he had hit a home run for us."<P>"Us" in this instance refers to Woodson's All-Star Grille, which Dieterle, a national restaurant consultant, and Woodson, the Steelers' Pro Bowl cornerback, opened in August. While Woodson's injury limited his availability for the Steelers, it increased his presence at the restaurant.<P>"The key ingredient in this is the active involvement of Rod Woodson," Dieterle says. "I knew his injury would mean he would be around more, and  that would add credibility to the restaurant."<P>Though athletes have been opening restaurants since the time of Babe Ruth, today's public wants more than just a famous name on the napkin. For these star/restaurateurs, credibility in the restaurant business extends to the tenderness of the sirloin.<P>What's happened is the restaurant business has merged with the entertainment business. The best examples of this are the Planet Hollywood restaurants opening around the country, always after splashy soirees fea- turing celebrity owners Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis. You don't go to Planet Hollywood just for a meal; you go to bask in the star power.<P>In Pittsburgh, star athletes such as Woodson are the celebrities. And Woodson's, located near Station Square, entertains immediately. To the left, a gift shop sells NFL jerseys, T-shirts and assorted other items, including the menu, which resembles a game day program. To the right is a video arcade. Scattered throughout are authentic-looking sports uniforms and helmets, and the big screen TVs common in sports bars.<P>It's the kind of place people get a kick just walking around. Many do.<P>It's also a place where people enjoy being during big sports events such as Steelers playoff games. At press time, the restaurant  was on pace to do         $5 million in business during the first full year, well over Dieterle's original estimate of $3.7 million. After Super Bowl Sunday, the ante will certainly have gone up. And while the place does seem to have multiple personalities -- part family restaurant, part tourist attraction, part business lunch and part sports bar -- the combination is working much better than it did for the former Sports Garden.<P>So Woodson's has made it, right? Hardly -- remember that sirloin.<P>Getting exposure -- which most athlete-owned establishments can do quite well -- is only part of the battle, and a small part at that. Ask Mike Ditka, whose restaurant in Chicago closed after a few years. Perhaps the Chicago Tribune said it best: Jocks in the restaurant industry usually do about as well as businessmen would do as linebackers in the NFL.<P>The famous name can pull customers in once, but diners won't return if the prices are high and the food lacking. <P>And it's important to keep the spacious Woodson's filled; any sense of emptiness is just magnified on a slow night. Word gets around quickly in a town like Pittsburgh. It doesn't help that the restaurant business is highly competitive: For most restaurants, a pre-tax profit margin of 4 percent is good.<P>"Restaurants operate under an extremely narrow profit margin," says Wendy Webster of the National Restaurant Association. "It's an extremely labor-intensive industry."<P>So the question is: Will Pittsburgh diners still find Woodson's tasty after the novelty wears off? Woodson would do well to emulate another Steeler defensive back, J.T. Thomas of the Super Bowl teams, who runs the Applebee's franchise in western Pennsylvania. Nobody goes to his restaurants because he's connected to them; they go for the food, price and atmosphere. <P>If the same can someday be said of Woodson's, he will have arrived as a restaurateur.                                           <P><P><P>

<b><font size =+1>Eye Surgeons See More People<br>Who Want 20/20 Vision ... Now</b></font><br>
<i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
</center><P>


<HR>
Ray Jakomas has worn glasses his entire life. When he was younger, it meant the usual taunts of "four eyes" and "bottle corks." Mildly annoying.<P>But as he became older, his 20/400 vision actually became dangerous: as a construction worker, Jakomas spent most of his time up four stories or  higher, even when weather conditions reduced visibility through his glasses.<P>"When it would rain, I couldn't see for the mist on my eyes," says 53-year-old Jakomas, who wore glasses to work and contact lenses at other times. "It was a pain. Every morning I would get up, and have to put on glasses or contacts before I did anything."<P>Jakomas investigated radial keratotomy, a surgical procedure that corrects nearsightedness by making tiny incisions in the cornea, flattening its surface. (Nearsightedness occurs when the eyeball has too steep of a slope, affecting the way that light hits the back of the eye and making vision blurry.) He refrained from RK after investigation, opting instead to wait for a procedure then under FDA review: photorefractive surgery with the excimer laser. Last fall, PRK was approved. <P>Just weeks later, Jakomas underwent the procedure in one eye (it's recommended to do one at a time). After putting a few numbing drops in his eye, which was held open with a lid speculum, to numb it, Dr. Richard Stout scraped away the top layer of Jakoma's cornea with a metal tool. Then all Jakoma saw was a series of red flashes accompanied by loud crackling zaps. He catches a whiff like burnt hair. <P>The laser, which takes 200 pulses to cut through a human hair, has done its work in just 20 seconds. <P> Jakomas was almost immediately liberated from eyewear -- the post-op eye now has 20/25 vision.<P>Drs. Kondrot/Stout & Associates has had the excimer laser since 1989, as one of five clinical sites chosen by the FDA to investigate PRK. Stout estimates that between PRK, RK and ALK (automated lamellar keratoplasty, for more severe nearsightedness), he's performed about 3,000 refractive surgery procedures in the past 10 years, the majority in the last three.<P>"It's like being a carpenter -- you have to be able to use all the tools in your bag," says Stout. "Certain results are equal in terms of vision. But with higher amounts of nearsightedness,  the RK incision has to come in closer to the pupil. So with [higher amounts] I lean towards doing excimer laser. When patients come in I explain the advantages and disadvantages of each."<P>The industry is hoping that the American public will focus on the advantages. Indeed, refractive surgery is widely seen as a shot in the arm to many ophthalmologists, with decreasing rate structures and managed care eating away at their revenue. Both RK and PRK are elective procedures, and, at $1,000 an eye for RK and $2,000 for PRK, potentially lucrative.<P>But entering the market is not without risk: Summit Technologies, manufacturer of the FDA-approved excimer laser for PRK, estimates at least $1 million in first-year training and equipment costs to get it up and running. The machine alone is $485,000, plus $50,000 in annual maintenance.<P>It is, however, a risk that many are willing to take. Over 60 million Americans are nearsighted and, according to Summit spokeswoman Nancy Duden, analysts at Smith Barney have predicted that in 1996 alone, 200,000 of them will try the surgery. The company had sold 100 lasers at press time, and is spending multimillions on a nationwide ad campaign. They also plan to partner with hospitals nationwide in establishing a chain of 20 to 30 Summit Vision Centers. While none are slated for the Pittsburgh area, the technology will appear here in spades. Eye and Ear Hospital has purchased a laser.  Kondrot/Stout already owns one. St. Francis Medical Center is participating in a joint venture with Cincinnati-based chain LCA-Vision, which is setting up in eight cities. Their laser will be up later this month.<P>But while none of the doctors interviewed predicted a decrease in the price of PRK due to the excess number of local lasers, several did express concern that the procedure would be overly recommended to finance the expensive technology.<P>In fact, some ophthalmologists caution that refractive surgery as a whole has a long way to go before it's recommendable. For one thing, there are no guaranteed results for any of these procedures, which are expensive and rarely covered by insurance. But most importantly, they take perfect eyes, correctable to 20/20 with eyewear, and put them at risk.<P>"In RK, you're cutting 99 percent of the thickness of the cornea, and you always have the cuts. So you can actually rupture the eye if it's hit in the right place, like playing racquetball or tennis," says Jean Hardwick, M.D., a cornea specialist. <P>But Dr. Deepinter Dhaliwhal, chief of refractive surgery at UPMC's Eye and Ear Institute, says that updated techniques and equipment have decreased those risks enormously. The National Eye Institute recently released a study of RK results: A decade after undergoing RK, about 85 percent of 427 patients reported at least 20/40 vision, with few vision-threatening complications.<P>Though long-term results of PRK in this country are as yet unavailable, proponents say results from other countries show PRK to be as consistently successful as RK, or more. But others disagree.<P>"I've talked to ophthalmologists in Greece and Mexico who do PRK, and they say they only get the results they want 50 percent of the time, because the procedure depends on human healing, and that you can't predict," says Hardwick.<P>It's true, some will heal too much: Ray Jakoma, though delighted his nearsightedness has been alleviated, says he's now a touch farsighted -- necessitating his holding documents out away from his eyes to read them. Others will heal too little and require a second operation. And scar tissue resulting from RK can cause poor night vision.<P>Jakoma knows these possiblities. On the day he's scheduled to have the second eye done, he is so nervous that Stout must hold his head firmly to align the laser. There are 10 minutes of preparatory work, then the 20-second operation. Stout slips a bandage contact soaked with antibiotic into Jakoma's eye. Jakoma will come back tomorrow and have that removed, after which he anticipates about a day of discomfort as the eye heals. But that's it.<P>No more wise cracks about bottle corks. No more questions about whether his glasses are bulletproof. No more fumbling around with glasses and contact lenses.<P>"No trouble," Jakoma says. And he walks out of surgery 15 minutes after he arrived, minus the glasses.                       n<P>

<center><b><FONT SIZE=+2>From the Kitchen Table to the Corner Office</B>
</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=+>Business Smarts, Raw Ability and a Little Luck Helped <br>FORE Systems Grow From Humble Beginnings to Wall Street Darling
</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Richard Bierck</i>
</CENTER>
<hr>
Eric Cooper is sitting in his posh office at FORE Systems, and around him it's business as usual: FORE is acquiring another high tech company. FORE's stock is climbing. FORE is adding new employees daily.<P>And not far away in Marshall Township, construction workers are building the $40 million headquarters campus that will house all FORE operations, along with new, even more posh offices for Cooper and each of his three cofounders: Francois Bitz, Onat Menzilcioglu and Robert Sansom. <P>It wasn't always like this.<P>As a matter of fact, it wasn't like this at all for this $100 million high tech company that perfected the technology that allows people to communicate instantaneously via computers.<P>"The first mailing address was Francois' house," Cooper recalls. "It was the usual thing where we started on a kitchen table."<P>But in just over five years, Cooper and his mates have gone from the home office to the corner office, from the kitchen table to the executive dining room.<P>Many know the story of FORE's current success. This is the story of FORE's early days.<P>It was those early, modest days of FORE Systems that laid the foundation for the success FORE enjoys today. <P>Most notably, FORE's founders -- all researchers from Carnegie Mellon University -- pulled it off without adventure capital, the seed money many businesses use to survive from the concept stage to the stage where the business is established and self- sufficient.<P>FORE took a different route, linking up with the Naval Research Labs at a very fortuitous time. The Defense Department was revising the manner in which it spent its money. It wanted top-quality work at competitive market prices. In return, many contractors -- including FORE -- retained the right to take that same technology commercial. They could even sell it to the Russians if they so desired.<P>FORE'S Bitz, Menzilcioglu, Sansom and Cooper freely admit that if the Navy contract hadn't come along when it did, FORE probably wouldn't be a household word among tech-stock watchers.<P>"Considering that we had no business track record or contacts with traditional funding sources, it would have been very difficult and, I would guess, impossible for us to have gotten started,'' says Cooper, now chairman and CEO of the company.<P>"If we hadn't gotten the contract, we would have had to have a million dollars at an early stage.''<P>That's not an amount of money that is easily raised, as anyone who has tried to raise adventure capital in  western Pennsylvania can attest. But FORE's founders had perfect timing.<P>A Navy Contract<P>The Navy's ultimate goal was to spur private development of a standardized technology rather than a proprietary one that would lock the Navy into a single contractor and hold taxpayers hostage to high rates. And because the Cold War ended, the Defense Department wasn't as concerned as it was in years past about keeping technological advancements secret. <P>"It's the old $800 toilet seat, $600 hammer," Cooper says, looking back. "Everyone knows that the commercial, off-the-shelf versions cost a fraction   of that.<P>"In the computer tech area it was even worse. You'd get these systems the military commissioned, and then they were locked forever into that contractor to supply them. They wanted to get out of that,'' Cooper says. "The military was well into the new way of thinking -- they no longer wanted to be captive to suppliers and buy military-use only technology.<P>"The rationale was that the commercial marketplace would drive economies of scale, price, performance and so on, to allow the government to get a better deal, because they were just  part of a broader market.''<P>The Navy was right, and FORE was among a handful of defense contractors who benefited from the new spending philosophy.<P>Landing the crucial Naval Labs contract wasn't just out of the blue. The FORE four had worked for the labs previously, so their expertise was a known commodity. This, along with a competitive bid, got them the work.<P>Cooper remembers the relief the fledgling firm experienced when FORE got the contract. "It was tremendous. I think that's what gave us personally enough assurance that, yeah, we could quit our day jobs. That was what really assured us that we could make a go of it."<P>It also meant that Bitz got his kitchen table back. As soon as FORE landed the Navy contract, the company leased 1,300 square feet of space on Murray Avenue in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood and bought used computers and used furniture.<P>It was still humble, but it was a step ahead.<P>FORE's Niche<P>FORE's founders believed the lucrative future of networking lay in developing asynchronous transfer mode, a technology that links together computers and enables them to share information instantaneously.<P>In early 1992, FORE delivered what the Navy had ordered -- a networking device using an ATM switch that allowed computers to share data, video and voice.<P>It was an auspicious delivery. The four scientists, who named their company with an acronym for their first names, were objectively assured that the prototypical networking device was superior to any on the market. <P>FORE's technology ushered in the current networking era -- one in which corporate executives can ship a training video to dozens of employees sitting at their own personal computers and answer digital questions simultaneously, by voice and by shared notations on screen.<P>"ATM is the plumbing that allows this to happen,'' says Cooper.<P>The technology links multiple computers across a building or city or between states, allowing them to interact in multiple media simultaneously and share information that is effectively broadcast from server PCs within the network.<P>"The one thing that stuck in our minds on the initial project ... was the idea of developing a networking solution that would keep up with the high-end desktop computers that engineers and scientists were already using, because even then it was apparent that these were insufficient, and there     didn't seem to be anything in sight to improve the situation,'' says Cooper.<P>Menzilcioglu, FORE's president, believes the technology would have been available soon, even if FORE had never existed, or if the Navy had        not been seeking to spur its private development.<P> "I'm sure this idea, if not through NRL, would have caught on,'' says Menzilcioglu. "Would we have this? I'm not sure;  it's all timing.''<P> FORE's technology hinged on  a network that FORE's founders had developed  in an earlier CMU research project.  Though commercially infeasible -- in part, because it couldn't be standardized -- its essential principles were solid.<P> "Our [original] research goals put us thinking in this general direction,'' says Cooper, who's equipped with         a propeller-head beanie given him      by an investment banker ("We are    high on the geek quotient,'' he likes to say). <P>"Conveniently, the research project was ending. There were a lot of decisions up in the air about what the next phase of the project would be.''<P>At the time, the prevailing networking wind was blowing toward high-performance equipment, so many researchers aspired to develop networking solutions for super-    computers.<P>"This was not really a direction we thought was very interesting. We saw that supercomputers were going to be less and less important in the marketplace than mass-market computers, and that a network aimed at them would be more interesting for us personally,'' Cooper says. "We decided, well, we can take what we've learned and start over again using the idea of ATM. We learned about it because it was discussed in the standards committees being driven by the telecommunications industry.''<P>Applying the technology to networking then was just a concept, one that the four computer scientists began to focus on. "We thought it was applicable there ... and we seemed to be the only ones who did. We had easily a year lead [because of the Navy research], when no one else was trying to do the same thing. <P>"I can remember our biggest concern was, if this is such a great idea, why isn't there anybody else doing it?''<P>At the Pentagon<P>Did the Navy Labs expect FORE to come up with the solution it did, and to prosper subsequently?<P>Hank Dardy, chief computer scientist for the Naval Research Labs in suburban Washington, says there were no certainties, but the odds looked good early on. <P>"The Department of Defense basically looks for good technology. They looked like good technical people, and we took the chance. We hoped that, if the company's good, good technology comes out, and we can buy it instead of a proprietary solution,'' says Dardy.<P>What brought the Navy and the company together in the contract was a common belief that ATM was the best networking solution, assuming that it could be developed.<P>"The Department of Defense had to come to grips with why we couldn't support [image, voice and video] in a single network. ATM's cell size allowed this,'' says Dardy.<P>"This size is slightly larger than what you want for voice and slightly smaller than what you want for data, and it works if you do it right, with the right silicon.''<P>Without the government contract, FORE might have had to resort to venture capitalists for seed funding. This might have meant selling most of the company, and selling it cheap. Instead, in 1992, after FORE was up and running, the company sold 30 percent of its stock to venture capitalists.<P>"Once we developed our first [commercial] prototype, we almost immediately started selling, initially   to research institutions,'' recalls Menzilcioglu. "It happened through word of mouth, through the Internet. We became self-sustaining.<P>"Then venture companies started knocking on our door. We could have not taken the venture money. But we decided it would be better off taking some in case we needed it -- for expansion. Looking back, I can't say I'm sorry, because it gave us enough cushion. And when negotiating with venture capitalists, if you do a deal at a time when you don't need it, you get good terms.''<P>Rapid Growth<P>FORE completed the Navy contract in 1992 and promptly went into production as the first company to ship commercial ATM networking products. The company's owners grew suddenly rich from feeding a hungry market seeking to link multiple personal computers more efficiently. Initially, FORE didn't even have a sales person; orders for the heralded new technology just rolled in. <P>After the company went public in May 1994, the initial offering price doubled within two months and kept rising all year, prompting Fortune to list FORE as the nation's fourth fastest-growing public company in April   1995.<P>In the year ended March 31, 1995, revenues more than tripled, reaching $75.6 million. Profits increased more than two-fold, totaling $7.4 million.<P>Not a bad few years' work for former academicians still in their 30s.<P>Cooper, for one, has easily made the transition from Ph.D. to CEO. And his role grows everyday -- just look at his wardrobe. He dresses casually when he can, often in khakis, sans tie. But the tie creeps around his neck more and more often,  like a corporate vine.<P>"I can chart the growth of the company and the shift in my role by the percentage of time that I spend wearing a tie," Cooper says. "It has definitely increased -- I think I'm up to about three days a week.''<P>His style has more in common with that of the current generation of high tech entrepreneurs than with classic corporate chieftains.<P>In a departure from the traditional executive role, Cooper and other FORE executives individually take groups of line employees to lunch on a regular basis. The employees are chosen by drawing straws.<P>"I do it when I'm in the office on Fridays,'' says Cooper. "It's not with an agenda of accomplishing anything. It's not a lunch meeting. It's a way to forge some communication among people who otherwise might not be having lunch together.''<P>Like many of the software moguls of the Silicon Valley and Redmond, Wash., FORE's originators are young to be officers in a publicly traded company. At 37, Cooper might be viewed as Pittsburgh's answer to Bill Gates -- only Cooper, who lived in the same dormitory with Gates at Harvard, graduated and went on to graduate school at Berkeley. Gates, you'll recall, dropped out of Harvard.<P>FORE's Future<P>Late last year, FORE acquired Alantec, a hardware and software company whose 200 employees will remain at the company's San Jose plant. The merger includes the       conversion of about 12 million outstanding shares of Alantec stock into FORE stock. At the end of 1995, these shares had an estimated value of about $700 million.<P>Though FORE's numbers have been leaner since the spring of 1995 -- the stock grew 59 percent between April 1 and mid-December -- analyst G. Arjavalingam of Needham & Co. in New York sees this as only natural in a market that is no longer exclusive.<P>Yet Arjavalingam, putting FORE's market share at 60 percent, believes the company will dominate ATM networking for at least the next few years.<P>In the face of competition from behemoth Cisco Systems, FORE officers tout the company's distinction of concentrating solely on ATM networking devices. They maintain that this, along with FORE's head start in software, will keep their edge honed.<P>So for now, eating will probably be the only activity at Bitz's kitchen table, the site of FORE's early work. The new headquarters campus will be ready for operation late this year. Wall Street still likes the stock.<P>It's been a meteoric rise that will likely continue. It started with the Navy contract.<P>"We had used furniture, used computers," Cooper says, looking back. "It was very tight, but we were able to break even that first year and were profitable thereafter."<P>And how.                                    <P>

<b><font size=+1>We Must Have Opportunities for Graduates<br>
While Teaching Youngsters to be Visionary</font></b><br>
<i>By Cynthia Bent</i></center>
<hr>
Michael and Suzanne Lisanti came to Carnegie Mellon's MBA program with the hopes of earning a world-class degree and finding jobs in Pittsburgh. They got the first, but not the second.<P>"We were pretty upset," says Michael, a Pittsburgh native now working in Dayton, Ohio. <P>"We would loved to have stayed," adds Suzanne. "So many of us in my class wanted to stay, but only one or two could. We couldn't get jobs. We would have even taken less money, just to stay."<P>Michael now believes, having worked for a year, that he would sometime like to start his own business. "I'd like to do it in Pittsburgh, but if I started it part-time, it would have to be wherever my main job was." <P>So Pittsburgh loses two young <P>talents, and a possible startup business.<P>In Part III of Executive Report's six-month series entitled Resuscitating the Region, ER focuses on the role of education in the region's revitalization. In the coming months, ER also will look at transportation, tax reform and tour-ism as other windows of opportunity.<P>One way to pump new life into Pittsburgh, experts say, is to focus on the younger people who tend to start businesses. Pittsburgh has all the raw materials -- good schools, great universities, bulldog-like loyalty to the 'burgh -- but something is still missing. Many talented young people never stay long enough to start their businesses.<P>"Only a small fraction, about      15 percent, stay. There are better opportunities elsewhere," says Jack Thorne, who heads the Don Jones Entrepreneurial Center at CMU's business school. He has watched all too many talented grads take flight. "One student who wanted to stay finally had to take a job in Washington, D.C. He's just started his first business there. That could have been here."<P>"This trend continues to drive demographics of the area older," says Don Smith, executive director of the Center for Economic Development, also at CMU.<P>He notes that besides the fact that less young people start less businesses, 20- to 33-year-olds also tend to spend a very high percentage of their income. High-tech markets like computers and electronics are mainly pitched to the young. <P>"The newest, latest, greatest, cutting edge industries and products -- Pittsburgh misses them as the young leave," says Smith. "It's an unsustainable pattern that's been going on anecdotally since the late '70s."<P>Pittsburgh's "brain-drain" has been Tom Canfield's crusade for some time now. Canfield is the president of The Enterprise Corp., whose mission is to aid entrepreneurs. Canfield says that this region lost $6 billion in human resources since the 1980s -- the 103,000 kids who went to school here and then left. Might sound like a drastic number, but others agree with him -- it's a critical problem.<P>Canfield has a plan of his own. "We have to do proactive things to keep them here," he says. "Are there things we can do to get promising people to sink roots? Where you get your first job is probably where you'll get married, buy a house, get a mortgage and stay."<P>Canfield wants to mimic the successful Kaufmann Foundation, based in Kansas City, Mo. That group's mission is to promote entrepreneurial activity by selecting around 20 fellows and providing them with internships for two years with venture capital firms around the country.<P>"The idea here is to identify Pittsburgh Fellows' and in some way offset their high salary requirements, pay for their positions, make it attractive to stay here," says Canfield.<P>He admits the idea might affect a small number of people -- the couple of winners per year. Others who didn't qualify would nevertheless find a network to other businesses.<P>"We look to promote people who can start businesses with a gazelle' potential. If we find a few gazelles, the rabbits and goats happen," Canfield says.<P>But what about home-grown entrepreneurs? Every innovator doesn't necessarily have an MBA. Smith believes that even if more young people stayed after school, western Pennsyl-vania would still have a problem. <P>"The general culture here grew around big business and big unions," he says, "and doesn't encourage risk-taking. Tradition is hard to change."<P>"We have to change the mindset   of kids," agrees Canfield. We have to show them that it's OK to start a    business, to risk."<P><P>It Starts Early<P>There are some who work against that tide of tradition. The Pennsylvania Council on Economic Education is the state branch of EconomicsAmerica, a nonprofit group whose mission "to promote and encourage understanding of fundamental economic concepts through education" has endured in this state for 16 years. <P>The group tries to foster school-children's understanding of how the economy works through games, curriculum, contests and other programs. PCEE trains teachers to use their material by sponsoring seminars, providing materials and setting up partnerships with school systems; the teachers then take that knowledge back to the classrooms and integrate the programs with their own curriculum.<P>Jan Bishop, economics education consultant for PCEE, says their goal is to teach students skills and attitudes that will last them a lifetime, rather than formulas or statistics they will soon forget.<P>One program, Taking Charge, lets teams of students compete in the classroom against each other to see who can run the best pizza stand. Developing advertising, budgeting and product pricing and hiring employees are all part of the challenge.<P>"We did research on the program and were surprised at the results. It showed a significant attitude change, especially in females," says Bishop.<P>Despite the statewide successes of the PCEE, Bishop believes there's a long way to go. She would like to see more schools take advantage of their programs, though she understands the schools are pressed for time and money as it is.<P>"There's a lack of understanding of what economics is. [Teachers] think it's too hard, that you study it in college. That attitude has to change. We try to make them comfortable with the content. But it's an uphill struggle."<P>Junior Achievement is a more familiar organization to many. The 77-year-old organization is most known for its after-school activity where groups of students start a real business and learn how to run it. But JA is involved in the classroom, too, with programs from elementary school on up. In 1989, for the first time, JA reached more than 1 million students nationwide in one year.<P>JA's programs in-class include games like Job Shuffle, in which students learn the education they need for various careers, or Personal Economics, helping kids learn budget-planning and assess their skills. The programs are taught in many cases by volunteer   business consultants. Volunteer participation reached 57,000 in 1994-95. <P>But teaching kids about how to start pizza stands is only part of the solution. Everyone agrees -- including educators themselves -- that our basic education system could do a better job of preparing students for the job market. And everyone who talks about revamping the school systems says that schools need to maintain better connections to the communities they serve.<P>Helen Sobehart, assistant superintendent of Fox Chapel Area School District, is a strident proponent of the link between education and the vitality of our region. She says that you can't divorce the school from the rest of society. They go together.<P>"If the community is filled with gangs, drugs or even just the attitude that it's ok to drink underage, it's going to carry to the school. We need to heighten the communication between the schools and the community so children hear the same message everywhere they go."<P>Sobehart says that we've lost an ability to be physically close to each other, and that has caused the close-knit traditions of community and values to suffer. Her school system is part of a community group, All of Us Care, formed to rebuild this cooperation between schools, parents, businesses and the rest of the community.<P>"It supports what we're trying to do here at school, and then we in turn support our community," she says.<P>Fox Chapel is also involved        with Career and Academic Passport Initiative, an attempt by business and the schools to generate new standards for education and new ways to teach those standards. <P>"Happily, the skills we emphasize are the same as those we are required by the state to teach. The difference is we're doing so now in partnership with business people in the community.  We're making sure students demonstrate skills by real life applications." That may involve the Taking Charge program. Or it may mean an apprenticeship with a local business, giving a student both credit and a paycheck.<P>"Students who had the ability to participate are all very enthusiastic about how much it helped them prepare for college and for work. The problem is, there's no systematic way for schools and businesses to approach each other. It's all based on who knows who," Sobehart says.<P>That systematic way is Jeanne Berdik's crusade. She's the regional manager of the Pennsylvania School to Work Opportunity System, a branch responsible for implementation of the National School to Work Initiative.<P>"Lots of complaining goes on out there about undereducated graduates [on the part of businesses]. It's absolutely valid. But there's no mechanism for doing something constructive about it," says Berdik.<P>She agrees that the approach to reformation has been fragmented, with individual organizations just out "doing their thing." School to Work tries to integrate technical education with academics, and to provide community and work experience connected to schools and training, and a clear path to post-secondary education.<P>The School to Work effort was started nationally about 1993. President Clinton signed into law in May 1994 the legislation to give federal money to states and some localities      to implement these philosophies,      and go by these guidelines to form these partnerships.<P>Berdik explains her role as that of a go-between. She wants to take the goals of the Regional Economic Revitali-zation Initiative drawn up by the Allegheny Conference, and put them into action in the schools. The industries targeted for growth could communicate their needs in terms of work force to the education system.<P>But that's not the last step. "If we have this economic development mechanism giving this information out, we need partners for them to tell it to," Berdik says. That's School-to-Work's next goal: partnerships between the schools and communities to use that wellspring of information.<P>In McKeesport, for example, she has gathered people who were already in partnership from existing apprenticeship programs and expanded to incorporate representatives of labor, employers, teachers, school board members, post-secondary institutions and city government.  They all sit down together, systematically, to design new programs taking the recommendations of our region's industry and mobilize programs around them.<P>"This is still in fantasyland right now," she admits. But already, within the 13 Southwestern Pennsylvania counties she coordinates, there are 19 partnerships formed.<P>So it seems that people are waking up to the fact that there is a problem in our schools, a problem that if remedied, could lift our region out of its sinkhole, but if ignored, could bog down southwestern Pennsylvania's best efforts at revitalization.<P>Also plain to those who study the problem is that this is only one brick in the effort to shore up the region. A favorable environment, they say, also requires reformation of taxes, regulations as well as venture capital.<P>Spinning wheels in endless debate about what to do accomplishes little. New standards for what students should know are useless until they are implemented and supported by the community. We need a concrete plan for specific action, not more standards and "we shoulds" that have no plans, and no power to ensure action. The Pennsylvania School-to-Work Opportunity System could be a real first step.<P>Whether these efforts will come together, or whether they will sift out and remain unconnected, depends on the tenacity of the people working for them, their willingness to communicate and the commitment of our state towards making real changes and listening to the community.<P>"We are at the bottom of the barrel and there are very few examples of those who rose," says Canfield. "There are places that have transformed, but most had huge injections of federal money. I think we have to do it without federal money, because it's not going to come. And we can't just wait, because it's not going to happen."                               n<P><P>

</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+1>Under Orders From Gov.Ridge, the State's<br>Environmental Regulators Have Changed Their Ways, and<br>Business Like What They See So Far</font></b><br>

<i>By Jim Strader</i></center>
<hr>
When Tom Ridge ran for governor, he campaigned hard against Mark Singel, the lieutenant governor and Democratic nominee who had plans to move up from the office he had occupied for eight years. But Ridge's attacks didn't stop there.<P>The six-term Republican congressman from Erie waged a battle against what he saw as the entrenched institutions of state government, and none personified that more than the dreaded and powerful Department of Environ-mental Resources.<P>In Ridge's eyes, no state agency had a more old-fashioned, unbending, stuck-in-time way of doing things than the DER. Ridge even had a tag line for the DER that he said loud and often.<P>"It's a job-crushing, community-harassing, regulatory nightmare," the governor proclaimed.<P>So Ridge dissolved the DER and created two new agencies with more than just different names. There are different philosophies: Instead of punishing unwitting violators, help them comply, the governor ordered.<P>In the process, the state had to change the habits of dozens of veteran regulators who were DER holdovers, and that would be key. In essence, Ridge was teaching old dogs some new tricks.<P> "The notion we desire is that government should treat citizens it is designed to serve in a manner that is fair, responsible and reasonable, reaching out to them and helping them comply with the law," Ridge says. "It is a notion that government should be a partner in protecting the environment, rather than a police force that is sitting back and waiting for someone to make a mistake and then pouncing on them from a punitive point of view.<P>"Most citizens I know want to be good stewards of the environment," the governor adds. "Treat them accordingly until they show you something different. If you show them what the law is, show them how to comply with the law and then they willfully ignore it or disobey it, then your response has to be swift and uncompromising.<P>"Absent that, we wanted to go   from a policing and punitive mental- ity to more of a collaborative and          compliance-based mentality."<P>It's still early, but so far Ridge has won some high marks for better defining the agency's mission, for implementing policies many in business see as    forward-thinking  and for instilling a new attitude in staffers who for years worked under the old DER mentality: Find the violators and punish them.<P><P>The New Mission<P>Ridge's decision to split the DER was no secret when he laid out the formal proposal after becoming governor. The plan was developed during his three-year campaign -- honed and hammered into shape as he traveled the state. His harangue against the DER struck home with many of those who dealt with the agency, which had a terrible reputation across Pennsylvania and in the Capitol.<P>Lawmakers from all corners of the state readily recite DER horror stories gleaned from constituent complaints. They were the classic examples of bureaucratic nightmares, and the tales seemed to feed on themselves. Ridge seized on the discontent.<P>In dividing the DER -- and establishing in its place the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources -- Ridge earned points with business. The hellish tales of excessive regulation, impenetrable red tape and eternal delay seemed to be amplified when dollars and cents were involved.<P>"I think splitting the agency serves to provide clearer focus," says Pittsburgh attorney Scott Dismukes, a former Environmental Protection Agency attorney who now heads the environmental law group at Doepken Keevican & Weiss. <P>"Essentially, they've narrowed the mission of the department, and I think by narrowing it, you create a more unified purpose," Dismukes says.<P><P>The Point Man<P>Leading the transition was Environmental Protection Secretary James M. Seif, Ridge's choice to head the new agency.<P>Much of the credit for the new outlook at the DEP goes to Seif, who came to state government from an environmental law practice in Philadelphia. A native of Mount Lebanon, Seif served as the EPA regional administrator from 1985-89 and was an aide to former Gov. Dick Thornburgh. He also prosecuted environmental crimes as an assistant U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh.<P>Seif says the transition has been smooth, and the agency's first year         a success. But there's more to come,   Seif says.<P>"As governor, Tom Ridge has set an ambitious goal to fundamentally transform Pennsylvania's environmental programs from a government knows best' philosophy to an approach that encourages private ingenuity to achieve the environmental goals we set," Seif says. "The core mission of protecting our environment will not change.<P>"Our success will be measured by the partnerships we build, by how well we help people understand the benefits of protecting the environment, by the number of people we bring into compliance and by how well we solve real environmental problems," he says.<P>Part of the Ridge administration's purpose for dissolving DER was to eliminate the sometimes divergent objectives of the two parts of the agency, which managed parks and forests in addition to regulating environmental matters. The new arrangement gives regulatory functions to the DEP and puts the parks and forests in the care of Conservation and Natural Resources.<P>The new conservation agency is headed by John C. Oliver III, former president of the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy. Ridge says his goal in setting up the new department was to allow the state's natural resources to receive more attention, without being in the shadow of the rest of the DER.<P><P>Changing Attitude<P>Seif has been a preacher and practitioner of the belief that the department should be user-friendly and work with business and others it serves, not against them. His experience will be a key to making that shift work, Dismukes said.<P>"He's not just of high caliber and on his own merits is a good appointee in any circumstance, but he's not subject to tunnel vision,'' Dismukes says. "He's been on both sides of the fence; he should be a lot wiser both ways. I think that's a unique strength in that appointment."<P>     The secretary also won praise from the business community for surrounding himself with top aides who take a lead-by-example approach to running the DEP.<P>    Many who deal with the agency on a regular basis say there have been noticeable changes in the last year in the way a good number of the DEP's 3,000 employees deal with the public.<P>"They've always been good people to work with here in western Pennsylvania," says attorney Barry Trilling of Pepper Hamilton & Scheetz, who has more than 20 years of environmental law experience. "They're all terrific people, always good to deal with. They were handcuffed, shackled, by policies that emanated from Harrisburg."<P>And, Trilling says, the way Harrisburg operated kept the agency from keeping up with changes going on around them. He cites improvements made by business in pollution control.<P>"There's been a sea change in industry's attitude toward pollution," Trilling says, explaining that most larger companies have come to realize the benefits of being clean and within the law. <P>"It was like having a bulldog on a choker chain," he says. "It's no longer that way. Industry sees that it's in its best interest -- short-term public relations and long-term profits. It's just good capitalism."<P>"What you had in DER was an attitude that industry had never awakened to that," Dismukes adds.<P><P>The Other Side<P>As impressed as Dismukes and others have been with the changes in the last year, the department has not won unwavering praise. Environmen-tal activists see some changes as too sweeping, with too much emphasis on the needs of business and not enough on protection of the environment. Even the business community has some problems with the way things work at the new agency.<P>Although Seif and other top officials at the DEP have demonstrated the way they want the department to operate, there are those DER holdovers in the agency who cling to the old ways, Dismukes says.<P>"You have career professionals that have seen appointees come and go and have substantially invested their professional careers in the department," Dismukes says. "That leads to some internal tensions."<P>Breaking that inertia among bureaucrats, attorneys and others in the agency is a task undone, he          says. But it is one Ridge and Seif are addressing.<P>From the first days of the Ridge administration, the refined mission and shift in attitude at the DEP were accompanied by new policies. The process of applying for environmental permits was placed on a fast track -- and the agency began offering a money-back guarantee to applicants who did not receive an answer on time. At year's end, Seif boasted of a perfect record.<P>The agency started a systematic review of all regulations -- some 11,000 pages -- to find outdated rules and to work toward consistency with federal standards. The DEP promoted negotiation among interested parties as a way to develop new regulations.<P>In the agency's southwestern regional office, department officials conducted an outreach program of quarterly meetings with people and groups affected by DEP policies. Spokeswoman Betsy Mallison says the effort allowed a two-way sharing of information -- benefiting the department and those it met with.<P>The permit process was expedited for the American Video Glass plant adjacent to the Sony television facility in Westmoreland County, she says, marking a change from the past. Sony's environmental guru, Mark Small, has gone out of his way to compliment DEP for its cooperation.<P>Perhaps the most-heralded policy change came in a package of celebrated laws designed to help business clean up and reuse polluted industrial sites.<P>An Alabama company jumped on the new law right away. Vulcan Materials Co., headquartered in Birmingham, is conducting a cleanup of a Neville Island site it used to own. AMG Resources will expand its recycling operation after the abatement of lead and other substances. <P>The laws allow flexibility in such projects, meaning the Neville Island site can be cleaned up to a point consistent with its future industrial use, rather than to a pristine state, says attorney Tim Weston, of the Harrisburg office of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, who represents Vulcan. <P>"The part of this process that          is substantially different is that the DEP staff is being allowed to think about site risk, rather than reciting some rote: We want it all gone,' " Weston says.<P>The new laws allow the department to take advantage of its people, too, according to Weston. The scientific expertise of DEP officials should be put to use in such situations.  <P>"They went to school for a reason, and they could think that through," Weston says. "It is not an easy process, and some of them are still concerned that they may not make the right decision. In the past, their concern that they might not make the right decision meant that they made no decision."<P><P>Still to Come<P>After the initial shift in direction at the DEP, the new management eased off its push for dramatic change. By the end of the year, the call was for time to allow the changes to work.<P>But it seems likely there is more to come, provided that Congress does not get in the way.<P>"Much remains to be done," Seif says. "Congress and EPA have been wild cards in our efforts to reform state programs, since some federal and state environmental programs are so closely linked. In some cases, the slow rate of change in Washington is holding up our efforts to reform programs in Pennsylvania.<P>"We've had some success in putting the Ridge principles to work," Seif says, looking ahead. "But we've only scratched the surface."                                                   n<P>

<B><font size =+1>Much is at Stake When Wealthy Individual Get<br>Divorced; Many Corporate Law Firms Have<br>Family Law Capabilities In-House</font></b><br>

<i>By Barbara Youngerman Meyer</i></center>
<hr>
Attorney Jonathan McAnney remembers when the legal community treated divorce cases with a bit of disdain. The divorce cases were there. They were always going to be there.<P>"Divorce was seen as the unwanted stepchild of litigation," says McAnney, of Tucker Arensberg in Pittsburgh.<P>"But divorces today often involve significant amounts of money. That's a major reason  why things have changed."<P>Yes they have: Much is at stake in divorces, especially those involving wealthy individuals -- from physicians with established practices to owners of successful small businesses to corporate executives. Veteran real estate appraiser Bob Gelman tells of one divorce case for which he was flown "in the client's private plane all over the southeastern United States to evaluate his holdings and eventually testify in court."<P>Spouses battle over luxury cars, multiple homes, stock options, personal valuables and sometimes the value of one spouse's professional license.<P>So divorce -- this one-time shabby stepchild -- has quietly become one of the family darlings. Corporate law firms not only accept divorce cases, they have attorneys with expertise, such as Tucker Arensberg's  McAnney,  to handle them.  <P>"These days you see more large and complex estates being split up," says Judge Patrick Tamilia, a veteran Family Court jurist in Allegheny County before ascending to the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. "There's more divorce among the wealthy than before. It's not uncommon these days to see $500,000 and even million-dollar settlements."    <P>Modern Love<P>Statistics show that half of all marriages in the U.S. end in divorce, which cuts across all class and economic lines.<P>"Divorce is easier now," says Tamilia. "With no-fault [divorce] in place, it's easier. People don't stay in a bad or unsatisfying marriage like they used to. Not that staying together was always good. Some marriages should have ended, but we've gone too far the other way."<P>As a result, many larger corporate law firms have taken on divorce litigation out of necessity over the years. Their clients are asking for it, Tamilia says.<P>"These firms don't just deal with contracts, mergers and high finance. They deal with clients who are human beings, and these human beings get involved in domestic problems," Tamilia says.  <P>"These human beings -- high-priced executives whose marriages have fallen apart -- go to their law firm, the one taking care of their business interests, and say Where do I go? Can you help me?'"<P>A '90s divorce, in many cases, carries with it characteristics similar to those of more traditional corporate law cases.<P>For one, McAnney points out that the attorney fees involved in litigating      a complex divorce can resemble fees from an antitrust case.<P>"Look at the money that's involved in the Barry Bonds divorce," McAnney says. "Legal costs in that case have exceeded $1 million."<P>Secondly, McAnney says many divorces have taken on the look of a business matter since pensions, 401(k) plans, and licenses and educational degrees often are pulled into the fray.<P>"Really," says McAnney, "a divorce now is no different than a business <P>dissolution."<P>And that's just the beginning.<P>High profile individuals face media scrutiny in some instances, and such publicity can hurt their business. Others going through divorce find business competitors snooping in their case file.<P>"I had a client who was fairly well-known in Pittsburgh," says veteran attorney Stewart B. Barman, head of family law practice at Buchanan Ingersoll. "He didn't want his competition to know what his business was worth. By settling out of court, he bought some protection.<P>"He paid more upfront, but there would have been a higher price to pay down the road if he'd gone public."<P>No-Fault Divorce     <P>Divorce in Pennsylvania got a lot easier two decades ago, when no-fault divorce became law. Before the reform, divorce cases tended to be bloody. <P>"We wanted to get the acrimony out of divorce proceedings," Tamilia says. "We wanted the focus to be on the actual dissolution. [The earlier] cases were bitter and hard-fought." <P>A contested divorce was almost impossible to obtain. Or the wife was frightened to have her marriage end; it was her lifeline, in many instances. She had no income of her own and, in the old days, there was no alimony.<P>"So people stayed married forever," says David Pollock, head of the Marital Law Group at Reed Smith Shaw & McClay.  <P>Nowadays in Pennsylvania, all real or personal property -- with certain exceptions -- acquired by either husband or wife during their marriage is presumed to be marital property. This means it doesn't matter who holds the property title, whether it's held individually or by both in some form of co-ownership. It is subject to "equitable distribution" upon divorce.<P>"The entire ball game was made anew back in 1980, when the divorce code came into being," says Pollock. "Now we have spousal support and equitable distribution of marital property. Now there's the whole concept of helping the dependent spouse who   hasn't worked outside the home."<P>"Equitable distribution," says Tamilia, "gave women economic justice."  <P>Property that is equitably distributed is not split 50-50, but instead in a manner that is fair to both parties. But consider problems that can emerge.<P>A classic case involved a physician from New Jersey who was supported by his wife during medical school. The court ruled that the wife was entitled to 40 percent of the value of the husband's medical license, a value the court set at $472,000. The wife's cut: $188,000.<P>"If the physician, however, has only been in practice a short time," says McAnney, "his estate really isn't worth all that much.  His income is high, but you have to consider his debts -- the cost of getting into practice. He doesn't have anything he can liquidate to make a cash settlement."<P>Barman takes the scenario a step further: "Let's say someone's suing her doctor husband for divorce, and she wants half of what his business is worth. And let's say it's worth $2 million. But his is a service business. If he drops dead tomorrow, what's the business worth? What's its inherent value?"<P>Regardless, as the New Jersey case showed, "the courts are awarding the money anyway as though the physician's business has an inherent value, a value apart from him," Barman says.<P>The traps of equitable distribution don't stop there. Consider the common example of the family-owned business.<P>"Take a 55- to 60-year-old guy who's been married 25 years and is in charge of a closely held family business," McAnney says. "The wife has worked at home and has no skills, no real job opportunities and the court will be apt to award her a big chunk of his estate.<P>"But it's important she not get a controlling interest in the company," McAnney says. "You don't want your divorced spouse to be a shareholder with you. It will ruin the business, and then what value is there in it?" <P>Alimony can be just as tenuous.<P>"In the past three years, I've seen a gradual change with regard to support for the dependent spouse," says attorney Pat Miller, the Permanent Equitable Distribution Master in the Family Division of Allegheny County Com-mon Pleas Court. "It's gotten more progressive, more liberalized. We've recognized that the law was too harsh."<P>Usually, wives are the recipient, but there are exceptions.<P>"I've had doctor-doctor cases, where he's in research and she's in private practice," says Pollock of Reed Smith. "He's making a lot less money in research and, so, he's going to get the alimony."  <P>Barman, whose past clients include Terry Bradshaw, says the best way to handle property distribution and alimony is to negotiate it instead of leaving it up to the court.<P>"If I could wave a magic wand, I'd never go to court," Barman says. "Once in court, a third party decides my client's fate. Who would want that?"<P>Other Alternatives<P>Another way to address property distribution and alimony is to work it out in advance of the wedding in the form of a prenuptial agreement. <P>Courts, for the most part, will enforce the agreements provided that the party that is wishing to protect its interests has fully disclosed its holdings.<P>In one Massachusetts case, the court upheld a prenuptial even though it was thrust upon the groom by the bride -- an heiress whose annual salary was $540,000 -- only three hours prior to the wedding. The agreement included a detailed schedule of the wife's estate and expected inheritance. The husband unsuccessfully argued that he signed the document under duress.<P>Another way couples try to resolve their differences is through divorce mediators such as Paul Wahrhaftig and partner Sherle Josephs. <P>"We work on constructive problem solving," Wahrhaftig says, "so we can settle out of court. We work to develop a parenting plan. We separate adult issues from those concerning the kids. We give each member of the couple reassurance that the future can be good for them. Each will be taken care of and the children, too. We don't use fighting words that imply anyone is going to be the loser in the deal."<P>Barman and other attorneys perform similar services for their clients, but Wahrhaftig says his firm is different because it works with the couple, not just one side.<P>"We're working with both, working out the nuts and bolts. We helped a couple who both worked in his family-owned business. When they came to us, they were very angry, very hostile toward each other. Today both work in that same family business. At different ends of the building, I have to add, but they can work together. It was good for the company that they both stay."<P>Of course, the happiest ending would be for the divorce rate to fall to zero -- but since that is unlikely to happen any time soon, divorce specialists can expect their phones to keep ringing.     <P>

<B><font size =+>With Memberships Down, Country Clubs are Hotly Pusuing New Members;<br>The Deals Being Offered by Some Clubs are Turning Golfers' Heads</font></b><br>

<i>By Joe Tuscana</i></center>
<hr>

When Congress passed tax legislation for 1994 eliminating the business deduction for club dues, it reinforced a message to businesses that has become common in these budget-cutting times.<P>There are no free lunches.<P>When it comes to conducting business on the golf course, the bill has gone up considerably.<P>The targets of the new tax law include such institutions as private city clubs, airline clubs and other business and entertainment clubs, including golf clubs.<P>Business write-offs for membership dues in country clubs were eliminated completely. Even deductions for the business lunch, which for so long has served as the bargaining table for many deals, have been slashed. The changes have dealt a severe blow to many  businessmen who use these memberships to foster business contacts. Not to mention the facilities they frequented. Consider the Highland Country Club in West View.<P>"At Highland, we had a lot of small businessmen who were members. We lost membership and we lost golf outings. It affected us big time because of our clientele," says Jim Antkiewicz, who worked at Highland Country Club for 12 years before becoming golf pro at the Club at Nevillewood in January.<P>"Our numbers shrank. Some just dropped out while others cut back."<P>The original tax proposal covered all clubs, including such service organizations as the Lions, Moose and Elks. However, the Treasury Department determined that Congress did not intend to alter the tax status of clubs whose main goals are public service and community volunteerism. Mem-bers of those types of clubs may continue deducting membership dues.<P>But the deficit reduction measure, which hopes to raise an additional  $1.1 billion of tax revenue over five years, puts new pressures on golf clubs to attract membership. This constant chipping away of deductions for business expenses that offer an element of personal benefit is motivating many clubs to offer membership specials.<P>While golf clubs have felt the pinch, the new tax laws, coupled with the construction of new courses throughout the area, have sparked a type of membership war. It's a buyer's market out there and golfers looking for an opportunity to join a club have never had a better time to do so.<P>The Highland Country Club has lowered its initiation fee, and has attracted 75 new members in 1995. Highland is not alone -- local clubs are offering a variety of deals.<P>Dues Decrease<P>"What seems to be going on is that country clubs are offering extremely discounted rates on intermediate (non-voting) memberships,'' says Rich Milesky, a 24-year-old law student at Duquesne University and a member of Shannopin Country Club in the North Hills. "Take the club bonds for example. Before, if you were over 35, you had to pay the day before you began your membership. Now, some club offers allow you to pay over a long period of time."<P>While most clubs claim discounted membership offers are not unique --Shannopin has a special to celebrate its 75th anniversary -- these tempting deals have been more plentiful since the tax change.<P>Milesky is a perfect example of the type of golfer clubs want to attract. At 24, his membership in a club could last for decades and his youth makes him more of a candidate to take advantage of a club's other social amenities, such as the pool, tennis courts and dining areas.<P>"Things are definitely different now," says attorney John Lyncheski, 51, a director with the Pittsburgh law firm of Cohen & Grigsby and a longtime member at Chartiers Country Club in Pittsburgh. "Country club memberships have become extremely competitive."<P>Lyncheski, who served as president at Chartiers Country Club from 1992 to 1993 and who has also served on its board, believes two factors have sparked the intense competition for new membership.<P>"One, obviously, is the IRS limits on deductions for entertainment expenses. Two, I think there is a saturation. The Pittsburgh area has more competition for membership."<P>The recent rise in new course development -- Southpointe, Diamond Run, Mystic Rock at Nemacolin Woodlands and the Club at Nevillewood, to name just a few -- has made memberships more plentiful and competition to fill them much more intense.<P>"Ten years ago at Highland, we had a waiting list," says Antkiewicz. "The past year, we were shy of our membership limit."<P>"In 1985 or so, virtually every country club in the Pittsburgh area had a waiting list to get in," Lyncheski adds. "At most clubs now, it's flip-flopped. At some clubs, there are memberships that go wanting. Other clubs have substantially reduced fees. They are targeting younger men because they have the potential to be long-term members. Some offer intermediate memberships to bring in younger members."<P>Many golf clubs have felt an added economic strain because of the social amenities offered. A swimming pool, tennis courts and dining areas require staff, maintenance and increasing costs for upkeep.<P>"Most clubs look for younger men because they tend to socialize more," says Milesky. "Older members tend to eat at the club more but younger members eat there, use the pool and other facilities. That's especially true for a member who has a family."<P>Pay to Play<P>Make no mistake, belonging to a country club is expensive. At a typical club, besides initiation fees, members are charged monthly dues that cover greens fees, plus there are pro shop purchases and food and beverage tabs. Some clubs also charge fees for locker rentals, club storage and capital improvements. These clubs need a strong membership that will spend money. The younger member makes for the best applicant, not only because of his youth but for the potential to develop stronger business ties.<P>"Younger members tend to spend more time there," Milesky says, "because it's a good networking opportunity."<P>The new tax law limited the deductible portions of business meals and entertainment expenses to 50 percent for fraternal clubs, business   clubs, athletic clubs and even airline travel clubs.<P>Under the new tax law, use of a club is monitored on a day-to-day basis to determine business entertaining. That percentage of use is deductible from annual membership dues.  <P>So if a club's dining area is used for a business luncheon, for example, only 50 percent of the cost may be deducted at tax time. While the new tax law has not eliminated the business lunch, it has certainly curtailed it.<P>"Companies are not willing to pay large amounts of money for group outings," says Tim Jugovic, club manager at Shannopin. "Those situations are not going to disappear, however. Their aim is now to smaller groups."<P>A membership-sponsored business function at Shannopin shows up on the billing statement of the member. Before 1994, those expenses could be deducted at tax time. Club members may be able to get around at least part of the deduction changes this way: If a club itemizes a bill into membership and meal portions, the members can still deduct the 50 percent of the meal portion as a business expense. Every little bit helps.<P>Jugovic says that the business-sponsored golf outings still flourish, but on a smaller scale at his club.<P>While construction of new courses may not be affected by this belt-  tightening, a trend to a different style of club has emerged. Courses such as Diamond Run offer a facility that caters specifically to golfers needs. You won't find a swimming pool, tennis courts or a banquet hall.<P>"We wanted a residential community that was tied into a golf course. That was the thought process behind Diamond Run," says Bob Collins, the club pro at the Gary Player signature course in Sewickley. "When they were building it, we tried to get as much up-front membership as possible. I would guess that 70 percent of the people we bring in here join the club. And about 90 percent of the people who live here are golf members or social members."<P>Collins says that while there is property allocated for a swimming pool and tennis courts, neither has been built. But the option remains.<P>"Tennis courts and pools are not profit centers at a club," says Collins. "Those aspects are nice, but they require maintenance. If you check other clubs, dues may be higher because of the upkeep."<P>Jugovic agrees.<P>"Clubs like Shannopin have amenities supplementing the golf activities. There is a lot of overhead to that." Jugovic says it doesn't matter if a group of 60 or 160 dine at the club, the staff numbers are the same. That's why it is critical for clubs to keep membership rosters full.<P>"You have to keep a pipeline open for natural attrition," Jugovic says. "The market is still pretty saturated and there are still more clubs springing up in the area."<P>One of the attractive aspects of a club built in a residential development is the convenience it offers.<P>"Our banquet facility has been a great source of revenue for us," says Maureen Valentine, who is the membership director at the Club at Nevillewood. "We have seating for 225 and our facility is more of a ballroom. The members use our facility for all types of events: weddings, dinners,  bar mitzvahs."<P>Valentine says the key to making a club's amenities profitable is to do it first class.<P>"We have a French chef on staff and offer a wide variety of menus," says Valentine. "Whatever you need, we can provide, whether it be a luncheon or a black-tie affair.<P>"Obviously, the golf club is our most important aspect. The average age of our membership is around 42, and we offer them a lot of events."<P>Valentine says the club has had success working other events into a golf outing.<P>"You still have to entertain," she says. "We have members from the top corporations in Pittsburgh here. Our beautiful golf course -- which is a Jack Nicklaus signature course -- guarantees their undivided attention for four and a half hours. But we also see it        as an opportunity for fine dining    afterwards."<P>Like many clubs in residential developments, the Club at Neville-wood was to exist exclusively for the residents. But the pull for membership has opened it to individuals who live outside the development.<P>"I think the movement is toward joining a club where the course is just magnificent," Valentine says. "That's very important. I think you can see the value in that."<P>The construction of more golf courses and the increasing need for members could leave casualties.<P>Three scenarios appear likely. Some corporations or individuals, who can't really afford to keep a club membership, will use the deduction elimination as an excuse to leave the club.<P>Other businesses that use country club memberships for their employees to entertain customers will see club dues as a cost of doing business -- with or without the deduction.<P>And some clubs, which do not have business or corporate memberships per se, may not be affected, whether business is transacted on the golf course or in the dining room.<P>The deduction elimination could have an unintended effect if club memberships decrease. A luxury tax  approved in the early 1990s on high-dollar items such as luxury boats and cars costing more than $30,000 had a downward effect on employment in those industries.<P>"I think that one of the changes that will occur is that some of the marginal clubs will fall by the wayside," says Lyncheski. "It takes a lot of money to maintain a first-class golf club. It takes a lot of capital improvements to improve your product."<P>Lyncheski believes the newer golf clubs will draw membership away from other clubs.<P>"That means that clubs on the next tier down will have a tough time competing," he says. "I think it will be more expensive to belong to a country club. Ultimately, the financial support of a club falls to the membership. Fees and dues will probably go up."<P>If Lyncheski is right, then the time to take advantage of these reduced fees is now, even if you get stuck with the bill for lunch.			    <P>

<center><B><font size=+2>Mulach Compton Awards
</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+>Vocational Rehabilitation Center</font></b><br>

<i>By Joe Tuscana</i></center>
<hr>
Those who have met, or even spoken to Joseph Mulach, Jr., cannot easily forget him. The former three-term board chairman of the VRC possesses  vitality, a sense of humor and compassion for humankind -- all of which, over a period of years, contributed to the development of the VRC into the agency it is today.<P>Even now, at 89 years of age, Mulach, if not playing golf or tennis, shares fond stories about his tenure at VRC and the friendships that he formed there.<P>Mulach, who joined the VRC board in 1962 and continues to serve on the board in an advisory capacity, remembers the day a colleague asked him if he would like to fill a current opening on the board.<P>"I said, 'I never heard of the      organization,'" recalls Mulach, who subsequently attended a VRC board meeting to learn about the agency and its  services.<P>During the meeting, says Mulach, a story was told about a consumer whose life had been changed by the VRC. This woman, who had never been able to do anything on her own, was taught life and employment skills and was able to begin working in        the VRC facility. As a result, her mother was able to go off of welfare and obtain a job.<P>"I thought, This is the ideal sort of organization, that can make people feel as though they can contribute and be a part of society,'" says Mulach, adding that the piece about the mother going off of welfare spoke to the businessman in him.<P>In his role as board chairman, Mulach was instrumental in leading a capital campaign that resulted in the relocation of the VRC to its present location on Forbes Avenue.<P>"At the time, VRC was on the fourth floor of this non-fireproof building with one single, rickety elevator," he says. "I envisioned the consumers, many of whom were in wheelchairs, trying to get out and what an absolute disaster it would be."<P>Mulach remarks that he is bothered by some organizations which he feels spend too much time trying to build up an empire.<P>"VRC has never done that," he says. "It always has excellent people involved with it and an excellent staff. It's my favorite organization, and I've been involved with quite a few." <P>This year, two of the companies founded by Mulach are contributing $10,000 toward the sponsorship of VRC's annual Mulach & Compton Awards Ceremony.<P>Steve Thomas, Mulach's son-in-law and the President and CEO of both Mulach Steel Corporation and Mulach Parking Structures Corporation (MPS), states, "This sponsorship is a tribute to the VRC's activity and benefits to the community and to Joe Mulach's being instrumentally involved in it for so many years.<P>"He's continued to support VRC, and the companies that he started have a commitment and obligation to continue that support and the tradition that he established."<P><b>A Message From VRC Board<br>Chairman H.Lee Noble</b><P>The Vocational Rehabilitation Center has long been recognized as a leader in the rehabilitation field.  In the mid-1960s, VRC became the first rehabilitation facility in Pennsylvania and one of the first in the nation to be accredited by the National Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities. Today, VRC is the only Pittsburgh rehabilitation facility accredited in six program areas.<P>VRC achieved another milestone this year when we achieved a 35 percent  placement rate. The national average is 10 percent for similar agencies. VRC is very proud of our success, and we salute the employers in this community for making our success possible.  <P>Each year, more than 200 area businesses turn to VRC for job placement services for dependable and skilled workers. One such person is Margaret Schmitt, an employee of the Western Pennsylvania Caring Foundation and this year's recipient of the Leonard Weitzman Consumer of the Year Award. Margaret's story is an inspiration.<P>VRC recognizes Margaret's employer, the Western Pennsylvania Caring Foundation, for its commitment to hiring people with disabilities.<P>We also are pleased to honor leaders in our community such as Karen Wolk Feinstein and Tony Sanzo for their efforts in improving opportunities for individuals with disabilities.<P>H. Lee Noble is the Vice-President of Bayer Corporation and President of the Polymers Division of Bayer. He has served as the VRC Board Chairman since last September.A Message From <P>Robert J. Mather, <P>President and Chief Executive Officer of the Vocational Rehabilitation Center<P><P>At a recent community event, I was in conversation with the CEO of a local corporation when he asked, upon learning where I worked, "What's at VRC?"<P>I was caught off-guard by the phrasing, "What's at VRC?" The answer to the question lies not in what, but in who is at VRC.<P>The persons with disabilities who become contributing members of society through training and employment, and the staff members who are helping them to rebuild their lives, are the keys to VRC.<P>Perhaps the "what" of VRC was best described in the emblem on the VRC T-shirts and sweatshirts developed this year and worn with a lot of pride by the staff and consumers.  Four simple words -- "What we do works" -- say so much about the daily happenings at VRC.<P>The agency was recently given affirmation that what we are doing is working through the results of several reviews. In an effort to establish continuous improvement practices and become a Total Quality organization, VRC conducted satisfaction surveys of consumers, workshop customers, staff, board members and parents.<P>The resounding response to the reviews was, "Yes, we're pleased with what you're doing. Keep up the good work." Ninety-four percent of our rehabilitation consumers indicated that VRC services met or exceeded their needs.<P>The VRC was also a pilot agency for a management review conducted by the United Way. Again, VRC programs were rated 90 percent or better by United Way volunteers, and VRC's management practices exceeded the norms for approach, implementation and results.<P>The best reassurance comes from the consumers and their families.  The following excerpts are from a letter written to VRC by the mother of Tanguy Richard, a 24-year-old consumer who came to VRC in 1992.  Tanguy Richard was diagnosed with a brain tumor at the age of two. He still has a short-term memory deficit and minor motor difficulties, but is employed in the VRC sheltered workshop.<P>On our first visit to the VRC in 1992, "we were immediately impressed by the dignity of the work environment and the pride and attention shown by all workers under the outstanding vigilance and assistance of staff members.<P>"Tuesday is a special day. From the evening before, we are reminded that this is payday and are repeatedly asked to guess the exact amount of the paycheck. The check will be displayed in the family room for the rest of the week.<P>"Tanguy has built self-confidence ... he feels important and valued in VRC's environment. There is no greater satisfaction for us than listening to Tanguy explaining to our friends and relatives how proud he is of his job and how important it is to him.<P>"I strongly believe that if all our citizens shared the same enthusiasm and work ethic as you and your clients here at VRC, many of our society's current problems would be solved. It is regrettable that the great daily achievements of VRC and other similar institutions never make the headlines."<P>The words of this letter are true testament to what's at VRC and to the rewards experienced by the consumers and the commitment of the VRC staff.<P>We are constantly assisted in our efforts to achieve successes by individuals like Tony Sanzo and Karen Feinstein.  Their dedication to persons with disabilities and their accomplishments in creating a better working environment for them in our community are worthy of much recognition.<P>They are another important piece of  the "who" that makes VRC work.<P><P><b>Mulach Award Given To Karen Wolk Feinstein</b><P>The name of Karen Wolk Feinstein in the Pittsburgh community is synonymous with quality leadership, a no-nonsense style of business management and an energetic zeal for taking on projects that benefit others, most notably special needs populations.<P>For the past five years, as President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, Feinstein has overseen the development of and funding of numerous programs ranging from a Jewish residential home to camps for children with disabilities.<P>Feinstein is this year's recipient of the Joseph F. Mulach, Jr. Award, an annual honor presented by the VRC to a person who has significantly improved the quality of life for persons with disabilities. The Mulach Award was established in 1976 to honor former VRC Board Chairman, philanthropist and industrialist Joseph Mulach, Jr. for his determination and commitment to the VRC. <P>Feinstein was chosen as the first President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation when the organization was created in 1991, following the sale of Montefiore Hospital to Presbyterian University Hospital.<P> The three areas prioritized by the Foundation were healthcare for children at risk, women's health, and the aging and people with chronic conditions.<P>Much work has been done by JHF in trying to develop integrated care systems which strive to connect families with all the resources to which they are entitled.<P>A significant investment by JHF was made in the Facial Anomaly Clinic at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Feinstein describes the clinic, which is for children born with cleft palates and a host of other facial disorders, as being "a model of the kind of care we wish every special needs population could get."<P>From the time children at the clinic are born, they receive comprehensive healthcare services from psychological counseling to special casework to speech therapy, in addition to regular medical care.<P>JHF has done a considerable amount of work with schools to ensure that children with special needs are completely accommodated in the classroom. Feinstein also speaks enthusiastically about the Foundation's involvement with local camps that focus on children with disabilities.<P>"We really look at camping as a very important way for young people with disabilities to start carving out their independence," she says.<P>Feinstein adds that the Foundation "recognizes that when a child lives with a disability, the whole family does. We really need to support the entire unit."<P>A major concern of the Foundation and an area that is still relatively unexplored nationally, says Feinstein, is how to move vulnerable populations with chronic conditions on to managed care without damaging their ties to existing providers. JHF is currently focusing much of its attention on this challenge.<P>Prior to taking control of JHF, Feinstein was a Senior Vice-President at the United Way of Allegheny County.  She currently serves on the board of directors for various community groups, including the United Way, the  Boy Scouts, Integra Trust Company and Shadyside Hospital.<P>Feinstein commented on the historic ties between the VRC and the Jewish population. Years ago, before VRC became an agency, many Jewish communities had their own vocational rehabilitation centers.<P>She also made a connection between persons with disabilities and the Jewish faith, stating, "As a Jewish Healthcare Foundation, we feel a       special affinity for people who suffer discrimination and who, for reasons that aren't worthy, are barred from   participating in the full spectrum of community life."<P>On being chosen for the Mulach Award, Feinstein says, "I'm delighted to be selected, but I feel somewhat unworthy. There are so many heroes when       it comes to the care of people with     disabilities."<P><b>Anthony M. Sanzo Receives James F.Compton<br>Humanitarian Award</b><P>Tony Sanzo relates the story of his 7-year-old daughter Cameron and her friend as one of the best examples of interaction between humans in the ideal world.<P>Cameron's friend has a physical disability. Cameron does not. The physical differences between the two girls have never even come up in conversation during their activities together.  Though they may recognize that the differences exist, they find no need to acknowledge them.<P>Sanzo, the President and Chief Executive Officer of Allegheny General Hospital, has spent the last several years striving to create the same type of coequal environment at AGH, as well as in the community.<P>He is this year's recipient of the James F. Compton Humanitarian Award, which is given to a president, chairman of the board or CEO for his or her efforts, or those of the company, to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities through enhanced employment opportunities.<P>The Compton award was established in 1992 following the board chairman's death. It acknowledges Compton's own desire to honor top executives in the business community for their leadership role in provid-     ing opportunities to people with        disabilities. <P>Sanzo first became more aware of and involved in the efforts for individuals with disabilities about four years ago during the national initiative known as "Forging a New Freedom."<P>Begun by former Reagan press secretary James Brady, who came to Pittsburgh to kick off the initiative here, Forging a New Freedom was an effort, in conjunction with the passing of the Americans with Disabilities Act, to break down the physical, mental and behavioral barriers in the workplace for persons with disabilities.<P>Though Sanzo was clearly approached to participate in the initiative because of his visible role at AGH, the involvement became a much more personal effort on his part and changed the way he thought about quite a few things.<P>He credits Linda Dickerson, Publisher of Executive Report magazine, for teaching him to think           differently about individuals with disabilities.<P>"Linda was the first person who gave me the opportunity to help out with this initiative," says Sanzo. "By her very presence, she taught me how to concentrate on a person's abilities rather than his or her disabilities."<P>Sanzo stated that as a result of Forging a New Freedom, a directory of accessible facilities in Pittsburgh was produced, accessible walkways were increased throughout the city and county, and employers became much more aware of the barriers that exist in the workplace for persons with disabilities. <P>"Nearly every employer in town has made a financial as well as an emotional commitment to this effort," says Sanzo.<P>Allegheny General Hospital was one of the companies which enlisted the help of VRC and other rehabilitation organizations to study the facility and inform the staff of physical and behavioral changes that needed to occur.<P>AGH has continued its involvement with VRC through a number of methods. VRC consumers work in the microfiche records area of the hospital; the facility uses VRC staff as coaches to work with the AGH management to overcome disability-related obstacles and to provide sensitivity training, and the hospital holds workshops for VRC clients which teach employment interviewing skills. <P>A quality improvement team was also developed at AGH, the mission of which was to improve the quality of life for employers and visitors, either with or without disabilities.<P>"While it has always been our mission to teach, to learn and to heal the sick, I don't know that [AGH] ever focused on a segment of the population in the fashion that we have since becoming involved with Forging a New Freedom," says Sanzo.  "Now that we have, I'm not even sure that people know the phrase anymore ... it's become a natural part of what we do."     <P> Sanzo is flattered to have been chosen as the Compton winner and accepts the award with a great deal of pride and humility.<P>"I personally haven't done anything to deserve this award," says  Sanzo, adding, "I'm blessed with being part of an organization that understands its responsibility in this community and functions as a good corporate citizen."<P>Past Compton award recipients are Wesley W. von Schack, Eugene J. Barone and Robert Mehrabian. <P><b>Margaret Schmitt Chosen Leonard Weitzman<br>Consumer of the Year</b><P>Though nearly blind since birth, Margaret Schmitt always knew that she was capable of achieving many things in life, one of those being obtaining a job.<P>But "working a part-time minimum wage job was never a goal," she says.<P>Following periods of attending college, working and returning to college for her degree, Margaret is currently happy with the position she holds at the Western PA Caring Foundation.<P>Schmitt is this year's recipient of the Leonard Weitzman Consumer of the Year Award. The award was established in 1989 in honor of the VRC's former president, who retired after 41 years.<P>The award recognizes the outstanding performance and excellence of a person placed in the workplace by VRC.<P>Following high school, Schmitt attended college for a while, then spent four years working as a rehabilitation assistant at the Pittsburgh Blind Association. Though she enjoyed the work there, she felt the need to move on to other things.<P>Schmitt returned to college and, in 1992, graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a Bachelor's Degree in Business.<P>Armed with her new degree and an enthusiasm for employment, Schmitt began the search for a job. It was at    this point that she encountered some obstacles.<P>"I spent quite a bit of time looking for work, but had no offers," she recalls.<P>Though entirely honest with potential employers about her blindness, Schmitt feels that her disability was a contributing factor in her lack of job offers.<P>She realized, however, that if a company was hesitant to hire her because she was disabled, it would be less likely to make any other accommodations for her and would not prove to be a good match.<P>Nearly two years after her graduation from college and still unemployed, Schmitt was referred to the VRC by a client at Blindness and Visual Services.<P>She began a job readiness course at the VRC in the winter of 1994 and by May had been hired in a temporary capacity by the Western PA Caring Foundation.<P>Pleased with her performance, the company hired her as a full-time employee six months later.<P>"I don't look at Margaret any differently than I do anyone," says Stacey Bloom, Schmitt's supervisor and the Manager of Administration and Communications at the Caring Foundation.<P>"Her performance has not been hindered because of her disability  it is on a level expected of that position," stated Bloom, adding, "Margaret also has good ideas and suggests different ways of doing things."<P>As a specialty service representative at the Caring Foundation, Schmitt provides telephone customer service to the parents of uninsured children.<P>According to Bloom, Schmitt handles roughly 50 calls per day, each of which may entail answering parents' questions regarding eligibility requirements for the program, explaining the aspects of managed care to them and researching the status of their claims on the computer system.<P>She also processes requests for applications and works closely with many other departments of Blue Cross and Keystone.<P>Schmitt was provided with specialized computer equipment in order for her to perform her job. She recalls that when she first started working and   didn't have all of the proper tools, "VRC worked really hard to get that resolved quickly.  They really went to bat for me."<P>Looking back at her experience with the VRC, Schmitt says she was especially impressed with the contributive approach of the staff there.<P>"Some rehabilitation agencies have a lower expectation or attitude [of their clients] that is a bit condescending," she says, adding, "I never received that from the VRC. They understood where I was coming from and my employment expectations."<P><b>A Message From Timothy Parks</b><P>I am deeply honored to be asked to serve as the Chairman of the Vocational Rehabilitation Center's 1996 Mulach Compton Awards Dinner.<P>The VRC is a very special agency in our community. Its work is directed toward assisting people in the most fundamental way -- through its work in assessment, training, placement    and ongoing support, the VRC moves individuals into meaningful work experiences.<P>The VRC helps individuals challenged with a range of disabilities focus not on those things that cannot be done, but rather on the world of opportunities of the possible. This builds self-esteem, pride and a sense of purpose that underscores that basic human tenet, dignity.<P>The outcome of the work of the VRC is both a sense of meeting our social and moral responsibility as citizens and it is bottom-line, good economic sense.<P>Last year, VRC helped 1,223 people with disabilities. The agency achieved a record as it placed 433 people in jobs in the local community. This number represents a placement rate of 35 percent and well exceeds the national average of 10 percent for similar agencies. <P>The bottom-line economic impact for this group of 433 people is quite impressive. This group will earn more than $5 million in annualized wages.  They will also pay approximately $500,000 in taxes as well as save the taxpayers some $400,000 in public assistance benefits.<P>The VRC works as a partner with many corporations and institutions throughout our region. Each year we honor those individuals who exemplify the highest standards of excellence within this field of services. This year we will honor three exceptional individuals.<P>First, the Mulach Award recipient is Karen Wolk Feinstein, President of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation of Pittsburgh. Karen's leadership and vision have made a significant impact on the services provided to people with disabilities in this community.  <P>Secondly, we are proud to acknowledge the leadership of Anthony Sanzo, our Compton Humanitarian Award honoree. Tony is highly respected in this community as an advocate for people with disabilities.<P>And finally, we recognize a very special individual -- Ms. Margaret Schmitt, who will receive the Leonard Weitzman Consumer of the Year Award. It is this award which symbolizes the real work of VRC. This is the bottom line, an individual who can reach her potential and contribute to the community.<P>Timothy Parks is the President of the Pittsburgh High Technology Council.<P>

<i> By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</i></b>

<hr>
An administrator at one of the region's higher education institutions was telling me not too long ago how much she loathes management meetings.<P>"You know the kind," she said. "These are the meetings where the person who is doing most of the talking takes a half hour to say what could be said in 10 minutes.<P>"I'd like to reach across the table and say, `Make your point!'" she added. "I just don't have that kind of time to waste. There are more productive ways to spend that time than listening to someone who cannot efficiently communicate their message."<P>Amen.<P>Many people can put together a grammatically correct sentence. But many choose to put together too many grammatically correct sentences. Before you know it, 45 minutes has passed. If you've ever attended a school board or municipal council meeting, you know that politicians have reduced this to an art. Unfortunately, many in the business world today also do the same. <P>Politicians can get away with it. Business people cannot.<P>In today's frenetic and highly competitive work environment, there is increasingly less time for poor communicators. Fellow managers don't want to deal with them. More importantly, clients or customers may find their obtuseness a turnoff. If they know you can't organize your own thoughts, they'll doubt your ability to organize anything, including the work you're doing for them.<P>And that's just scratching the surface.  Communicating is about knowing your audience and precisely how to sway it in your direction. The situations vary from something as private as a management meeting to something as public as a press conference following a disaster involving your business.<P>You have to know when to say nothing, but you also must know when it's time to talk. And you have to know what to say and how to say it. Remember Pepsi's adept handling a few years back of lies about syringes being found in their soda cans? Or USAir Chairman Seth Schofield standing firm after the crash of flight 427? Schofield said if he thought USAir's fleet was unsafe, he'd ground it. One sentence. To the point.<P>Motorola, one of the most forward-thinking companies in the country, tutors high level executives in communications skills as part of its Vice President Institute. The VPI program consists of a five-day seminar consisting of problem-solving and presentations by - among others - Chairman Bob Galvin himself. Follow-up events occur for two years.<P>At Motorola's VPI seminar, an instructor from Northwestern University teaches the VPs how to handle crisis communication. Participants analyze press releases and news programs to determine whether messages were effectively communicated. <P>How do Pittsburgh executives rate? You tell us.<P>Annually at Executive Report, we pick a Corporate Communicator of the Year in conjunction with the Pittsburgh chapter of the Public Relations Society of America's Renaissance Awards.<P>Last year's winner was Duquense University President John E. Murray Jr., a master communicator. This month, we'll pick our corporate communicator of the year for 1996.<P>He or she will be a person whose messages reach the right audiences and align them with his or her perspective. This person will be someone against whom other business people can benchmark and learn.<P>We hope the choice we have to make is a tough one.      <P>

<BR><FONT SIZE=+2>New Year, Old Ideas<BR>Let's Try Something New For a Change 
</FONT SIZE>
<font size=+1></font><BR>
<i> By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher </i></b>
<hr>

The time is New Year's Eve. The setting is the newly renovated Heinz Hall. The players are the world-renowned Pittsburgh Symphony and 2,000 First Night attendees.<P>Surrounded by the melodious tunes of one of the world's greatest orchestras and the energy of a wildly enthusiastic crowd, I pondered the region's fate.  After all, New Year's Eve is the annually appropriate time for contemplating the future. <P>From my perspective, that future is bleak. Despite my attempts to shrug off  my concerns about this region's stagnation, the harsh reality of Pittsburgh's waning competitiveness besieged me.<P>In some ways, it seemed like a  New Year's Eve of old instead. 1996 doesn't promise significant change or improvement. One of this region's competencies is its widely acclaimed cultural assets and performing arts organizations. But our rich cultural base has fostered an abject adherence to tradition: the works of Mozart, Matisse and Shakespeare are inviolate. <P>Communities, by contrast, are not fine works of art. They should change over time. Culture and the high quality of life that it creates is key to successful economic development, but the concomitant tradition that it imposes is repressive. The compulsive need Pittsburgh has to keep things "the way they were" is the region's most formidable enemy. <P>As comforting as our insularity and inherent sense of sameness may be, a region steeped in tradition is doomed to failure in today's globalized world. The New Year's resolution that I propose for the region is to dare to be different. Forget traditional approaches and philosophies - they will ultimately choke this region.<P>Only effective, maybe even brazen,  leadership will offer real hope. But the Pittsburgh region lacks leadership because its cli mate debilitates those who demonstrate leadership skills. New ideas are not welcome. Instead, instant replays of past approaches are equated with leadership.  <P>Andrew Carnegie is not likely to return as the region's savior. As we continue to celebrate his effusive generosity and extraordinary contributions, we must work together feverishly to build our own future. The days of a dozen people in the Duquesne Club determining our destiny are over. The collective effort of communities of individuals will dictate the region's fate.<P>The Pittsburgh region will become impotent in a world economy if we continue to rationalize inactivity and accept the status quo. This year, we must break tradition, depart from the norm and seize the opportunities that globalization presents.<P>

<b><P align=center><FONT SIZE=+2>Lethal Legislation
</FONT SIZE><br>
<font size=+1>A Proposed Bill That Will Limit Immigration
</font><br>
<font size=+1>is Bad News for Business</FONT>
 <i>By Lawrence M.Lebowitz
</b></i>

<HR>
A few weeks ago, representatives of more than 50 western Pennsyl-vania businesses met with U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter at our law firm. These business people all told Specter that the immigration bill proposed by Republican U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming would hurt their companies.<P>The meeting mirrored another later that week between business people and Specter in Philadelphia, and hundreds of other meetings between senators and business leaders nationwide.<P>The meetings have been called by several organizations, including the American Immigration Lawyers Association, to make Congress understand that the Simpson immigration bill will hurt the U.S. economy. Specifically, the Simpson bill would significantly limit the ability of U.S. companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers, including those at the executive and managerial levels.  <P>Laws governing employment-based immigration must effectively serve the dual purpose of helping U.S. employers remain competitive in the increasingly global economy and protecting jobs of U.S. workers. The law as it now stands does this.<P>Simpson's bill, which proposes to help U.S. workers, will actually hurt them. By eliminating this small but central part of the work force, U.S. jobs will be lost.<P>Surveys indicate there are more than 200 foreign companies with operations in western Pennsylvania, em-ploying more than 10,000 people in our region and more than 60,000 nationwide. Estimates based on the more than 100 foreign companies our law firm represents indicate that only 4 percent of these firms' employees are from other countries. But without those 4 percent who are immigrants - managers, technicians, scientists and others with special skills - these businesses and these other thousands of jobs would not exist.<P>The Simpson bill reduces the available employment-based immigration visas by 46 percent, from its current level of 140,000 to 90,000 per year.<P>Simpson wants these jobs to go to Americans. But what will really happen is that the jobs won't be filled at all. As a result, other jobs will be lost.<P>Here are some examples of how employment of a very small number of highly skilled immigrants creates jobs for people in western Pennsylvania:<P>
<LI>	A Pittsburgh-based equipment manufacturer with 50 employees that is developing a technology that the federal government has deemed to be in the national interest needs four Russian engineers who know more about the technology than anyone else in the world. <P>
<LI>	A Japanese conglomerate employing 4,000 people nationwide (200 in Pittsburgh) is directed by 140 immigrants who are transferring a proprietary technology developed in Japan.<P>
<LI>    One of the world's largest companies, with its U.S. headquarters in Pittsburgh, constantly applies technologies developed in one part of the world to the rest of the world. As a result of its ability to import the needed scientists and technocrats, thousands of manufacturing and support jobs are created in the United States.<P>First on Simpson's "hit list" are nonimmigrant, or temporary, visa categories. The legislation reduces the authorized period of stay from six to three years for professionals who obtain visas under what is known as the H-1B status. And the Simpson bill requires all employers who hire foreign professionals under the H-1B visa category to pay a "penalty" to the U.S. government of 5 percent of the employee's yearly income in year one, 7.5 percent in year two and 10 percent in year three. <P>Perhaps most outrageous is the proposal to make employers who "sponsor" a permanent resident pay 105 percent of the "prevailing wage" rate, that is, the average compensation paid to all other similarly situated workers, and also pay a tax of 10 percent of the employee's annual income. <P>Only an outcry from business will defeat the Simpson bill.  The Pitts-burgh business community should join with businesses across the country in making it clear to Congress why the proposed legislation is unnecessary.  <P>Tell your elected officials that   both nonimmigrant and immigrant       workers are instrumental to the success of many businesses. Explain that if    the Simpson legislation becomes law, American business will be unable to obtain highly specialized workers    from abroad who help keep our    country competitive.                               n<P>Lawrence M. Lebowitz, chairman of the Pittsburgh chapter of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, is a director with the Pittsburgh law firm of Cohen & Grigsby.<P><P>

<H2>Working Like a Dog</h2>When Gail Amshel of Pittsburgh was laid off from her job as a pharmaceutical sales representative a few years ago, she was relieved. The stressful career didn't suit her personality. She decided try something she liked to do. And what she liked to do most was take care of animals.  <P>But turning that love into a career was another matter. Amshel knew how to care for animals. She had volunteered for years at the Pittsburgh Zoo and had raised pets all her life. Then her veterinarian wanted the name of a pet sitter to whom the vet could refer people, so Amshel gave him her phone number. She got six calls in two weeks. She knew she was on to something.<P>Today, Amshel's life is very different from her pharmaceutical sales days, and immensely more rewarding.  After two successful years in the pet sitting business, Amshel has five independent contractors. Despite hair-raising experiences like pet sitting three dive-bombing cockatiels, three 35-pound South American tortoises and an attacking rooster, Amshel feels very lucky. <P>"I am one of the fortunate few who get to make a living doing what I truly love," she says.<P>Amshel had some help early on. The Service Corps of Retired Executives counseled Amshel on how much pet sitting she would need to do to make a living. SCORE also helped her secure liability insurance, and helped her legally hire the independent contractors.<P>"She had the vision," SCORE counselor Horace Miles says, "and I helped her tackle some of the early problems."<P>National trends show that pets are big business, from breeding them to feeding them to Amshel's niche: taking care of pets when the owner is away. <P>In Eugene, Ore., Dan and Trish Cole leased a defunct gas station and opened Suds'Em Yourself, a full-time, self-service dog wash. The Coles provide waist-high dog tubs so customers won't have to bend over, and electric dryers to blow away the wet-dog aroma. The cost is $6 for small, short-hair dogs and $11 for family-sized, long-hair models.<P>The Coles average 20 dogs a day and employ part-time helpers.<P>The pets are even doing the work themselves in some businesses. Many firms now pay $450 to $800 a month to hire guard dogs instead of paying at least $2,000 a month for a security guard.<P>      In other re-gions, firms are renting dogs to women who take them along as protection while they jog or walk for exercise. One example is Project Safe Run, which was started by a rape victim from Oregon. For a  $25 monthly fee, women can call to reserve a dog, then pick it up and run, walk or hike. The service also has been used by senior citizens of both sexes. <P>While running, the dogs wear backpacks that display the Project Safe Run logo. They also carry the runner's keys, wallet, phone numbers and a Pooper-Scooper. Not every dog makes the cut. They must have the smarts to bite on command, but also must demonstrate restraint by refusing any food that is not placed in their bowl at home.                                                   n<h2> Plowing Through</h2>Is your back shot yet? Or - if you own a small business - is your snow removal budget shot yet?<P>A Pittsburgh firm is banking on it.<P>Just in time for the dead of winter, Solotec Corp. came out with its Driv'nPlow, a lightweight, portable snow plow that works with most mid-sized sedans, compact cars and minivans. The company is hoping that people will drop $279.95 for convenience beyond snowblowers.<P>"This is for professional people who really don't have a lot of time to waste," says Thome Matisz of Solotec. "For that matter, the Driv'nPlow really is for anyone who has better things to do with their time than shovel snow."<P>The plow can connect to the wheel wells of a vehicle or just sit on the ground as the vehicle nudges it along.<P>"In most cases, you don't need to hitch it," Matisz says. "The idea is that the consumer can push it with the car, and that's the beauty of this product."<P>Solotec has shipped units from its South Park warehouse to points all over the Northeast and parts of Canada. Locally, Builders Square and Walmart are carrying the plow, and at press time, Matisz expected to soon have it in Sam's Club.<P>Matisz says the plow unit weighs about 43 pounds and will work with any vehicle with a bumper height of 17 inches or less. That means it won't work with most trucks or sport utility vehicles.<P>When not in use, the plow stores in a garage just like a ladder.<P>The Driv'nPlow will not remove ice, but it did push away 17-inch-deep snow in one run this winter.                  n<P>

<font size=+1>Pennsylvania Business is Still Working for<br>Ridge to make a move on Worker's Compensation                 

</font><BR>
<i>By Jim Strader

<HR>
Winning two races in the Triple Crown brings a big purse for a thoroughbred. A batting average of .666 is a dream for a major leaguer. And, in the words of Meat Loaf, the singer who made his name his meal ticket, "Two out of three ain't bad."<P>So, after accomplishing two of their top three objectives in Harrisburg last year, why weren't business leaders satisfied?<P>Maybe it's because the missing jewel - after lower taxes and regulatory improvements - is workers' compensation reform.<P>"For the business community, it has continued to be a major issue," says Don Liskay, president of CompServices Inc., a workers' compensation company based in Pittsburgh.<P>"It's vital to the economic growth of Pennsylvania. Workers' compensation costs are significant," Liskay says. "To the extent we can bring those costs in line with other states, we're in a better position to compete."<P>Otherwise, say Liskay and others, companies will look elsewhere for expansion opportunities. And, they add, companies now doing business in Pennsylvania may be tempted to move.<P>Gov. Tom Ridge had cutting the costs of workers' compensation on his agenda when he came into office a year ago. The Republican governor listed it with other objectives - such as lower business taxes and a more user-friendly attitude on the part of state regulators - that he felt would put Pennsylvania in a better position to compete with other states.<P>	But the issue never got to the top of Ridge's list. After early legislative success in setting standards for hearing-loss claims, workers' comp remained in the "to do" column.<P>A couple of things got in the way.<P>Foremost, Ridge pushed hard for an education program based on school choice and taxpayer-funded tuition vouchers (or grants, as Ridge called them). The initiative failed first in June, then a revamped proposal fell apart in December. A lot of time, effort and political capital were spent, to no avail.<P>Some saw Ridge's emphasis on the education plan as a bid for national attention in the year before a presidential election. For a 50-year-old governor who likely has higher political ambitions - though he says repeatedly that he is kept busy being governor - such an achievement could have made him an attractive GOP running mate for the White House.<P>Ridge also owed the Roman Catholic Church for its political backing in his run for governor. Despite Ridge's advocacy of abortion rights, the church was seen by some to be looking the other way on that issue in hopes of a win on tuition vouchers. A governor who is the product of Catholic schools and has children in Catholic schools now is a needed ally for the church.<P>Also keeping workers' compensation legislation from moving was the issue's complexity and the fierce fight promised by the numerous parties with vital interests in its outcome.<P>In addition, the architect of the last major workers' compensation legislation, Earl Baker, resigned from the Senate to pursue a job in the private sector. He was sure to have been a driving force in further reform.<P>"I think that slowed the process. He had a tremendous amount of expertise on this issue and had spent years studying the issue," says Liskay, who also chairs the workers' compensation committee of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. <P>Liskay's organization, the primary lobbying group for business in Harrisburg, signed on in support of a bill introduced late in the 1995 legislative session by Rep. Joseph Gladeck, a Republican from the Philadelphia area.<P>Gladeck's goal is simple: to help businesses cut their costs in workers' compensation coverage and insurance. He promotes his bill as an economic development measure, aimed at keeping Pennsylvania businesses in the state and bringing new business in.<P>"The bottom line for business is the cost, and you really need a system that is fair and equitable and provides an adequate level of benefits for people who are injured on the job," Liskay says. "The original mission of workers' compensation hasn't changed in that regard, but it has become very costly in Pennsylvania and it's time for us to correct it."<P>Although eager to get the issue moving, business leaders are reluctant to gripe too loudly. After all, Ridge and the General Assembly have been kind.<P>"I don't know if you'd characterize it as frustration," Liskay says of the sentiment he perceives. "We believe the commitment is there on the part of the administration."                                  n<P>

<font size = +1>Siena is What Home Would be Like, if you Had the Time
</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl
</I></B>
<p>

<hr>
Every month when the catalogues and home magazines come, do you let your mind wander to the atmosphere you might create - if you had the time, the money and no kids or dogs? The owners of Siena, a new restaurant that its owners label "culinary art," have indulged those fantasies.<P>Downtown in Market Square, the space Jake's formerly occupied has gotten a comprehensive facelift - and a beautiful one at that. The space has been redecorated in rich shades of amber and ivory, the walls have been sponged with glowing color, and the shades on the unique ceiling window panels sparkle with celestial bodies. Unusually crafted wooden chairs, rather resembling executioner's stocks, distinguish the bar area. Muslin chaircovers and tapestry pillows in jewel tones are touches that make the room both elegant and warm. <P>Which seems to be the theme throughout. The decor, the menu, the service - all professional and exact, yet warm and unintimidating. Contem-porary, but not pretentious.<P>The menu is the same way. The offerings salve those venturing from their regular roosts while pleasing those looking for new cuisine by using familiar ingredients (well, most of them - I'm still not sure I know, or want to know, what forcemeat is) in inventive combinations.<P>The appetizer list includes creations like their beggar's purse, a "blend of goat cheese, herbs and seedless grapes enveloped in phyllo." We tried the grilled salmon flatbread, which is a small flatbread pizza layered with Boursin cheese, salmon and caviar. The result is remarkable, but avoid the caviar if you don't like things fishy. Another delight is the Maine lobster cakes, which are smooth and delicious, served under a towering baked cracker shaped like a trellis.<P>The Siena salad is a potpourri of greens, including radicchio, beet and escarole. The grilled portobella salad tops the same greens with a meaty mushroom, seared and juicy. Both are a meal. Careful, they're liberal with the salad dressing - we chose the balsamic vinaigrette, which was on the oily side.<P>The entree selection goes from chicken to fish to beef, with some more unique offerings, like venison. Vegetarians have a couple of interesting choices, such as wild mushroom ravioli and a casserole of root vegetables. We tried the rack of lamb, which was beautifully grilled but unfortunately paired with a forgettable bread stuffing. The dish was sided with a very nice complement of quinoa, an ancient grain favored by the Maya. The venison medallions were crusted with walnuts and pine nuts, served atop a slice of grilled yam and dotted with cranberry chutney. The venison was farm- raised, which will suit those who like their game more tame than game, but was a little underdone for my tastes, though I ordered it medium rare. Laid out on a huge serving plate, the food is presented beautifully. <P>The food sounds creative and looks beautiful, but falls a little short in preparation. Perhaps, having only opened in November, it's still gelling -for the owners have between them opened enough restaurants to feed the region. Owners Robin Fernandez (a partner in Metropol and Rosebud), Eric Barth (a Texan with 35 restaurants under his belt), Eric Fernandez (Robin's brother, money guy) and Michael Schumacher, (food and beverage guy) bring an array of talent to the restaurant and, together, have designed Siena as a total experience. The wine list is impressive, and they'll open any bottle to sell a glass. Aperitifs, cigars and espresso are offered after dinner. <P>Add the name Siena to the growing list of restaurants upping the ante for local establishments. That's both creatively and financially: Be prepared, or the bill could take your breath away. Dinner for two, including appetizers, salads and entrees, was $140 before adding a tip. You can't do it every day. <P>But you get what you pay for. <P> Siena<BR>430 Market Square<BR>Pittsburgh, Pa.  15222<BR>412/338-0945<BR>Hours: <BR>Lunch, Mon. - Fri., 11:00 to 2:00 p.m.<BR>Dinner, Mon. - Sat., 5 to 11 p.m.<BR>Appetizers and Salads: $4.95 - $14.95<BR>Entrees: $14.95 - $29.95<P>

<hr>
In 1957, Howard and Anne Hanna founded Howard Hanna Real Estate Services, then a small mom-and-pop business serving the East End neighborhoods. Though their three kids, Hoddy, Helen and Annie, all got broker's licenses at age 18, none of them meant to go into real estate. But in the '70s, for one reason or another, all of them ended up in the family business - eventually setting it on the path to what it is today. The region's largest realtor, Howard Hanna Real Estate Services has 22 residential and commercial sales and leasing offices, 750 associates and 10 ancillary companies. Helen Hanna Casey, second of the three children, is now president of residential sales for the company. No middle child underachieving complex here - Casey is overseeing what can only be termed unprecedented growth for the company. She talked to ER's Lydia Strohl about the family empire at their plush new offices in RIDC Park.<P>Executive Report: You grew up in this industry, right?<P>Helen Hanna Casey: My father started this company when I was six. He had been executive director of the Homebuilders' association and he was transferred to Cleveland. My parents had just restored a 170-year-old house. So he commuted. Then he was transferred to Chicago. My grandmother was not well, and my mother didn't want to leave Pittsburgh. So he started his own company.<P>ER: Why real estate?<P>HHC: I'm not sure. There were probably a couple of reasons. In the 1940s in Pittsburgh, you either worked for a major company or you worked for a start-up business. My father went back and got his master's in economics, I'm not sure why. His grandfathers both had family businesses, and my mother's family came from a family business. A good friend of his dad's had a real estate company: That's where he did I guess what you would call his apprenticeship, working for a year before he started his own company.<P>ER: What was the industry like then?<P>HHC: It was very different. We refer today to them as mom-and-pops, one-office companies. Then, everything was a one-office company. We always had a lot of women working for us, but most companies had a lot more men in the sales force. You had one office that specialized in that one area, people didn't cross around town as much. You did a little of everything, different kinds of sales, rentals, notary public, insurance, all kinds of things that we really didn't do. We really specialized in residential, and a little commercial.<P>ER: When did your growth occur?<P>HHC: The real growth mode came in the '70s, for a couple of reasons. My father bought an appraisal business that had a base in the North Hills. Then my brother [Hoddy Hanna, now president] came in and the decision was made that now was the time to expand. Our real growth, and this is unusual about us, started in the city. In other markets where there is a regional broker that is the major broker, most of them started in the suburbs. We followed the migration of our clients. Where our clients moved we moved, so we went to Fox Chapel, Forest Hills/Churchill market, etc.<P>ER: Was a conscious decision then made to have the company become more than a nice living for your family?<P>HHC: I would say that came a little later. Certainly my brother had the advantage, because of my father, to be able to go to other cities to look at other companies, to take courses, to look nationally to see what growth patterns were. We grew tremendously in the '70s, and I would say by the late '70s there was a concerted plan to be the largest regional broker.<P>ER: And you joined the company just after your brother?<P>HHC: It's a little odd. We all got our licenses when we were 18, because when you're a sole proprietor you worry if something happens. My mother never really sold, but she has her license. They wanted the protection, but they didn't want us to get into the business - any of us. My brother worked in the summers during college selling. But my sister and I were also licensed at 18 - and I can remember being a rental agent in a pinch one summer or something - but we didn't come in until after school.<P>Each of us had different plans when we went to school. My brother was to go to law school. I can still remember the night he told my parents he wasn't going. I had planned on going to law school also, and instead worked on my master's in history, then got married, had babies and taught. I joined the company in 1976 - I'm the middle child, but I was the last of the three. My sister Annie [Cestra], get this, got her master's in deaf education. <P>The draw was different for me, probably, than for them. I was teaching in a small private school and came into the industry like a lot of women, with a personal need for more income. My father was saying that what I knew as women in the industry in the '50s and '60s was not the same as women in the '70s, that what we were seeing was young, educated women who were really coming in and making a name for themselves and establishing their own careers. I think for a lot of the women in the '50s it wasn't so much a choice, they had to go make a living because they were widowed or whatever, in a time when not many women worked. And they were not in the mainstream of society because they were working women, I don't think they considered it a career. You worked a couple of hours here, a couple of hours there, sold people from your bridge club, whatever.<P>That changed dramatically in that 20-year span, to something that had more structure.<P>ER: Are women better at sales than men?<P>HHC: No. I think more women are in the business than men, so the numbers are very skewed. This is because of the flexibility, and because women have done very well in it. They can have a very good career and still have a family. That's why people come in, because they want to have flexibility. But it's the flexibility of personality, not just of time, that makes the difference, that makes success. You've got to be able to switch from one thing to another very quickly.<P>  I'm a firm believer that the word salesman is a dirty word in this country. We have tre-mendous numbers of associates that are former nurses or teachers, and they would never have said that they were salespeople, but I don't think you can get a third-grader to learn fractions unless you can sell them on the idea that it has some meaning for their life. You're selling your ideas. <P>ER: You've had a lot to do with training and development since you've been in the company. How has that changed the career?<P>HHC: There's a theory that people used to come into real estate and they would say, "Here's your desk, here's your phone, start calling people."<P>We were never structured quite that way. Through the years my brother and my father had training, but it was not very structured. I formulated that into a structure. I had advantages because I was able to go off and see what other people were doing. There were days I would go places and watch training tapes for 10 hours and decide what was best for us. People wanted more training, more structure. We've always done one-on-one training, and people across the country are always amazed at the time that our management team puts into training. <P>ER: Has the industry changed in the same manner that Howard Hanna has changed?<P>HHC: Multi-office companies in the '70s and '80s really grew. Some survived and some didn't. There have been major changes in that - nationals coming in and buying local firms, franchising, 100-percent concepts - that have come in over the years.<P>The key to our success without question at Howard Hanna is two things: Our ability, because it's privately owned and it's our name on it, to take the chance, to know that we're only putting ourselves at risk when we open a new market area or buy a new company. And number two, the people who are associated with us - people who have been here years - and are part of the Hanna family. <P>ER: Is it difficult to incent people for commitment to a company that is so family-oriented?<P>HHC: In 1979, we had really opened up a whole bunch of offices. And what did we do - we moved our people up and around. My brother hired a consultant - one of our big concerns was nepotism. When I first started in the business, I lived in Highland Park and had two small children, and I worked in the North Hills office. It was tough, but we were afraid that if I worked in our city office everyone would think it was unfair. So I went to the North Hills for six months, then came back to the city office. Then a couple years later this consultant comes in. I wasn't being considered for any management job, my sister had always been back of office, never in the sales force. He wanted to meet with us, and came back telling us, "You're not using your best assets, your family is your asset here." <P>I can remember someone telling me they were going to leave because I was the manager of that office and they could never be manager. I said, "I don't believe that. I'm 30 years old, and if you think I intend to be manager of this office for 40 years, you're nuts." Sure enough, in 18 months I was regional manager. <P>ER: Do you use unique incentives?<P>HHC: It's always hard to tell. We basically have the same kind of program in terms of commission, but we have additional incentives that we think are different because we don't charge off a lot of things to our sales associates. We pay the advertising expenses, etc. A lot of the incentives we think grow business. We have quarterly events, annual trips, profit-sharing that is not affected by anything but their own production. <P>Three years ago, we put our sales associates on a program where they can get a monthly check, called the income advantage. I don't know anyone else in the country that had it at the time; we were in the Wall Street Journal. About 20 companies have it now. It's a tremendous boon to us. The nature of the industry is that you get paid large sums of money at closing. We hope it gives people more security.<P>ER: The company has been on a real growth spurt. How far can you go?<P>HHC: As far as we want. We've  gone into Beaver County and Lawrence County this year, we went into Washington County last year and Butler the year before. It'll be a big growth year in terms of our expansion. We're going to cross the border into other states.<P>We think the opportunities are that a lot of the outlying counties have individual brokers. We see expansion of what a work commute is - 10 years ago in Pittsburgh a half-hour commute was a long time. Today, 45 minutes is not uncommon. We see an expansion of the edge cities. <P>We're lucky to have a diversity of desires here. People want city living - and we're fortunate many of our city neighborhoods never had to be regentrified. New construction will continue to expand. I believe there is a desire for more community feeling. People are no longer just moving to a school district. Families, especially, are more concerned with where the park is, where the library is, what services are available in my neighborhood.<P>ER: Is Pittsburgh still the place where people who visit are astounded at how little a house costs?<P>HHC: That changed, for two reasons, after about 1990. On the East and West Coasts, 50 to 100 percent appreciation a year, so they weren't coming with realistic numbers. There was a leveling off on the East and West Coasts. And all of western Pennsylvania, between 1988 and 1992, had more appreciation than they normally had.<P>ER: So you're planning to stay a regional company?<P>HHC: It depends what "region" is. Without question there are parts of Ohio right now that are part of the future of our region. West Virginia is the future of our region. We can look at what we have mapped out for the next two years, but the region could be far beyond that in three years.                        n<P>

<P align=center><B><font size=+2>An Off Month
</font><br>
<font size=+1>The Technology Stocks Take Some Lumps
</font><BR>
<i>By Doug Thomas
</i></b>

<HR>
What technology stocks giveth, the market hath taken away. FORE Systems, Respironics and II-VI Inc. all lost ground in the month ended Dec.15, which in turn caused the ER Index to slip slightly behind the S&P 500, but only for the month.<P>Since inception in August 1994, our basket of local stocks has risen 35.4 percent, while the S&P index is now up just 33.6 percent. For the month, though, the S&P won hands down, with a 3.99 percent return vs. just 2.7 percent for the ER Index. The exciting part of the story is that many of the companies in the Index, including those mentioned above, are busy positioning themselves for a bright 1996 and beyond.<P>FORE Systems, for instance, made two significant acquisitions that should bolster its leading position in computer networking. FORE purchased Alantec Corp., the San Jose, Ca.-based maker of network switches, which are electronic devices that boost the transmission speed of computer data through local-area computer networks. FORE makes networking equipment based on asynchronous transfer mode, which is faster still. Its acquisition of Alantec should enable FORE to help its customers increase their capacity to send computer data by applying ATM to their local networks.<P>The stock transaction, which is worth approximately $716 million, is expected to be completed in March. The merger, says Eric Cooper, FORE's chairman and CEO, "gives us the opportunity to have it all in our bag."<P>FORE also bought a private company, CellAccess Technology Inc., a Los Gatos, Ca.-based supplier of digital access products used in computer networks. CellAccess will expand FORE's ATM product line and provide a cost-effective way to link LANs and circuit applications such as voice and video in remote offices to wide area networks. CellAccess will cost FORE approximately $45.5 million in stock.<P>Since the beginning of the year, FORE shares have nearly doubled in value.<P><B>Around the Index</B><P><HR>Cable Design announced late in December that it would purchase Northern Telecom Ltd.'s Canadian communication cable and network wiring unit in a deal that could double Cable Design's annual revenue. Cable Design posted revenue of $189 million for its fiscal year, which ended in July. Northern Telecom's projected annual revenue is $190 million.<P>As part of the $90 million deal, Cable Design gets a number of important new products as well as offices in Canada and 800 employees, including salespeople in Europe, the Pacific Rim and Latin America.<P>Cable Design also reported record results for its quarter ended Oct. 31, with sales up 45 percent and net income up 66 percent. The company also effected a 3-for-2 stock split that was effective Dec. 29.<P>Cable Design, which went public in Nov. 1993, has risen nearly              133 percent since August 1994. It jumped more than 28 percent last month alone.<P><HR>Astrotech International reported a superb fourth fiscal quarter, ended Sept. 30, which capped a terrific year for the maker of stor age tank products. Revenue for the quarter increased to $28.9 million from $23.7 million, while earnings per share doubled to 10 cents from 5 cents in the period. For the year, revenues topped $100 million vs. nearly $69 million last year, while operating income was 28 cents vs. 9 cents.<P>The company ended the year    with "substantial improvement in   revenues and profitability," says             S. Kent Rockwell, Astrotech's chairman and CEO.<P><HR>Aluminum Company of America announced in December that it will build a $32.5 million plant in Hungary to make forged aluminum wheels for trucks and buses. The company says demand for its strong and lightweight wheels throughout the world will soon exceed its U.S. production capacity.<P>In other news, ALCOA promoted company veteran Alain Belda to the new position of vice chairman, possibly making him a strong contender to succeed Paul O'Neill as chairman and CEO. Belda was one of two people who previously were being groomed for the position. <P><HR>Doug Thomas is vice president, director of research for Lancaster, Pa.-based Emerald Asset Management.<P>

<b><font size =+1>The Region's Research Environment Helps Draw Medical<br>Talent -But Will Decreasing Funding Edge Us Out?</b></font><br>
<i>By Christopher Lawton</i>
</center><P>


<HR>
It used to be that a patient with a brain tumor underwent traumatic and difficult surgery - difficult for both patient and surgeon alike.<P>Not any more, due to a physician who now calls Pittsburgh home.<P>Dr. Takanuri Fukushima, a world- renowned geneticist, was lured away from the University of Southern California by Pittsburgh's Allegheny Singer Research Institute, where he now chairs the Human Genetics department.<P>"One of the more difficult types of surgery involves the extraction of tumors from inside the skull," says Leslie Shuttleworth, vice president of ASRI. "However, with the discovery of new equipment and new techniques, this surgery can now be performed more efficiently and with less pain."<P>Fukushima is just one example of how the Pittsburgh healthcare community, by mixing research with clinical treatment, is attracting top talent. These are special people.<P>"Many people in this country don't understand the complex nature of the research environment," says Dr. Ronald B. Herberman, associate vice chancellor of research, health sciences at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. "They don't realize that the research scientist must have a firm understanding of minute details, as well as a complete knowledge of how the research will be delivered at the clinical level."<P>Top researchers are important to a healthcare community not only because of the innovation they bring and the attention this garners - they also  attract funding to the community. Pennsylvania is one of the top five states receiving research grant funds from the National Institutes for Health. <P>Pitt annually receives research grants totaling $650 million. These funds have led directly to innovations such as Dr. Jonas Salk's discovery of the polio vaccine in the 1960s. More recently, Pitt's research efforts led to the discovery of a defective gene that can cause aortic aneurysms. Pitt also pioneered techniques in breast cancer treatment, replacing the radical treatment of mastectomy with the     less disfiguring lumpectomy.  The list goes on.<P>"Advances in research at the Western Psychiatric Hospital led to a technique whereby patients who have a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimers' can be detected much earlier," UPMC's Herberman says.<P>But Herberman and others are concerned, because reasearch funds don't flow in like they used to.<P>"Simply put, research centers, including UPMC, are having to consider sources of nontraditional funding, such as joint ventures with corporations, both medical and nonmedical, and associations with venture capital companies," says Herberman. <P>"Other research institutions that don't have the magnitude of UPMC's research budget and absorb much of their own cost may fare better, but the amount of research will be drastically reduced."<P>Anthony Sanzo, president of Allegheny General Hospital, of which ASRI is the research arm, agrees. "When reimbursements and grants for research decline, so will the amount of research that's conducted. <P>   "It's a catch-22 situation," Sanzo says.<P>  Another factor that hurts academic health centers in their research mission is that they often must absorb the costs of treating high numbers of Medicaid and Medicare patients. And because Pennsylvania has a proportionately higher percentage of elderly who participate in these plans, Pennsylvania academic health centers, including those in Pittsburgh, face severe constraints. <P>But Allegheny Singer Research Institute, which is largely funded by internal revenue sources, has many successes to its name. In addition to Fukushima's previously mentioned research, in 1985 Dr. George McGovern, an ASRI cardiologist, performed the first dynamic cardiomyplasty in the U.S. In this operation,  a flap of muscle is trained to "beat" as a means of assisting a weakened heart, an innovative approach.<P>The United States has the finest healthcare in today's world, due in large part to research innovation. Now research institutions, faced with increasing healthcare cost containment demands, must go one better. <P>They have the heavy responsibility of realistically weighing the benefits of their programs, and then leveraging dollars today to ensure discoveries tomorrow. And if they don't? <P>We all lose.                                     <P>

<B><I><font size=+2>The Employee Handbook<br>
</font></I></B>

<b><font size =+1>Most Businesses Should Have One, But Draft It<br>In a Manner That Will Keep YouOut Of Court</b></font><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i>
</center><P>


<HR>
When Judith Smith lost her job at a professional services firm in eastern Pennsylvania, she headed to court with the firm's employee handbook tucked firmly under her arm. Her gripe? That though the detailed handbook set salary levels for each employee classification at the firm, her pay fell below the level designated for her job.<P>The federal court ruled that the employer - in developing the handbook - had written itself into a contract for Smith's salary. So "pay up," the court told the firm, finding that Smith was entitled to the difference between the salary level set in the handbook and what she actually was paid.<P>Employee handbooks bring many benefits to employers, but they also can sometimes - as Smith's lawsuit illustrates - leave a window through which the employer may be dragged into court. So while it's prudent to have a handbook, labor attorneys say make sure you do it right.<P>"Draft your employee handbook so that no reasonable person would consider it as having formed a contract," says attorney Sidney Zohn of Buchanan Ingersoll. "What we see are a lot of different approaches by employees as they try to sue employers."<P><B>Why a Handbook?</B><P>	You think your company is too small to need a handbook? Attorney Bob Prorok of Reed Smith Shaw & McClay points to one state law on discrimination that applies to companies with as few as four employees.<P><B>No company may be too small.</B><P>"Everybody should have one because of the benefits handbooks bring," Prorok says. "The size of the company may certainly affect the size of the handbook - smaller companies don't need as complex a setup - but size should not affect whether or not you have one."<P>"I think generally it's a good idea to have an employee handbook," says attorney Joe Vater of Meyer Unkovic & Scott. "There's one caveat: The employee handbook should be done right, be updated and be followed. If your company won't do one of those three things, then you are better off without it."<P>Prorok and Vater both agree that one key benefit of a clearly written handbook is employee satisfaction. If the rules and requirements are in black and white, the employees know what they can and cannot do. They are unlikely to go to a third party, such as a plaintiff's attorney, for interpretation of or advice about their legal rights.<P>The other main benefit of a handbook, provided that it is followed, is its use when employees charge that they've been mistreated.<P>"Part of every wrongful termination lawsuit is the claim 'You terminated me for X reason, but Joe did the same thing and you didn't terminate him,'" Prorok says.<P>"If you have uniform rules and uniformly apply those rules, it really rebuts the claim that one employee was treated differently than another."<P><B>At-Will Employment</B><P>Pennsylvania is an at-will employment state, meaning employers can terminate an employee at any time, for any reason, or for no reason at all. The courts have protected that right, declining in most instances to declare handbook language as having formed a contract. When an employee sued Conrail, for instance, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania rejected the employee's claim that handbook language, combined with performance appraisals, formed a contract. <P>But employers should take assertive steps to keep disputes from even reaching court. And that can mean making sure the employee handbook doesn't leave openings for employees to sue.<P><B>Some Steps Are Simple</B> <P>One is placing in the handbook a disclaimer noting that nothing in the handbook is intended to form a contract, and that the employee remains an employee at will.<P>Some employers even take it one step further, requiring employees to sign a receipt when they receive the handbook, acknowledging that they understand that the procedures contained in the handbook are for informational purposes only and do not constitute a contract. Vater says he tells his clients to have the employees sign the receipt a few days later, after they've had time to review the handbook.<P>Common mistakes include the use of language that could guarantee employment. Zohn says those terms include "grievance procedure, probationary period, tenure or vested."<P>Some employers also use language that may create a mandatory disciplinary procedure with a "just cause" standard. Instead, Zohn says the language should be open-ended.<P>Most importantly, employers should periodically review and update employee handbooks. Management at one company sued by a terminated employee forgot that a handbook even existed. The employee produced it, and it turned the case in the employee's favor.<P>"These handbooks are something nobody thinks about until they're sued," Vater says. "Then they go scrambling and ask, 'What does it say?'"      <BR>

<B><font size=+2>Employee Retention</font><br><font size=+1>A Little Flexibility Goes a Long Way Toward<br>Keeping the Staff Intact<br>
</font></B><i>By Henry Lipput</center></i><P>


<HR>
Joe Tomko and his wife were expecting their second child, but they weren't expecting this: Early into the pregnancy, Tomko's boss walked up to him and offered a week off with pay upon the birth of the child. Tomko's boss told him to use the paid leave to take care of his wife and new baby.<P>"It is amazing," says Tomko, who works for Pittsburgh graphics design firm A to Z Communications. "I was quite happy, needless to say."<P>So was Goldie Ostrow, co-founder of A to Z, who can personally attest to the return she receives for making such gestures toward deserving employees. For Ostrow, it's been a strategy of success since she went into business close to eight years ago.<P>She went seven years without having an employee quit, a record most small businesses wish they could boast. The ability to retain employees is crucial to efficiency and profitability in small businesses. Businesses with high turnover rates waste time and money recruiting, hiring and training replacements.<P>Ellen Ruddock of Career Dynamics, a business consulting company, says it's important for small businesses to recognize the flexibility they possess and learn how to use it as a mechanism to reward employees.<P>"We know that people go where they are wanted and stay where they are appreciated," Ruddock says. "And flexibility, nowadays especially, is an important part of that picture. We find that more and more employers are moving away from the mindset that the day and the location and the atmosphere for business has to be exactly what it was 20 years ago."<P>Instead, it's more like the atmosphere at A to Z. Dress is casual. Bonuses are handed out to deserving employees. And then there are the gestures such as the one made toward Tomko.<P>Ostrow says she knows she doesn't have the constraints present in a corporate atmosphere, so she's going to take advantage of it.<P>"In comparing what a small business culture can mean to an employee instead of a large corporate culture, I think there's definitely a lot of flexibility in people's scheduling," Ostrow says. "If somebody needs to go to a doctor's appointment, needs to go to a wedding, needs to run out to see their kids in the school play, that's not a problem here.<P>"We can also bonus people very easily at any point in time and without getting permission or filling out forms," Ostrow says.  "If somebody's been working really hard, we can say to them, 'Why don't you take tomorrow off, this project's done, you were great.' We can give somebody a cash incentive when they've really been working hard, at our discretion, any time.  And I think those are the kinds of things that motivate people.  Everything's very performance-driven, people are definitely paid for performance," Ostrow says.  "I think a lot of large businesses pay lip service to that, but can't really see it or act on it the way we can."  <P>     Ruddock has found that many of her client companies are recognizing the need to work around employee concerns.<P>     "They're not only flexible, but there is an awareness of fairness that has to be carried out," Ruddock says. "They will bend over backwards to recognize and award a good performer with some of those needs that employees have. And every employee wants to be able to take care of their family first and achieve personal goals.<P>   "We know that our personal goals drive our business goals. If our employer's keeping us from meeting those personal goals, it's not too long before the resentment builds up. "  <P>Joe Tomko appreciates working for a small company that can address his personal goals and treat him as an individual.  "Occasionally, there will be a need to resolve a personal situation, whether it's a jury duty thing or whether you have to get your car repaired.  You do the work and get the work done, and they're flexible as to allowing you to leave at different hours.  <P>"In big companies, you can't, you're pretty much stuck in a place from nine to five and they really don't know who you are as much. You're a number," he concludes. "And that's what's real attractive about working for a small business."                                  <P>

<B><I><font size=+1>Healthcare Reform Hasn't Yet Trickled Down to the<br>Schools that Produce Doctors, Nurses and Technicians
</font></I></B><br>
<i>By Gretchen McKay</i></center>

<HR>

<P>
The numbers coming out of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center last April weren't encouraging for young people who were hoping to enter the healthcare field. The medical center said it would lay off 400 people and eliminate almost an identical number of positions via attrition.<P>But some other numbers also were raising eyebrows during this period of upheaval at Pitt and other healthcare institutions in the region: A record number of students were applying to the many healthcare-related programs   offered at regional institutions. <P>The message: Upheaval in healthcare hasn't yet trickled down to the schools that train professionals.<P>"Medicine has and always will be an excellent field. There continues to be a great interest in many other health-related careers as well," maintains Dr. Lauren Roth, associate vice chancellor for education/health science at Pitt and vice president for managed care at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.<P>Applications for UPMC School of Medicine's 150 spots each year, for example, have jumped to more than 7,000, notes Roth. And programs in pharmacy, public health and rehabilitation science - the design and implementation of wheelchairs and other approaches for the disabled - have also continued to grow.<P>Pitt is not alone. Applications continue to rise at Duquesne University as well, and that doesn't surprise Thomas Schaefer, dean of admissions and international affairs.<P>"Though the nature of healthcare is bound to change [due to healthcare reform], the demand will not," says Schaefer. "The fact is, we don't have control over our health, and the needs are still going to be there. They're just going to be met in different ways."<P>The move toward managed care, for example, has pushed many hospitals and other caregivers to downsize  to become more cost-effective and to emphasize more efficient delivery of services. For instance, a physician's assistant may treat common illnesses and injuries instead of an M.D.; a surgical technologist might draw your blood instead of a registered nurse; a nurse may practice in the home, or a pharmacist in a large chain store instead of a neighborhood shop.<P>Many area schools have modified their existing programs to make them more compatible with market demands, or have created new programs altogether.<P>Take Pitt and Duquesne. Both recently expanded their 5-year pharmacy programs by one year to the doctorate level, in order to help their pharmacists to develop better critical thinking skills and more clinical knowledge.<P>"We're not decreasing the number of pharmacists but giving them more responsibility," says Schaefer, who adds  that without the Ph.D., pharmacists could have trouble finding a job in the future. The training is more intense, and the program is longer, but in the end, "they'll be able to do things only doctors could do in the past."<P>Nursing is feeling the change, too. Many of the tasks R.N.s traditionally performed in the past are now being performed by less-expensive technicians and technologists.<P>Nursing students are going after advanced degrees, such as nurse practitioner, nurse midwife or nurse anesthetist, as nurses will be involved in a patient's primary care.<P>And who is training the technicians who will perform traditional nursing tasks? Many of the same schools. Heeding market demands, Carlow College recently started two-year certificate programs in EEG and surgical technology, both anchored in the national certification process, and applications continue to outnumber the available spaces.<P>"Work patterns are changing," explains Carol Senator, Carlow's director of allied health programs. "Services that were once delivered by expensive professional staff are now being delivered by technicians or technologists, because those services cost less."<P>A year ago, Carlow also became one of the first schools in the country to offer formal education in anesthesia technology.<P>Beyond clinical majors, there's the business of healthcare. Robert Morris College has carved out that niche, offering four business-related undergraduate programs in health services management, long-term healthcare management, nursing management and radiological technology.<P>"When baby boomers hit the upper end of the demographic cycle, we'll have upwards of 45 million Americans 65 years or older, and those people will need healthcare services," says Gloria Barry, acting head of the department of health administration and allied services at Robert Morris. <P>"And there will be an even greater need to manage those services that provide what they need," Barry adds.<P>What's the future hold? Probably much of the same, as emerging medical technologies will require all sorts of expertise from the physicians through the nurses and down to the technicians. That means more learning. <P>"Today's technology," says Pitt's Roth, "along with changing market demands, basically devotes people to a course of lifetime learning. "                <P>

<center><b><FONT SIZE=+2>Sony and the Clean Air Act</B>
</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=+>The Law is Overly Burdensome on Pennsylvania Businesses<br>But Sony Showed That You Can Still Do A Major Project Here
</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i>
</CENTER>
<hr>
It was long before any dirt was moved. Long before a contractor was hired. Long before the public even had a hint that Sony Electronics Inc. and Corning Asahi Video Products might jointly build a glass plant across the street from Sony's existing Westmoreland County facility.<P>The plant would be built all right. It was just a question of whether it would be built in Southwestern Pennsylvania. Sony loved the sprawling East Huntingdon Township site, only a few minutes from the New Stanton interchange of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. But before Sony would commit, it had to first cost out one critical factor: the pollution control requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act.<P>The amendments Congress made to the law in 1990 require companies in Pennsylvania and several other states to purchase what are known as emission credits if the companies emit certain pollutants. Companies that don't have credits to offset the amount of pollutants they emit must buy credits from companies that have more credits than they need. In other words, companies in Pennsylvania have to pay to pollute. In the end, it costs them more to do business here that it would in Ohio or West Virginia.<P>"We felt the emission credits would be available," recalls Mark Small, Sony's irector of corporate environmental affairs. "Our feeling was that it could be done. But the obvious next question was 'How can it be done cost-effectively?'<P>"No one really had attempted something like this - at least in this region - so we had to be innovative."<P>Very innovative, it turns out. Sony spent a full year researching available credits, eventually buying some at a bankruptcy auction. According to parties familiar with the project, Sony spent about $3 million to buy all the pollution credits it needed to meet Clean Air Act requirements. It was a figure with which the electronics giant could live, so the word came down: Move ahead with the project in southwestern Pennsylvania. Today, general contractor P.J. Dick Corp. is constructing the shell of the 500,000-square-foot facility that will begin production in the summer of 1997 and employ at least 500.<P>A happy ending? Not necessarily when you look beyond Sony. <P>While Sony's story definitely is one of success, it also illustrates the burden the Clean Air Act places on companies that do business in Pennsylvania. Moreover, it illustrates why many companies won't consider southwestern Pennsylvania as a place to locate a manufacturing facility.<P>"There are companies out there that look at our region but don't seriously consider Pennsylvania because the restrictions are too hard," says Harold Miller, director of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Growth Alliance, which promotes economic growth in the region.<P>"There are other companies out there that we don't even know about because they don't even look here from the beginning," Miller says.<P>The Clean Air Act<P>Take a deep breath. The air isn't so bad, is it?<P>Truth be told, the air quality in our region has gradually improved since the collapse of the steel industry. Nevertheless, amendments to the Clean Air Act - signed into law by former President Bush after much debate and eventual approval in Congress - cost businesses in our region millions every year. Even worse, the law as it stands now pushes both new and existing companies to Ohio or West Virginia, where the federal pollution restrictions under the Clean Air Act are less stringent. Companies don't pay to pollute in Ohio and West Virginia.<P>The message to businesses in our region is simple: Go west - about 35 miles or so until you cross the state line - where the cost of doing business is much less.<P>"The Clean Air Act makes it more difficult to do business," says attorney Harry Klodowski, who brokers the purchase and sale of emissions credits. "I know companies that have sent their plant expansions to Ohio because of it."<P>So does Scott R. Dismukes, a former Environmental Protection Agency attorney who now heads the environmental practice at the Pittsburgh law firm Doepken Keevican & Weiss. It can be more cost-effective for companies to locate in Ohio, Dismukes says. <P>And for this flight of businesses to Ohio, you can thank the state's Congressional delegation, circa 1990. It supported the Clean Air Act amendments despite what corporate heads in Pittsburgh say was obvious: The ramifications of such a bill on Pennsylvania business would be felt for years.<P>Only one Pennsylvania congressman, Republican U.S. Rep. Bud Shuster of Altoona, shouted "Nay" when the House voted on the bill. The rest - including then-U.S. Rep. Tom Ridge of Erie - voted affirmatively.<P>And it passed.<P>Now Ridge, ironically, in his current capacity as governor of Pennsylvania has launched several attacks against the same measures he voted for in 1990. Late last year, for example, Ridge petitioned the Environmental Protection Agency to remove 37 western Pennsylvania counties from the Northeast Ozone Transport Region, an area covering 12 northeastern and mid-Atlantic states that is subject to stringent and costly pollution control requirements.<P>In Ridge's defense, he was among many legislators who early on had criticized the Clean Air Act amendments for the negative effect they would have on business.<P>Three months before Congress sent the bill to the White House for President Bush's signature, Ridge took the House floor on May 23, 1990, and predicted dire consequences for big business.<P>    "We know that people are going to lose their jobs as a direct result of this legislation, and, oh, indeed what a bitter irony that is," Ridge told his House colleagues from the podium, according to the Congressional Record. "The good news for the people is that they are going to have cleaner air to breathe. The bad news is that they probably will have a little more time to enjoy the outdoors, to hunt and fish and generally enjoy this clean air, because they are going to be out of work as a result of this particular piece of legislation."<P>Yet when it came time to really cast a vote for business, Ridge punted.<P>The Law<P>The Clean Air Act is its common name, but the official title of the law is the Clean Air Restoration & Standards Attainment Act. If you think the name is long, try to plow through the actual law. The bill that went to Bush for his signature totaled more than 1,100 pages and was full of bargains hashed out in the back halls of Congress. In defense of the state's Congressional delegation, our elected lawmakers weren't the only ones who fell in line behind the Clean Air Act amendments.<P>The year 1990, after all, was a time when taking steps to preserve the environment was one way politicians survived the next election. <P>"If you were in Congress and were coming up for re-election, would you want to have to defend the fact that you were anti-environment?" says veteran environmental attorney Dan Darragh of Buchanan Ingersoll.<P>"Would the same bill pass with the current Congress?" Darragh adds. "I don't think so."<P>In 1990, the bill was the subject of months of debate, but eventually breezed through both the House and Senate. In the House, the vote was lopsided at 401-25. The Senate vote was 89-10.<P>Ridge and other lawmakers acknowledged the impact on business, estimating the amendments would take about $22 billion annually from the economy. One of the hardest hit areas would be the Northeast - including Pennsylvania - since companies there would have to pay to pollute while their counterparts in Midwest states like Ohio had no similar costs. In the end, lawmakers justified supporting the amendments with the argument that doing nothing to clean up the nation's air would be even more costly as a result of higher health bills and related economic losses.<P>Perhaps then-Senate majority leader George Mitchell, the venerable Democrat from Maine, best summed up the state of mind in Congress:<P>"With the passage of this legislation, we will take a long overdue step to renewing our national commitment to an active, effective and aggressive program of controlling the pollutants that threaten the air we and all Americans breathe," he said immediately after the Senate vote.<P>In a nutshell, the law marked the first overhaul of the federal clean air law in 13 years. It required new pollution controls on automobiles, factories, thousands of businesses and coal-burning power plants. <P>Specific to Pennsylvania, the amendments designated Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties as a moderate nonattainment area for ground-level ozone. That designation was based upon high ozone levels the region experienced during the drought of 1988. And with that designation came costly and burden some requirements placed on existing businesses and any new businesses that might consider locating here.<P>Even worse: The amended Clean Air Act placed the region in the Ozone Transport Region, another black list. So even if southwestern Pennsylvania is redesignated as an attainment area under the law, businesses here will continue to face stringent pollution regulations because they are located within the transport region.<P>Consider these requirements: <P>n Outside businesses locating here or existing ones looking to expand must pay to pollute. They purchase emission credits from other companies that have more than they need. The buyer must obtain credits to cover 115 percent of their own emissions. <P>n An existing business in southwestern Pennsylvania is required to install reasonable available control technology, or RACT, on top of other emission controls. The estimated cost is $1,500 per ton of emissions.<P>The Sony Story<P>Money definitely mattered to Sony, but there were other factors in play.<P>The electronics giant liked the work force southwestern Pennsylvania offered and liked the infrastructure already in place. It also liked the prospect of developing dwhat is known as a "Greenfield Site" under environ-<P>mental law. From a business standpoint, attorney Dismukes of Doepken Keevican & Weiss says developing a Greenfield allows Sony to proceed with little risk of later liability for environmental contamination at the site.<P>But from a cost standpoint, the Clean Air Act still loomed large. In fact, there was a point where spending too much to comply with the Clean Air Act would have made the project cost-prohibitive and sent the plant somewhere else, perhaps down Interstate 70 to Wheeling.<P>"The more we spent, the less attractive western Pennsylvania was going to be," says Small, Sony's environmental guru. <P>Sony's emission credit shopping spree took it to U.S. Bankruptcy Court, where credits belonging to the former General Glass plant in Jeannette, Westmoreland County, were on the block. General Electric also showed up, and the two squared off in a bidding war.<P>"That was the first public auction sale of emission credits where people competitively bid," says Klodowski, the emission credits broker.<P>"GE was bidding against Sony for credits GE needed for a plant expansion it was doing in Grove City. GE pushed up the price, but Sony still got its credits pretty cheap. GE ended up buying credits from a power company and paid even less," Klodowski says.<P>Sony bought the rest of the credits needed to meet the 115 percent requirement from Sharon Steel.<P>"No one really has written a book on this, so everything we've done you could really consider precedent," says Sony's Small. "There is information available ... what credits and who has them, but this process is something that cannot be done overnight. For us, it was probably a year-long effort to secure the credits."<P>Most importantly, it was completed within the budget. The time investment paid off.<P>"Obviously, the price that we spent was not enough to make us pick another location," Small says.<P>Ozone Transport Region<P>How bad is our region's air? It's not good, but it's not bad. In fact, had it not been for unseasonably hot, humid periods during some recent summers, the region's air would probably meet the ground-level ozone requirements set by the Clean Air Act. So Miller of the Growth Alliance holds out some hope that the region can soon gain attainment classification.<P>But there's also the distinct possibility that the region's nonattainment classification could be downgraded to "serious nonattainment." During last summer's unrelenting heat, the level of ozone recorded at one monitoring station in the region was the highest it has been since 1988, according to the Allegheny County Health Department. <P>If a downgrade occurs, the 115 percent capacity requirement on new or expanded plants would jump to 120 percent. Regulations that now apply to businesses which produce 100 tons of emissions annually would apply to businesses producing just 50 tons. <P>Then there is the issue of the Ozone Transport Region. Even if the region wins attainment status, it still would be subject to stringent emission standards as part of the Ozone Transport Region. As previously mentioned, Ohio and West Virginia are not in the Ozone Transport Region even though power plants in the Ohio Valley are a source of the pollutants blowing east.<P>"It's a tough thing because a good share of Pennsylvania's pollution does come from out of state," says Shirley Loveless of the Pennsylvania Environ-mental Council. "The unfortunate part is the competitive disadvantage for our state. Businesses in other states that cause a good bit of our air pollution don't have the same costs.<P>"What do we do? We've got some health problems that we know are present even with the standards as they are, so I don't think we want to let the air become more dirty," says Loveless.<P>Some are pushing for the border of the transport region to be moved west and south, leveling the playing field by <P><P>subjecting Ohio and West Virginia to similar requirements. But don't expect cooperation from Congressional delegations in Ohio and West Virginia. They know they have an advantage.<P>In the meantime, people like Miller of the Growth Alliance give Sony and Corning Asahi credit for actually going through with the Westmoreland County project instead of locating the plant in Wheeling or elsewhere. <P>Until the Sony venture, people like Miller had trouble illustrating this region's disadvantage under the Clean Air Act. Now they don't. <P>On the flipside, Sony at the same time is a benchmark for other manufacturers that might consider locating in the region despite the Clean Air Act. Sony found advantages to locating in Westmoreland County and decided to absorb the Clean Air Act costs.<P>"It is a big deal," Sony's Small says of the pollution costs. "But in this specific location, there were too many other benefits. We already were located here, we like the work force and there's great infrastructure here. There were a lot of positives."<P>And the Sony project is a signal, according to Westmoreland County Commissioner Terry Marolt, that large manufacturers can and should consider western Pennsylvania as a possible plant site. He and others agree that there's more to look at than just costs. <P>Will others come? If they do, emission credits are here for the taking.<P>Klodowski, the emissions credits broker, says it's a buyer's market for credits. That probably won't change any time soon, since business development is stagnant. At press time, Klodowski was shopping around emissions credits owned by U.S. Steel and Rockwell International.<P>"The price is soft," Klodowski says. "There are plenty of sellers. Just think if there really were some business development going on here. The market would be tight, the price would go up, and you would have a tough time getting the credits."<P>Let's hope that's our next problem.<P>

It's just before sunrise on a chilly December Saturday, and Jim Hedge is performing his weekly ritual. <P>Leaving the warmth of his suburban home and family for downtown Pittsburgh, he enters a building  wedged between a jail and a massive vacant lot and heads immediately for its basement, two flights below street level. He can't see the darkness outside; this room has no windows. What it does have is coffee and other people who, like Hedge, have chosen this odd path to enlightenment.<P>Ahead of Hedge is a 12-hour school day, so it's no doubt amusing to him that this form of higher education is often referred to as "convenient." The single father of two teenagers has his own word for it.<P>"It's a commitment to yourself, it really is," says Hedge, a senior in Robert Morris College's Saturday One Day A Week Program.<P>But however daunting that commitment, it is one that the region's thousands of nontraditional college students are willing to make. And you won't hear the colleges and universities complaining. In western Pennsylvania,  where the population is aging and where once-prosperous corporations are downsizing, so-called convenient education is something of a growth area, if not a lifesaver, for higher education.<P>As a result, there's intense competition for nontraditional students, commonly defined as those who are not  full-time undergraduate or graduate students. While traditional students can have a majority of educational needs met by a schedule that runs Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., nontraditionals cannot. Most likely, they are busy working, raising families or both. Unless the education fits their schedules, they cannot partake.<P><B>The New Traditionals</B><P>William Presutti, associate dean of Duquesne's graduate school of business, has a theory about the move to Saturday college: With downsizing and more pressure on employees to work longer and harder, the desire to spend nights at classes is not there.<P>"There's only so much energy that you have," Presutti says. "How long a day can you put in?"<P>Family responsibilities also discourage older students from taking classes at night. The best option many see is a good night's rest, then a whole or half day of classes on Saturday. <P>Starting this winter, the University of Pittsburgh is offering 90 classes on Saturday and plans to increase that number in the years ahead. Pitt has been offering classes on Saturday since 1972, but only recently has it aggressively marketed the Saturday-only concept. This scenario is being played out at most higher education institutions, evolving into a major undertaking and a major source of income.<P>At Robert Morris, for instance, part-time students outnumber full-timers, which makes you wonder why they are still dubbed "nontraditional."<P>"They're the new traditional      students," says Carol Yova, director of continuing education and lifelong learning at Westminster College in New Wilmington.<P>And, where these students were once of interest primarily to business or vocational schools, now they are pursued by all manner of liberal arts colleges and universities. "Universities are looking for ways to supplement their traditional populations," says Dr. Robert Comfort, interim dean of Pitt's College of General Studies.<P>At Pitt, the expanded Saturday College will offer B.A. or B.S. degrees in economics, history, psychology, huma-nities and social sciences. Moreover,to make the full-time Saturday program attractive to people who think weekends are for things other than studying, Pitt allows students to structure their classes so they do not have Saturday afternoon classes for nine of the 15 weeks in a semester. <P><B>Hedging Their Bets</B><P>These students are simply good investments. Jim Hedge is a classic example.<P>Hedge, 38, of Dormont, describes himself as a "lousy" high school student who never had much interest in college. And, since he had little trouble finding work after graduating from Keystone Oaks in 1976, he never thought twice about what he may have missed.<P>It was only after he started advancing in the field of motion control and went to work for Reserve Motion Control and Systems in Bridgeville that he recognized what he calls "the glass-ceiling effect."<P>"I didn't think I was in jeopardy of losing my job, but I also saw I was at the top end as far as I could go without a college degree. I realized I needed an insurance policy."<P> In Hedge's case, as with many nontraditionals, his company not only wanted him to get the education, it was willing to pay for it. <P>  Not surprisingly, with this kind of incentive, plus the addition of maturity, Hedge has become an altogether different student than he was at Keystone Oaks. This past semester, for instance, he just missed the dean's list, scoring a 3.17 cumulative grade point average.<P>Since entering the Saturday program at Robert Morris' Downtown campus in the fall of 1992, Hedge has taken classes in the fall, spring and summer each year; or 41 Saturdays each calendar year. His winter schedule was not atypical:<P><LI>	7:50 a.m. to 10:25, Business Professional Writing<LI> 	10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., Operating Systems Concepts<LI>  	1-1:25, lunch<LI> 	1:30-4, Supervisory Skills<LI>	4:05-6:45, Management.<P>But Hedge insists the time flies each Saturday. In August, when he gets his degree, he's even considering going for an MBA, albeit after taking time off to rest and recuperate.<P>"Life experience definitely plays a big part in my being able to do the work," Hedge says. "I don't know how traditional students survive."<P>If it seems as if Hedge and other nontraditionalists are receiving some form of compressed education, it is clear the colleges and universities do not look at it that way. Nor do they want the students to see it in that light. For example, Robert Morris is permitting Hedge's class, which does not complete degree requirements until August, to participate in the college's commencement ceremonies in May. It's a symbolic gesture, but it shows that the older students are every bit as important as other Robert Morris graduates.<P>"The degree they earn is not watered down in any way," says Darcy Tannehill, Robert Morris' associate dean of admissions. "It's the exact same degree. They're not relieved of anything."<P>The same holds true at Pitt.<P>"It's a University of Pittsburgh degree," says Pitt's Comfort. "I say to the professors  who teach them, 'What you expect of              your day-time students should carry over to the others.' "<P>But there are, of necessity, differences. "We ask instructors to keep in mind that many of these students can't get to campus during the week," says Tannehill. As a result, library as-   signments may be curtailed. But, she insists, "They've got to do the same amount of work."<P>   According to figures from the National Uni-versity Continuing Education Assoc-iation, students who attend college on a part-time basis account for one-third of all undergraduates. Two-thirds of all students pursuing masters degrees are part-time and 60 percent of all graduate students, inc-luding those in medical school and law school, can be described as "non-traditional." <P>Noah Brown, director of government relations and public affairs for the NUCEA, says that between 1970 and 1993, the number of full-time students in colleges and universities grew 38 percent, while the number of part-time students increased by 128 percent.<P>The reasons behind those numbers are diverse and range from a decline in the number of manufacturing jobs to an increase in the divorce rate. But one reason remains paramount: money.<P>"There has always been a clear correlation between the amount of education you have and the amount of money you earn," Brown says.<P><B>More Tuition Money</B><P>Money - tuition money that is - is a major incentive for colleges to go after the part-time, older student. <P>Westminster's Yova says that while full-time day students outnumber part-time students at Westminster by a 15 to 1 ratio, the growth is coming from the older students. <P>In an attempt to stimulate that growth, schools are offering part-timers scholarships. Part-timers, paying for their education by the course, are not subject to the housing costs and activity fees full-time students must absorb. According to Yova, part-timers can wind up paying about half of what their daytime counterparts pay for the same degree.<P>Pitt's Comfort says going after the older students is smart marketing for reasons beyond enrollment numbers. He says the older market is a logical target, especially in light of the region's stagnant population base.<P>"Allegheny County is not a growing area," Comfort says. "The aging of the population and shrinking of the potential market for undergraduates has created a competition for students that is very, very intense."<P>"You've got to be customer-oriented," says Duquesne's Presutti. "These students have specific needs."<P>Duquesne's answer was the area's first Saturday morning MBA program, which began in September 1994. On the horizon are a number of joint-degree programs that Presutti says "target specific market niches." Among those will be combined degree programs such as MBA/law, MBA/health management and  MBA/environmental sciences.<P>"A university has a lot of resources," Presutti says. "We have to leverage our resources."<P>If that sounds like advertising-executive-speak, that's appropriate: nontraditional students are heavily  targeted in promotional advertising.  At Robert Morris, for instance, over    80 percent of the school's advertising targeted to specific students is aimed at luring nontraditionals.<P><B>Marketing Niches</B><P>At LaRoche College, the emphasis is not on selling the same education that is available at Pitt or Duquesne or Robert Morris, but selling something that is entirely different.<P>"We're not trying to repeat          programs that already exist," says        Dr. Carol Rush, dean of nontraditional and corporate programs at LaRoche, located in McCandless Township. "We're trying to meet needs not already being met."<P>That's why LaRoche offers a  degree in radiography in conjunction with two area hospitals. The school    has gone directly to the business     community to ask business leaders what courses are most needed. LaRoche offers an increasing            number of certificate - rather than degree - programs in skill areas     such as professional writing, working in teams, supervisory skills and    graphic design.<P>"A really critical need, with so many companies downsizing, is for employees to wear a number of different hats, " says Rush. "They need more skills development."<P>Colleges are wise to please         businesses because many finance        the educations of their employees,          who account for a large number            of part-time students. At Saint    Vincent College in Latrobe, for instance, the majors offered to         those attending evening and Saturday classes are primarily business-             oriented: accounting, business management, finance, communications, computing and information sciences and liberal arts.<P>"These areas appeal to those already working," says Elizabeth Balser, director of the career development center at Saint Vincent. "And their companies will pay for those courses."<P><B>Sacrificing Quality?</B><P>The big question surrounding these programs is whether quality is compromised by convenience. In western Pennsylvania, most college administrators insist that is not the case.<P>"Our slogan is 'quality matters,' " says Balser of Saint Vincent. "For the most part, evening and Saturday classes are taught by our regular faculty, the same as our day courses. Some courses require specialists to bring an expertise, such as investors, and they are part-time, but that is true for day classes as well." <P>At Westminster, 99 percent of classes, day, night and weekends, are taught by full-time faculty members. At Pitt, Comfort estimates that 50 percent of business classes are staffed by full-time faculty, as are 40 percent of arts and sciences classes.<P>At Robert Morris, which uses a lot of part-time teachers from the business world anyway, only one-third of evening and weekend faculty is full-time, according to Tannehill.<P>Tannehill says the use of part-time faculty members brings the "best of both worlds" to the classroom. "Those who are out there working bring a practical base into the classroom. And it's good for students to know people in the business world. It creates good ties for employment purposes."<P>An example is Thrift Drug chief legal counsel Joe Bartolacci, who was a CPA before he became an attorney and today still teaches an evening accounting course at Robert Morris.<P>"If you hold [convenient education] to the same standard, same faculty, same courses, and we do," says Edward A. Nicholson, president of Robert Morris, "the result is that the students' ability to learn what you ask them to learn tends to be greater."<P>At most colleges, getting full-     time faculty to teach evenings and weekends is not as difficult as it     might seem. For one thing, there's the enjoyment factor.<P>"To me," says Comfort of Pitt, "the students are the whole reward for doing it. They bring a lot more life and work experience to the classroom and they are actively looking to participate. They have a mature and sensible manner. They're not bumps on a log."<P>Robert Morris' Tannehill says nontraditional students tend to be better in the classroom: "more self-motivated than parentally motivated."<P>While there is no statistical evidence proving that older, nontraditional students do better than their younger, full-time counterparts, there is overwhelming anecdotal evidence that they do. <P>"They're older and more focused," says Brown of the National University Continuing Education Association. "And, they tend to carry a lot fewer credit hours."<P>Perhaps the most surprising development in the rise of convenient education is that an area once seen as an adjunct to the collegiate environment is now seen as something of value to everyone. Attracting such students keeps colleges economically viable in difficult times. Nontraditional students are advancing their careers. And younger students benefit from the experience their older counterparts bring to the classroom.<P>Jim Hedge says even his own children benefit, although they may not realize it right now.<P>"There have been nights when all three of us are sitting at the dinner table doing our homework," he says. "One thing they've learned from seeing me there is they can't use the excuse 'I don't have the time.'<P>"That excuse doesn't work at      our house."<P>

</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+1>When We Sell Our Products Somewhere Else,<br>We Import Wealth Into Western Pennsylvania</font></b><br>

<i>By Jim Urban</i></center>
<hr>
The way Connie White sees it, Altamira Instruments wouldn't be around today if it hadn't been for the products it sold in Europe and the Far East about four years ago.<P>The U.S. economy was flat. Domestic customers weren't buying. Altamira, the Pittsburgh-based manufacturer of lab equipment, would have been in deep trouble if it had not been selling in foreign markets.<P>"Had it not been for exporting, Altamira would not have survived the U.S. recession," says White, Altamira's vice president.<P>"Exporting was the thing that saved our business."<P>It also will likely be one of the things that helps save this  region from economic disaster.<P>In Part II of Executive Report's six-month series entitled Resuscitating the Region, ER looks at how exporting offers a window of opportunity for companies of all sizes to spur growth. In January, the magazine talked about the importance of entrepreneurship. In coming months, ER also will look at transportation, education, tax reform and tourism as other windows of opportunity.<h3>This Month: Exporting</h3>Pennsylvania is the nation's fifth-largest state, but statistics show the state ranks 11th nationally in exporting. Business leaders say that number is unsatisfactory.<P>In 1994, a Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Development Council report titled Discovering Export Opportunities found an overall lack of commitment to international trade within the region. The SPRDC report said those business that do export actually do very little. It also charged that public ser-<P>vices are available to companies interested in exporting, but seldom are used. And finally, the report said the region is void of an essential "everyone wins" mentality toward international trade. <P><h3>To Export or Not</h3>Millions of businesses - large and small - export their products and services to foreign countries, and millions more could, but don't because they are intimidated by the untried and unknown.<P>In western Pennsylvania, only about 125, or 4 percent, of the businesses capable of exporting are actually export experienced. Another 500 businesses, or 14 percent, are ready to export. That leaves the other 3,000, or 82 percent, who are not ready to export.<P>"There are few experienced exporters in region today. Of those who are export experienced, many are short-term focused," says Rita Pollock, executive director of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Development Council, an agency that serves as a focal point for a variety of state and federal programs offering technical, financial and marketing assistance to small and medium-sized businesses in nine southwestern Pennsylvania counties. <P>The SPRDC periodically hosts forums for companies that would like to get into exporting. Pollock says of about 300 to 400 invitations that are mailed out, about 5 to 10 companies show up. And when it's over, usually no more than one or two actually followup with a phone call to the SPRDC.<P>The reasons why compa nies shy away from exporting vary, depending upon to whom you speak. Pollock has a list of excuses that is as long as her arm. Companies cite lack of knowledge, lack of money, lack of staff expertise and time constraints as roadblocks to exporting. Other excuses include excess paperwork, lack of market expertise, fear of losing control and transportation costs.<P>Meanwhile, business people in Hong Kong, Japan and Germany and other leading international traders long have thought of themselves as active participants in a world economy. And more recently, business people in Charlotte, N.C., Columbus, Ohio, and Madison, Wis., are jumping in headlong. That's why business leaders here say our consumers and industry no longer can be insulated by regional and national borders and expect to survive in the global market.<h3>The Altamira Story</h3>Connie White recognized the importance of foreign markets early on. She was not intimidated by paperwork, control or her own lack of knowledge.<P>Good thing for Altamira that she wasn't. The company not only survived the 1991-92 recession, but it also grew sales from $400,000 in 1988 to $2.1 million last year. And the sales are nicely spread across many markets. About 36 percent of sales were in the U.S. last year, along with 48 percent in Europe and 18 percent in the Far East. That compares with 1988, when U.S. sales accounted for 80 percent, with the other 20 percent limited to Europe.<P>The telltale year was 1991, when U.S. sales accounted for only 16 percent. White and her Altamira colleagues already were in Europe and the Far East, which carried the company.<P>"The first thing we did was research markets, listing 20 countries where we could sell. Then we prioritized them," White recalls of Altamira's entrance into foreign markets. "Then we looked for sales agents."<P>Sound easy? White admits, it really wasn't rocket science.<P>To find sales agents, White simply got on the phone and asked other companies that were exporting who they were using. She checked references and moved ahead. Today, Altamira sells in countries such as the Netherlands, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, Korea and China. <P>The business is there, according to those who already are there.<P>II-VI Inc. of Saxonburg, which headed ER's recent list of Top 10 growth companies (December 1995), sells its laser products to over 2,400 customers in 35 countries, with foreign sales accounting for 47 percent of its revenue in fiscal 1995.<P>Even professional services firms are tapping foreign markets. Environmental engineering firm Chester Environmental, for instance, decided to aggressively pursue international business in the early part of this decade and landed contracts in Taiwan, Mexico, South America and China. The result: Revenue generated from foreign business jumped from $170,000 in fiscal 1992 to $12.07 million in 1994.<h3>The Exporting Push</h3>At presstime, the SPRDC was moving ahead with initiatives aimed at spurring exporting. Among several other measures, the agency wants to develop a formal mentoring cycle through which the experienced exporters would work with less experienced companies.<P>The state has also taken steps, recognizing that statewide only about 20 percent of the manufacturers sell their products overseas. Gov. Tom Ridge appointed a task force to develop the state's export strategy, although a final report was not out at presstime.<P>"We certainly need to sell our goods in the other 49 states, but I   think there are other huge markets    out there internationally," the governor says. "We must have a strategy to      promote exports. We must have a mindset that says export, export, export. There are billions of consumers out there for the widest possible range of products.<P>"We have world class workers who produce world class products in Pennsylvania," Ridge says. "I think we ought to stamp them, "Made in Pennsylvania" and get these products  out the door."                                       n<P>

</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+1>An ER Special Report: How the Decision-Making Power<br>is swinging From The Doctor to the GuyWho Cuts the Check</font></b><br>

<i>By Lydia Strohl</i></center>
<hr>
Dr. LaDonna Fuge, a family practitioner at Forbes Health System, spent more time than usual away from her patients last December. And she wasn't holiday shopping. <P>"I spent over a dozen hours in discussions with payors about patients," says Fuge, president of Forbes' Independent Physicians Association. "I had a 62-year-old man who had two strokes, and they told me he didn't qualify for rehab. But I didn't feel it was safe enough to take another option [which the HMO ordered].<P>"And some of the contracts include a gag clause, so you are not allowed to say to the press or to the patient that you disagree."<P>Welcome to the wonderful world of managed care. Used to be, the patient and doctor would decide the most effective course of healthcare. But in an effort to cut costs, businesses - in the form of managed care companies and other healthcare insurers - are micromanaging healthcare.<P>Patients and doctors, meanwhile, are questioning the change. And they're not the only ones wondering whether the guys who merely paid the bills in the old system should be managing clinical care in the new? <P>It's just one of the complex issues brought about by healthcare reform. Even though the Clintons' reform fell flat, the industry is going through fast, fundamental change, nationally and locally. And at the core of the change is money. In round one, the dollars were slashed by downsizing, layoffs and the other usual methods of budget streamlining, like group purchasing for volume discounts. It wasn't deep enough. What's needed, insiders say, is a complete change in the philosophy and delivery of healthcare in Pittsburgh.  <h3>A Nonsystem </h3>At the root of the problem is the fact that what we have been calling a healthcare delivery system isn't really a system at all.  <P>"It's all done informally," says William Cross, vice president of health knowledge systems for the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania. "What we had, until 1985, was a cost-based reimbursement system where anything was covered. You wouldn't take your car into a shop and say, 'Anything you can find, I'll pay you to fix,' but that was what we had."<P>The most effective way to deliver care, say the experts, is to build integrated systems tying in an entire spectrum of entities to provide a continuum of care. Currently, our system is built around the hospital, where about 40 percent to 60 percent of our healthcare dollars are spent. But at an average of over $1,100 a day, that's the most expensive place to care for the sick. <P>A philosophical shift is also necessary, however, to really shore things up for the long run. Today's system is built around making sick people well. The new system, experts say, must shift to focus on treating that first symptom and treating it the most effective way possible. <P>More fundamentally, it must shift to providing preventive care up front to improve the health of the entire population. That eliminates expensive, critical care down the line. Preventive care, coupled with having the best, most appropriate care available when people require it, will demand coordination of everyone from doctors and hospitals to social service agencies, laboratories, home health agencies and many others.<P>"It's hard to do that in a boutique, cottage industry, which is basically the way healthcare delivery is here in Pittsburgh," says Jim Fritz, president of the Southwest Integrated Delivery Network, an entity currently being set up to provide such a spectrum in the region. "But we won't be successful unless we include the whole continuum of care, with the real focus on the primary care physicians." <P>Though physicians only command 35 percent of healthcare dollars, says Fritz, they control 100 percent of the spending decisions. The new model for healthcare acknowledges this, and makes the primary care physician the gatekeeper.<h3>Calling the Shots</h3>With the advent of managed care and the gatekeeper concept, primary care doctors are in demand. Hospitals, insurers and other networks are scrambling to get them on their team, partnering with them, even buying them -   setting them up in new facilities, promising empowerment and giving them signing bonuses as incentives. For managed care companies to ensure convenient access for their members to the system, companies must consolidate their relationships with primary care doctors, including specialists and pediatricians. <P>"For an insurer, success in the future means growing and retaining market share by providing broad access to networks and primary care," says Gus Georgiadis, executive vice president of primary care delivery systems for Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania, which controls 68 percent of the insured population in Western Pennsylvania.<P>To date, Blue Cross has 1,800 of the 3,300 primary care physicians in its coverage area participating in its Keystone HMO. But it wants more. <P>Eventually, the company hopes to have 500 primary care doctors in some form of this "guaranteed access" model. At year's end, Blue Cross had already partnered with 135 physicians, most of whom will be moving to eight new staff centers being built throughout the area. Blue Cross has $30 million earmarked to build the new centers. <P>"The way healthcare is delivered now is fragmented, not user-friendly," says Georgiadis. "We're attempting to meet the needs of the single mom head-of-household market. They need one-stop shopping. "<P>Sounds great - but who wins when clinical and financial goals collide?<P>"Often, despite the physician wanting to provide certain amounts of care, their hands are tied," says Dr. Richard Harris, an internist and president of the Allegheny County Medical Society. "In an HMO network, restrictions apply to certain procedures. And the physician is restricted to sending patients to the hospitals and doctors in that particular network, as well. I had to look in the [HMO's list of doctors] the other day to pick a specialist for a patient, and pick someone I was not familiar with. But if I didn't, the patient wouldn't get care." <P>Interruption of traditional relationships and referral patterns is only one of the side effects of affiliating with managed care. Many changes are a result of primary care physicians being paid by the HMOs on a capitated basis. So instead of getting paid for the services they perform, they are paid one monthly fee, anywhere from $10 to $15 per patient, to provide all services for that patient. Although specialists' fees are not taken from that, the HMO sets up funds to pay for utilization of other portions of the system. What's left, the doctor and the HMO split. Some doctors say they're waiting to see that actually happen.<P>"Never in 10 years have I gotten anything back," says Dr. Marc Schneiderman, president of Fifth Avenue Medical Associates, a physician group based in Coraopolis. <P>"My overhead is increasing, my income is decreasing. Yet the CEO of [one HMO] made $11 million two years ago. There are huge windfalls being made in managed care, and they're being made on the backs of the physicians and hospitals."<h3>Transitional Losses</h3>"I don't know that finances are the real issue," says Harris. "In California [a market in which capitation is the standard], doctors make more money now [with managed care]. As the capitation system gets more established and people take more risk, they can get more reward." <P>But he acknowledges that the system now, with low or no copays for office visits, encourages people to come to the doctor for minor problems.  <P>Another place the physicians lose, they say, is in administration of care. Paperwork from the many different alliances they must now form to ensure that they can cover a broad spectrum of patients is drowning them. <P>But there are more serious problems, like those hours Fuge spends battling about patient care with the HMOs. She cites another case, in which the HMO approved mental care for a patient, but only through an agency it contracted with. The arrangement required a long commute for the sick woman. In another situation, the payor refused to pay for a hospital stay. <P>"I wasted two months of work to get a few thousand dollars back to the hospital," says Fuge. "I have to feed my family, and it's difficult to look back on the week and realize that an entire day of potential work was lost. And those were three I won. But you don't win them all. It tears at your soul." <P>The payers realize that the systems are not perfect yet. All seem to say that cost-effectiveness and patient-centered care can be compatible - eventually. <P>"We're looking for ways to partner and develop systems of care that share income equally," says Dan Lebish, senior vice president of provider network development and management at HealthAmerica. The payers feel that more direct relationships with doctors, like those being made with buyouts and partnering, will help. <P>But some doctors are skeptical. They feel disinherited when they sell their practice and become an employee rather than a proprietor. <P>"The unstated reason for acquiring primary care physicians' practices is because that's where everything starts, and they will direct patients to other parts of the system," says attorney David Lowe of Cohen & Grigsby, who has overseen many practice sales. "By having the primary care physicians in the delivery system, they have access to a broader patient base and revenue stream." <P>Hospitals and insurers buying practices generally arrive at a selling price and a signing bonus. But Lowe says few will guarantee employment of the physician for over 10 years. Most guarantees are for three to five. <P>"In general, I think physicians would rather keep things as they are - masters of their own destiny," says Lowe. "But they see that they need to create ties with one or more entities to insure their own future." <P>Schneiderman says that hired physicians loose their entrepreneurial spirit, and cites 10 percent to 20 percent drops in physician association membership corresponding to this trend. But depending on the alignment, Schneiderman and others say it is possible for physicians to retain some degree of clinical autonomy in this shifting environment.<h3>Taking the Lead</h3>Organizing into self-governing networks and is one way for doctors to retain a larger portion of clinical autonomy and profits. Fuge believes that networks organized by providers are the only way. "It's the only cost-effective, quality-effective, patient-advocate option that I have seen in 10 years," says Fuge. "I believe as clinicians we have the responsibility to drive the bus. Laying down in front of it isn't going to do any good." <P>The premise of these provider networks, or integrated delivery systems, is that they will organize a full continuum of care and contract with the insurance companies and managed care organizations (payers), or directly with employers. Rather than a capitated fee per patient, they will receive the premium dollars, less a negotiated administrative fee, which the payer keeps. So far, two networks have formed in Pittsburgh, with a third expected. Last summer, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center formed Tri-State Health System, comprising UPMC, South Hills Health System, Passavant, St. Margaret and Washington hospi-tals. Southwest Integrated Delivery Network aligns Allegheny General Hospital, Sewickley Valley Hospital, Allegheny Valley Hospital, Forbes Health System, St. Clair Hospital and their physician organizations. <P>The networks organize the continuum by researching the best practices and choosing appropriate courses of care by consulting global data bases to find out what's happening elsewhere. <P>The integrity of networks will be based not only on cost-effectiveness, but also on outcomes - by benchmarking the health of members against other populations and whether they become better over time. Such a standard will ensure that quality of care drives the system. The networks not only agree, but believe good outcomes will be a tremendous selling point.<P>"We're moving toward a continuum of care, a product that has to produce something - cost savings or outcomes or whatever - and that means being able to accept some risk, so that if you get a good outcome you are rewarded on that," says SIDN's Fritz. "It's a lot easier to take on risk in large numbers. The system will win." <P>According to Blue Cross' Georgiadis, it is organizing on many of the same premises, empowering physicians by including them in the governance of the system. But Blue Cross will need to sign the provider systems as well - and, with the strong ties to UPMC forged after its coup there last spring, Blue Cross is naturally aligning with Tri-State. And Blue Cross is talking to SIDN.<h3>The Cost of Quality</h3>Patients are worried too. They are worried when their family doctor or certain specialists are not included in their healthcare plan's network. They cannot understand when an HMO tells them a certain avenue of care is unavailable - well, perhaps available, but not covered. In the future, patients will have to take more responsibility for the lifestyle choices they make that affect their health. And, hopefully, plans will build the systems to help patients to do this.<P>"We pay for our healthcare and we should become more knowledgeable about what is possible and have the best plan possible," says Karen Finestein, executive director of the Jewish Healthcare Foundation, a local leader in facilitating healthcare change. "Communities will get the health plans they deserve. They need to put a searchlight on what's happening and get what they need."<P>No one quite knows what's immediately ahead for healthcare here. Western Pennsylvania has 50 percent more hospital beds than it needs. Hospitals are struggling with change, implementing new programs to remain competitive. Their changes will be among the most fundamental.<P>But is the emphasis on cost reduction contradictory to providing quality care? The state is defining its role as the system's hall monitor, even as the insurance plans are shoring up alliances. <P>One thing is clear - the Pittsburgh healthcare industry has a tough road to travel. Opening a presentation about managed care to doctors last December, Schneiderman flashed a slide of Pieter Bruegel's "Triumph of Death," a 1556 painting depicting the plague. <P>"Chaos," Schneiderman remarked. "That's the milieu of Pittsburgh right now in the healthcare arena."             <P>

</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+1>If Your Architect Isn't Listening,<br>You May End Up With Something You Din't Want</font></b><br>

<i>By Shareen Berry</i></center>
<hr>
"My tailor is the only man I know who behaves sensibly. He takes my measurements anew each time he sees me. The rest go on with their old measurements and expect me to fit them."   <P>- George Bernard Shaw<P>Does the latter sound familiar?<P>Some managers have found it to be the case when dealing with an architect. You discuss a project - whether it be new construction or minor renovation - listing both concerns and needs. In the end, the architect has missed the boat. Or as Shaw would say, "The suit doesn't fit."<P>That's why although the process of finding the right architect can be time-consuming, it's a time investment that usually will pay off in the end.<P>"The most critical thing is the selection of someone to help you interpret your vision," says architect Jay Labarthe of the Design Alliance in Pittsburgh. "Often, it is a mystical process. You can rate, analyze and spreadsheet alternative firms to death."<P>Prepare: It helps to be prepared before making initial contact with architectural firms, experts say. Those planning a project should know their desires and ideas. Then, it's time to ask some questions:<P><LI>For what will the structure be used and will there be ample space?<LI>	Has a location been selected, a budget developed and a construction schedule set?<LI>	Do you have the resources for the project?<P>Now it's time to approach the architects. Some businesses have found it helpful to contact other businesses that have gone through similar projects. They often can provide insight on which firms had their acts together and which firms did not.<P>Some businesses also have found construction companies to be good reference resources, since they are the ones working hand-in-hand with architectural firms on various projects over extend periods of time.<P>"The people who know the most about us are the people at the construction companies," Labarthe says. "After all, many of them have worked for us for 20 or 30 years. In most cases, clients only work with us for a year or so."<P>The Interviews: The meeting is crucial because the client can usually get a personal feel for the architects. It's also a chance to carefully evaluate the firm's history and understanding of your needs.<P>"A good architect is an active listener," says Robert Harald Tarasovich of Johnson Schmidt & Associates. "The architect should evaluate the client's needs and recognize that, just as the clients differ, so do their needs."<P>After gathering all of the needed information, experts say it's good to rate the firms based on personal confidence, design ability, technical competence, professional service and cost. Rating the firms will help the client pinpoint the best choice and move ahead with the project.<P>Those who have been through it, however, offer some advice: Keep the lines of communication open with the second choice. You may need the No. 2 choice if discrepancies over price or logistics develop with the top choice.<P>The Design Process: Don't think this is simple. In fact, it is very complex. Many businesses find that out the hard way by trying to handle the design phase of a project in-house.<P>"Many people feel they can do the work themselves," says Ed Pope of Gardner+Pope Architects. "However, they often disregard the fire codes, electrical codes and other codes that are included with an architect's services. If something goes wrong, the blame falls on us. Therefore, we make sure the codes are being followed."<P>In most cases, architects include in their fee the basic services of preliminary design, development and preparation of construction drawings and assistance in negotiations and contact with the contractor.<P>Other services, such as outside consultation, predesign work and analysis work for site preparation may be required to properly implement the project. Those often cost extra or may not even be offered by the architect.<P>In writing the contract, the client can choose to pay for a set of basic services - standard services common in every project - with a second category of additional services costing extra. With another option, the parties designates services needed up front and set a price for them.<P>Sometimes, too little is known about the project to determine the full extent of professional services in advance and proceed to a contractual agreement based on designated services. In this case, experts say it's wise to provide project definition and other predesign services first, with remaining services to be determined later.<P>Ultimately, after much research and examination, the vision begins to take shape. And because of the deliberate selection process, it takes shape the way you wished.<P>"A reasonable size project takes six to 12 months to design," says Labarthe of the Design Alliance. "Then there's 12 months to build and 12 more months for the contractor's warranty. You are hiring the architect not solely for the design, but for 36 months of guidance and assistance throughout the project.<P>"There must be a mutual trust during that time."<P>

<B><P align=center><font size=+2>Militancy Doesn't Work
</font><BR>
<font size=+1> Unions Have A Lot to Learn From<BR>the UAW Debacle at Caterpillar 
</font><BR>
<i> By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</i></b>

<P>
<hr>
It's been almost four years since a Democratic presidential nominee named Bill Clinton came to Pittsburgh to schmooze with teachers. That's right: teachers, not steelworkers.<P>In this town where for decades steelworkers formed the heart of organized labor, the then-future president shined his shoes and put on his best tie to engage in chitchat about textbooks and mainstreaming at the annual convention of the American Federation of Teachers.<P>There were no flannel shirts. No steel-toed boots. No satin jackets embossed with "Local 1397," the once-large United Steelworkers local that represented 15,000 millworkers in Homestead.<P>Clinton was coddling unionized teachers in July 1992 because they were the strongest arm of organized labor in that election year. The traditional labor unions, which represented a third of the industrial work force when they helped elect Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, only marginally influenced Clinton's win in 1992. He didn't even mention them in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention.<P>Now it's 1996, and little has changed. The traditional labor unions don't wield the clout they possessed years ago. The United Auto Workers proved that last month. <P>UAW members at eight Caterpillar Inc. plants in four states - including Pennsylvania - ended a 17-month walkout that they originally thought would cripple Caterpillar. Instead, only about 8,700 of more than 14,000 who were eligible to strike stayed on the picket lines. Others crossed the lines or retired. Caterpillar, meanwhile, posted record profits.<P>The UAW finally waived a white flag Dec. 2, ordering strikers back to work under the company's terms. Those Caterpillar workers who stayed out for the duration each lost roughly $37,000 in wages before the strike was crushed.<P>This was the latest blow to labor in a succession of skirmishes in which corporate America has shown that it clearly has the upper hand.<P>The mythical Joe Magarac, a towering, burly steelworker who dipped metal bars in molten steel before bending them into different shapes with his bare hands, must be sick to his washboard stomach. <P>Instead, Magarac should be whispering in the ears of these labor leaders who are trumpeting the so-called new spirit of militancy in the AFL-CIO. Union leaders today would be well advised to learn that their most effective tool is cooperation, not militancy.<P>First off, there's little reason for militancy. This isn't the pre-World War II era when workers were toiling for long hours in unsafe workplaces without benefits. This is the '90s, a time when workplaces are safe and management often empowers employees by involving them in decision-making.<P><P><P> And the benefits offered by many manufacturers go beyond the basic. One manufacturing site in New England has a laundry service. Employees can tote their laundry to work, where the company will launder and fold the clothes for $1 a load.<P>Secondly, unions that think militant tactics will work aren't acknowledging the nature of business today. Want to call a strike? The employer of today can hire new workers from the tremendous pool of underemployed Americans. The employer can also shift production overseas or farm it out to contractors. It can even lure union members across picket lines, just as Caterpillar did.<P>A big union gripe today is over change companies make in the work place to become more efficient. Change may result in the loss of a few union jobs, but at the same time it probably secures hundreds of other union jobs because increasing efficiency makes the company more competitive.<P>Only about 12 percent of private-sector manufacturing jobs are unionized today. By the beginning of the next century, labor experts predict that only 7 percent will be unionized. That's about the same number as at the beginning of the 20th century and a fraction of the 36 percent peak in 1953.<P> These unions that remain must realize that they are a partner in making American business more competitive in the global economy. Militant tactics by unions only do their members a disservice and will make American business less competitive.<P>

<i> By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher </i></b>
<hr>

The Fortune 1000 enterprise is no longer the vehicle that fuels economic growth or job creation. Of the meager 1,000 new jobs created in this region last year, few, if any, emanated from large companies. <P>Job growth is the exclusive domain of the small and emerging business sector. So when the Working Together Consortium established the region's economic development mantra as "100,000 new jobs," they dramatically increased the importance of the entrepreneurial sector in this economy. <P>Or did they?<P>Generating 100,000 new jobs regionally before the turn of the century is at best a stretch. If current trends prevail, Dick Berner, Mellon Bank chief economist, predicts a net job loss of 1,000 jobs here in 1996, resulting in no net job gain for 1995 and 1996. <P>Though his crystal ball may be cracked, the modest 1995 job gain is accurate. The Working Together Consortium's strategies to achieve the 100,000 new jobs allow for slow job growth initially, followed by a period of rapid expansion, crescendoing to 100,000 new jobs in the year 2000.<P>Since job growth follows entre-preneurial vitality, the region's relatively low entrepreneurial energy choked any new job creation efforts. In 1995, Pennsylvania's new company formation rate fell from 45th to 49th in the nation. Our job growth rate in these new companies fell from 33rd to 38th in the country. Sadly, once again the Development Report Card for the states ranks Pennsylvania dead last in entrepreneurship.  And University of Pittsburgh research ranks this region's entrepreneurial vitality  well below that of the state, making Pittsburgh arguably the worst major metropolitan center in the nation for new business development. The prospect of generating 100,000 newSince job growth follows entre-preneurial vitality, the region's relatively low entrepreneurial energy choked any new job creation efforts. In 1995, Pennsylvania's new company formation rate fell from 45th to 49th in the nation. Our job growth rate in these new companies fell from 33rd to 38th in the country. Sadly, once again the Development Report Card for the states ranks Pennsylvania dead last in entrepreneurship.  And University of Pittsburgh research ranks this region's entrepreneurial vitality  well below that of the state, making Pittsburgh arguably the worst major metropolitan center in the nation for new business development. The prospect of generating 100,000 new jobs in five years greatly diminishes in this unhealthy entrepreneurial climate.<P>Yet, entrepreneurial vitality has not emerged as a top priority among corporate leaders and public officials. The Allegheny Conference on Community Development presented a plan for regional growth and prosperity at its Nov. 16, 1995, annual meeting. Building an entrepreneurial infrastructure hardly featured prominently. Their grand vision anchored on tourism, retail expansion and housing and commercial development.<P>Entrepreneurial activities should feature prominently in any job creation strategy. Relegating entrepreneurship to this also-ran status guarantees this region will never reach its 100,000 new jobs goal. That is cast in stone - a gravestone, in fact.<P>

<HR>

We see a few companies continuing to scale down their work forces, but it otherwise seems clear that the relentless purging of middle management over the past 15 years has about run its course.<P>Most of us would also agree that the financial results of this approach have been very positive: There have been dramatic gains in profitability.<P>The astute manager, however, should consider a few longer term, contrary patterns that are beginning to emerge. Most notably, as American industries become leaner, meaner and more competitive on world markets, the business environment surrounding those industries changes as a direct consequence. For example, more demands are placed on business resources - particularly human ones - than those resources can comfortably support.<P>On the plus side, alternative markets - previously out of reach - become logical targets of opportunity. In short, downsizing brought about its own demise by reviving the opportunity, and in many instances, the need for growth and growth planning. These are concepts we haven't heard much about in recent years.<P>Now, it is also true that at the time of this writing there are some indications of economic flat spots ahead. Nevertheless, I think most business people would agree that overall, the worm has turned once again - back to growth planning.<P>Even now, a growth-oriented atmosphere seems to be overtaking the survival mentality of the recent past, and quite a few industrial manufacturers can realistically plan for expansion to meet longer term profit opportunities. If that kind of sea change has really arrived, and I think it has, a few assumptions that have become holy writ over the past dozen years must also change. For example:<P> Manpower planning means staying as close to the bone as possible:  Let us all keep in mind that the survival organization everyone has worked so hard to achieve is just that - an inherently temporary group designed to get you through the next year or so. There is precious little flexibility in such organizations and typically one finds large age bracket and skill level gaps.<P> We'll cross the management succession bridge when we get there. We're in no position to do anything else right now:  Those of us in the search profession love this kind of thinking, but is it in your best interest? Right now it probably isn't.<P>There are, of course, many elements involved in expanding to meet a business opportunity, but one seminal issue that inevitably needs early attention is the question of how a company organizes to exploit this challenge. Who will manage all of this tomorrow ... and five years from tomorrow? For example, we all know of a few larger companies, currently doing very well, that don't have a clue where the 10 or more key managers it will need in four years will come from.<P>Fortunately, a few highly decentralized companies, including some of my own clients, have recently recognized a need for some kind of program that will produce enough in-house candidates for expected division general management needs in five years, or perhaps sooner. To do this, several of these companies have, as a matter of policy, begun to seek out several multitalented, promotable people for selected assign ments at officer level.<P>Other types of businesses with larger and more structured, linear organizations, such as big steel and capital equipment, have a tougher problem to solve. Specifically, how do they recruit and integrate the high caliber, partly cross-trained individual into middle management? It's difficult to program further cross-training when larger economies of scale and more complex political environments work against any change in traditional, linear promotion routes - but it can be done.<P>There is also less perceived need for change in most highly linear organizations, but in certain circumstances it may be appropriate because of the cash cow nature of these businesses.<P>Does the solution to either of these organizational problems signal a return to the old Fortune 50 policy of establishing "four guys on the bench" for every position, with a third of management constantly involved in some kind of cross-training? Hardly. <P>The correct policy probably lies a few degrees off the current lean and mean heading. Just add several multi-talented, mid- to higher-level management people with multi-directional promotion routes.                                n<P><P>Charles Reese is principal of Reese Associates, a management consulting and executive selection firm that is based in Wexford.<P>

<P><b>What,s in a Name? Money</b><p>It's likely that Pittsburgh will have a baseball-only stadium someday soon. The question is: What will we name it? Don't expect Roberto Clemente Field, the moniker chosen by former Mayor Sophie Masloff when she suggested a baseball-only stadium a few years back.<P>It's highly likely that any new stadium will bear a corporate name, much like many venues across the country. <P>"It's still a little early, but my sense is yes," says Mark Schneider, chairman of the City Stadium Authority. "It's a big way to support a team in a small market."<P>Some corporations are willing to pay big bucks to affix their name to a venue. Airlines are one example. Michael Jordan roams the United Center in Chicago. There's also Salt Lake City's Delta Center, home to the NBA's Utah Jazz; Phoenix's America West Arena, the home of the NBA's Suns; and USAir Arena, formerly known as the Capital Centre, in Landover, Md. <P>The Landover deal costs USAir $1 million a year.<P>Insurance companies and banks also are willing to pay for posterity. Fleet Center, the new home of the Boston Bruins and Celtics, is named for Fleet Bank.<P>In 1994, representatives of the Civic Arena and the Stadium Authority put out feelers for sponsors for those venues, but received limited response. <P>"We haven't dropped it," says Penguins vice president Bill Barnes. "We are moving on it very slowly."<P>The asking price remains $1 million a year. The Penguins, who control signs in the Civic Arena, have creatively tapped other revenue sources. Look down, at the steps in the seating areas, and you'll see ads for #1 Cochran Pontiac. Look up, there  are two huge ceiling signs proclaiming USAir as the official airline of the Penguins.<P>"You have to continually look for ways to augment your ticket income," Barnes says. "Signage is one way."<P>Coming soon to the arena: floor graphics in the concourse areas. That's right, advertisements, painted on the floor like rugs.<P>At Three Rivers Stadium, management had hoped to bring in as much as $15 million for 10 years when it considered selling the name rights a few years back. Schneider says the authority slowed efforts as the future of the Pirates remained unresolved during the past year.<P>But with the Pirates situation somewhat resolved, Schneider says the authority will look into it again. <P>So take a guess for the new stadium. Here are our favorites: PNC Park. Mellon Gardens. USX Stadium. Heinz 57 Field.<P><P><b>Scrolling Pittsburgh</b><P>Looking for a gift for that special ex-Pittsburgher? Check out Pittsburgh's new screensaver. Twenty Pittsburgh landscapes move blithely across the computer monitor: Aside from the obligatory Golden Triangle skyscape with hot air balloons, there's the incline, the University of Pittsburgh, the Three Rivers Regatta, St. John's church on the South Side, Station Square, a bear at the Pittsburgh Zoo, the Warhol museum and a sunset barge shot. As a special reminder to those far  away to come visit, there's a shot of the new airport thrown in for      good measure.<P>Even better, New Pittsburgh Publications, which markets the screensaver, will imprint your company logo on it. The screensaver costs $29.95, and quantity discounts are available. For information, call 412/681-8528 or fax 412/681-8531. Or interrupt their screensaver and  e-mail them at URL http://www.pittsburgh.net/NewPghPubl/.<P><b>A Voyage for Corporate Support</B><P>Rear Adm. Bill McGowen is setting sail for downtown Pittsburgh in search of corporate dollars. The retired Navy officer is executive director of Pittsburgh Voyager, an educational program centered around a vessel anchored outside the Carnegie Science Center.<P>Not to be confused with the submarine that also makes its home there, the Voyager is a small gray boat, formerly used by the Navy for training in Annapolis, Md., and San Diego. The Navy donated the vessel in 1993 for use as a floating classroom.<P>On board are science and navigation laboratories, resource materials, computer workstations and related equipment. The boat, equipped with central heating and air conditioning, can be used all year round.<P>Students currently using the vessel range from grades five through 10. The program eventually will be expanded to include kindergarten through grade 12. McGowen hopes to sell corporations on the idea of sponsoring school classes on the outings.<P>"It is an exciting, hands-on education program," says McGowen. "We are looking for additional corporate involvement. We are giving companies in the<P>Pittsburgh area the opportunity to join us in this exhilarating experience.<P>"This is an excellent chance for them to further enhance the educational process and help the future work force of southwestern Pennsylvania."<P>The students spend four to five hours on the boat, learning about nautical and environmental sciences. Some students take a stab at navigating a course for the boat. Others experiment with water quality tests.<P>The vessel accommodates up to 30 students. For more information, call the Pittsburgh Voyager at 412/488-5602.<P><b>Juris Imprudence</b><P>A New Jersey firm got into the habit of discharging nontoxic salt water into a nearby creek. To guard against ecological damage to the stream, Magnesium Elektron Inc. installed a complex monitoring system that allowed it to adjust discharges so no damage would occur to the stream. None did.<P>In fact, some of the discharges actually benefited the stream by providing it with needed organic nutrients.<P>The only problem was that Magnesium Elektron was not following its Clean Water Act permit to the letter, which turned out to be a costly mistake to the tune of $2.6 million.  The federal judge in New Jersey who imposed the fine - the maximum statutory penalty allowed in the case - says not following a permit is a serious violation since self-policing is a crucial part of the Clean Water Act.<P>The court justified the penalty by citing damagethat could have occurred and the importance of strict permit compliance.<P>The case is scary: A company that actually helped the environment was sued and hit with the maximum fine. Attorneys at Reed Smith Shaw & McClay's Pittsburgh office point out two other significant points: The penalty was based on what Magnesium Elektron would have paid to overcomply, and the financial condition of Magnesium Elektron's parent corporation was used to determine the com-pany's ability to pay.                               <P>

<hr>
It was Joe Piccirilli's first full day after closing the purchase of the Pittsburgh Brewing Co.  Pleased as punch  about life, Piccirilli squired this visitor into his office, then abruptly changed gears. "No, no, keep your coat on. I want to take you out to the plant." With all the enthusiasm of Willy Wonka taking kids through the Chocolate Factory, Piccirilli proudly showed off the Pittsburgh Brewing Co.  Smiling workers walked up and shook his hand. He joked with them, addressing them by name and sharing details of the closing of the sale with those who asked. In the conference room, he pointed out the many beers the company has brewed over the years - getting little or no recognition for their origination - including theBoston Beer Co.'s popular Samuel Adams, American beer and the little known Morechamp, produced for a brewer in Nigeria. His goal? To increase Pittsburgh Brewing Co.'s line, geographic reach and, therefore, market share. And to have a lot of fun along the way. Here are excerpts from the conversation ER Executive Life Editor Lydia Strohl had with Piccirilli.<P>Executive Report: Where were you before buying the Pittsburgh Brewing Co. brought you all this notoriety?<P>Joe Piccirilli:  My family had a small trash company, and I remember working since I was 5 or 6 years old. Even through high school, I worked before and after school. I knew that's what I wanted to do after high school. I wanted to go into the business. So I did. <P>My typical work week was about 100 hours a week, seven days a week, and I grew the business eventually to the pointwhere we ended up selling the business [Piccirilli Disposal, a residential and commercial garbage disposal company in Moon Township] in 1993.<P>I'd had 20 years working by then, so I took a year off to see other opportunities. I built a house and then started doing some consulting in the solid waste industry. I would go all over the country aquiring landfills and hauling companies. After a year and a half, I got tired of being on a plane three or four days a week. So I told my attorney, find me something I can go to every day and talk to people. I enjoy people and I had that when I had my own company. <P>We started looking last year, and one of the first things we looked at was City Pride Bakery. And thank God I did my due diligence - I told everybody, you know, I'm not a Harvard graduate, but two and two's not four, and things aren't right. You couldn't tie the books together. So we stepped away from the deal, and at that time I had taken some flak from some people who really wanted me to go through with it, but it wasn't a good situation. And I guess later it was proved that I made a good decision.<P>In the meantime we looked at other opportunities, and did participate in some, but none on the magnitude of the brewery. <P>ER: The purchase process was an involved one. Tell us about it.<P>JP: We went through a process where there were probably 25 different bidders. It was a tough process. Here comes Joe Piccirilli from the garbage business, and what do you know about the beer business? And I says, 'Just about as much as Lou Gerstner knew about IBM and computers.' He really didn't, and when you look at a lot of companies, they're bringing outsiders in who ask what may seem to be immaterial questions, but they're common sense questions. Every business has employees. You understand employees and put yourself on their level and ask, and I do that. I go through the shop and I ask what would you change, what would you like to see. They're on the ground floor, they're in the trenchesevery day. And I've been pretty successful with that philosophy.<P>So I told them that, and they said OK. Then the next hurdle they put you through is the financial criteria. <P>ER: You had capital from the sale of your family business, plus outside investment. What was the total price of the deal?<P>JP: The total purchase price was $30.1 million. You had $17 million in liabilities, your payables and underfunded pension, and $13 million of that was cash. Of which a significant portion was equity dollars. I won't get to the specific numbers, but the majority of the money that came into this deal from my family was personal money. Because of the financial structure of the company, the company   really could not support a high level of debt. If           you overdebted the company you'd probably be             in bankruptcy in another      two years.<P>    ER: Do you think it was a good deal?<P>    JP: I think, looking back at it, that it was an above par deal. The potential is that, number one, wehave great products. Number two is to take this nationally. We know we can make the beers, the quality, and that follows through marketing and distribution. Right now we're the ninth largest brewer in the country. The potential is there.<P>  I started this process in March. The company was still running intact. The employee morale was fantastic, given everything they'd been through. However, the company did suffer because of the marketing, the dollars were pulled away. The equipment that needed to be purchased wasn't, so some of the maintenance got to the point where it needed immediate attention to get productivity levels to where they need to be. And believe it or not, that was it. Pittsburgh is a very loyal place to the producer of Iron City Beer.<P>ER: You mentioned before that for nine years, management had not really gone in and talked to employees?<P>JP: The ownership went from an Australian ownership, where the guy wasn't here, taken over by Heilman. So this plant, instead of being a producer of IC and IC Light, really became a production facility for all the brands under Heilman. And then Michael Carlow. <P>ER: There are a lot of questions about what really happened with Michael Carlow. What's your take?<P>JP:  I think of all the entities that Mike Carlow had - Clark Candy, City Pride, the glass company - by far Pittsburgh Brewing was the most financially sound. And what happened, unfortunately, was that the money pulled from the brewery supported all the other businesses. And eventually, that could only go so far. He pulled out all the cash from the business, cut back the marketing, cut back the maintenance, and some things deteriorated over time, which hurt the company.<P>Sales dropped a little, not much. Production probably increased, as far as contracts with other people, because as Iron City lost market share it was replaced with contract brews for Samuel Adams. <P>ER: And what are you brewing now?<P>JP: Right now, it's solely ourselves and Boston Beer. We probably right now do about 20 types of beer. We developed the J.J. Wainwright, too, for two reasons. Pittsburgh is a very loyal market to Iron City and IC Light. However, we're starting to go national with our products - well, you couldn't take an Iron City to Cleveland. So we set up a different line of J.J. Wainwright products, which fall under the category of Wainwright Brewing. And what we are hoping to achieve is if we take the products nationally, and if we don't penetrate the market with Iron City, we'll start marketing the Wainwright. So either one will go and the other will follow, or vice versa. As you develop the relationships, if someone takes a truckload of beer, what we like to do is say, ok, why don't you take a palette of IC Light. The more different types of beer you have, the better off you are. Right now the hot thing is the microbrewed beers, and probably the largest in the country is Samuel Adams. And we've been doing that for eight years. We know we can doit, we've won awards - so we've really pioneered, without knowing it. And now we want to set the stage and go forward ourselves.<P>ER: Products associated with Iron City and J.J. Wainwright are currently in what markets, and where do you hope to go?<P>JP: Right now they're primarily in Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania. Now we've made some contacts in Kentucky. Virginia, we're moving some beers, and the New England area, Maine, Massachusetts. I'm now aggressively pushing the eastern part of the country, and my strategic plan is by mid next year to go to the Midwest. The way to do that is through continuous market development and research, introducing new products - like next year we're going to come out with a Cranberry, a double Bock, a wheat, a summer ale.<P>ER: How much of this business is innovation? A lot of the names that you hear, the summer ale, wheat beer, Oktoberfest - it seems like everybody has aversion. What's the key to the beer business?<P>JP: I don't think it's so much innovation as marketing and distribution. I think sometimes you back into the innovation by what you want to market. The easiest thing to do is make the beer. You can make the greatest beer in the world, but if it's not marketed properly, it's a lose-lose situation.<P>The key is good advertisement. It's an investment, putting the dollars into the future. Being innovative in the market - like we did the 'Burgh Summer Tour, where the camera crews would show up, the response we got was phenomenal. When we had write in your own commercials, people just loved that because they could star in their own commercial. What I want to do is get the company back to the basics, start going back to some of that marketing and advertising and putting the dollars in it. <P>Relationships with the distributors are very important. They push your product and you have to be able to distinguish why theyshould push yours vs. Samuel Adams, or someone else. And it's the support you give them - point of sale advertising, t-shirts, hats, giveaways. What I'm trying to do is rekindle the relationships with the wholesalers, include them in some of the brewery's decisions  <P>ER: What about foreign markets?<P>JP: Believe it or not, we're working with two foreign companies right now, and we've ironed out some basic venture ideas. We haven't formalized them, because you know how attorneys are, but there are agreements to do bilateral marketing where we'd take x percent of their foreign production and do it domestically and they would take some of our domestic production and do it abroad. <P>We're going to probably look at strategic acquistions within the United States that would make sense for Pittsburgh Brewing. A lot of microbrewers have formulas but they don't have breweries, so they're always at the mercy of a brewery to make their products. [We'd buy] formulas, trademarks, names, and we have the brewing capacity here.<P>Now we do about 950,000 barrels a year. We could probably go to 1.3 million. But you can't buy market share. You have to go in, take the time to form the relationships with the distributors and go from there.<P>ER: How much of the management here continued? Do you think you can do it with the people that were here in the past?<P>JP: All of management continued. But that's a question that goes through my mind. I think a fair comment to make is that really, with Mike Carlow, their hands were tied. No one knew what was going on, and there really wasn't much they could do. Their money was taken away from them, they were riding on pins and needles, vendors calling for money. In three months? It may be a different story. I'm not going to lie to you.<P>They need to know, and I think they do, that I care. I walk through every day. I'm not a person that's sitting around or calling on the cellphone from Hawaii.<P>ER: How do you look at the markets in this industry?<P>JP: I guess you look at marketing as far as trends. If you follow any trend of any product it usually starts on the coast - California, Texas, and works its way to New York or vice versa. Then it starts to penetrate the Midwest. It's pretty similar in a lot of products. Once it gets to the Midwest, it's already out of fashion in New York or California.<P>So we look at the markets and say, where are they now? What percentage could we get and what do we need to do to achieve it? If you look at Rolling Rock, it's made in Latrobe. It was trendy - they're paying $4 for it in the New England area. You couldn't give it away here. It's the mentality.<P>Samuel Adams has been very successful everywhere - that's marketing. The good thing is that the J.J. Wainwright Evil Eye we just came out with already has 70 percent of the market share of Samuel Adams in less than a year. So that means the product's good, to catch on that quicklywithout the promotion and the dollars behind the advertising. Now if we can put the dollars behind that quality and taste, I think we're going to take the product that much further.<P>ER: How's the physical plant here? Do you need a lot of dollars in capitalization?<P>JP: Yeah. And a good portion of that is to automate going forward. Some of that is to make up for the neglect that's happened. We committed a lot of money for the next three years.<P>It's over a million dollars a year. So now you're talking about owners coming in, we're not taking a dime of profit out of here, every dollar's going back. I took a drastic pay cut to come here, but I hope it pays off in the long run.<P>

<B><I><font size=+2>The Tiny Central American Country of Costa Rica is and Ecotourist's Dream</font></I><P></b>
<i>By Katherine Brentgel</i>

<HR>
Don't look too hard for the elusive golden toad in Costa Rica's Monteverde Cloud Forest. Even though Monteverde is the only place in the world to see this brilliantly colored amphibian, sightings are rare. Visitors, however, rarely go away disappointed because this misty reserve offers much more: 400 bird species, 100 types of mammals, 490 kinds of butterflies and 2,500 plant species. <P>In Costa Rica, the Nortoameri-canos can see the jaguar and the ocelot slink through the lush, green rain forest. Tourists can spot brilliant red and emerald quetzals, the sacred bird of the Maya and symbol of freedom. They can hear the booming call of the three-wattled bell bird. Or they can watch sea turtles nest on an undeveloped beach.<P>It's all in Costa Rica, a tiny democratic nation bordered by Nicaragua, Panama, and both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. <P>Twelve percent of Costa Rica's land is protected in national parks, with another 15 percent in private nature reserves like Monteverde. The park system has long been the well-kept secret of biology students and researchers from around the world - but more and more nonscientific visitors are coming to absorb the natural beauty.<P>"I am happy that ecotourism is flourishing because it brings some substantial return to a country like Costa Rica," says Ray Heithaus, a biology professor at Kenyon College who has researched in Costa Rica and taught students there. <P>Ecotourism is blossoming because of Costa Rica's incredible biological diversity, its extensive amount of protected lands and stable political conditions. In size, Costa Rica is slightly smaller than West Virginia, yet has an amazing variety of protected habitats: lowland forests, high mountain paramos, seaside mangroves, swamps and deciduous dry forests. In fact, the largest area of dry tropical forest left in the New World is in Costa Rica's parks.<P>Originally, 99.8 percent of Costa Rica was forested.  But trees began disappearing at an alarming rate until 1969, when natural resources experts lobbied for the creation of a park system to protect at least some of the remaining forest. The government created the National Parks Service in 1970, to the chagrin of farmers, ranchers and loggers, who believed that they would profit most by clearing the rain forests. The government's task was to prove that conservation and development could go hand-in-hand, using non-destructive activities likeecotourism. Since the government lacked the funds to develop tourist facilities or train park guides, it turned to the private sector. The land had been set aside; it was up to the nature tour companies and developers to provide the tourist services. Conservationists liked the  idea because they thought the private sector would do its best to protect        its investment. <P>It has. And ecotourism is big money for this small country. Ecotour companies have mushroomed all over the country, offering guided tours through national parks and more specialized tours that include bicycling, horseback riding, rafting and kayaking. Most towns have a network of native tour guides willing to show visitors Costa Rica's national heritage. <P>One frontrunner is Costa Rica Expeditions, founded by American Michael Kaye. For about $65 a day, the company offers one-day trips led by a professional naturalist to many of the parks and reserves. Like most of the ecotour companies, Costa Rica Expeditions is headquartered in San Jose, the centrally located capital city.<P>These companies offer many one-day trips as well as more extended packages. A guided tour is probably a good idea for first-time visitors; a knowledgeable guide can help you spot and identify birds and animals. <P>Your most difficult task will be to select which parks to visit. Some parks are accessible as a day trip from San Jose. Others are more remote, but accommodations are available in nearby towns. Some examples of the parks:<P>l	Braulio Carrillo National Park, 20 miles east of San Jose, is a feast of lush green forest, waterfalls and canyons. The main highway from San Jose to the Atlantic coast cuts through this park, so it is possible to drive through this incredible landscape. Three monkey species have been spotted in Braulio Carrillo, as well as tapirs, jaguars, ocelots and kinkajous. It is the closest place to San Jose where the resplendent quetzals can be seen. Many people travel to Braulio Carrillo just to climb Barva Volcano, one of two volcanoes in the park. Jungle Trails and Costa Rica Expeditions offer one-day trips to the volcano.  <P>l	Santa Rosa National Park offers great exposure to a dry tropical forest, one of the most endangered ecosystems in the world. It is in the northwest corner of the country on the Pacific coast, over a four hour drive from San Jose. The undeveloped beaches inside the park are beautiful. During the wet season, leatherback, green and Pacific Ridley turtles nest along Playa Naranjo, a beach that is eight miles from park headquarters. <P>In addition to sea turtles, Santa Rosa is home to spider, capuchin and howler monkeys, armadillos, coatis and over 50 species of bats. Thousands of moth and butterfly species have been identified in the park along with 253 bird species, such as orange-fronted parakeets, trogons and caracaras.<P>Liberia, a 45 minute drive to the northwest, has the closest accommodations to Santa Rosa. The town offers several modern hotels with swimming pools and is a good base for exploring the parks and beaches of the region.<P>On the way back to San Jose, another site worth seeing is Arenal Volcano, active since 1968. The volcano belches huge clouds of smoke, ash and thin streams of lava. Its thundering explosions can be heard for miles. Built in 1987, the Arenal Volcano Observatory is a privately owned nature reserve and a long-term research base for scientists. Through Costa Rica Sun Tours, non-scientific visitors can do a day trip to the observatory for about $65, which includes a guide, transportation to the site and a chance to swim in the thermal waters around the base of the volcano. To see Arenal erupt at night, there is also an overnight package available.   <P>Costa Rica is an easy destination to reach. Travelers would most likely fly to Miami on a domestic flight and then to San Jose on Lacsa, the Costa Rican airline. It's a year-round destination, although the dry season (December to April) is most popular, and hotel reservations can be hard to get during this time. Exploring the national parks requires good hiking shoes, rain gear and insect repellent.<P>A little bit of luck won't hurt, either. You might spot the golden toad. <P><P>Destination: Costa Rica<BR>Location: Central America, between Nicaragua and Panama<BR>Size: Slightly smaller than West Virginia<BR>Climate: Tropical; dry season (December to April); rainy season (May to November)<BR>Terrain: Coastal plains separated by rugged mountains<BR>Natural hazards: Subject to occasional earthquakes; hurricanes along Atlantic coast; frequent flooding of lowlands at onset of rainy season; active volcanoes<BR>Bet you didn't know: Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of Costa Rican exports. Most notable are Costa Rican coffee, bananas and sugar, all of which are shipped to   the United States. Other food     crops include corn, rice, beans      and potatoes.<P>

<P><B><font size=+2>Fit In, Don't Blend In</font><br></B>
<font size=+1> Executive Dress These Days Means<br>More Than the Conservative Blue Suit</font><br>
<i>By Lydia Strohl</I>
</CENTER>


<hr>
Debbie Moses, a PNC trust investment counselor, has a work outfit she loves - a wine-colored gabardine suit, with soft lines and a short skirt. Beth Wainwright, executive director of Leadership Pittsburgh, does too - a black suit, with a tuxedo jacket and a short skirt. And Monica Lake's favorite piece? The wife of Steeler safety Carnell Lake has an Ellen Tracy jacket she's had since 11th grade, navy blue and cropped, with military gold buttons.<P>Though the career regimens of these women vary greatly, their fashion does not. They like tradition, with a twist. And that's okay. Because after years of blue suits, dressing for success is loosening up, for both men and women.<P>While other areas of the country - especially hotbeds of small business - move to truly casual executive dress, retailers and shoppers alike say "classic with a flair" is the modus operandi in Pittsburgh fashion.<P>In searching for a look, Pitts-burghers don't fall too far from the tree. Quality, value and longevity       top the list of desirable features for         a wardrobe item. They want classic style that's just a little bit different in some aspect, whether it's the fabric, the cut or the color. They want to fit in, but not blend in.<P>"Dressing is one of the top marketing tools an individual can use," says Philip Elias, president of Elias/Savion Advertising. "It presents an unspoken persona, and sets the stage for who   you are. It should be solidified by your corporate goals and philosophies. People drive BMWs for the same reason. But you can't bring your BMW into a meeting." <P>"It's very important," adds Wainwright. "How you look is the first thing people notice about you. It's the overture, even if you don't know it, and if you do it right, the next step is easier."<P>"People respond to how you look, whether it's acknowledged or not," agrees Moses, whose shopping strategy includes regular passes through Saks, but also through bargain outlets such as Value City and Loehmanns (now closed). "Plus, if I feel good about how I look, it will probably give me confidence."<P>Gone are the times when every man getting off the elevator has to have on a yellow striped tie. Gone, executives say, are the times when women had to wear dumpy, masculinely tailored suits with little ties, though the odd tale still surfaces of the woman who didn't make partner because she didn't dress the part.<P>"I think, in business, women draw the boundaries tighter than they need to. You can push those boundaries if you do it with taste. It can even enhance your success in a client relationship, because they think you're independent-minded," says Moses. "But if I came in in a leather suit, it wouldn't fly."<P>Just what is appropriate? There's a line drawn - but it's all in the mind. Those that cross it, most likely, have different lines. Ideas about fashion are all over the map. Most people, given the choice, wouldn't dress in runway fashion - too drafty, not practical. And others aren't sure that's fashion at all.<P>"People in Pittsburgh associate the word fashion with trend," says Katherine Barchetti, for 27 years one of the area's most forward and successful retailers. "My frustration is that people think Pittsburgh is not fashionable because it's a conservative city. I don't sell a man a suit that will go out of style before eight years."<P>Barchetti, whose pet peeve is customers who remark that they're buying something "to wear when they go somewhere else," bases her men's clothing business on haberdashery that is classic, with a flair. But she also stalks success by giving her customers service and convenience in buying everything from socks to suits to ties. Her massive database includes the sizes and tastes of all her customers.<P>"I just call them, or they'll call me and tell me what's new," says Don Jones, creative director of Jones Day Advertising. "If you're running low on anything, they'll send it down to you."<P>Jones says that he also shops when he's out of town - mostly because he has more free time. But many women say they shop out of town because, though Pittsburgh's fine for the staples, they have trouble finding that one piece to differentiate them from the crowd here.<P>"It's hard finding good shops," says Lake, whose height of 5 feet 9 inches complicates her search. "I'm from California, and it's so easy to find things there. Here, it's hard." <P>Julie Stark, executive director of the March of Dimes, has the same problem to the other extreme. She's just 5 feet tall. <P>"It's hard to find a smart, sassy look on the rack. If you wear something too big it looks like you borrowed someone's clothes," says Stark, whose favorite piece is an eggplant colored dress with a swing cut. "I think Pittsburgh is a small midwestern town in flair and style, but it is a fashionable place. I go to a lot of black tie events, and you see the whole gamut of fashion there. There are a lot of places to shop."<P>For the most part, Pittsburgh executives seem to think that depending on your taste and how dedicated of a shopper you are, there is a place in Pittsburgh to suit you.<P>"I'm not big on any specific store, I shop mostly at Kaufmann's and Saks. Being downtown I find it easier to pop into different places," says Jody Doherty, former manager of public relations for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, now aide to Allegheny County Commissioner Larry Dunn. "I'm not hard to please. Pittsburgh has a lot of options."<P>And those options are broadening, at least for women. Many female executives mentioned shopping at Ann Taylor, which continues to expand in the region. And smaller specialty shops continue to crop up, like the new Cajoli, in Aspinwall, and Katherine Barchetti's women's shop in Oxford Centre, which opened in October.<P>"I reordered one line three times in one week," says Barchetti, who had a women's clothing shop in addition to her men's shop years ago, but says she closed it because she didn't have enough time. "It's hard to find enough people to work for me. But the wives of my customers kept asking me 'When are you going to have something for us?' "  <P>Barchetti's women's shop will sell sportswear, suits and accessories. Though not in as wide an array as her men's shop, it will also be based on service. That's a concept more and more women are beginning to value.<P>For years, men have been able to call their tailor for a custom fitting. Now, women can do that too, with a couple of new lines that retail through traveling sales people who travel to your home or office.<P>"I sell to the female executive who is too busy or doesn't want to go shopping," says Theresa Sullivan, a salesperson for Doncaster, a Rutherfordton, N.C., company that sells through home-based consultants. The Doncaster line contains executive and casual components, that can be ordered in a variety of fabrics and colors. Sullivan often is asked into the client's closet, to critique her clothing situation.<P>"I go through her closet and say, 'Get rid of this, this is nice, pitch this,' " says Sullivan. "And they do it. I think they just want someone to be honest with them. How they look is important."<P>Beyond the Clothes: Many Improve Their<P>Physical Appearance via Plastic Surgery<P><P>A little tuck here, a nip there - the potential of plastic surgery has been apparent for years, given the patient has ample cash and level of vanity. Previously, however, the extent of contact that most conservative western Pennsylvanians have had with it has been in the grocery store line, where it's easy to chart the cosmetic alterations of the likes of Cher and Michael Jackson. <P>But that's changing, according to Dr. Theodore Lazzaro of Aesthetique, an aesthetic plastic surgery center in Greensburg. Baby boomers, the generation addicted to health and fitness and image, are reaching the age where there's beginning to be a little something to nip and tuck up. And never ones to be frugal with resources when it comes to something that enhances their lives, they're checking in in style - Aesthetique, a late 1890s coal baron's mansion, on 35 acres outside of Greensburg, has been renovated into an accredited ambulatory surgical facility.<P>"Western Pennsylvania is the most rapidly growing area for cosmetic surgery in the country, because it is the cheapest, and because people are finding out that you don't have to go into the hospital," says Lazzaro. <P>Cosmetic plastic surgery is generally not covered by insurance, except   for breast reductions involving more than three-quarters of a pound from each one.<P>"The majority of people that get aesthetic plastic surgery come from households with less than $30,000 income," Lazzaro says.<P>In 1988, Lazzaro saw 50 to 75 cosmetic surgery patients - last year he estimated 750 or 1,000 cases. One demographic that's increasing is men, who are getting cosmetic procedures in increasing numbers. Lazzaro says that his practice, which was 85 percent women five years ago, is now just 60 to 65 percent women. The procedure he performs most on men is eyelid surgery, then liposculpture for the 'handlebars' of fat that accumulate on male backs. Women most commonly have breast procedures, either augmenting or reducing, and liposculpture for the hips and thighs.<P>Another factor contributing to the increase in his patient load is an influx of cases from outside the area, which accounts for 10 to 15 percent of his cosmetic surgeries. Here, depending on the complexity of the operation, a face-lift costs $4,000 to $6,000. In New York, it's $20,000, says Lazzaro. Aesthetique has a deal with nearby Nemacolin Woodlands, where patients can stay for four nights and be pampered until their follow-up visit for $1,000. Even with airfare, they've made a deal.<P>"As the baby boom population becomes middle aged, these same people who have put an emphasis on fitness are now reaching the age where they don't look as good as they feel," says Lazzaro. Indicative of this is the fact that people are getting these techniques done younger: Ten to 15 years ago, his average face-lift patient was age 55 or 60. Now, patients are in their early 40s, and he's had to modify some of his procedures. <P>Lazzaro tells the story of one patient, a CEO, who went back to work after getting a facelift and his eyelids done. At the board table the next day, he could see everyone looking at him out of the corner of their eyes, so he leveled    with them.<P>"I can see you're looking at how good I look. In case you're wondering, I had a face-lift," said the CEO. "I wouldn't think of coming in with a wrinkled shirt, so why would I come in with a wrinkled face?"<P>

<font size=+1>A Spate of Public Offerings is a <BR>
Good Sign for the Regional Economy
</font><BR>
<i>By Doug Thomas
</i></b>

<HR>
Just when you were beginning to worry about the shrinking universe of public companies in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, here comes a spate of initial public offerings and numerous other signs that the local climate for public companies is becoming more inviting<P>A slew of new offerings have catapulted formerly private companies such as The Carbide/Graphite Group, the Carnegie Group and Italian Oven into public entities. More, like Tollgrade Communications, are on the way. Other companies like the already public Universal Stainless and II-VI Inc. are tapping the public markets again through so-called secondary offerings to raise additional capital to expand, either through capital expenditures or acquisition.<P>Pittsburgh is even participating in a big way in the success of some other nonlocal public companies. For instance, the Boston Beer Co., the brewer of Samuel Adams and one of the recent IPO highflyers, had received approximately 46 percent of its beer through November from Pittsburgh Brewing Co.<P>So fear not. Whether through venture capital, private investment or sweat equity, the marketplace for public companies here is diverse and dynamic. Despite losing its share of corporate headquarters, Pittsburgh's climate for fostering new ideas and new companies is showing promise. Our economic future depends just as much on the growth of small and mid-sized companies - e.g. Cable Design Technologies, FORE Systems and Respironics - as it does on the industrial stalwarts and stellar performers like Alcoa, PPG Industries and Mellon Bank.<P><P><B>Around the Index</B><P>The ER Index continues on a growth path, increasing 3.45 percent, as compared with the S&P 500's gain of 1.41 percent, for the four weeks ended Nov. 10, 1995. Since its inception on Aug. 15, 1994, the index has posted a gain of 31.91 percent as compared with 28.51 percent for the S&P 500. The impressive numbers show that individual investors can do quite nicely by investing in local companies.<P>The month's winners and losers:<P>Pittsburgh-based vitamin and supplement retailer General Nutrition Companies reported better than expected earnings for its third quarter ended Sept. 30. Net income increased to $15.9 million, or 18 cents per share, up from $10.1 million, or 13 cents per share, in the prior period. Revenues for the quarter increased 24 percent to $193 million from $156.4 million. For the month, GNC shares finished up 10.8 percent to 23.<P><LI>	PPG Industries had a record third quarter. Earnings for the period were 85 cents per share on revenues of $1.72 billion, compared with 68 cents per share on $1.58 billion in sales last year. <LI>	Allegheny Ludlum announced stronger than anticipated earnings for its third quarter ended Sept. 30. Profits nearly tripled from one year ago, with net income rising to $30.1 million, or 44 cents a share, from $10.3 million or 14 cents. Revenues increased 42 percent to $373.6 million from $262.3 million on a 14 percent increase in steel shipments. Despite the good news, shares of Allegheny Ludlum finished off 15.63 percent in the month                to 16 7/8.<LI>	Armco announced that equipment failures at its steel mills in Mansfield, Ohio, had a negative impact on third quarter earnings. The company reported a loss from continuing operations of $2.1 million. <LI>	Kennametal announced a 28 percent increase in earnings as net income rose to $13.6 million, or 51 cents a share, compared to $10.7 million, or 40 cents a share, last year. Revenues rose 17 percent to $254 million on higher sales of metal-cutting products in North America and Europe and strong catalog sales. Although the results were positive, earnings came in below analysts' expectations, helping Kennametal shares to drop 12.54 percent to 30 1/2.<LI>	The turkey of the month was American Eagle Outfitters, which announced the resignations of Chief Operating Officer Bob Lynn and Chief Financial Officer Adam Monks Dec. 1, only six weeks after the company disclosed a dynamic turnaround plan to New York analysts.<P>The untimely departures of Lynn and Monks raise questions about whether remaining AEO management can turn around  the company.            n<P>Doug Thomas is vice president, director of research for Lancaster, Pa.-based Emerald Asset Management.<P>

<font size = +1>Koto-Buki Offers a Little Bit of Tokyo<BR>in the Heart of Suburbia
</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl
</I></B>
<p>

<hr>


I remember on several occasions in Tokyo, following some friend or another to a restaurant we just had to try. Inevitably, we'd turn off one of Tokyo's crowded main thoroughfares down a twisting narrow alley, where the traditional one-story wooden shops still stood. My host would go straight for the restaurant, identifying it somehow from a row of identical facades, stooping into what was generally a small one-room eatery.<P>Koto-Buki, a new restaurant serving authentic Japanese cuisine, is deep in the American equivalent of that confusing sameness - plunk in the middle of the residential North Hills. <P>Koto-Buki is in a nondescript building on the edge of some North Park townhouses. Don't let that fool you. Inside, the atmosphere is calming - all light wood, tables and chairs in a streamlined design, splashes of color blocked into the room on strategically hung geometric panels. Tables are simply set: There is a white paper napkin with a set of wooden chopsticks at each place, a ceramic pitcher of soy sauce the only other accoutrement.<P>Until the food comes.<P>Then you realize that everything in the restaurant is a subtly balanced backdrop for the meal. First, a simple salad of iceberg lettuce, with maybe a slice of cucumber or radish, and garnished with a thick ginger dressing, not spicy but gentle and refreshing, in a simple black bowl. <P>Then the appetizers. We chose the assorted sushi platter - the pieces of tuna, fluke, yellowtail and salmon so fresh and so tender it practically melted in our mouths. On the beautiful wooden tray were piles of wasabi and gari. Wasabi is a green horseradish paste that is mixed with deep, dark soy sauce, like nothing available at the grocery, for dipping sushi. A refreshing piece of gari, slivered pickled ginger, follows each bite. We also tried shumai, steamed shrimp dumplings dipped into a light sesame sauce. No alcohol is served, but you can bring it if you like.<P>After the appetizers, we were brought soup with white squares of tofu suspended in it. As it is hard to eat soup with chopsticks, the Japanese drink it straight from the bowl. So did we - it was warm and velvety. <P>Next came the dinner. The shrimp tempura and salmon teriyaki combination comes on a laquered tray. The tempura, batter-dipped and fried vegetables and shrimp, was light - jumbo shrimp, fingers of sweet potato, carrots, zucchini and onion. The salmon teriyaki was grilled crispy and glazed in a smooth peanut and soy sauce. A mold of steamed rice and stir-fried vegetables occupied other compartments. The sukiyaki - boiling broth in which was cooking assorted vegetables, tofu and thinly sliced beef - was served in an iron cauldron. The broth was sweet and distinctive, though our server could not identify the special ingredient.<P>The service here, like everything else, is understated and typically Japanese. In fact, this place is so authentic we've heard of one local doctor who used to travel to Washington, D.C., when craving a good Japanese meal who is now perfectly content to travel out McKnight Road. After our meal, they brought the check - we had to beckon them back for coffee and tea.<P>It was worth persisting. The hot ginger tea is a pungent brew of lemon, lime and ginger juices. The dessert menu is light - try the ginger ice cream (they also have red bean or green tea flavor). Because we'd asked for a fork (utensils available on request), they brought us spoons, so I'm not sure how we'd have been expected to eat it. But regardless of how it got to the taste buds, like everything else we tried, it was simple, elegant and delicious.        n<P><P>

<b><font size =+1>Medicare HMOs are Battling for the <br>Region's Elderly Population</b></font><br>
<i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
</center><P>


<HR>
George Wescott says he wouldn't mind. Jean Feskorn and Olga Kessler say they're confused about it. Lou Boliver and Rudy Benedetti already have enrolled. In an HMO, that is.<P>These days, Medicare-eligible seniors are faced with the same difficult healthcare choices as younger people. HMOs are offering them complete care at one premium - often lower than the supplemental  policies many now hold to cover what Medicare does not.<P>HMOs, eager to grow their ranks to achieve cost-effective economies of scale, see seniors as a big market. About 400,000 seniors live in Greater Pittsburgh, half of whom are covered by former employers that pay all or much of their retirees' supplemental premiums. Employers think HMOs can directly reduce the dollars they spend on retiree healthcare. So they're teaming up to attract seniors - in the process, barraging them with direct mail and meetings in every church, community and senior citizen center available. Seniors are confused.<P>"I'm not sure I did the right thing," says Boliver, a 78-year-old retired manager of employee benefits for People's Natural Gas, who enrolled in U.S. Healthcare when People's parent company CNG offered Medicare HMOs to the 7,000 retirees and their dependents it covers. "I think eventually everyone will be forced into HMOs," Boliver says. "It saves the company money."<P>In traditional supplemental programs, either the retiree or the em- ployer pays a monthly premium. Depending on the program, the retiree pays a deductible and a co-pay on visits; the employer pays what Medicare does not cover on a pay-as-you-go basis. For CNG, that cost had been running about $18 million annually, on top of $50 million in premiums. For retirees who chose an HMO, CNG will pay one monthly premium.  In this case, it was $25 if the enrollee choose Sec-urity Blue, Blue Cross' product, or $8 for U.S. Healthcare's product.<P>Retirees meet some co-pays on visits and prescriptions. CNG offered retirees a $25 monthly subsidy to try  the program. <P>"We're able to do that because of the size of the savings," says Andy Haas, CNG assistant vice president for employee benefits and administrative services. "Their [Blue Cross Medi-Gap] premium is going up to $31 per month, per person next year."<P>How do HMOs save? In addition to monthly premiums, the HMO collects anywhere from $250 to $700 per person from the federal government. By applying economies of scale and managed care methods, they cut costs. <P>"The system creates opportunities for HMOs," says Carl Smollinger, senior vice president of the senior managed care program at Blue Cross. "The highest cost of the system is in-patient care, at $1,000 a day, yet there really are a lot of options that cost less. There are regulations built into Medicare, lots of waste we can cut out with managed care, because we're not bound by the same rules."<P>Though many seniors are concerned with the high cost of healthcare, their top concern is limits on their choice of doctors. The Bolivers' primary care doctor is not part of the U.S. Healthcare network, but the rest of his and his wife's doctors (eye, gynecologist and dermatologist) are. The Bolivers are big believers in preventive care, which the HMO also stresses.<P>"There are advantages to HMO plans for the well elderly, especially in preventive coverage," says Dr. Judith Black, medical director of Gerontology at St. Margaret Memorial Hospital. "But if you have physical limitations, you should look very carefully at the accessibility of the HMO."<P>While the HMOs sing of decreasing expenses to seniors, Black says that not everyone can realize savings. She suggests potential enrollees carefully detail the costs they would incur under each plan, as well as look at the convenience of the providers in the network. She also urges seniors who travel a lot to check their out-of-town coverage. "I'm most concerned about the education process," says Black.<P>CNG has spent about $500,000 marketing the plan to retirees. And through the National Medicare HMO Initiative, developed by benefits consultant Towers Perrin, it is able to offer enrollees coverage when they are traveling through participating HMOs. With 12 percent of its covered retirees enrolled in HMOs to date, the company is anticipating about $3.5 million in savings the first year. The jury's still out on whether retirees will be managed care friendly or not.<P>"It's worth trying," says Boliver. "But if there's a problem, U.S. Healthcare will hear about it. I'm not going to just sit down and let anyone tell me what we need."                        n<P><P><P>

For Women Only</font></B><br>
<B><I><font size=+1>Four Schools in the Region are Proving That <br>Survival Does Not Mean Going Co-Ed
</font></I></B><br>
<i>By Gretchen McKay</i></center>

<HR>
Like most of her classmates, Tamara Watkins was considering only co-ed colleges as she neared high school graduation in 1991. Then she happened upon a brochure touting the merits of all-women's institutions.<P>"It had some very impressive statistics, especially with regards to females in politics," recalls Watkins, who had almost settled on the University of Michigan. "It really piqued my interest."<P>Small wonder. Watkins found out that a quarter of the women in Congress and a third of the women on Fortune 1000 boards are graduates of women's colleges. It proved a powerful draw to Watkins, who subsequently enrolled at Chatham College in Shadyside, one of the region's four women's colleges.<P>Her decision paid off: The management/political science major drew several job offers before she graduated this past May, and is now a sales representative in the lucrative pharmaceutical industry.<P>"I just blossomed at Chatham," says Watkins. "There were more opportunities to take on leadership roles, and I gained a sense of empowerment. Plus I got a superior education."<P>Attracting students wasn't always easy for women's colleges. They  took a real hit in the late '70s and '80s, plunging from 163 colleges nationwide in 1971 to just 84 in 1991. The four here watched enrollment dip as professionally minded women opted for the region's co-ed universities and colleges.<P>"Everyone associated women's colleges with white gloves, which meant one of two things: That women who go there are wealthy, or they don't expect to work," says Esther Barazzoni, president of Chatham.<P>Women's institutions were also failing to reflect women's increased interest in pursuing careers.<P>"The '80s was the decade where Wall Street and making money was big," says Peter Egan, director of admissions at Seton Hill College, a small Catholic women's liberal arts college in Greensburg. In comparison to their co-ed counterparts, he says,  women's colleges were seen as just finishing schools.<P>But that was then, this is now. According to the Washington, D.C.-based Women's College Coalition, applications to the country's 84 women's colleges have risen by 14 percent since 1991, and enrollments have grown to 105,000 students, nearly 20 percent more than in 1985.<P>That translates to a record number of enrollments at the region's four women's schools - Chatham and Carlow in Pittsburgh, Seton Hill in Greensburg and Wilson College near Harrisburg - which have reengineered to meet the challenge. Their strategy includes offering courses that focus on business, math and science, beefing up mentor programs and internships, and engaging in more vigorous marketing. And all in an atmosphere that fosters self-esteem and encourages women to reach their potential.<P>"At a women's college, there's no glass ceiling," says Seton Hill's Egan. "There's an 'I can do anything' kind of attitude through the whole school."<P>What does a women's college offer that its co-ed counterpart does not? The list is long: freedom from stereotyping, a more sup portive atmosphere, gender equality in sports. The schools also offer smaller class sizes, higher  student/faculty ratios and a profusion of female role models, accustoming female students to the idea of power.<P>"We have an overt commitment to women taking leadership positions by expecting them to do it," says Barazzoni. "And what you expect someone to do has a powerful influence on what they actually do."<P>Still, the business of attracting new students hasn't been easy. Chatham considered going co-ed in 1990 as a way to stay afloat financially. Administrators decided against it, however, when everyone from alumnae to trustees protested. They did decide to enroll men in their five graduate programs, but that was the extent of it. <P>Seton Hill also matriculates males, but only in its School of Visual Arts. Carlow, a Catholic liberal arts college in Oakland, still markets itself as primarily a women's college.<P>As for Chatham, administrators there say they took the "quality route" and beefed up curriculum, which included adding some very highly competitive professional programs at the graduate level. <P>Other women's colleges have taken similar strides to lure students from co-ed schools. There's a renewed emphasis on recruiting, often at an earlier age. Take Seton Hill. The college is going after a younger audience, bringing junior high students onto campus to participate in chemistry lab activities, and taking current students into local grade schools to serve as mentors. <P>"We're encouraging girls to pursue careers in math, science and business, and to think about doing it in the best place, which may be a women's college," says Seton Hill president JoAnn Boyle.<P>The end result? Business is booming.  Enrollment at both Seton Hill and Carlow College has doubled in the past decade. Chatham, which has enjoyed a 25 percent increase in the past three years, went up 28 percent last year, or three times the national average.<P>"We're like Olympic training villages, training women to compete in the world," says Barazzoni. 		      n<P><P>

<B><font size=+2>Computer Quandary</font><br><font size=+1>Consultants can Help When<br>Choosing Computer System<br>
</font></B><i>By Henry Lipput</center></i><P>


<HR>
Richard Miller had plenty of reasons to go hunting for a computer system for his insurance agency. He knew it would make his small business more efficient, but he also knew it would keep him and his colleagues on a level playing field with competitors.<P>"Number one, our competitors were computerized," says Miller, a principal with Miller Wrenshall and Associates Inc. "Number two, in today's marketplace, you have to be able to do more with less when it comes to what your staffing budget would be. If you don't have computers, you're going to perform a lot of the manual tasks that are going to cost you a lot more than if you have a computer."<P>But procuring a computer today is no easy task. With rapidly evolving technology, what is cutting edge today can be obsolete in a few months. What complicates matters is the fact that many small businesses - such as Miller's insurance agency - have limited capital budgets. So some small businesses that want the most bang for their buck are turning to consultants, who can recommend software and advise business owners on how much memory their hard disk should have. And that's only a start. There are       also printers, fax modems, translation programs and other bells and whistles to consider.<P>Some make a business more efficient. Others are of no use, so why pay for them?<P>"Up until six or eight years ago, a computer - to a small business - was a very scary thing," says computer consultant Gerald Rosenthal of Teitelman & Rosenthal. "The cost was high, the learning curve was immensely high and long, and there was always a potential for great disaster. Technology has come a long way. The cost has drastically dropped, and the learning curve has greatly shortened. And there are many, many more products on the market."<P>For most small businesses, a computer can ease the accounting procedure immediately. Computerizing the accounting process - or upgrading it if it already is computerized - can help the business better track accounts receivable, in the end improving cash flow. Another emerging plus is the money computers can save a business in paper costs, which have skyrocketed over the past year.<P>"If a small business wants a computer, first we look over their general bookkeeping and accounting situation to see what level of sophistication they want to be at, and then we simply     recommend some hardware with certain specifications," Rosenthal says. "We know the accounting software on the market and we recommend the software that we think fits them."<P>What some businesses don't realize is that by better tracking accounts receivable, a computer can pay for itself within a year. The problem is that some businesses explore computerization or upgrade an ancient system only as a last resort, when they already are choked by a cash flow crisis.<P>"Most small businesses engage me because their profitability, the strength of the business, is in jeopardy, and there are a number of profitability and conflict issues involved," says another consultant, Marty Feinberg.<P>"If a firm can increase its efficiency by 10 percent, it can double net profit without increasing sales one dime," Feinberg says.  "When I do the diagnosis for the business, one of the things may be that they either need computers or they need to update what they have." <P>Some consultants represent certain lines of software or hardware and will take a commission if you buy the lines they promote. Other consultants work on a fee-only basis and, some say, offer a more objective point of view. For the owner of the business, it's a matter of preference.<P>"Usually, the guys who are good will make recommendations with a range of alternatives," says Feinberg, who works on a fee-only basis. "And they'll even help them shop. I don't like to do for a client what a client can do for himself, but in this case, sometimes guidance is worth paying the price."  <P>Once the purchase is made, the real learning starts. At this point, there also are a slew of consultants who will train employees on software.<P>"We recommend software, then we teach them how to use it, and everything is customized to their business," says consultant Jody Sprinkle, of Software Training Specialists. "It's customized in the way that we train them. We're using their work materials and the way they do business, so that they have a decreased learning curve."<P>Again, beware of consultants who also take commissions from software companies. Their advice may not be impartial, industry insiders say.<P>Small businesses must operate at maximum efficiency to increase profitability. Adding computerization or upgrading existing systems is one way to increase efficiency.                           n<P><P><P>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Can We Resuscitate This Region?<br>Now Is The Time to Turn Things Around

<hr>
Back in 1977, Michael Bussler founded Algor Inc. with a single computer that his clients paid to use on a time-share basis. Now, two decades later, Algor develops and sells specialized software to design engineers in more than 60 countries, with annual sales approaching $10 million.<P>The software has been used to design and test Nautilus exercise equipment, Black & Decker's "Dustbuster" and B.F. Goodrich tires, among other products. The software also was used to stress test Pittsburgh's Smithfield Street Bridge when it was recently rebuilt.<P>So it's quite evident that the Algor of today is a far cry from Bussler's startup as an engineering service bureau with one computer. Today, Bussler employs about 70 people at Algor headquarters in O'Hara Township, and the company's effect on the regional economy goes well beyond paying salaries to employees.<P>Like other successful entrepre-neurships in the region, Algor is a living lesson in trickle-down economics - western Pennsylvania style. The mere existence of Algor creates business for others in the region. Algor pays a law firm. Algor pays accountants. Algor pays to have its headquarters building cleaned. And Algor donated $1 million to Carnegie Mellon University to help fund a research project.<P>"There's no doubt, we are generating some jobs here," concedes Bussler, himself somewhat of a skeptic on the trickle-down influence of entrepre-neurships like his own.<P>"We certainly are not hurting the local economy, since 98 percent of our income is coming in from somewhere else, and hardly any of it is going elsewhere," Bussler says.<P>Other observers agree.<P>"That's a company that is expanding and creating new wealth," says Thomas N. Canfield, president of The Enterprise Corp., which helps entrepreneurs develop businesses with significant employment opportunities.<P>"[Algor] is selling its products and services outside of this region," Canfield says. "That is money we are importing from the rest of the country and world right here into this region. Because of this wealth, we probably have another little shoe store or pizza parlor.<P>"That's how regions create wealth," Canfield says.<P>Unfortunately, Bussler and other successful entrepreneurs are the minority in our region, where the rate of entrepreneurship is dreadful. What's it mean? The professional services firms - such as law and accounting firms - better expand their geographic reach, because they sure won't grow business here unless they take it away from another firm. The same holds true up and down the food chain that makes up our economy. Security guards have fewer offices to watch. Landscapers have less grass to cut. Lawyers have fewer companies to counsel.<P>"There's only two ways to expand your business," says Mark Miner, media manager for the law firm Buchanan Ingersoll. "You can take market share from someone else in the city or you expand geographically."<P>Because the number of start-ups is stagnant, there's only so much business to go around. For you and me, that's bad news. It puts this region at risk.<P>With this article, Executive Report begins a series of articles entitled Resuscitating the Region. The six-month series will focus on opportunities to spur regional growth. Foremost is this month's topic: entrepreneurship. Through the following five months, ER will also explore education, exporting, tax reform, tourism and transportation as areas of opportunity.<P><P><B>Entrepreneurship</B><P>Perhaps Gov. Tom Ridge sums it up best. The gover nor doesn't expect large corporations to come into Pennsylvania, build manufacturing sites and employ thousands of people. There are too many reasons - such as regulation and taxes - for corporations to locate elsewhere. <P>"I believe Pennsylvania's economy depends on our ability to keep the jobs we have, to help Pennsylvania's companies expand in Pennsylvania and to help convince potential entrepreneurs to take calculated risks, to step forward, to pursue that dream," the governor says. "There is no doubt in my mind that our ability to nurture these people is critical to the state's future."<P>And it appears Ridge is walking the walk instead of just talking the talk. He took a first step toward spurring entrepreneurship early in his administration with a budget measure increasing the amount of net operating losses entrepreneurs can carry forward from previous years, up to $1 million from $500,000. Ridge says he thinks the change will convince some potential entrepreneurs to take the leap and stick out the lean times, knowing they can recoup part of any losses at a later time.<P>Ridge also knocked 1 percent off the corporate net income tax during his first year in office.<P><P><B>Good Reason to Act</B><P>Ridge knew that state statistics on entrepreneurship were horrifying. For instance, the Center for Enterprise Development ranked Pennsylvania dead last nationally in 1994 for "entrepreneurial energy." The rank is the result of  combining three factors: Pennsylvania ranked 45th in the rate of new company formation, 49th for rate of change in the formation rate and 33rd for the rate of job growth in new companies less than four years old. The center did not rank states in 1995, but Canfield, the Enterprise Corp. president, crunched the numbers himself and slotted Pennsylvania last again.<P>It gets worse: Western Pennsyl-vania trails the statewide average in new company formations. A University of Pittsburgh study showed the new company formation rate proceeding about 25 percent slower than the dismal statewide rate. About 3,400 new companies are formed in the region each year, half of where we would be if we reached the national average.<P><P><B>Addressing the Problem</B><P>Many observers see a multipronged problem that starts with the region's tradition. Donald F. Smith Jr., executive director of the Center for Economic Development at Carnegie Mellon University, says many in the region expect big business and big labor to provide them with opportunity, rather than trying to create opportunity themselves. <P>History supports that theory: For decades in western Pennsylvania, a son would go to work in the same facility that employed his father and his father's father. People didn't have to create their own opportunities because Andrew Carnegie and men like him were creating opportunities for them.<P>That thinking must change.<P>"We must get the man on the street to accept the challenge," says Gerald E. McGinnis, chairman of Respironics Inc., the once-entrepre-neurship and now public company that posted 1995 sales of $99.5 million.<P>But the problem goes beyond our region's mindset. Even if this region were entrepreneurial, it still would be starting a few steps behind the rest of the country. Only 15 percent of our population is in the prime entrepre-neurial age range of 25 to 34, compared to other regions that typically have over 20 percent of their population in that group. Furthermore, the region's population is the old-est among the nation's metro-politan areas.<P>"And that isn't because old people move here," Allegheny Ludlum Corp. chairman Richard P. Simmons told a gathering of fellow chief executives a few months back.<P>And then there is the problem of cap-ital to support entrepreneurship. A recently published Enterprise Corp. report showed  a shortage of local adventure capital - the high risk start-up money that will sustain a company and enable it to grow until larger pools of capital can be attracted, such as those provided by venture capital funds. The adventure capital usually comes from individual investors, since venture capital firms rarely invest in companies at their earliest stages. The Enterprise Corp. recommends that up to $4 million in adventure capital should be invested in local start-ups each year.<P>As for venture capital - the money that helps established companies grow - the report showed only     a slight increase in the amount              of venture capital here that is available to invest. And five of 13 Pittsburgh-based funds said they were fully   invested and were not seeking             new investments.<P><B>Solving the Problem</B><P>Not all the news is bad. Our region has several factors in its favor: Its universities and hospitals are nationally recognized. It has strong cultural amenities and a low cost of living. It has a great airport and is centrally located between New York and Chicago. You can also factor in more business friendly initiatives that Ridge likely will push through.<P>So there are reasons to consider starting a business here.<P>And to find entrepreneurs who might start businesses, Canfield wants to clone a program used in Kansas City, Mo., an entrepreneurial hotbed. <P>In 1993, Ewing Marion Kauffman, founder of Marion Pharmaceuticals, which now is industry giant Marion Merrill Dow, left half of his $1.2 billion estate to be used for economic development in greater Kansas City.<P>One effort entails using Kauff-man's money to keep talented people in Kansas City. Canfield wants to do the same thing here, tapping the talent produced each spring by the region's universities.<P>Canfield would call the program Pittsburgh Fellows.<P>"I think it is absolutely critical that we copy this program," he says. "Let's get 50 of these people who are imported here - about ready to graduate - and get them to stay here, sink roots here, buy a house ... maybe have a kid. Once they are here, like all of us, they do not want to leave.<P>"If they stay, maybe we get a couple FORE Systems that in a few years will have 500 employees," Canfield says.<P>Then there's the question of money. Why should private individuals invest in a young business when such high risk is involved? William C. Dunkelberg, chief economist for the National Federation of Independent Business, doesn't look at adventure capital as a risk because, he says, eventually there is a return. He thinks adventure capital should be a priority.<P>"Small firms are in many ways the R&D of the U.S. economy," Dunkel-berg said in a speech last year. "Any individual has the right and the opportunity to start a business. Through this mechanism, new ideas, new ways to do things, new products or new niche markets can be served. Successful projects are rewarded with profits, the source of capital for expansion and the signal for new resources to enter the market in the form of competition.<P>"Experiments that fail may result in bankruptcy or termination, but the resources that were used are not lost to society," Dunkelberg says. "They are repriced and redeployed in yet another entrepreneurial venture. This process is repeated until the resources earn a competitive return, the signal that they are now productively deployed."<P>Stories about companies bootstrapping their way to success are common, but in actuality, are much the exception rather than the rule. Seed money is an absolute necessity in most cases: Just ask entrepreneur Gene Kirila, who has been through the early stages of a business twice.<P>At age 20, Kirila left Youngstown State University and with a friend started Pyramid Enterprise, a company that eventually offered a line of 130 fitness products and generated annual revenues of $8 million. Kirila sold the company in 1993 and now is involved with another venture, Pyramid Plastics, which is opening a 65,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Greenville that will employ 110 people.<P>"Venture capital is the key element," Kirila says. "There's no question."<P>Through the early part of the 20th century, Pittsburgh was a center of venture capital. The Mellon family, H.C. Frick and other business tycoons invested in all sorts of industries.<P>Today, there are signs of improvement in the region. Most notably, Kevin McClatchy pulled several local investors into his bid for the Pirates. And Dr. Peter Johnson, a University of Pittsburgh plastic surgeon who is pushing for Pittsburgh to be a tissue engineering hub, says doors are opening for him.<P><P><B>At Ground Zero</B><P>Some observers say the solutions aren't as simple as preserving the region's younger population and making seed money readily available. Algor's Bussler, for one, tells how the local economy supported his time-share business until the early '80s, when it dried up and forced him to totally change his business to what it is today. He no longer could rely on the regional economy to support his business.<P>"There has to be a viable economy for entrepreneurs to survive," says Bussler.<P>Tom Croft, executive director of the Steel Valley Authority, agrees, and places partial blame for our dearth of entrepreneurship on the region's policy makers. Croft says it was they who a decade ago gave short shrift to the manufacturing base after the collapse of the steel industry. Since then, Croft says, there's been a shifting economic development focus. <P>"Tourism. Retail. If the game plan keeps changing," Croft asks, "how do we even stay on the field?"<P>The Enterprise Corp.'s Canfield says manufacturing can indeed trigger entrepreneurship, provided the manufacturing base is cemented in growth industries. Unfortunately, our regional manufacturing base is not in growth industries.<P>"Name the top five growth industries in the U.S.," Canfield says. "Then name the companies dominating those markets and the Pittsburgh companies participating in those markets. You find out our current economy is not tied to the things that are generating the huge growth."<P>And that could explain the perception that there is a lack of venture and adventure capital, according to CMU's Smith. He stresses that capital does not necessarily have to come from this region. If ideas are viable - and often that means tied to a growth industry -Smith says the capital will flow in from sources here and elsewhere.<P>At presstime, the Allegheny Conference was moving forward with investment initiatives aimed at creating 100,000 new jobs by the year 2000. The business-sponsored policy organization had raised $40 million from the private sector to revitalize downtown Pittsburgh. But it also targeted restoration of the manufacturing base via technology-oriented manufacturers in five key industries: metalworking; chemicals and plastics; biomedical technologies; information and communication products; and environmental products. The Allegheny Conference wants to develop regional technology parks at sites near downtown and the airport.<P>Triggering entrepreneurship is a complex process, and it won't happen overnight. Crucial steps include keeping young talent here, luring adventure capital and tapping growth industries. And Ridge must make Pennsylvania a good place to do business.<P>Whatever the strategy, the time is now. As Allegheny Ludlum's Simmons told his fellow chief executives a few months back: The region is at risk.<P>"Wouldn't it be awful if we simply said we are too far gone - if we didn't try," Simmons told the group. "This is my home. This is your home. This is the home of a lot of people who say we have a window of opportunity and we are going to grasp it.<P>"We're going to try."                    <P>

<B><font size=+2>Dream or Reality?
</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+1>Will the Region Support a Downtown Retail District?<br>Lazarus and thje City are Betting on it</font></b><br>

<i>By Christopher Lawton</i></center>
<hr>
It was only a few days after Lazarus - the retailer that acquired Joseph Horne Co. - had committed to building a new store in downtown Pittsburgh. Mayor Tom Murphy was addressing an investment forum at the Westin William Penn and passed on some insider information: A half-dozen or so other retailers - their attention caught by the Lazarus venture - were calling the city.<P>That was good news for Murphy, who only months earlier was sweat-   ing out the possibility that Lazarus might abandon downtown Pittsburgh altogether.<P>But with Lazarus a done deal, Murphy now has something the city has lacked for years: a legitimate shopping district. And even if the other major retailers don't come, Murphy still has this: Lazarus on one corner, Saks Fifth Avenue on another corner and Kaufmann's on the next block. Plus, there's Burlington Coat Factory and Barnes & Noble bookstore, too. Larrimor's, Brooks Brothers and other specialty shops and restaurants round out the neighborhood. The city thinks more will come.<P>"We want to increase the viability of downtown by increasing the desirability of being downtown," says Robert D. Hurley, one of the mayor's economic development managers. "Once you get Lazarus on Fifth Avenue, a lot of the rest will come."<P><B>Setting the Foundation</B><P>Essentially, the present plans were born 15 months ago when Lazarus told the mayor it wanted to move from the Horne's building near Gateway Center. The building was not only old, it was isolated.<P>"The facility that Lazarus inherited required a lot of deferred maintenance to bring it up to today's merchandising standards," says John Hurley, director of real estate for Lazarus department stores. "We also conducted considerable evaluation of foot traffic patterns at the present location and determined that it was on the edge of the core retail area."<P>Rather than invest in a location that was economically undesirable, Lazarus decided to either move to a new location or pull out of the downtown market. The latter would have been Murphy's worst nightmare.<P>"From the outset, Mayor Murphy made it a priority to find a way to keep Lazarus in a downtown location," says Judy Kelly, the mayor's assistant. "His vision was to adopt the concept of retail anchors in a mall setting, and apply it to the retail district in downtown Pittsburgh."<P>In suburban malls, the large retailers draw the crowds and create the traffic that generates business for smaller retailers. The city was thinking the same way when it shoehorned Lazarus into the corner of Fifth Avenue and Wood Street. Lazarus didn't need much convincing. It also realized that building a new facility there would anchor the downtown retail district, along with Kaufmann's and Saks.<P>"We felt that there was great potential for the redevelopment of Fifth Avenue, particularly between our new location and Kaufmann's," says Lazarus' Hurley. "After careful analysis of foot traffic in the area, we also determined that portions of Wood Street, Smithfield and Forbes Avenue would accordingly benefit from redevelopment. Since this district already had some concentration of higher quality retailers, we felt that their added presence was also beneficial to our plans."<P>Mike Hendrickson, vice president of real estate firm Grubb & Ellis Co., agrees.<P>"With the addition of the Lazarus store, Pittsburgh's retail triangle has an opportunity to solidify itself in the retail marketplace," says Hendrickson. <P>One hitch did remain - the old Lazarus site. Remembering what happened with the closing of the Gimbels department store, which stood vacant for years, the city worked with Lazarus, Blue Cross and Oxford Development to get Blue Cross in the space.<P>The healthcare giant is maintaining its space at its Fifth Avenue Place headquarters and is occupying floors two through six and the mezzanine in the old Lazarus site, now called Penn Avenue Place. Oxford is seeking commercial and/or retail tenants for the ground level of the building.<P>"The building will undergo complete refurbishment so that it can accommodate nearly 600 new downtown employees, 400 of whom are  in completely new jobs," says Steve Leeper, an economic development manager for the city.  <P><B>Back on Wood Street</B><P>The city's work still wasn't nearly done. Crucial to any retail district is parking. The city was instrumental in helping Lazarus finalize plans for a 500-car subterranean parking garage for not only Lazarus' customers but those shopping at other area stores. The proposed garage will offer affordable short-term rates to those customers shopping within the district. <P>"We feel very strongly that for the new Lazarus location to be profitable we have to market this store beyond the downtown office workers," says Lazarus' Hurley. "While the business crowd is important to us, it by no means represents the majority of business that this store needs to remain competitive and profitable." <P>It needs shoppers from the suburbs, and Pittsburgh has one distinct factor that works in its favor in that regard. Unlike many other metropolitan areas, Pittsburgh's highway system funnels traffic toward downtown. In contrast, other cities with beltways channel traffic around, and in many cases, away from downtown.<P>"In many suburbs around the city, it's possible to drive in and out of the downtown area in 10 to 15 minutes," says Kelly, the mayor's aide.<P>But the suburban shoppers will have to want to come downtown in the first place. And that leads to even more work. One need only walk the retail corridor to see what needs to be done.<P>Streets are badly in need of resurfacing. The sidewalks - where they aren't cracked - are often uneven, the surfaces raised several inches from the ground due to weather changes. In other places the individual sidewalk panels don't match one another and are made of different materials. Garbage receptacles and garbage in general are another problem. Many of the receptacles overflow, and those that don't are in such bad shape that they look as if they might crumble at any moment. Everywhere, there seems to be an inordinate amount of litter.<P>The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership has hired workers to sweep the streets and is in the process of purchasing new garbage containers for the area. That will help cosmetically.<P>On other fronts, the downtown partnership is working with Port Authority Transit to redesign bus routes, and with the city to develop an ordinance that addresses aggressive panhandling  downtown.<P>Errol Frailey, president of the Downtown Partnership, strongly feels that with the positioning of Lazarus at Fifth and Wood, the city has demonstrated a serious commitment to upgrading that area.The city furthered that commitment by the inclusion, in the latest budget, of funds to restore  sidewalks, streets and lighting around the new Lazarus facility.<P>"When you sit in a mall, the furniture in the mall is geared so customers look at stores," says Robert Hurley of the city. "It enhances the quality of the location, and stores want to be there. We want to create an ambiance that lends itself to the same thing."<P>The Downtown Partnership also is working with the city to possibly reroute bus and automobile traffic away from Fifth Avenue.<P>"One of the problems we first addressed was that Fifth Avenue seems to have an inordinate amount of bus traffic considering the narrow width of the street and its sidewalks," says Frailey. "Our objective became to find a way to create a better balance of traffic in the area and possibly use other streets to handle some of the load."<P><B>Elsewhere on Wood Street</B><P>The obvious beneficiaries of this early development are those already in or near the retail corridor who have sweated out the lean times. On one end of Wood Street sits Point Park College. On the other end sits PNC Plaza. Once foot traffic increases in mid town, both stand to benefit.<P>Point Park is part of the redevelopment. The college, along with The Carnegie Library, recently purchased the Bank Center to develop into The Library Center. Located at the corner of Fourth and Wood, and opening sometime in the fall of this year, the Library Center will house the Carnegie's downtown business library, as well as Point Park's entire library collection. In addition, it will house a small theater that will be used to hold public events and lectures.<P>"Located in the retail district, the Library Center will attract library users and generate increased commercial activity," says Jim Hunter, interim president of Point Park College.<P>In the renovation of the Bank Center, Point Park and Carnegie Library were careful to preserve the original architecture of the structure.<P>"We wanted the Library Center to stand as an example of how an older structure can be utilized without sacrificing the building's architectural and historical significance," says Hunter.<P>Some businesses may be pushed out by redevelopment in the retail corridor, but they likely will get new space within the corridor.<P>"In addition, we're offering some low-cost financing incentives to retailers around the new Lazarus store who want to renovate their existing space," says the city's Leeper.<P>The Urban Redevelopment Authority has approved $1 million in renovation funds that can be made available to retailers.<P>The city and the Downtown Partnership maintain that only careful planning and a retail strategy will ensure that other retailers follow. What both the city and Lazarus hope to create is a viable retail district in Pittsburgh that effectively competes with the suburban mall alternatives within a 20-minute radius of the city. Planners offer one promise: The downtown retail corridor will be unique. <P>"We are going to determine what type of restaurant, store or entertainment facilities will be needed to best complement Lazarus and strengthen the position of downtown as a unique retail center," says Frailey of the Downtown Partnership. "We want to create something that's different from the suburban retail centers and from anything that Pittsburgh's had in the past in the downtown area."  <P>Lazarus is a key first step.            <P>

<B><font size =+1>Can a Suburban Community<br>Halt Growth?<br>Cranberry Township is Giving<br>It a Shot</font></b><br>

<i>By Barbara Youngerman Meyer</i></center>
<hr>
There were farms with cows grazing in the meadows, a few small businesses and - within Cranberry's 25 square miles - a total population of about 11,000. <P>So on a typical Friday night, Ebeck could drive through his Butler County community to shop in Wexford without hitting one traffic light. But that trip isn't such a breeze anymore. From 1970 to 1990, Cranberry's population grew 200 percent, to about 33,000. New residences increased 354 percent and, as of 1991, 3.7 million square feet of retail, warehouse or office space was constructed.<P>As for Ebeck's Friday night drives? He has some company on the road. A recent township study shows that by the year 2000, weekly traffic volume will have increased 321 percent to 296,000 cars from the 70,275 counted in 1985. Ebeck doesn't necessarily mind. The more people who pass through Cranberry, the more people who might walk into his office for an eye examination.<P>"I'm in the people business," Ebeck says. "It's been good for my business."<P>But not all residents of Cranberry and neighboring communities are as happy. These communities, which once attracted home buyers because of their rustic charm, now resemble modern suburbia. <P>"Thirty years ago, I moved up here from the North Side [of Pittsburgh]," says Darryl Kirschner, who lives not far from Cranberry in Zelienople. "And where am I going to go now? To Canada?"<P><B>Stop the Growth</B><P>Many Cranberry residents have a collective message for developers who are pushing for more growth: not here.<P>Back in 1992, Cranberry Township held two public meetings to define the problem and listen to what residents had to say <P>"The community made it very clear that we must manage our growth," says township Manager Jerry Andree. "And it's not too late to do it." <P>Until recently, Cranberry had been laboring under an outdated development plan. Some liken it to driving 90 miles per hour in the fast lane, steering via the rearview mirror. Development was governed by regulations adopted in 1977, when it was thought the community would always be occupied by rural or low density residential properties. <P>Without new rules to control growth, developers covered almost 12 square miles with anything and everything. Shopping malls were designed with little regard to eye appeal. Much to the irritation of locals, an 80-acre parcel of land was allowed to become a giant auto auction site. <P>But last April, the zoning laws were changed - and are now the township's weapon against developers.<P>"Zoning is how we're going to make things better," Andree says. "For example, we passed legislation that requires 30 percent of a commercial lot to be devoted to green space. Things must look environmentally pleasing. Therenow have to be landscaped islands in the parking lots. And we won't allow wholesale cutting of hillsides anymore." <P>The new zoning laws control residential as well as commercial growth. New residential restrictions demand a minimum lot size of 1.25 acres, for instance. To further mollify people who believe their rural paradise has taken on the "Monroeville look," as some residents put it, Cranberry is building a second recreational park. However, it will be built on 128 acres now used as a horse farm. Gained will be an area with soccer and baseball fields, a swimming pool, picnic facilities and hiking trails. Gone is another bit of the township's rural character - just what the township cites as its major strength.<P><B>The Other Side</B><P>Although Cranberry has passed legislation to control its growth, there are people who resent being restricted in any way.<P>"And, believe me," says Daniel Santoro, Cranberry's Director of Code Administration, "these people abound. They don't want anyone telling them how they can or cannot develop a piece of land. They consider it an infringement on their inalienable rights." <P>Plus, as Santoro adds, there's big bucks to be made. People can sell off just about any tract of land on Route 19 - the main artery running through Cranberry - for a sizable sum. Some don't care how the developer uses the land after its sold because they move out of the township.<P>And, because there's so much money to be made by developing property in Cranberry, the township is spending a chunk of its budget in court. If the township denies someone the right to develop a site in a certain way, the case ends up being litigated.  A developer will rarely go away quietly just because the township says no. <P>"The trend," says Chris Lochner, manager of Hampton Township in northern Allegheny County, "is to do whatever it takes to get a variance on a zoning regulation. Areas of growth, like Cranberry, are being bombarded by developers who won't be stopped. They go to court and, nine times out of 10, are granted whatever variance they need.<P>"Here in Hampton we tried to stop an amusement park being built in an area of the township that is already heavily congested on weekends. And we lost, despite the fact that we showed exiting roads just couldn't handle the anticipated flow of traffic. 'So what' the judge said to our problem. The law is on the side of whoever wants to develop the land."<P>Hampton does not want to stem all growth. In fact, Lochner admits that the township envies Cranberry to an extent because growth does carry with it many benefits. For one, it enhances the tax base of the municipality and other taxing bodies, such as a school district. It also creates jobs. And as optometrist Elmer Ebeck will tell you, it brings more customers into the businesses already located there.<P>But there's a point when growth goes too far, and Ross Township Commissioner Robert Raida says his community is one example.<P>You want to see the downside of growth firsthand? Raida says take a drive along McKnight Road. <P>"We are doing everything we can to discourage any more growth because we don't like the problems we have," Raida says. "We're spending one-third of our budget for public safety. That's about $3.5 million for police protection and other safety-related services. The more growth you have residentially and commercially, the more crime you have. That's not just true in Ross or Cranberry. It's what happens anywhere." <P>Ross Township discouraged Wal- Mart from building on land located at Babcock and McKnight.<P>"We just made it somewhat difficult for them and they went away," Raida says. "They didn't want the fuss, I guess. But people have the right to develop the land, and it's hard to fight it. Yes, Cranberry is spending a lot of its budget in court and I feel sorry for them. That's a heck of a way to spend your money." <P><B>Legal Fees</B><P>Andree, Cranberry's manager, concedes that the battle is an expensive one. But in the same breath, he says it is one worth fighting if that's what the residents want.<P>"We have successfully defended 95 percent of our cases," Andree says. "Yes, it's expensive to take these people on, but that won't stop us. We have a $5.8 million budget. We can cover any legal costs involved in protecting our community. We will not sign Cranberry's death warrant." <P>Because the township is under pressure to alleviate rather than compound its traffic congestion, it may rezone land surrounding Route 228. A 1 million-square-foot mall proposed for a site in that area might not make it beyond the planning stage if the land is rezoned for office use or multi-family development only. <P>Traffic studies show that a mall would add 22,000 cars a day to Route 228 - a mere two-lane highway where farm tractors often cruise at speeds approaching 15 miles per hour. However, mall developer J.J. Gumberg intends to continue with plans to build. Observers say the project will probably end up smaller than originally proposed, but, there may yet be another mall in Cranberry. Already in place are Cranberry Mall, the Wal-Mart plaza and several smaller shopping strips. <P>Business parks also are popping up here and there. For example, New Castle-based Penn Power is developing a 180-acre site in Cranberry Township. The land formerly belonged to Three Rivers Aluminum Company.<P>"We are always looking for new and innovative ways to build our business and our relationship with the community," says Penn Power spokesman JoeBobbey. <P>The utility company plans on developing the land for use by 15 to 20 small to medium-sized businesses. GMAC already has committed to the site, which is located between the Pennsylvania Turnpike and Route 19. Penn Power is eliminating a sharp bend from an access road to make the property more attractive.<P>"The excellent location - just 20 minutes from Pittsburgh and in the middle of a major U.S. market region - makes it especially appealing to businesses like small manufacturers, suppliers and distributors, and even information technology companies, " says Randal J. Coleman, economic development consultant at Penn Power. "We consider this venture a new model of cooperation between a community, a local electric company and businesses."<P>Penn Power is a subsidiary of Ohio Edison and provides electric service to more than 140,000 customers in Butler, Allegheny, Crawford, Lawrence and Mercer counties.                               <P><B>Natural Growth</B><P>Most of Cranberry's problems are a natural outgrowth of residential development. To escape high property taxes in Allegheny County with less than a 30-minute commute to downtown Pittsburgh, people are moving to Cranberry in droves. Their property tax rate is half that of Allegheny County communities.  Some talk of savings thousands annually.<P>These new residents, says Chamber of Commerce Director Melissa Corbin-Nelson, want easy access to shopping, banking and a quick bite after work with the kids. It seems that, if Cranberry appears overdeveloped, the only place to put any blame is on the residents themselves. <P>Maybe some of the wealthier and older residents didn't get exactly what they wanted in the way of upscale shops and fine dining. But the typical family has most of its daily needs met in Cranberry, says Corbin-Nelson. The schools and pre-schools are good, she says, and the average family has children ranging from infancy to 10 years of age. Headed by adults aged 25 to 40, this family lives in a new three-bedroom house valued between $115,000 and $125,000. <P>Corbin-Nelson says many neighborhoods, like her own, are comprised of out-of-state people. Her neighbors are young and on the move, often changing jobs or transferred from place to place as part of a management training program.<P>Mike Long, a senior merchandising manager for JC Penney, moved to Cranberry with his family two years ago from Parkersburg, W.V.  Before that, he lived in Columbus, Ohio.<P>"What my wife and I like is that there are lots of people here our age, in their mid 30s, with kids the same age as ours. It's easy to make friends," he says. <P>It does take him five minutes just to get out of his housing development in the morning, and he says he doesn't like that very much. Nor is he happy about thepossibility of more shopping malls moving in.<P>"I work down at Ross Park Mall, and so I'm aware of what big shopping malls bring with them. Crime. Auto thefts. Shady characters. No, I wouldn't like to see that here where I live," Long says. But Cranberry was bound to happen sooner or later.<P><B>At the Crossroads</B><P>Henry Nutbrown, district engineer for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for 30 years, calls Cranberry "the crossroads of western Pennsylvania."<P>Running through it are Routes 228 and 19 and Interstates 79 and 76, which is the Pennsylvania Turnpike. "So it was inevitable that Cranberry became what it is today," Nutbrown says. <P>Many see the completion of Interstate 279, which links Pittsburgh with I-79 and, thus, with Cranberry, as the prime catalyst for Cranberry's enormous development. But Nutbrown disagrees.  "Construction of I-279 was just the icing on the cake," he says.  "Even before that road was completed in 1989, Cranberry was growing. If any road is primarily responsible, it's I-79. And both I-79 and I-279 are highways that began to be planned at least 30 years ago." <P>But could anyone have predicted 30 years ago what these roads would trigger? They were, according to Nutbrown, initiated as part of an interstate highway system for efficiently mobilizing armies and missiles throughout the country in case of war. On an everyday basis, they are used to mobilize people from home to work. <P>"Right now," says Nutbrown of I-79 and I-279, "the Parkway North has the second highest volume of traffic in the area, with the Parkway West having the highest. I-279 around the North Side gets 100,000 vehicles each day, according to 1995 figures." <P>Penn Dot's figures tell that "there's a lot of growth happening out north. Everywhere north. But what we are considering for Cranberry specifically," Nutbrown says, "is connecting I-279 and the turnpike to cut down on traffic congestion." <P>Nutbrown has heard complaints that this plan would turn Cranberry into a ghost town, but he doesn't think there's a chance of that happening. Cranberry, like most communities north of Pittsburgh - especially those in Butler County - are experiencing a rapid influx of people.<P>And that brings us back to Darryl Kirschner, the Zelienople resident,  who doesn't know if he'll stay around to help fight the growth. He wishes the trees were growing, not the population.  After all, it's the rural setting that attracted him to Butler County from Pittsburgh's North Side a few years back.<P>Not far from Kirschner's home, there are still pockets of wild turkey left in the woods, along with deer and a few bears. <P>"But it just isn't what it used to be," laments Kirschner. "Just in the past few years, all these peoplehave been coming in here and scaring the animals away. I don't know how far north I'm going to have to go this time."              n<P>Once again the group from FORE Systems is breaking ground; this time, literally.<P>To accommodate FORE Systems' continuing growth, the company is currently undertaking the largest commercial building project in Allegheny County in five years. The new headquarters campus will be located north of Pittsburgh, in Marshall Township.<P>"The buildings will be like none that exist in the area," says William Bates, director of facilities for FORE Systems. "We believe the unique new headquarters will contribute to the growing visibility of FORE, while improving recruitment and creating a sense of identity for employees."<P>State, county and local government joined forces in an effort to lock in FORE's headquarters at the Marshall Township location. A low-interest, $10 million loan from Allegheny County's Economic Development Fund provided 25 percent of the necessary funding. Further funding was arranged by Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh.<P>Bates says the buildings are being designed to capture the dynamic, creative spirit of FORE Systems and its unique image in the computer industry. The new facility will be able to accommodate extensive growth.<P>Six years ago, four professors and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University combined their talents to form the company that now is the worldwide leader in the design, development, manufacture and sale of high performance local area networking products based on ATM technology. FORE Systems has since grown to more than 540 employees. <P>FORE offers the most extensive ATM local area network product line available today and has delivered ATM solutions to more than 800 customers, including Fortune 500 companies, telecommunications service providers, government agencies, research institutions and universities.<P><P>Duquesne University promised to provide a unique atmosphere when it affiliated with the former Vincentian High School to form Vincentian Academy-Duquesne University. Six months into the first school year, students in the academy program are conversing in Spanish via electronic mail with Spanish-speaking undergraduates at Duquesne. <P>There are some other unique characteristics of the program. For one, the school year lasts 205 days, 25 more than the traditional 180.<P>Last August, the 27 members of the class of 1999 spent 15 days in  a summer session that counted against the 205 days.<P>"They were very attentive and were interested in their studies and helped each other out. In fact, they came to me on a few occasions saying they wanted more work to do and wanted to do things in addition to those listed in the curriculum," says Derek Whordley, president of VADU and dean of Duquesne's school of education.<P>Students in the academy program attend classes in the same facility as Vincentian High School students, but follow an international baccalaureate program. Duquesne says the program is the first university-affiliated high school tooffer an IB program in the world.<P>The IB diploma is regarded as a mark of excellence by universities around the world. A student who has successfully passed IB exams is admitted as a second year student qualifying for academic scholarships at virtually any college or university.<P>"We have the opportunity to create the most interesting international baccalaureate school in the world," Whordley says. "I think this school can put some goodness in the world of education that wasn't there before."<h2> Butler County's Mainstay: ServiStar</h2>It takes tools to build something. A company known for tools, ServiStar, is helping youngsters build their futures.<P>Headquartered in Butler, Pa., ServiStar's name has been associated with thousands of independent retailers specializing in hardware, lumber, home center, rental, garden and automotive sales. This $1.8 billion member-owned company has stores located in 49 states and 40 countries. In 1995, ServiStar achieved record sales of $1.8 billion, including a record $766 million in lumber/building material.<P>It also continued its Tools for Tomorrow program, under which independent ServiStar retailers support vocational education programs in their respective communities. The retailers lend tools to vo-tech programs for use in instruction or on community projects. They also conduct how-to clinics, offer discounts tovo-tech students and teachers, and donate ServiStar coupon calendars that student groups can sell for fund-raising purposes.<P>Another facet of the program recognizes at the local, state and national levels vo-tech students who set standards of excellence in vocational and academic skills while displaying commitment to their communities. <P>"The 15 million students enrolled in vo-tech programs today represent the backbone of tomorrow's work force," says ServiStar CEO Paul E. Pentz. "ServiStar is pleased to take a proactive role in promoting the importance of quality vocational education and in recognizing students and teachers who achieve success on a daily basis." <h2> Improving Healthcare in Butler County</h2>Instead of merely mimicking the national debate on the delivery of healthcare, Butler County is taking action to improve residents' health.<P>A year and a half ago, the Butler County Community Health Advisory Council was formed with a simple mission: to improve the health of the people of Butler County by measurably reducing incidence of disease and encouraging healthy lifestyles. The group includes 18 members from all geographic and professional reaches of the county and was one of three areas awarded a $15,000 grant from the Voluntary Hospital Association to assess the health of the community.<P>Through this comprehensive survey, the group has identified 13 community health priorities and is now convening task forces of providers and citizens to work in each area. The top three issues in Butler County are heart disease, unintentional injuries and cancer.<P>"We are asking people to bring their expertise and resources to the table," says Stephanie Rathfon, community health facilita tor. "We want to develop action plans for continuum of care in each of these areas, to see how providers can collaborate and coordinate services. We hope to take out duplication in services and fill in the gaps so we have a smooth system."<P>The 10 other identified issue areas include maternal and infant health, immunization and infectious diseases, HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, diabetes, mental health and geriatric services. In those, the group initially plans to increase education and awareness.<P>Rathfon also hopes that the strategy of creating initiatives with existing resources (110 providers, including hospitals, social service agencies and physicians, have been asked to man the task forces) will decrease the need for intensive funding as the project continues. To date, the group has spent $75,000 to amass the information needed to launch the effort - only $15,000 of which was covered by the grant. The rest has been funded by Butler County Memorial Hospital.<P>"We're the sole commu nity provider, and from our perspective, the continued support of the community health assessment is part of our mission. That's why we're here, to improve the health of the community," says Carol Dietrich, chief operating officer of Butler County Memorial. <P>Dietrich sees increasing the community's health as a good investment for the future, not just for the community, but for the hospital. A healthier population uses less healthcare - so resources can be concentrated on the cases requiring intervention. And that bodes well for a future which, in light of healthcare reform, looks to be getting leaner and leaner.<P>

<B><font size =+1>If Employers Monitor Workplace E-Mail,<br>Are They Invading a Worker's Privacy?</font></b><br>

<i>By Jim Urban</i></center>
<hr>
Supervisors at a California bank found something surprising when they randomly checked an employee's electronic mail. Some messages sent and received by the employee disclosed that the employee was moonlighting as a stripper. The bank terminated the employee, who subsequently sued the bank for invasion of privacy.<P>The bank successfully defended  its action, convincing a judge that the e-mail system belonged to the bank and could legitimately be monitored. Nevertheless, the case shows how an  e-mail system can expose employers  to workplace disputes over what           is private, and potentially lead to  costly litigation.<P>"Most employers are being pretty cautious about it," says Robert McTiernan, an attorney with Tucker Arensberg in Pittsburgh. He advises clients to avoid monitoring e-mail unless they believe it is being misused.<P>"It's an issue that also involves employee morale," McTiernan says. "Employers want to build a sense of trust with employees."<P>Today, 90 percent of all companies with more than 1,000 employees use  e-mail. Surveys show there are close to 20 million e-mail users in the United States today, and projections approach 40 million users nationwide by the year 2000. These 40 million e-mail users will be sending an estimated 60 billion messages annually. <P><B>An E-mail Policy</B><P>Attorney Jeffrey A. Van Doren of Cohen & Grigsby in Pittsburgh says a critical step for the employer - whether they intend to monitor or not - is clearly communicating an e-mail policy. Tell the employees up front what they can expect and what is expected of them.<P>"A wide gap exists between what an employer considers its rights to access and what employees deem an invasion of privacy," Van Doren says. "Most employees tend to believe their e-mail, like U.S. Mail, is private. Thus, employees who discover that their employer has been monitoring their  e-mail messages may believe their right to privacy has been violated.<P>"The Fourth Amendment protects privacy from government intrusion and does not normally apply to private employers, but there is a common law right of privacy that may apply," Van Doren says.<P>Invasion of privacy is relatively difficult to prove.  A plaintiff must show that there was an expectation of privacy and that the employer engaged in highly objectionable monitoring. In some states, the plaintiff must also show that the employer disseminated the information or data received from the monitoring.<P>By defining a clear and concise policy up front, the employer can limit the possibility that it will be held liable for invasion of privacy later. Some employers go as far as having employees sign consent forms before they are permitted to use the e-mail system.<P>"The consent forms are great, because you have taken away that expectation of privacy," says Gregory Miller, an attorney with Buchanan Ingersoll in Pittsburgh.<P>As far as a policy is concerned,   the American Law Institute recom-mends including the following as a starting point:<P>1. An e-mail system is company property and should be used for company purposes only.<P>2. Employees should disclose information or messages from an        e-mail system only to authorized employees.<P>3. The company reserves the right to monitor the e-mail system in order to assure that its property is being used for business purposes only.<P>4. Employees do not have a personal privacy right in any matter created, received or sent from an         e-mail system.<P>5. Nothing should be entered into the e-mail system without a good reason.<P>ALI also says an appropriate program for monitoring an employer's system should be disclosed in detail   to employees.<P>The first point - restricting        e-mail use to company purposes - is critical in light of what happened to one company in a recent National Labor Relations Board case. The employer had allowed employees to use e-mail for a variety of matters with little relevance to the business itself. But when the employees started using it to distribute labor union information, the employer stepped in and put a halt to it.<P>When the employees complained to the NLRB, an administrative law judge sided with them. The judge ruled that the employer discrim-inatorily prohibited bargaining unit employees from using the e-mail system for distributing union information. <P>In addition to the points listed above, Van Doren says managers should consider other variables when developing the policy. Is there union representation that could affect acceptance of the policy? Is bargaining necessary before a policy can be implemented for union employees? How will the employees be informed of the policy?<P><B>The Smoking Gun</B><P>Employers should also be aware that e-mail is discoverable during litigation. Some have learned the hard way, including one employer that was sued by a terminated employee. The employer characterized the firing as an economic layoff, but was sunk by an internal e-mail that characterized the employee as a "bitch" and talked of "getting rid" of her.<P>"People use e-mail like it is the phone," says Buchanan Ingersoll's Miller. "They write something, send it, then hit delete. They think it is gone, but it is not. That stuff is all backed up. And it's just deadly."<P>Relatively few employers have      e-mail monitoring policies in place, and there's a split of opinion as to whether e-mail monitoring should be routine. <P>There are times when monitoring is absolutely necessary. An example is when an employee is using the e-mail system to sexually harass a coworker. If the problem is brought to the attention of the employer and the employer allows the harassment to continue, the company could be held liable for subjecting the complaining employee to a hostile work environment.<P>There's also the chance that some employees may use the e-mail system as a means to leak company secrets. In 1992, Borland International sued industry rival Symantec Corp., accusing it of stealing trade secrets. Borland contended that one of its former executives sent confidential trade secrets to Symantec while working for Borland. The executive subsequently took employment with Symantec.<P>Miller says professionals, who many times deal with proprietary information, are more apt to recognize the importance of e-mail monitoring and accept it. In other industries or situations, monitoring might outrage employees.<P>McTiernan, the Tucker Arensberg attorney, says in those instances you must consider the detriment of implying mistrust to employees.<P>"The greater risk is the damage to morale and the effectiveness in the organization," says McTiernan. "You can have e-mail policies, but the advantage to the employer of routine monitoring is limited in comparison to detriment. If something is brought to your attention about misuse of anything in the company, you are certainly allowed to investigate. But monitoring everything on an ongoing basis? That would be a risk."                <h2>About Wilder, Mahood & Crenney</h2>	Wilder, Mahood & Crenney is a small law firm which provides personal individualized services to a limited number of clients in divorce cases and related matters.

<P>


There's a laundry list of reasons why businesses do not want to locate in our region: Clean Air Act regulations, the tax burden, workers' compensation ... the list goes on.
<P>
Are our local businesses trying to add to that list? Maybe so.
<P>
One of our region's strengths is its strong cultural amenities -- from the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra to the various theater offerings. Yet at a time when national funding for the arts is threatened or declining, the arts community here also is running into resistance from the corporate world.
<P>
The days when corporations funded the arts because they felt it was   their civic duty to do so are long over for some corporations. Some have been ravaged by lean times. Others have simply changed their philosophy on giving.
<P>
Call it bad timing. The arts -- perennially on the financial edge -- are facing some of their most challenging years in recent history. Federal funding for the National Endowment for the Arts is expected to decrease from   $97.5 million in fiscal year 1996 to zero in fiscal year 1999. 
<P>
As this magazine pointed out last month, many corporations these days demand something in return for their sponsorship dollars: visibility. That is not necessarily bad, as long as what they demand remains in line with what they give. 
<P>
Unfortunately, the number of large corporations in this region that sponsor the arts has dwindled. Many have simply left the city and taken their sponsorship dollars with them. One example is Gulf Oil, for years a major sponsor of the arts in Pittsburgh.
<P>
Other corporations that remain  in the area are led, in some cases, by CEOs with no connection to the region and with loyalty only to shareholders. They simply de-emphasize their company's philanthropic interests. Some have no interest in sitting on cultural boards. They have limited interest in permitting other members of their management team to become involved in      the arts.
<P>
It gets worse. The arts community reports a disturbing trend among smaller firms that were born here, grew here, but simply have shown little to no interest in supporting the arts. These are the types of firms that will spur growth in the region. These are the firms we need to support the arts.
<P>
What many fail to realize is the importance the arts hold from a business sense. The arts are much more than black-tie events or photos in the society column. They can serve as motivation for companies to want to do business here. They can serve as motivation for qualified employees to want to live and work here. The arts make the community a place where people want to live. Tony Crumbley, who works for the Charlotte 
<P>
Chamber of Commerce and tries to lure businesses to that region, has little good to say about western Pennsylvania. But when pressed, Crumbley lists our strong cultural amenities as a plus. He's right.
<P>
And as former Harvard Business Review editor Rosabeth Moss Kanter pointed out during her September speech in Pittsburgh, "The final deciding factor in whether a company is going to locate its corporate headquarters in a city is the question of whether top management wants to live there."
<P>
Ironically, one of the nation's greatest backers of the arts -- Philip Morris -- is one that repeatedly has come under attack of late because of its tobacco business. Philip Morris. The tobacco giant donate<P>s 1 percent of its domestic pretax earnings annually to charitable causes. Of its total charitable contributions, 30 percent goes to the arts, as compared with an average of 11 percent for U.S. businesses.
<P>
So if the quality of arts in this region falls due to a lack of support, you can add it to the list of reasons for corporations to stay away. Jot it down right under workers' compensation and high taxes.
<P>
Preserving the arts in this region is crucial to economic growth. Come on corporate Pittsburgh -- from high tech to high finance -- ante up. If a shareholder asks what you are doing with profits, tell them you are investing them. You will be.

</FONT SIZE><BR>
<font size=+1>It's Time for More Women to Try the Entrepreneurial Route</font>
<i> By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher </i></b><P>



 
In this region, "women's work" is never done because women never do "their work."  
<P>
Nationwide, women are starting businesses at twice the rate of men.  Not here.  Women-owned businesses employ more people in the United States than all of the Fortune 500 companies employ worldwide.  Yet, only     7 percent of local women-owned businesses surveyed in a recently released Duquesne University study reported payrolls totaling over $500,000 in 1994.
<P>
In fact, 41 percent of women-owned businesses in the Pittsburgh area employ no one other than the woman business owner.  A survey of National Association of Women Business Owners members indicates only 16 percent of their members do not employ anyone other than the business owner.  This striking contrast reveals the differing plight of the Pittsburgh woman business owner  versus her counterparts elsewhere.
<P>
A more accurate barometer of business success -- gross sales -- presents an even bleaker picture.  The percentage of women-owned businesses in the Pittsburgh area reporting 1994 earnings less than $250,000 is almost twice the national percentage.  
<P>
Most women blame the discriminatory practices of men for women's also-ran status within the business community. I disagree.
<P>
I believe that women's lack of support for other women and generally myopic perceptions of a woman's role are much more stifling than men's attitudes or actions toward women.  
<P>
Women don't even support other women here when money isn't involved.  Take the ballot box for example.  Pennsylvania ranks 44th out of 50 states in the percentage of women in our state legislature.  And consider the lack of support for commissioner candidate Colleen Vuono. Women's attitudes about themselves become a self fulfilling prophecy in this area.
<P>
Women here must unleash the tremendous latent capacity which lies within themselves. Pittsburgh cannot afford to have over half its population underperforming.  In many ways, the region's future economic vitality depends on women's ability to obliterate the outmoded paradigms establishing their expected levels of substandard performance. Our women are close to last when compared to other women across the country.  If the region is to prosper, women must get their act together.  This is what I call "women's work."

<b><P align=center><FONT SIZE=+2>The True Enemy
</FONT SIZE><br>
<font size=+1>A Reluctance to Think Regionally
</font><br>
<font size=+1>Is What Really Holds Us Back</FONT>
 <i>By Marc Jampole
</b></i>

<HR>







<P>
It's no secret anymore that western Pennsylvania is in economic  trouble. While nearby cities such as Columbus, Baltimore and Philadelphia are enjoying economic renaissances, the Pittsburgh area continues to        lose jobs, headquarters offices and   businesses. 
<P>Be it at a cocktail party or business meeting or in the news media, when the hand-wringing stops, the blaming begins. And many people condemn the usual culprits -- labor and taxes. Now, as a business owner who pores over spreadsheets late at night, I can say it's always easy to come to the conclusion that if it only paid fewer taxes or paid employees less, the business would be more profitable.
<P>The problem with that kind of thinking for any business is that you could theoretically reduce your expenses to nothing and still make nothing if you have no customers. 
<P>Instead of dreaming of the proverbial free lunch of low taxes and cheap labor, let's look at what we get for our money.
<P>Labor is an easy issue to deal with, because the facts are so striking,  if underreported. All government research indicates that for virtually every job classification, Pittsburgh has lower wage rates than Cleveland, Philadelphia, Raleigh and San Diego, as well as Los Angeles, New York and Washington, D.C. No study has ever indicated that Pittsburgh labor is less productive. In fact, we always point with pride to our work ethic. With so many fine universities and colleges and many more post-secondary training opportunities than Columbus or Cleveland, it's clear that the workforce in western Pennsylvania is usually a bargain for employers.
<P>The issue of taxation is more complicated, because we do have high taxes in Allegheny County. There really is no such thing as a free lunch, so let's ask the question, what kind of lunch are we getting for our tax money?
<P>Here are some "dishes" that our taxes in Allegheny County pay for:
l 	130 municipal governments.
l	More than 40 school districts.
l	Partial or complete funding for more 	than 40 organizations engaged in 		economic development.
<P>Because we are paying for this duplication of administration, there is less money available for things we really need, such as improved mass transit, county-wide 911 service and classroom improvements. This duplication also leads to competition within the region, for example, between school districts for residents and between economic development groups for funding. This duplication of effort and competition for limited funding has hampered Allegheny County since World War II. Meanwhile, across the nation, one metropolitan area after another has embraced regionalism, and thrived. Examples include Baltimore, Columbus, Milwaukee, Charlotte, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Portland, Ore. -- all growing areas about the same size as Pittsburgh or smaller.
<P>For the business owner or executive looking to expand or invest in Allegheny County, the abundance of local entities is confusing and expensive. Take the hypothetical example of a national chain that wants to place stores in three or four locations in Allegheny County. There is no one place to turn for help in determining the best locations, because every one of the economic development groups and municipalities are in it for themselves.
<P>Once locations are selected, the chain will likely have to approach a different zoning board for each location. A handful of residents will likely oppose the development because of the phenomenon of Nimbyism (not in my backyard). There is Nimbyism everywhere, and often opponents of a development come up with good improvements. But because our region is so fragmented, the chain has to negotiate with many groups and municipalities, not one or two, about their site plans. And the Nimbys end up having a greater say in Allegheny County than elsewhere, simply because their voices can speak louder and longer in a municipality of 10,000 or 20,000 than they ever would in a broader region.  
<P>Allegheny County is moving slowly towards taking a more regional approach to our economy. Our regional asset tax has been a good first step. Allegheny County and the city of Pittsburgh are doing much more together, such as training police and collecting delinquent taxes. But these steps are only the beginning of what it will take for Pittsburgh to be able to compete with Columbus or Baltimore in the future.
<P>People naturally fear change, and the fears associated with regionalism, such as losing control and civic iden-tity, are real. 
<P>But we should fear more Pittsburgh becoming the Balkans of America -- a backward, fragmented region with a relatively low standard of living, a declining economy and constant infighting.                                 n

<h2>We Are Here to Stay</h2>
Reporters from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called Executive Report twice on Nov. 9, asking Publisher Linda Dickerson and Editor-in-Chief Jim Urban about rumors that the magazine was shutting down.
<P>
Are they true? No. Was management at ER surprised by the rumors? Not at all.
<P>
"We were the subject of similar but equally untrue rumors two years ago," Dickerson explains. "It's a cut-throat tactic used by the publications that compete with us for advertising dollars, and frankly, it troubles me. November is a month when advertisers are deciding how they will spend their money in next year's budget. If our competitors convince advertisers that ER won't be around, that helps our competitors' position. 
<P>
"At ER, we don't unjustifiably attack our competition," Dickerson adds. "We attack the problems facing this region and try to come up with solutions."
<P>
Dickerson, who has been publisher of ER for 14 years and is well entrenched in Pittsburgh's corporate community, says ER has expanded its coverage of business in recent months. She says since Urban took over the editorial department in June, the magazine has added monthly coverage of issues related to healthcare, education and small business while also adding restaurant reviews, travel features, a monthly look at legislative happenings in Harrisburg and a question & answer with a prominent business person. The magazine also was graphically redesigned.
<P>
"Our October issue, with 88 pages, was one of the thickest we've ever published," Dickerson says. "We are projecting growth in a down market."
<P>
ER was investigating the rumors in an effort to determine the source. Patrick 
<P>
Wood, associate publisher, says the magazine will pursue legal action if the source is pinpointed.
<P>
Under common tort law, a corporation has been defamed if a statement made by another tends to prejudice the corporation in the course of business or if the statement deters others from dealing with that corporation. Remedies under tort law include compensation for any lost business.
<P>
"We're not necessarily concerned about money," Wood says. "To us, it's the principle."
<P>
As for the rumors? The most ridiculous version had Dickerson moving to Florida. The publisher is heading south, but only for a few weeks as she benchmarks our region against those that are thriving in the South. Look for a report on her findings in early 1996.
<HR>
<h2>What Color is the Sky in  Your World?</h2>

Blue? Or is it "cornflower"? The trendy color gurus have gotten their hands on our Crayolas, and have turned color into a marketing tool.
<P>
Though for many, purple may be a lot less confusing than "eggplant" or "aubergine," consumers seem to like the trendy names. One paint company that changed the name of its "off-white" paint to "antique silk" doubled its sales, according to Bob Cooper, a principal with Cooper Marketing Group in Oak Park, Ill., in an interview with American Demographics.
<P>
Cooper, who annually asks 5,000 adults their color preferences for an array of products, has grouped consumers into three groups: Color Forwards are willing to go for new and daring colors; Color Prudents wait for a color to come in before they try it, and Color Loyals stick to the tried and true. Marketers, he says, usually target the Color Prudents.
<P>
They are nothing if not predictable. A 1994-95 research study done by the Pantone Color Institute in New Jersey showed that Americans continue to favor blue above all other colors, but that greens are up and coming. Orange is passe. Leatrice Eiseman, Pantone's director, is responsible for many of the names with which colors have been rechristened, and says giving a color a name gives it romance and panache. Guess she'd approve of the "apricot whisper" just rolled on some of our living room walls. It's all ivory to us.

<HR>

<h2>A Growing Epidemic</h2>

Journalists, secretaries, attorneys, computer programmers, cashiers. The list of working Americans who are slowed by repetitive motion injury grows longer every day. The Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that "cumulative trauma disorders," including carpel tunnel syndrome, are the fastest growing occupational illnesses.
<P>
The numbers are numbing: Statistics show the number of new cumulative trauma or repetitive stress injuries has more than doubled, from 147,000 in 1989 to 302,000 in 1993, the most recent year for which statistics were available. An increasing number of the injuries occur in the white-collar service sector.
<P>
Experts say over 50 percent of the work force will have some sort of repetitive motion injury by the year 2000. Some past claims have run up to $300,000 for employers, pushing total claims past $20 billion annually nationwide.
<P>
For employers, the cost moves well beyond the workers' compensation or disability costs. Injuries erode the bottom line in other ways, such as productivity decreases and increases in the cost of hiring and training additional personnel.
<P>
Despite the increases in injuries, keyboard manufacturers have fared well in products liability lawsuits, including a New York jury's verdict this summer in favor of IBM and NCR. With juries saying the keyboards are not the problem, some employers now are trying harder than ever to determine the cause.
<P>
Some employers are testing a variety of keyboards to find out which is the safest. A recent entry into the market, the DataHand System, reduces repetitive keystroke motion up to 80 percent and finger travel to a fifth of that in a traditional    keyboard.
<P>
American Express Co. went a step further by conducting an ergonomics study, which included offering typing lessons to a control segment of its 150 customer-service representatives.

<font size = +1>Harry G's Mixes Good Food With a Tune
</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl
</I></B>
<p>

<hr>

<P>

How would you like your picture, in lights, at Sixth and Penn? Not all of us will make the marquee at Heinz Hall, but anyone can get their picture on the wall at Harry G's. 
<P>Formerly Bravo Franco's, the restaurant, renovated by owner Harry Guidotti last summer, features a raised bar and an elegant, white-table clothed dining room. Reminiscent of New York meeting places (but a little cleaner), the small restaurant's walls are lined with photos of Guidotti and his patrons among an eclectic mix of prints. His goal is eventually to coat the walls completely with these photos and lose the animated Disney cels and Native American posters. 
<P>"My customers are the stars," says Guidotti. 
And keeping them in mind, the menu is engineered to serve appetites from demure to decadent -- and back again. We started with red roasted   peppers croustini, topped with a dry ricotta. The tastes were nice, but the croustini a little too thin and unremarkable. The wild mushroom soup, on the other hand, was herbally perfect, with a rich broth. 
<P>Following the appetizers, we moved on to salad -- the tomato and fresh mozzarella is good and fresh, with Greek olives and a light sprinkling of olive oil. The house salad is also good and fresh, with a light vinaigrette, nicely herbed and not too oily. 
<P>Harry G's has a big lunch menu, almost duplicated at dinner, but only at lunch you can get a grilled portabella mushroom sandwich. And you should. Rendolent with the flavors of the grill, the mushroom is juicy atop a soft roll, with red peppers. Skip the grilled salad: Though it's a tasty idea to grill a choice of swordfish, chicken, tuna or N.Y. strip steak over Caesar salad, the salad is drowned in oily dressing. The grilled yellow fin tuna wasn't particularly fresh, either. Though the side of bow-tie pasta with feta cheese and chopped tomato is odd to serve with a lunch salad, it was fresh and perfectly cooked.
<P>If you've a great appetite (we took a pregnant woman along), there's a hearty selection of pasta and entrees for lunch. She tried a Triolene of filet mignon: slices of filet coated with fresh herbs, romano and breadcrumbs, then sauteed. It was perfectly cooked and flavorful, a beautiful cut of beef. It was also served with a side of pasta, though a different one than the salad -- penne in runny tomato sauce. (Besides being pregnant, she is also Italian, and gave it the thumbs down.)
<P>The seafood pasta marinara was also in a rather runny sauce, though the tastes were well-balanced. And the seafood, like that in the salad, wasn't the freshest. Harry's new menu will expand the pasta menu to 16 sauces and seven types of pasta.
<P>The desserts were killer rich -- we tried the peanut butter and chocolate mousse cake, strawberry cheesecake and French apple streusel tart. All were delicious -- the cheesecake rich and creamy, the tart cinnamony (they should have served it hot). The mousse was so rich a spoonful would have done -- but of course it didn't. The cappucino was smooth and full, but the house coffee was the watery standard.
<P>Capitalizing on the location,  Harry G's plays up the show theme. During lunch, a piano player steadily tinkles tunes ranging from "The Wind Beneath My Wings" to Snoopy's theme song -- making it definitely not the place for a business-heavy luncheon, unless you're selling pianos. Every night starting at 7:30, Harry G's has cabaret singers, and, after the show, a curtain call menu, which Guidotti says attracts many stars from Heinz Hall and the Benedum Center.
<P>"We want to be the show before the show and the show after the show and the show when there is no show," says Guidotti, who in 1994 retired and sold his local Guidotti Marketing Group.

<P>

<P>
About eight years ago, Steve Sheetz and his family were selling two hot dogs for 99 cents. They were also losing customers at an alarming rate.
<P>
Today, the Sheetz family sells gasoline, made-to-order hoagies and fresh pizza at their 175 convenience stores in four states. Some stores even have drive-thru windows. You need a gallon of milk and some hamburger buns? Don't even get out of the car.
<P>
The result: Sales since 1987 have jumped about 309 percent despite the fact that the number of Sheetz stores has only increased by 12. 
<P>
The Altoona-based company now employs 4,000 people, 3,400 of whom are full-time.
<P>
In October, Steve Sheetz handed over the presidency of the business to nephew Stanton R. Sheetz. Steve moved up to the position of chairman. He spoke with Executive Report Editor-in-Chief Jim Urban.
<P>

<P>
<b>Executive Report: Early in your tenure as president of Sheetz, sales were flat and customers were shopping elsewhere. Describe how you turned the business around.</b>
<P>
<b>Steve Sheetz:</b> We've got about 175 stores and our emphasis during the past seven years has shifted from number of stores to customer satisfaction. I'm sure a lot of people say that, but in 1988 we had 163 units. Today, seven years later, we are at 175, so we have only added 12 net units despite the fact that we've opened about 60 stores. We've sold several stores, replaced a bunch of stores and just flat-out closed several stores.
<P>
That all came about, I think, in about 1987, when our sales went flat and our customer counts were going backwards. We went from 1,400 customers a day to less than 1,300 a day. Our typical response was always to cut expenses, and at some point, we have  to build revenue. Quite honestly, we didn't know how to do that. All we knew how to do was cut expenses.
<P>
<b>ER: So what was the key step?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> We finally went back to base zero. My brother and I went down to Hagerstown, Md., and spent two days talking to customers -- Sheetz customers and non-Sheetz customers. We did about 40 interviews each to find out what the customers wanted. It's very simple -- in the end they wanted location, cleanliness, quality products, fast service and friendly people. From there, we went to all the stores, surveying over 1,000 people, who basically confirmed those top five items. We came back and just redesigned the whole business.
<P>
<b>ER: I guess there were some surprises?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> You talk about location? We thought we had location, but customers told us we didn't have enough parking, enough gas pumps. In terms of cleanliness, it meant much more than we ever thought. The buildings that had more lights appeared to the customer to be cleaner.
<P>
We always thought fast was getting them in and out in 90 seconds or two minutes. It wasn't that at all. They just wanted to make sure the people we had working were attentive to them and weren't talking on the phone or in the back. The customers didn't mind waiting if they knew we were working as hard as we could to service them.
<P>
We really redesigned the whole business. Although we've only added 12 net units from 1988 until now, sales have gone from $171 million to almost $700 million this year. It's really just giving the customers what they want, and putting in mechanisms to make sure we remain in touch with what the customers want.
<P>
<b>ER: You mentioned location. What else did you learn? Where there stores you thought were in prime locations that in actuality were not?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</B> A lot of what the customers told us dealt with capacity issues, and that forced us to close a lot of the stores that didn't have enough capacity,   parking, gas pumps and didn't have enough space to put more in. So what happened was we had an ideal site that didn't have enough square footage. We either had to acquire neighboring property or close. I would say the capacity issue drove the closings more than anything else.
<P>
The other thing that hindered us was the fact that a lot of the early sites were chosen before self-service gas was legal. They were more neighborhood sites. We used to count rooftops. Then it changed to how many cars went by the location.
<P>
The other factor was the buildings we were in. People found them unattractive ... too cramped. All of those things pushed us toward a replacement mode as opposed to a growth mode. We started chasing customers, and the customer counts grew. From the point when we fell to below 1,300 customers a day in a store, we have now grown to 2,500 customers a day. We've just about doubled the number of customers since 1988.
<P>
<b>ER: Most of your family is involved in the business. How does everyone     get along?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> There's a whole bunch of family involved -- five brothers and a nephew. My brother Bob had it early. We bought him out, but he came back in 1986 in the new company. We established a structure in which his son -- my nephew Stan -- became president in October. I moved to chairman. My other brothers Charlie, Joe and Louie are all vice presidents, so there are lots of Sheetzes here.
<P>
We have open arguments, but we all vacation together. We sit down at Christmas dinner together. Last year at Thanksgiving, we had 50 people at my house. Everybody is amazed at how well we get along.
<P>
<b>ER: What about your children and your brothers' children? Are they involved?</b><P>
<b>SS:</b> We had to make a decision last year whether we indeed wanted to bring the next generation in. We figured the six of us get along so well, should we risk it? In the end, we decided to bring them in because we have a lot of talent in the second generation.
<P>
We basically went out and recruited them. Two of them came back this year. One is a Wharton School graduate who came back as director of personnel. The other has an MBA from Vanderbilt and will be a site selector in Pittsburgh.
<P>
<b>ER: Any reason to believe they won't get along?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> Our ideas are basically the same. We go over the same customer information, and people have different opinions, but when we come out of there, we are firmly galvanized around whatever we want to do. 
<P>
<b>ER: You talked earlier about pleasing the customer. Working at Sheetz is not very glamorous. How do you land loyal and hard-working employees who will give the customers what they want?</b> 
<P>
<b>SS:</b> It's not a glamorous job at all. That was one of the problems that we had. We had to change the attitude about the job and make sure that the job was fun. And talking with employees was one of these mechanisms that was part of redesigning the business. We found out that one of their biggest dislikes was working by themselves.
<P>
Part of our new structure was to design a store that was large enough and generated enough volume so     that you never worked by yourself.     We did that. 
<P>
<b>ER: What about attracting new hires?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> We increased staffing to try and build some fun into the job. That was fine for the people we have, but we also had to attract new people to this job that, as you say, is less than glamorous. One way was to offer more money than others in the service industry do, and then we had to advertise that. We had to market ourselves as the place that was paying more.
<P>
All the things we were doing to retain people were great, but we had a problem attracting good people. We even do a better job with management people now because we are out there recruiting them. We had to believe in ourselves that we had a good place to work before that could happen.
<P>
In the mid-1980s, we fell into that same circle that it wasn't a good job, that it wasn't a good place to work. I think we have worked hard to make it a fun place to work. 
<P>
<b>ER: It seems you turned things around when you stopped cutting on the expenditure side. Is that the way it really worked?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> For us, it's a much different business than it was. There still is the convenience store market where there is one person on duty and the store has low overhead. They'll continue to survive, but we've elected to go a different route. Many people say that we are no longer a convenience store. But we don't know what we are if we are not a convenience store. 
<P>
The spectrum of convenience store has really broadened. Right now, we feel really good about where we are headed. We are in a position now where we can open a good many stores. This year, we probably opened about 16. We geared up our real estate department to open 25 to 30 units a year. We don't want to become numbers-driven again, but we feel we can handle more stores.
<P>
We'll do that because we remain in touch with the customers. This year we conducted about 50,000 customer surveys, a minimum of 250 per store. Each store has its own report card. 
<P>
We are pushing farther south, down into Virginia. We are still opening stores in this area, but not probably pushing any farther west. We are pushing east.
<P>
<b>ER: How concerned were you during your down times of the 1980s?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> I was real concerned. I took over as president in 1984. The sales went in 1985. The customer counts went backwards in 1986, and it got worse in 1987. Each time, I cut ex-penses. I cut labor hours. I thought we were hitting bottom in terms of where we could go. We were still profitable, but only because we just kept cutting and cutting. There wasn't much left to cut, and I was deeply concerned about where we were heading.
<P>
That pressure pushed me away from the stores and made the situation worse. It was constant pressure: What am I going to do? I relied on past methods until I really went out and started talking to customers. That simple action of just walking out and talking to people pulled me away from the focus I was in. It revitalized me, and I realized there was a solution out there. We had to spend money, but it was worth it.  
<P>
<b>ER: So you advise others in business to avoid constantly worrying about the expenditure side?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> I was in the downward spiral focus. It's really the principle of assessing where you are now, where you want to be and how you will get there. To objectively assess where you are is the toughest part. I look back at the '80s and realize I didn't really do that until I went out and talked to the customers and employees. Until then, I was really assessing where we were based on my own mind. To me, it's assessing what the customers think about what you are delivering right now, and what the employees feel. Then, how are you going to get there, and that's the tough part -- setting the strategies.
<P>
It was fun when we went out and talked to customers and employees. And it's been fun these past seven years building what the customers and employees want. And we get to make money, too.  
<P>
<b>ER: You've entered some new horizons as far as convenience stores are concerned. Describe some of the new products or services.</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> We are trying Sheetza Pizza, which we will roll out company-wide. Our best response is in markets where there is not a lot of competition. 
<P>
We have several drive-thrus. One in Hollidaysburg in a neighborhood setting is doing extremely well. It is still in the experimental stage, but we are going to move forward with it.
<P>
Some customers thought they could only buy prepared food, but they can also get a gallon of milk through the window. We renamed it Easy Street. We've promoted the fact that you can get anything through the window, and that has really picked up business. That experiment continues. I think it will be successful.
<P>
For us, it means taking the property and being able to access more customers. We are not touching the parking at all. To me, we are getting other customers who want in and    out fast -- the same theory as the card-activated gas pumps.
<P>
Some people say to me, 'You're crazy. You want the people inside.' My response is that if you treat them right outside, they'll come back again another time and come inside.
<P>
<b>ER: Some of your other changes aren't very flashy, are they?</b>
<P>
<b>SS:</b> Some of the new things are not big items. In the '80s, we didn't even have restrooms for customers. As we talked to them about what they wanted, they asked for restrooms. We put in one toilet in a room that locked. They still weren't happy. The door was locked. They weren't sure if someone was in there. So now we have two stalls with the doors unlocked. They told us they had to wait, so now we have three stalls each for the men and women. That's really what it is all about.
<P>
In the old days, I would have said restrooms were too expensive. It costs money to put them in, to pay for paper, to keep them clean. But we kept at it until the customers were content. Otherwise, they aren't coming back.

<P align=center><B><font size=+2>Lighting It Up
</font><br>
<font size=+1>FORE Systems Shows Strong Earnings and a Solid <BR>
Strategy for the Future
</font><BR>
<i>By Doug Thomas
</i></b>

<HR>

<P>

Strong earnings are no surprise when its comes to FORE Systems, but the Warrendale company continues to turn heads. FORE, the worldwide leader in local area networking products based on asynchronous transfer mode technology, reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter ended   Sept. 30.
<P>
Earnings per share came in at 13 cents, based on revenues of $38.4 million. The earnings were 2 cents above the average analyst estimate of 11 cents per share. We attribute these healthy results to continued strong unit demand for Fore's switch ports and the company's determination to increase profitability.
<P>
The future looks good as FORE teams up with Premisys Communica-tions to sell Premisys' access products as part of a planned line of Fore Systems' ATM access products. Fore hopes the combined effort will facilitate integration of ATM networks.
<P>
Earlier in the month, Fore successfully completed a 4 million share secondary offering that netted approximately $130 million. Proceeds from the offering will be used for general corporate purposes and for the potential purchase of complementary businesses, products or technologies.
<P>
The better-than-expected earnings, the new deal with Premisys and the recent completion of the company's secondary offering propelled Fore shares to a 52-week high of 57 1/4 on Oct. 31, up from 36 1/2 per share on Oct. 13.
<P>
On the subject of stock offerings, Pittsburgh will become the home to yet another public company spinning out of Carnegie Mellon University. The Carnegie Group, a technology company that has been compared to the likes of Fore, develops knowledge-intensive software products that continually adapt as new data is added. The software is custom-designed for clients to integrate advance software technologies -- including knowledge-based systems and advanced graphical user interfaces -- with existing infrastructures.
<P>
Carnegie's current clientele in-cludes the U.S. Army, BellSouth Tele-communications, Ford Motor Co. and Caterpillar Inc. The company is listed on the NASDAQ ex-change under the symbol CGIX. 
<P>

<B>Around the Index</B>
<P>
    For the four weeks ended Oct. 13, the  ER Index was unable to recover from the late September market decline, finishing down 2.24 percent for the month  as compared to a  0.20 percent increase for the S&P 500. Since inception, the ER Index still maintains the lead with a 27.51 percent return, as compared to a return of 26.73 percent for the S&P 500.
<P>
	This month, Westinghouse and Southwest National Corp. replace Black Box and Integra Financial on the ER Index.
<P>
Most of us know the Westinghouse story: It manufactures and sells electronics equipment and components and operates broadcasting and cable television systems. In a move to expand its broadcasting business, Westing-house recently bid to acquire CBS. On Sept. 13, Westinghouse finalized its $7.5 billion loan for the $5.4 billion purchase after signing with a syndicate of 50 banks led by Chemical Bank and J.P. Morgan & Co. The acquisition is slated for completion by the end of 1995. Additionally this month, the company reached a settlement with the Philippine government that ends litigation over safety at the nonoperational Bataan Power Plant built by Westinghouse in 1985. Settlement of the suit lifts the Philippine ban on Westinghouse products and opens a market the company hopes to tap. Shares of Westinghouse ended the month up 1.72 percent to 14 3/4. 
<P>
	Southwest National Corp., headquartered in Greensburg and the parent company of Southwest Bank, reported an earnings-per-share increase of  4.4 percent to 75 cents in the quarter ended Sept. 30. These results reflect the improvement in loan growth and a decrease in net loan charge-offs. Southwest National shares increased slightly to 32 1/4.
<P>
	Another of note was Alcoa, which announced better-than-expected earnings for its third quarter. Profits from operations increased to $231.8 million, or $1.30 per share, on a 27 percent increase in revenue to $3.33 billion. That compares to net income of  $70.1 million, or 39 cents per share,  in the year-earlier quarter. Shares of Alcoa fell 8.63 percent in the  month to 51 5/8

<font size=+1>Rookie Legislators Get Taste of Political<br>                    Reality During First Year in State Capitol                 

</font><BR>
<i>By Jim Strader
</i>

<HR>

<P>

As rookie players in the old game of Pennsylvania politics, new lawmakers from the Pittsburgh region took to the field in Harrisburg this past year with enthusiasm and an eye on the pennant. But most of the legislators elected in southwestern Pennsylvania last fall are Democrats who entered the game with an unexpected disadvantage: For the first time in a dozen years, Republicans are making the rules.
<P>
For Rep. Harry Readshaw -- who is new not only to the General Assembly but to politics as well -- the lessons started early.
<P>
"You have to get here and become extremely active quickly to adapt and understand the system -- and by the system, I mean Harrisburg," says Readshaw, a Democrat from Pleasant Hills. "When you arrive in Harrisburg, the name of the game is politics and you have to be able to deal with that."
<P>
Dealing with political realities does not mean compromising ideals, explains Readshaw, who says he came to the Capitol without obligations to anyone but his constituents.
<P>
"I'm a third-generation funeral director. My family has been in the business since 1912," Readshaw says.   "I didn't come to Harrisburg for a job; I came to do a job."
<P>
Readshaw's initial legislative effort was a bill to advance the date of Pennsylvania's presidential primary election, to give the state's voters a larger say in choosing the candidates. The bill lingered in committee for months, despite Readshaw's appeals to ruling Republicans to move the legislation. Just prior to summer recess, the bill made it to the House floor and passed.
<P>
"The only thing that annoyed me is that government could act a little quicker than it does," Readshaw says. "It's frustrating that you deal with issues, or you anticipate dealing with issues, and then they are put aside."
<P>
Rep. Christopher Sainato, elected to the state House after 10 years as a congressional aide, looked for small victories in his first year in Harrisburg. The Lawrence County Democrat pushed to have the toll on the Route 60 expressway lowered to fall in line     with the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The higher toll defeats attempts to use the road to foster economic development, Sainato says.
<P>
"As an economically depressed area, we have to try to use all of the tools that we can to try to attract business," he says.
<P>
"The people who need to use it every day can't afford to use it."
<P>
Turnpike officials rejected the idea, and Sainato will try to make the change legislatively. 
<P>
Sainato also supports the development of enterprise zones to encourage businesses to locate in areas like his district, which lost thousands of jobs a decade ago. Other business-friendly efforts undertaken to date, such as the lowering of corporate taxes, are helpful albeit small steps in what needs to be a bipartisan endeavor, he says.
<P>
"I believe that we have to work together, both as Democrats and Republicans, to try to do what's best for Pennsylvania, and my concern is western Pennsylvania," Sainato says.
<P>
The lone new senator from the area is Democrat Jack Wagner, a Pittsburgh city councilman before his election last year. Wagner finds "real joy and a challenge" in addressing the needs of 12 million people, rather than just 350,000 city residents.
<P>
In some areas, Wagner sees the opportunity to influence the national debate on issues such as welfare and education.  With the federal government shifting more responsibility to states, solutions that work in one state can be tried in others, he says.
<P>
The Ridge administration should be commended for encouraging the reuse of polluted industrial sites, Wagner says. That effort and the larger goal of making Pennsylvania more competitive must be supported by all agencies of state government and by local governments around the state,   he says.
<P>
Rep. Don Walko of Pittsburgh finds the Capitol a little bit like Broadway, a stimulating mix of the best and worst the state has to offer, from the occasional rough-and-tumble of politics to the often thoughtful consideration of issues by his colleagues."It's just a wonderful way to discuss issues and feel like you have a meaningful impact on people's lives," he says. "I'm really energized by it."
<P>
As a Democrat, Walko has felt the sting of politics by having one of his bills passed over in favor of a nearly identical GOP measure.
"That's part of the cost of being in the minority," he says.

<B><I><font size=+1>For State Schools, Attracting Top <br>Students Is a Never-Ending Battle
</font></I></B><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i></center>

<HR>

<P>

Bob Cook wanted his alma mater to offer an atmosphere similar to what his children experienced at the small, private colleges they attended. Luckily for Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Cook also had a few million dollars to throw around.
<P>
The 52-year-old entrepreneur and native of Altoona pledged $3.26 million to IUP, from which he graduated in 1964. The money will be used to create the Robert E. Cook Honors College, a tool the university thinks will help it lure top students out of high schools near and far.
<P>
For schools like IUP, tools such as an honors college are invaluable as the battle for top students wages on. The schools in the state system -- including IUP, Slippery Rock, California, Clarion and Edinboro -- compete with smaller, private schools whose huge endowments allow them to slash tuition costs and offer other incentives.
<P>
"Many of these students are attracted to private institutions," says Drew McGukin, acting associate vice president for academic affairs at California. "The private schools have flexibility with financing. They give these students reduced rates or even tuition waivers."
<P>
So the state schools fight back. California has had an honors program for about 10 years, annually admitting about 25 students whose SAT scores exceeded 1000. The program mixes disciplines, hopefully producing the science majors who also are strong writers and the English majors who are computer-savvy, McGukin says.
<P>
California is currently evaluating the admission criteria so it can include more nontraditional students, such as working parents who return to school, in the honors program.
<P>
The difference between IUP's and California's honors offerings are facilities and size. First-year students will be admitted to IUP's Cook Honors College next September, with full implementation of the college scheduled for the following academic year. Total enrollment will fall between 300 and 400 students, limiting each annual class to no more than 100 students. They will not only share classes, but also living quarters.
<P>
"I sent both my children to small, private colleges," Cook says. "I wanted to duplicate some of their programs at IUP. When I told administrators that, they said, It sounds like an honors college.' "
<P>
Cook is the former chairman and chief executive officer of Systems Center Inc. of Reston, Va., a leading developer of systems software that  supports IBM's Virtual Machine Operating System. He sold the business in 1993 for a reported $185 million.
<P>
The honors college will limit class sizes to 20 and feature selected professors. Each residence hall room will have a computer with access to IUP's library and the Internet. There's other good news: Honors college tuition will be the same as regular admission.
<P>
Cook's donation has been critical to IUP's chase of top students. Some other schools in the state system don't have the dollars to fund honors programs. An example is Slippery Rock, which resorts to other strategies. 
<P>
Slippery Rock added 35 new scholarships this fall. The school's President's Scholarship covers full tuition and targets students who rank first in their class following their junior year in high school. The school also strives to create an intimate learning environment, pushing professors into the classrooms and trimming class sizes.
<P>
"You won't find any larger lecture sections," says Duncan Sargent, director of admissions. "And you'll find faculty with Ph.D. degrees in their area of expertise. Those are academic types of things." 
<P>
The state schools will use whatever they can for an edge over competitors who try to land the same students. The state schools have one other selling point: They all charged $3,224 for the current school year, which, outside of the region's community colleges, is a bargain.

<B><font size=+2>The Taxman Cometh</font><br><font size=+1>Close a Profitable Year With<br>Strategies That Limit Tax Liability<br>
</font></B><i>By Henry Lipput</center></i><P>


<HR>

<P>

For Dave Herrmann, the best way to celebrate a profitable year at his small business is to limit Uncle Sam's cut. And at the fiscal year-end, that means purchasing equipment and employing other common strategies.
<P>
"We've mostly purchased office equipment: computers, software, printers, copy machines, some office furniture ... things like that," says Herrmann, president of Herrmann Associates, a manufacturer's agent for heating and ventilation equipment.
<P>
"This year coming up -- if we had a good year -- I'm going to use that money to invest in a new phone system."
<P>
Section 179 of the federal tax code allows small businesses to purchase up to $17,500 worth of equipment and receive a current deduction for that amount, instead of having to depreciate the assets over time. Companies can take possession of the equipment and not pay for it until the following year. 
<P>
"We suggest that every small company look at this," says Jeff Wlahofsky of the Pittsburgh accounting firm Schneider Downs. "That's a good planning technique for both a cash-basis and/or an accrual-basis taxpayer. Both of them can buy that equipment and take that deduction." 
<P>
The tax break was written by Congress specifically for small business, and it may become more lucrative since Congress is looking at raising the deductible limit for fixed assets from $17,500 to $37,500 per year. But year-end tax strategies don't stop there.
<P>
Pension plans, profit-sharing plans and 401(k) plans are also good year-end tax planning techniques if an employer is interested in providing these benefits to his employees.
<P>
"You can take a deduction for the amount of money that you're going to fund in that plan, but under the tax rules, you basically have nine and a half months to fund it," Wlahofsky says. "You can set up a plan before the end of the year, accrue the deduction, and then have until the extended due date of a tax return to actually make the payment into the plans.
<P>
"You can set up a plan, provide a benefit to yourself and your employees, and have a lot of time to raise the cash to fund it. In the meantime, you're saving tax dollars."
<P>
Herrmann's business, with a 401(k) profit-sharing plan, is one example. The employees choose how much they want to contribute, and the company kicks in an amount equal to  3 percent of their pay. "We do have the option of kicking additional money    in if we have an exceptional year," Herrmann says.
<P>
Some companies with accrual-basis bookkeeping also limit their tax liability by paying bonuses to their nonshareholder employees. 
<P>
"You can declare a bonus, accrue the deduction, but not pay it until March 15," Wlahofsky says.  "The employee doesn't pick it up in his income until 1996.  It's a win-win situation, but you have to be an accrual-basis taxpayer."
<P>
Tax planning this year will see some changes due to measures pushed through the 1995-96 state budget by Gov. Tom Ridge. The most noticeable change was a reduction of the corporate net income tax to 9.99 percent, retroactive to Jan. 1, 1995. But small businesses received a break in that they now can claim up to $1 million in net operating losses for previous years, up from $500,000. 
<P>
The state also increased the exemption from $75,000 to $100,000 for the capital stock and franchise tax, lessening the tax burden on small businesses.
<P>
"I think any small business should be thinking about tax planning at year-end," Wlahofsky says. "Basically, the rule of thumb is to defer income and accelerate expenses as best you can."

<b><font size =+1>A Young Plastic Surgeon Trolls for Economic Development</b></font><br>

<P>

<P>
Peter Johnson's life mimics his art -- or one of them anyway. A veteran fly fisherman, Johnson sends his line spinning out over the water, hoping to hook a big one. As head of the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative, his job is very similar.
<P>
Tissue engineering includes cell culturing, gene therapy, organ transplant and generation -- procedures that allow tissues to be grown outside the body, often from  minute particles of human tissue. Take the example of a child, burned over 98 percent of his body. If the skin had to be harvested from his own body, where would it come from? What if science could manufacture enough skin to cover the wounds from a piece that's one-tenth of 1 percent of body surface area?
<P>
With heady clinical and cost cutting potential, tissue replacement is an estimated $400 billion market.
<P>
Johnson's tissue engineering institute hopes to anchor the industry here in Pittsburgh. So Johnson, who models   his leadership on the Internet, which ignores traditional boundaries to build cooperation, has woven a web of 411 entrepreneurs, funding sources and university researchers in his computer. He meets with people, lists contacts, matches like interests. His objective? To bring one of Pittsburgh's finest and heretofore mostly untapped resources -- the biomedical research that goes  on in its universities -- from the lab to the marketplace.
<P>
Johnson believes it's high time that researchers (and the American economy) start profiting from and perpetuating their own science, instead of relying on federal funding to create technologies that other countries pick up and beat us with. 
<P>
"It became clear to me that tissue growth outside the body and implantation was going to have a major impact on the way we practice surgery, and actually reduce the cost of healthcare," says Johnson.
<P>
Currently, replacement tissues are harvested elsewhere on the body -- operations that are costly in dollars ($28 a minute for operating time, not including surgeon's fees), and taxing to  the patient's health.  These technologies eliminate both. 
<P>
"The problem was, how would you take something that was the scientific equivalent of a moonshot in its complexity, and bring together enough of a critical mass to make headway?" Johnson says.
<P>
Pittsburgh, Johnson thinks, has that critical mass. The labs at Pitt have strength in cell culture and transplantation. At Allegheny General Hospital's Allegheny Singer Research Institute, researchers work on mechanical systems supporting the growth of cells. CMU's dominance in computing, engineering and design completes the equation. In January 1994, these institutions jointly founded the Pittsburgh Tissue Engineering Initiative. 
<P>
"Pittsburgh has these huge piles of talent, but its weakness is we have few companies related to what they are doing, particularly at Pitt," says Johnson. "So we represent a region that is at high risk for losing talent to regions with the proper structure." 
<P>
A year ago, PTEI was endorsed by the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative as one of the five most promising ventures in the region. The Ben Franklin Partnership granted PTEI  $80,000 last year and $100,000 this year for seed grant programs. But the biggest indicator of its success? Since July 1995, five companies have formed or are coming to Pittsburgh from other places, due to Johnson's matchmaking.
<P>
"In every way possible, PTEI facilitated this," says Dr. Paul Kornblith, former director of UPMC/Brain Trauma Center who is president of Precision Therapeutics. His firm is developing a methodology and laboratory to test specific drugs on the cancer cells of patients outside their bodies, so there's no guessing involved with prescribing chemotherapies. PTEI helped access connections for technology transfer, funding, business and marketing training, even lab space. 
<P>
It's not Johnson's goal to spirit talent away from the universities, only to facilitate the technology's transfer to the commercial marketplace -- which can occur with or without the researcher. So he tries to hook entrepreneurs like the San Diego, Calif.-based Tulip Co., which manufactures instrumentation for procedures such as liposuction. They plan to start a company called CellSource in Pittsburgh at the beginning of 1996 to manufacture autologus (which means "from yourself") tissues like fat, collagen and fiber blast, working with scientists here.
<P>
"Pittsburgh has the science and wants the opportunity, and we want to do a co-venture," says John Johnson, president of the Tulip Co., who is particularly interested in manufacturing fat cells as therapy for incontinence, a problem that affects an estimated 18 million people nationwide. John Johnson says the company didn't even look for possible alliances on the West Coast, one of the two current hotbeds of biomed research. The other is the East Coast, where competition, not collaboration, between institutions is the norm. "There's an incredible willingness on the part of Peter Johnson -- he's a real futurist." 
<P>
Does Pittsburgh have the stuff to become the national hub for tissue engineering? "Not only do I think it's possible, but that it will be achieved," John Johnson says. 
<P>
In October of this year, SoloHill Labs, Inc. of Ann Arbor, Mich., also incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, SoloHill Therapeutics Inc., to work with researchers here. They will be based in Clairton.
<P>
"What I would see happen is that a large cluster of companies could be formed, the way they did it in Silicon Valley, creating such a competitive advantage that the companies all grow," says Peter Johnson.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Saxonburg's II-VI is No. 1 in ER's<br>6th Annual List of<br>Top 10 Growth Companies
</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i>
</CENTER>
<hr>

<P>


Some call it Two-Four. Others call it Eye-Eye-Vee-Eye.
<P>
To Carl Johnson, it's always been II-VI Inc. (say Two-Six), his Saxonburg-based company that develops optical and electro-optical components, devices and materials.
<P>
We won't butcher the name, but we are offering a new handle with a different numeral: No. 1.
<P>
II-VI, with a staggering growth rate of 62.36 percent over the past five years, heads Executive Report's sixth annual list of Top 10 growth companies in southwestern Pennsylvania. The Top 10, compiled by Parker/Hunter Inc., gauges public companies on the growth of their earnings per share over five years.
<P>
This year, the battle for No. 1 was no contest, as the growth rate posted by II-VI was nearly double that of    No. 2 Mylan Laboratories, whose growth rate of 33.46 percent was nothing to sneeze at.
<P>
II-VI takes its name from Groups II and VI of the periodic table where the elements zinc, cadmium, sulfur, selenium and tellurium are listed. II-VI uses those elements to make raw materials for its laser-related products. The company went public in October 1987, offering 924,000 shares at $6.50 apiece. The stock peaked in the first quarter of this year at $23.  
<P>
The CEO, Johnson (for more on him, see page 19), already was a stickler for quality. The public offering eight years ago only heightened the push for quality. Since then, II-VI has further entrenched itself as the leader in markets all over the world, 35 countries to be exact. Over 50 percent of its revenues are from overseas.
<P>
"Being a public company has been good for us," says Johnson, who founded II-VI in 1971 at the age of 29. "Before, we could sit back and say we were working for ourselves," Johnson says. "Once you are working for that investing public, everything changes."
<P>
II-VI's stock settled in at around $12 following a secondary offering in October, but the company looks positioned well. Its infrared products are used in high-power carbon dioxide lasers for industrial processing worldwide. Name an industry, chances are workers are using lasers. Garment makers cut fabric with lasers. The food industry uses them to etch dates and product codes in aluminum cans. 
<P>
Last December, II-VI acquired Virgo Optics, a division of Sandoz Chemicals Corp. that manufactures near infrared and visible light products used in industrial, scientific and medical instruments and solid-state yttrium aluminum garnet lasers. Francis J. Kramer, president and chief operating officer of II-VI, says the YAG lasers are likely a growth area through the year 2000. You know all those airbags that become standard on most vehicles in coming years? The airbag sensors and inflators are welded with YAG lasers.
<P>
II-VI will take its YAG products into the markets where it already has established presence. 
<P>
II-VI is also developing and     marketing solid-state x-ray and gamma-ray products for the nuclear radiation detection industry through its eV PRODUCTS division.
<P>
Lasers are popular because they produce cleaner, more intricate cuts than conventional machine tools. They also last longer and adapt more easily to changes in production. 
<P>
<B>The Line on II-VI Inc.</B>

Headquarters: Saxonburg
CEO: Carl J. Johnson
Listing: IIVI on NASDAQ
Primary industry: Optical and electro-optical components, devices and materials for precision use in infrared, near infrared, visible and x-ray/gamma-ray instruments and applications.
Five-year growth rate: 62.36 percent</pre>
<P><pre>
<B>No. 2: Mylan Laboratories Inc.</B>
<hr>
Headquarters: Pittsburgh
CEO: Milan Puskar
Listing: MYL on NYSE
Primary industry: Pharmaceuticals
Five-year growth rate: 33.46 percent</pre>
<P>Always a bridesmaid, never a bride. Mylan Laboratories comes in at No. 2 for the third consecutive year, cementing itself as one of the region's best stock buys despite its inability to crack the top spot.
<P>Give Mylan Labs credit for its consistent growth. And give Mylan Labs credit for being lean and mean. In its last fiscal year ended March 31, Mylan posted net earnings of $121 million on just $396 million in revenues.
<P>It only gets better. This fall, Mylan signed an agreement to acquire UDL Laboratories Inc., a leading supplier of unit dose generic pharmaceuticals to the institutional and long-term care markets. 
<P>"The addition of UDL will enable Mylan to better position itself with a more complete line of both solid and liquid pharmaceuticals in custom packaging for the retail, institutional and managed care markets," says Milan Puskar, chairman, CEO and president of Mylan.  "The addition of UDL to the Mylan Family,' blended with the two previous acquisitions of Dow Hickam Pharmaceuticals and Bertek, is representative of Mylan's strategic plan to continue its evolution into a fully integrated pharmaceutical company." 
Mylan is ranked No. 1 in total number of prescriptions dispensed among branded and generic companies in the United States, based on an IMS prescription audit conducted at the end of June 1995.

<B>No. 3: Kennametal Inc.</B>
<hr>
Headquarters: Latrobe
CEO: Robert L. McGeehan
Listing: KMT on NYSE
Primary industry: Industrial tools and tooling systems
Five-year growth rate: 33.17 percent</PRE>
<P>

Kennametal is a global leader in the development and manufacturing of industrial tools and tooling systems. About 80 percent of its sales traditionally are to the metalworking industries, with another 15 percent heading to mining and construction markets.
<P>
The Latrobe-based company    posted earnings per share of $2.58 in fiscal 1995, when Kennametal achieved record sales of $984 million, up             23 percent.
<P>
Much of the growth stemmed from Kennametal's alliance with Hertel AG, a German toolmaker in which Kennametal acquired an 81 percent interest in August 1993. Hertel definitely has been a catalyst for Kennametal, which is now entrenched in the European market and strengthening its position in the eastern part of Europe and the Pacific Rim.
<P>
Kennametal president and CEO Robert L. McGeehan says 1996 holds more potential growth. McGeehan says sales of metalcutting products in the United States should benefit from continued expansion of the U.S. economy, additional branch openings at J&L Industrial Supply and Kennametal's strategic marketing alliance with W.W. Grainger, the nation's largest industrial distributor of maintenance, repair and operating supplies. 
<P>
Overseas, sales in Europe and Asia should continue to benefit from the enhanced product offerings and technical expertise of Kennametal and Hertel in those regions. Sales of mining and construction tools should continue to increase from selected opportunities in existing markets and developing opportunities in China and Poland, McGeehan says.

<B>No. 4: Respironics Inc.</B>
<hr>
Headquarters: Murrysville
CEO: Dennis S. Meteny
Listing: RESP on NASDAQ
Primary industry: Patient ventilation products
Five-year growth rate: 27.08 percent</pre>
<P>

Respironics designs, develops, manufactures and sells respiratory medical products for use in the     home, hospitals and emergency care situations.
<P>
The Murrysville-based firm saw sales in fiscal 1995 -- which ended June 30 -- jump 27 percent to         $99.5 million, up from $78.2 million the year earlier. Included with that were        signs that growth was occurring in both established and emerging markets. International sales accounted for 20 percent of the growing sales base.
<P>
Shareholders had reason to smile when Respironics offered a 2-for-1 stock split in March. The good news continued days later when Respironics disclosed it would acquire Vitalog Monitoring Inc., a California-based designer and manufacturer of sleep monitoring and diagnostic equipment.
<P>
The transaction strengthened Respironics' position in the sleep disorder market. Respironics Vice President Robert Crouch says the rapidly increasing awareness of the harmful effects of sleep apnea was "the engine that drove our business in fiscal 1995."
<P>
The year's sales in that market sector rose more than 30 percent from "an already strong base," Crouch says.
<P>Respironics has several new products in the pipeline, slated for launch during fiscal 1996.

<B>No. 5: Industrial Scientific Corp.</B>
<hr>
Headquarters: Oakdale
CEO: Kent D. McElhattan
Listing: ISCX on NASDAQ
Primary industry: Products for detecting, measuring and monitoring gases
Five-year growth rate: 18.28 percent</PRE>
<P>

Industrial Scientific designs, manufactures and sells instruments and other technical products for detecting, measuring and monitoring a wide  variety of gases.
<P>
Its earnings through the first half of fiscal 1995 trailed the year earlier, but the company seemed positioned well to resume its growth pattern.
<P>
"Speaking generally, we decided to increase investments in people, equipment and technologies," says Kent D. McElhattan, president and CEO. "These calculated investments have reduced earnings in the short term, but will pay back in the near- and longer-term future. More specifically, staffing levels and project activity in technical research have been increased, resulting in 30 percent more new products in our development stream. 
<P>
"Secondly, field sales staffing was increased by more than 40 percent during the first quarter. This will broaden our base of customers and contribute to developing practical, useful products.  We project increased sales to begin after 8 to 12 months of investment into these new employees."
<P>
Industrial Scientific also purchased Monitor Group Inc., a developer of portable mass spectrometers for analytical determination of gases and liquids. Monitor pioneered and patented extensive developments that reduce the size and cost of mass spectrometers. Industrial Scientific expects sales to begin early next year.
<P>
The domestic demand for portable gas detection instruments will grow annually at a rate of up to 12 percent, and international markets offer opportunities for substantial growth.
<P>
Just this year, Industrial Scientific established a wholly owned sub- sidiary to better serve the Australian and Pacific Rim markets. By late summer, year-to-date international sales        were up 30 percent compared to the previous year.

<B>No. 6: PPG Industries Inc.</B>
<hr>
Headquarters: Pittsburgh
CEO: Jerry E. Dempsey
Listing: PPG on NYSE
Primary industry: Industrial coatings, glass, chemicals and finishes
Five-year growth rate: 16.59 percent</PRE>
<P>

PPG Industries, a member of the inaugural Top 10 in 1990, returns to the list after a four-year absence. PPG is a leading producer of industrial and specialty chemicals, coatings and resins, flat and fabricated glass, and continuous-strand fiber glass. 
<P>
A good investment? Standard & Poors thinks so. It praised PPG in August for PPG's enviable dividend record. PPG was included among a list of 58 companies that have paid a cash dividend for at least 50 consecutive years and increased payments annually for the last five years.
<P>
This year's third quarter was business as usual, with PPG's board declaring a dividend of 30 cents per share.
<P>
"PPG's dividends per share have grown by more than 11 percent since April 1994; dividend payments have increased every year since 1972, and dividends have been paid without interruption since 1899," CEO Jerry E. Dempsey says.
<P>
The company also posted record earnings through the first nine months. Net income was $606.4 million, or $2.97 a share, on sales of    $5.34 billion. That compared with 1994 net income of $363.6 million, or $1.71 a share, including a second-quarter after-tax charge of $51.9 million, or 24 cents a share.
<P>
Dempsey credits PPG's performance of late to diversity in the company's portfolio. For evidence, look at the numbers PPG is posting at a time when housing and auto production -- two industries that drive PPG's business -- are soft.
<P>
"We continue to achieve record results despite only modest economic growth," Dempsey says. "We are benefiting from ongoing strategies to capitalize on our broad business mix and geographic diversification."

<HR>
Headquarters: Indiana, Pa.
CEO: Robert D. Duggan
Listing: STBA on NASDAQ
Primary industry: Banking

Five-year growth rate: 15.37 percent</PRE>
<P>

S&T Bancorp repeats on the     Top 10, moving up one spot from No. 8 last year. S&T is a $1.3 billion bank-holding company whose principal subsidiary is S&T Bank, which operates   35 branches in Allegheny, Armstrong, Clearfield, Indiana, Jefferson and Westmoreland counties.
<P>
S&T has shown loan growth at a time when the economy is flat and interest rates have been volatile. Its nonperforming loans total only about 0.23 percent of total loans.
<P>
S&T also has shown a flare for the creative this year as it further cements its position in its regional market. For example, S&T rolled out a 401(k) service that included Fidelity Investors as investment manager and Benefits Services Corp. as record-keeper.  S&T can provide all the necessary components for a 401(k) retirement savings plan to businesses -- even those with as few as 25 employees.
<P>
S&T also partnered with Wal-Mart, placing a seven-day-a-week facility inside the Wal-Mart store in White Township. That S&T Bank branch is the bank's second to be located within a retail store. S&T Bank opened its first branch within a Kittanning supermarket in June 1992.
<P>
"The establishment of a branch within the Wal-Mart Supercenter as part of our branch network will help us to further establish ourselves as the service and convenience leader in the Indiana market area," S&T CEO Robert D. Duggan says.

<B>No. 8: Parkvale Financial Corp.</B>
<hr>
Headquarters: Monroeville
CEO: Robert J. McCarthy Jr.
Listing: PVSA on NASDAQ
Primary industry: Banking
Five-year growth rate: 14.94 percent</PRE>
<P>

Parkvale Financial Corp. makes the Top 10 for the second consecutive year, after placing No. 6 on last        year's list.
<P>
Parkvale Financial is the parent of Parkvale Savings Bank, which has 28 offices in greater Pittsburgh. At late summer, Parkvale held approximately $900 million in assets.
<P>
The numbers show why Parkvale is repeating on the Top 10: For the fiscal year ended June 30, 1995, net income increased 11.7 percent from $7.2 million or $2.59 per share in 1994 to $8.1 million or $2.93 per share in 1995.
<P>
Stockholders already know how well Parkvale is doing: Parkvale's board declared a 5-for-4 stock split of common stock in September. The stock split, combined with a quarterly dividend of 13 cents per share, increased the cash payout to stockholders by      25 percent.
<P>
The split represents the third stock split in three years with previous 5-for-4 splits paid in October 1994 and October 1993.
<P>
CEO Robert J. McCarthy Jr. says the continuing profitability of Parkvale Savings Bank and the appreciation in the corporation's common stock justified the stock split and the increase in the dividend payment.
<P>
If Parkvale is not acquired, expect the bank to continue strong growth in the wake of Integra's acquisition by National City. Parkvale is positioned well to pick up some business.

Primary industry: Banking
Five-year growth rate: 12.21 percent</PRE>
<P>

First Western Bancorp Inc. makes the Top 10 for the fourth consecutive year, including placing at the No. 9 spot last year. First Western is a multi-bank holding company based in New Castle, Lawrence County.
<P>
First Western is the parent of First Western Bank, N.A., a full-service bank; First Western Bank, F.S.B., a federal savings bank; First Western Trust Services Co., a full-service trust company and Residential Mortgage Co.     of America, a mortgage banking    company. 
<P>
The parent company has quietly acquired branches in new markets, allowing it to boost its total assets and customer base at the same time.
<P>
For the nine months ended Sept. 30, First Western earned $12.5 million or $2.40 per share, up slightly more than 6 percent from last year's nine month totals of $11.8 million or $2.26 per share. Shareholders were rewarded with a 3-for-2 stock split.
<P>
"Our record earnings to-date in 1995 reflect superior loan growth, better control of interest expense in the second and third quarters and continued excellent cost control," says Thomas J. O'Shane, president and CEO of First Western. "We are also very pleased with our sales of traditional banking products in our recently expanded northeastern Ohio market after the first quarter branch purchases." First Western's 42 community banking offices are located in seven Pennsylvania counties (Lawrence, Mercer, Beaver, Erie, Allegheny, Venango and Butler) and two Ohio counties (Ashtabula and Lake).  
<P>
At press time, total assets stood at about $1.66 billion, up 14 percent from the end of 1994.

<B>No. 10: Matthews International Corp.</B>
<hr>
Headquarters: Pittsburgh
CEO: David M. Kelly
Listing: MATW on NASDAQ
Primary industry: Custom-made I.D. products
Five-year growth rate: 12.17 percent</PRE>
<P>

Matthews International is a first-timer on the Top 10. The Pittsburgh firm designs, manufacturers and markets custom-made identification products.
<P>
The products include cast bronze memorials for use in cemeteries, printing plates and graphic services for the corrugated packaging industry, and marking equipment and consumables for identifying various consumer and industrial products and containers.
<P>
The interesting product is the bronze memorials: It sounds cold, but as long as people continue dying, Matthews will have steady business. 
<P>
The company recently had a change of leadership when David M. Kelly became Matthews' president and CEO Oct. 1. He succeeded the retired William M. Hauber, who remains chairman of the board. Kelly, 52, spent 22 years with Carrier Corp., where he most recently was in charge of worldwide operations for Carrier's Residential and Light Commercial businesses.

<P align=center><b><FONT SIZE=+2>These Rising Stars Came to the Fore in 1995  
</FONT><br>
<hr>
<P><B><font size =+2>
Dr. Suzanne Ildstad <br>    
 Director of the Division of Cellular Therapeutics<br>
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center<br></font></B>
<i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
</FONT>
<P>

Nestled among the numerous  photos on Dr. Suzanne Ildstad's desk is a microscopic shot of the insulin-    producing cell of a rat, securely implanted in a diabetic mouse.
<P>
Little wonder that Ildstad, director of cellular therapeutics at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, framed it. The acceptance of that cell by the mouse represents a milestone in her quest to transplant organs into humans without massive doses of anti-rejection drugs. It signifies that she's winning -- which could mean hope for thousands of patients suffering from diabetes, leukemia or other auto-immune diseases, even AIDS. 
<P>
"For even a perfectly compliant patient who takes the [anti-rejection] medicines every day, which is not easy, the chance of having a [transplanted] kidney function for 10 years is about one in five. And for hearts and lungs it's even less," Ilstad says.
<P>
Researchers have long believed that transplanting part of the donor's immune system to the patient would confer immunity to the donor's organ. 
<P>
"We began to look at what enables the stem cells to take without graft vs. host disease," says Ildstad. What they found, with the aid of an innovative technology called cell sorting, was a facilitator cell, which allows the stem cells to take. Stripping the T-cells out had also removed this cell -- because no one knew it was there. The facilitator cell has enabled many, many mice to have transplants. And this year, Ildstad and her lab team transferred the technique to human patients. The technique also mitigates the highly selective process of matching donors with needy patients.
<P>
"We have now treated five leukemia patients who conventionally have no match, and three of those five have had take of their bone marrow without graft vs. host disease," says Ildstad. 
<P>
     The procedure is also being tested to induce tolerance for liver transplants in six other patients, and the team has been given permission from West Penn Hospital to use it on patients with red blood cell disorders, like sickle cell anemia. With genetic diagnostic techniques, Ildstad hopes that in the future, patients diagnosed with diabetes could have insulin-producing islet cell transplants in the womb, when the bone marrow is developing, to eliminate diabetes.
<P>
One of the most controversial applications is transferring the bone marrow of a baboon, a species which is immune to AIDS, into a human. Cross-species transplantation, another focus of Ildstad's, creates what's called a chimera, from the mythical creature that was, in parts, goat, lion and snake.
<P>
Under intense scrutiny, the FDA last summer approved the operation, which was to be performed Nov. 1. But the patient, 37-year-old Jeff Getty, contracted pneumonia. Ildstad deemed the operation too risky. If cross species transplantation works, it could ease now critical donor shortages. (For caucasians, the chance of finding a suitable match is 30 percent; for people of color, less than 20 percent.)There have been other hitches in her research. Funding from the National Institutes of Health, which has supported the bulk of her research, is being cut. But she says her biggest disappointment is that her team     doesn't perform the clinical portion of their research at UPMC. The operations to date have been done by partnering with the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston, and the University of California, San Francisco, an arrangement that doesn't allow the team to follow patients daily.
<P>
"Dr. [Thomas E.] Starzl [director of UPMC's Transplantation Institute] has a different philosophy about Chimerism and tolerance, and we found we couldn't pursue our vision,  without his interference. And for that reason, we petitioned the University to be able to do them elsewhere, because other groups were very excited about our findings," says Ildstad.
<P>
Of course, a rising star like Ildstad has options, about which she will      only say that many are anxious to  make her lab the flagship of their   operation. But what a shame it  would be to have her shoot out of  our constellation.   <hr>                              

<P><B><font size =+2>II-VI Co-Founder<br> 
Carl Johnson is High Tech Smart and Business Savvy</font></b><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i>
<P>

Carl Johnson's early days as a 29-year-old entrepreneur were pretty simple: He had one partner, 13 investors, a head full of knowledge and a crystal ball that he says could only peer a few years into the future. So even though the potential for growth of his high tech business clearly existed, Johnson had no grandiose delusions about his start-up in the Butler County countryside.
<P>
"My crystal ball is good for about three years," Johnson says today at age 53. "I didn't think past three years. I figured if we survived those first three years, we would be OK."
<P>
He was quite right. Johnson's company, Saxonburg-based II-VI (pronounced Two-Six) Inc., grew from its modest beginnings to the present state as a market leader in the manufacturing of laser components and materials. The laser industry is hot today because lasers help users become more efficient. Lasers help a manufacturer, for instance, speed up production while improving precision.  
<P>
So maybe that crystal ball provided more foresight than Johnson lets on.
<P>
Look at the II-VI of today: It employs more than 200 people at its Saxonburg plant and several hundred more around the world. With II-VI products selling in 35 countries, the company is a benchmark for other companies in the region that are trying to tap the global marketplace. In fact, II-VI was overseas long before many other companies of comparable size even thought about foreign markets. II-VI used distributors in Japan in the early '80s. Today, it maintains a       manufacturing facility in Singapore, a direct sales office in Japan and a distributor in Europe.
<P>
And then there's the earnings.      II-VI went public in 1987, and this year is No. 1 in Executive Report's sixth annual listing of Top 10 growth companies (see page 26). At presstime, the jury was still out on the investment community's reception of a secondary stock offering in October, but the company seems positioned well for future growth.
<P>
About 50 percent of II-VI sales come from foreign markets, where the company is entrenched as a market leader in optics for carbon dioxide lasers. Within the past year, II-VI also paid $2.4 million for Virgo Optics, a Sandoz Chemicals subsidiary with expertise in optics for the higher powered yttrium aluminum garnet or YAG lasers. YAG lasers are becoming more popular because power levels are increasing as costs decrease. Johnson's next task is establishing itself in the growing YAG market on par with        II-VI's presence in the carbon dioxide laser market. 
<P>
Looking back, Johnson says it was a combination of the entrepreneurial bug and his research background that pushed him into starting II-VI. He earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Purdue, added a master's from Massachusetts Institute of Technology and earned his Ph.D. from Illinois. 
<P>
Just prior to II-VI, Johnson was director of research and development for Essex International Inc., an automotive electrical and power distribution products manufacturer. Johnson oversaw three of the company's research groups at Mellon Institute. 
<P>
He considered other positions before starting his own business.       The original start-up capital for II-VI totaled about $125,000. The original location isn't far from the present Saxonburg plant that is currently being expanded by about 30 percent.
<P>
And the trim Johnson, with slicked-back hair, is staying put.           He loves what he does. So when          investment bankers ask him about retiring or selling the company, Johnson laughs.
<P>
"We are having too much fun doing this," Johnson says. "There is enthusiasm. We know we have good opportunities, and we have the ability to step up and seize them."

S&T Bancorp Thriving in a Tumultuous Industry</font></b><br>
<i>By Christopher Lawton</i>
<P>

S&T Bank is a community bank that doesn't really act like one. And some might say that banking industry veteran Robert Duggan, the CEO of S&T's parent corporation, is a banker who doesn't act like one. After all, this guy likes to watch Indy car racing.
<P>
So much for the stuffy banker      stereotypes.
<P>
Duggan, the 62-year-old CEO of Indiana County-based S&T Bancorp, is anything but conservative. He has S&T speeding along during a tumultuous period in the banking industry when mergers and acquisitions are common and competition between the banks that remain is like never before.
<P>
The banking industry is especially interesting in western Pennsylvania, where banks large and small are jockeying for business created by Cleveland-based National City's acquisition of a Pittsburgh staple: Integra Financial. Conventional wisdom says many individuals or businesses from western Pennsylvania who previously dealt with Integra won't let a Cleveland-based bank handle their money.
<P>
If they don't, their choices will be Mellon, PNC or one of the smaller banks -- Duggan's S&T being one. S&T Bank operates 34 offices within the six counties of Allegheny, Armstrong, Clearfield, Indiana, Jefferson and Westmoreland. It offers customers -- both commercial and individual -- the same services that many of the region's larger banks offer. It even offers some new products that some competitors don't offer. 
<P>
One of these is a 401(k) product Duggan rolled out in August for companies with as few as 25 employees. The full-service package offers Fidelity Mutual Funds and provides employees and employers with documentation services, employee education, daily valuation and 24-hour toll-free telephone access. Plan participants also can use the expertise of S&T trust officers to help them design and customize their investment choices.
<P>
"This plan has all of the retirement savings benefits that larger companies have been able to offer their employees," Duggan says. "This can be a cost-effective way for businesses to provide state-of-the-art benefit plans to their employees by letting S&T take care of the day-to-day administration of the plan."
<P>
And S&T has shown innovation on other fronts, such as attracting the individual customers. In that battle, accessibility is a key because the customer's time is limited. S&T has been out front since 1992, when it opened a branch office in a Foodland supermarket in Kittanning. Late this past summer, S&T opened a branch in a new Wal-Mart in Indiana, enabling S&T to reach a multitude of new customers each week while providing greater convenience to existing customers.
<P>
"Wal-Mart has built a superstore, one of their traditional stores that also encompasses a complete grocery store, and right in front of the 38 registers is one of our offices," says Duggan. "This new branch will enable us to provide products and services to people whose banks may be closed when they're out shopping."
<P>
The bank has shown steady growth, repeating this year as one of the region's Top 10 growth companies (see page 29). In 1991, S&T Bancorp acquired nine offices of Vanguard Savings and four offices of Atlantic Financial. In the process, S&T Bancorp saw its assets portfolio jump to close to $1.4 billion dollars.
<P>
"We also began to realize that  we're competing more and more for customers with all the other larger banks such as Mellon and PNC," says Duggan, who joined S&T in 1981 after 21 years with the federal reserve. 
<P>
In October, S&T opened a branch in Greensburg to expand its presence there. 
<P>
Duggan, like many other banking industry executives, isn't sure how the new presence of National City will affect previous Integra customers. But he is quick to point to a recent survey which argues that 60 percent of a bank's customers usually remain with that bank after a merger. If that's true, National City only has to worry about the 40 percent of Integra's previous customers looking for a better way to save and invest their money. And it should probably worry about S&T Bank.

Through a Crucial Period</font></b><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i>
<P>

James Oliver Hunter was serving as associate dean at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law back in 1983. His colleague at the school was       Mark Nordenberg, a member of the law school faculty who eventually became dean and now is interim chancellor at Pitt.
<P>
You might also recognize the name of the fellow who was the law school dean and Hunter's boss at Pitt: John E. Murray Jr. Ring a bell?
<P>
A decade later, all three men have coincidentally taken similar paths. Nordenberg is drawing praise from Pitt faculty members while guiding the school through turbulent times as     Pitt trustees search for a successor to     J. Dennis O'Connor.
<P>
Murray left Pitt last decade for Duquesne University, a school he revived from near death and now has strongly positioned for the future.
<P>
Hunter's path has taken him to Point Park College, the downtown school that was staggered this past summer by budget shortfalls and fast-declining enrollment.
<P>
The school saw enrollment drop    8 percent last year, creating a budget deficit that forced Point Park to tap into its endowment.
<P>
Six months later after being named "president for an interim period," it's evident that the savvy Hunter has been anything but a caretaker at Point Park. He stopped the budget bleeding while bringing a personal touch to the 35-year-old college. 
<P>
To stem the enrollment drop, Hunter personally signed letters that were mailed last summer to part-time students who had not re-enrolled at the school. He told them why he was there and why they should return and join him. Many did. 
<P>
He also hand-delivers funding proposals to Pittsburgh foundations, getting in a handshake and smile so his proposal doesn't blend in with the rest.
<P>
It's all about marketing, the same type that has helped Murray succeed at Duquesne.
<P>
"I think the circumstances John Murray faced when he went to Duquesne were more severe than what I faced at Point Park College," Hunter says. "In just a couple years, John was able to help the institution focus on its mission and stabilize the institution. It's the same formula here at Point Park. We have stabilized the institution financially."

<P>But much work still lies ahead. Point Park, like most private schools, is more expensive than state-funded schools. So Hunter must still try to grow enrollment as the less-expensive competitors try to lure away the same prospective students Point Park seeks.
<P>
Hunter says the Ridge administration's commitment to financial aid programs for college students helps his position. He also points to several quality programs -- such as performing arts, journalism and business administration -- on which Point Park can hang its hat.
<P>
The performing arts programs draw students internationally. Perhaps the school's most famous graduate was a journalism major who went show biz: comedian/actor Dennis Miller, a former Saturday Night Live cast member who has hosted HBO comedy specials and played opposite Michael Douglas and Demi Moore in the film "Disclosure." Another Point Park graduate, Melina Kanakaredes, played a recurring role opposite Jimmy Smits last year in ABC's top-rated NYPD Blue.
<P>
Others who passed through Point Park have turned up both in front of the cameras and behind the scenes in Hollywood. 
<P>
"You can't sell from an empty wagon," Hunter says. "The product must be one you believe in. I have found quite a few of those at Point Park. I have the easy job."
<P>
The future holds some other factors that Hunter says will help Point Park grow. Most notably, the former Bank Center, which for years has been a shuttered eyesore on Wood Street, will reopen in 1997 as a library for the college and a new business branch of the venerable Carnegie Library.
<P>
Then there's Lazarus, the department store chain that will anchor a new store one block from Point Park's new library, likely spurring further growth on Wood Street and definitely increasing the traffic flow past the college.
<P>
A search committee has begun work on finding a permanent successor to J. Matthew Simon, and Hunter is likely to end up on the short list of candidates. He already has many faculty members in his corner. At the very least, he will run the college into the fall of this year. His track record shows he'll run it well. <hr>

<B><font size =+2>Joe Bartolacci Touches<BR> 
All the Bases As Thrift Drug's Chief Legal Counsel</font></B><br>
<i>By Colleen Anna</I>
<P>

It surprised Joe Bartolacci when an executive "headhunter" called him in 1992 to ask if he was interested in interviewing with Thrift Drug for a position as general counsel. After all, guiding the legal strategy for a $1.5 billion company seemed like an unrealistic career goal for someone with the experience of the 32-year-old Bartolacci.
<P>
But Bartolacci got the job.
<P>
Today, he supervises a seven-     person law department. He negotiates acquisitions. He charts strategies that help guard the chain's market share during healthcare's move to managed care. He also chooses outside counsel to handle matters that might end up in litigation. 
<P>
"I focus on strategic priorities," Bartolacci says. "Thrift Drug recently acquired 100 stores in North Carolina. For months, I was totally devoted to negotiating that deal.
<P>
"Much of my time is also spent in strategic meetings on everything from plans for the future to selecting outside counsel."
<P>
Bartolacci has a unique background, which helped him land the Thrift job. He graduated in 1982 with an accounting degree from St. Vincent College in Latrobe and worked as a certified public accountant with Touche Ross (now Deloitte & Touche). Then came law school at the University of Pittsburgh and some years with a downtown firm.
<P>
Bartolacci liked accounting, but law intrigued him because he loved     to debate. At the negotiating table,    that can be a deadly combination: A numbers-cruncher who likes to argue.
<P>
And as chief counsel at Thrift, Bartolacci uses all of his knowledge     of both accounting and law to         develop and implement corporate strategy. Because Thrift Drug is one      of the many companies touched           by the rapidly changing healthcare industry, part of Bartolacci's cor-  porate development strategy includes government relations and lobbying efforts directed to state and federal regulatory agencies and committees and pharmacy boards.
<P>
It's the side of law he rarely saw when he worked for a firm.
<P>
"Working as an in-house counsel allows me to really get to see the full impact of legal actions," Bartolacci says. "As an attorney working for a variety of clients, you are essentially advising and documenting legal transactions. Now, I get to understand the full implications of each legal action. I know the business and I know the people involved. I have an interesting perspective because my client is also my employer."
<P>
Bartolacci was born in Milan, Italy and came to the United States when he was 2 years old. He grew up in New Kensington, and except for living in Shadyside for a brief time, has lived there his entire life.
<P>
His schedule is often very full. In addition to working long hours in the office at RIDC Park, Bartolacci teaches classes at Robert Morris College in downtown Pittsburgh. 
<P>
"I first taught accounting at St. Vincent," Bartolacci says. "Teaching is something I really enjoy doing. I've taught at least one class on legal or tax issues every semester for years. Teaching and law have a lot in common; you have to enjoy telling what you know to an audience," Bartolacci says. 
Bartolacci has a lot to tell.

<B><font size =+2>Bob Cornell has Carved <BR>
Out His Niche With <BR>
Industrial Properties</font></b><br>
<i>By Colleen Anna</I>
<P>

Bob Cornell used to do what he does now, only for someone else. Now he does it for himself and his partners, and life at Pennsylvania Commercial Real Estate is great.
<P>
"Every real estate broker is an entrepreneur at heart," says the            44-year-old Cornell, who with several other brokers left Cushman & Wakefield in 1991 and started Penn-sylvania Commercial Real Estate.
<P>
"You start with nothing and generate sales," Cornell says. "Your success is directly related to your skill in putting the right people with the right properties."
<P>
Though the upheaval caused by top brokers leaving Cushman eventually led to the closing of the Pittsburgh office, Pennsylvania Commercial Real Estate continues to act as the regional representative for the national company. The main difference is that Cornell and his colleagues reap more benefits and have more individual control.  
<P>
And as one of the founding principals of the company, Cornell's deals have played a significant part in building the 4-year-old company into a major player in the regional real estate market. His niche is industrial properties.
<P>
"I understand the industrial real estate market," Cornell says. "I enjoy handling industrial properties. Industrial real estate demands that you focus on making the deal, not convincing someone that the property can be adjusted to meet specific needs."
<P>

<P>
Industrial real estate deals mostly pivot on successfully match-ing existing properties with clients. Since brokers are paid a percentage of property cost, the larger the deal, the better.
<P>
In the last few years, some significant properties have come on the market in the region. These properties have the larger square-footage and the amenities that manufacturers look for, 
<P>
such as loading docks, high ceilings, sprinkler systems and highway access.  Some of Cornell's recent deals include the 500,000 square-foot Peter J. Schmitt property in Youngstown, Ohio, which was recently purchased   by the May Co., the parent company   of Kaufmann's Department Stores. Cornell also brokered the 320,000 square-foot Charley Brothers warehouse in Greensburg, which was recently purchased by Parkway Food Services. 
<P>
Cornell can stay focused on industrial real estate partly because he can rely on the company's other brokers to handle areas outside of his expertise. That focus on industrial real estate has paid off for Cornell for the last three years, and he foresees continued success for at least another two or three years. Pittsburgh has ideal distribution location, located halfway between Chicago and New York. Overnight delivery runs of only 450 miles will reach 50 percent of the North American population.
<P>
"People are finally discovering Pittsburgh as a center for regional distribution," Cornell says. "It helps that the properties are available. We still lose business to places like Columbus, Ohio, and Harrisburg, but that is beginning to change."
<P>
The toughest part of his job, according to Cornell, is that sometimes he is the first to know that plants are closing and that workers will soon be out of their jobs.
<P>
"But I look at it this way. I have the opportunity and the responsibility       to find a new company to replace those jobs."

<B><font size=+2>Commitment to Quality
</font></B><br>
<B><font size =+1>Chamber Honors Firms Striving for World-Class Performance</font></b><br>

<i>By Shareen Berry</i>
<P>

Q-Net, part of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, started an awards program in 1993 to honor companies with methods in place to assure the quality of the goods and/or services they provide.
<P>
Q-Net was founded with the goal of making the Greater Pittsburgh area synonymous with world-class performance through the use of total quality processes.
<P>
The awards are a simplified version of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards, which have been presented annually by the Commerce Department since 1988. Winners of  the Baldrige and Pennsylvania    Quality Leadership awards are not     eligible for the Greater Pittsburgh  Total Quality Awards.
<P>
The awards competition is open to public or private organizations in Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Washington and Westmoreland counties. 
<P>
Evaluations were performed by an independent board of examiners composed of public and private sector quality experts. A panel of judges, with experience in quality and business management, made final recommendations. On-site visits were conducted for those who passed the initial screening. 
<P>
The criteria this year included leadership, human resource development and management, management of process quality, and customer focus and satisfaction.
<P>
Although no company received the "highest achievement" award, we did have several repeat winners along with some new faces, including a school district.
<P>
An award presentation took place in November. Here are the companies that were honored:
<pre>
<i><font size =+1>Honoree: Bell Atlantic Network Services -Western Area
Location: Pittsburgh
Primary industry: Communications
Award: Significant Progress</font></i></pre>
<P>
The regulatory climate of the communications world during the past decade has forced a major shift from a monopolistic environment to heated competition.
Bell Atlantic Network Services -     Western Area, which once had a stronghold on the market, had to improve its total quality in order to stay ahead. The company began to monitor its quality in 1989 by initiating the Philip Crosby-based management system. That changed in 1994, when Bell Atlantic Network Services - Western Area switched to a Baldrige-based management program with hopes of even higher quality.
<P>Bell Atlantic is being recognized for significant progress by the Greater Pittsburgh Total Quality Awards.
<P>"Bell Atlantic's purpose in applying for the Greater Pittsburgh Total Quality Award is to gain expert perspective on how we can improve services to our customers," says Tim Richards, Bell Atlantic's vice president for network operations.
<P>The Network Services - Western Area is one of seven districts in the Keystone Region of Bell Atlantic. The region encompasses 984,648 residential lines and 433,036 business lines spanning from downtown Pittsburgh, west to the Ohio state line, north to Sharon, east to Indiana and south to the West Virginia state line.<P> <pre>
<i><font size =+1>Honoree: Development Dimensions International
Location: Bridgeville 
Primary industry: Human resources consulting 
Award: Significant Progress</font></i></pre>
<P>
Development Dimensions Inter-national helps organizations succeed by creating empowered, high-involvement work forces. Its clients number 12,000 worldwide, including 400 of the Fortune 500 companies.
<P>Over the past 26 years, Bridgeville-based DDI has grown to include more than 75 offices and affiliates in 23 countries and over 1,000 employees.
DDI has been able to improve the quality of its services during growth by using a value-driven change process. Its Total Quality Steering Committee -- which is made up of senior executives -- drives the continuous evaluation of all aspects of the firm. 
<P>Tangible results of the quality initiative include increased customer satisfaction and retention, better efficiency and reduced cycle time, high levels of employee satisfaction and outstanding financial and operational results.
DDI is being recognized for significant progress.
<P>"These achievements are the driving force behind DDI's outstanding customer satisfaction, improved processes, innovative products and remarkable corporate and financial growth," says William C. Byham, president and CEO of DDI. 
<P>More than 15 million people have been trained using DDI programs and materials, and DDI estimates that their newly acquired skills have influenced the work lives of more than 20 million employees.
<P><pre>
<I><font size =+1>Honoree: Mine Safety Appliances Co.,
 Safety Products Division
Location: Pittsburgh
Primary industry: Products for worker safety
Award: Significant Progress</font></i></pre>
<P>
Mine Safety Appliances Co. uses state-of-the-art technology to produce the highest quality materials and equipment used to make the workplaces more safe in a variety of industries.
<P>MSA combines this technological production with a program called Quality for a Safer Tomorrow. MSA is being honored for significant progress with its quality initiative.
<P>"Every auditing organization has helped us," says Thomas B. Hotopp, senior vice president and general manager of the safety products division. "We have been through the ISO 9001 and ISO 9002 processes, audits by many of our major customers, including Martin Marietta and others.  Each and every audit experience brings home several points that we recognize as opportunities for improvement." 
MSA designs and manufactures respirators, hard hats, protective clothing, hearing protectors, eye and face protectors, emergency care equipment, and over 4,000 other types of industrial equipment.  Each MSA product  must meet the requirements of individual governing agencies regulating that industry worldwide. 
<P><pre>
<I><font size =+1>Honoree: Green Tree Marriott
Location: Pittsburgh
Primary industry: Lodging/banquet
Award: Significant Progress</font></i></pre>
<P>Over 158,000 guests annually find a home away from home at the newly renovated Green Tree Marriott. Thousands more enter the hotel to dine or attend meetings, weddings or banquets. To ensure future visits from its customers, the hotel instituted a total quality management program to improve the rate of satisfaction.
<P>The hotel is being honored for making significant progress with its TQM program, which was designed   by the Green Tree Marriott's parent company, Pittsburgh-based Interstate Hotel Corp. 
<P>At the Greentree Marriott, management has increased customer satisfaction, improved operational efficiency and profits and increased market share. The TQM program is targeted at the hotel's staff of 360 people. It encourages the employees to increase enthusiasm and morale that, in turn, increases work production.
<P>"We have worked hard on Total Quality Management for a number of years now," says Ted Knighton, general manager. "We have found that the application format has helped us improve our results. " 
Although the Green Tree Marriott accommodates many overnight guests, it also provides service for more than 960 meetings, 70 weddings and  487,000 meals in its two restaurants, two lounges and 25,000 square feet of meeting space.
<P><pre>
<i><font size =+1>Honoree: Precise Technology 
Location: Pittsburgh
Primary industry: Custom injection molding
Award: Significant Progress</font></i></pre>
<P>Precise Technology is a custom injection molder that provides products and services to the packaging, healthcare and consumer markets. Its capabilities include product design, product engineering, mold building, injection molding and contract manufacturing.
<P>The key to its quality initiative is the ability of program team members to closely work with customers and achieve total quality. These program teams have representatives from every Precise function -- from engineering and mold making to production and quality control. The company is being honored for significant progress.
<P>"The experience has taught our organization more about the importance of quality in the workplace," says John Weeks, president and CEO. "By networking with other companies, this enables Precise to explore new ideas and methods that may improve the Precise Quality process." 
<P>Precise's headquarters, located in Pittsburgh, includes 25 corporate personnel, 62 plastic shop employees and 19 mold shop craftsmen. These employees, who average 18 years of service, constantly participate in updated training programs to preserve the corporation's high standards of operation.
<P><pre> 
<i><font size =+1>Honoree: Price Waterhouse
Location: Pittsburgh office
Primary industry: Accounting
Award: Significant Progress</font></i></pre>
<P>With a name like Price Water-house, some might say that quality is a foregone conclusion. But that doesn't stop the reputable Big Six accounting firm from constantly looking for improvement in the services it provides to clients.
<P>The 50,000 members of the Price Waterhouse staff, who work in 450 offices worldwide, accept total quality management as a business strategy for improvement on client consultation and operational strategy.
<P>"Achieving Total Quality is about continually improving," says James C. Stalder, managing partner in Pittsburgh. "We have applied for the Greater Pittsburgh Total Quality Awards each of the past three years. Without question, we have learned that no matter how good we get, there remains almost unlimited opportunity for incremental improvement."
<P>Last year, Price Waterhouse was the first accounting or law firm ever to be recognized by the Greater Pittsburgh Total Quality Awards. It was recognized for "Serious Commitment" to total quality, but moves up this year to "Significant Progress."
<P><pre>
<i><font size =+1>Honoree: Johnson & Higgins of Pa. Inc.
Location: Pittsburgh office
Primary industry: 
Insurance brokerage and benefits consulting
Award: Serious Commitment</font></i></pre>
<P>The insurance market is extremely competitive. Consequently, Johnson & Higgins must make a conscious effort to preserve its dominance among the top companies.
<P>J&H believes the key to success is in knowledgeable, dedicated employees who are able to thrive in the work environment the company provides. It is being honored for its serious commitment to total quality.
<P>"Quality is a never-ending process," says Roy T. Johnson, principal and senior vice president in Pittsburgh. "Johnson & Higgins is the one who reaps the benefits of providing a better quality work environment for all of its teammates."
<P>Johnson & Higgins was established in 1845 in New York.  Over the past 150 years it has opened 260 offices worldwide. As the largest privately held insurance brokerage and benefit consulting firm, it has exceeded $1 billion in revenues, posted five consecutive years of record growth in new business and maintained a solid record of client retention.
<P>J&H's Pittsburgh branch employs 123 people who assist clients in such brokerage and technical services as marketing, administration, loss control, claims management, actuarial consulting, risk management consulting, computerized risk information and employee benefit consulting and administration.
<P><pre> 
<i><font size =+1>Honoree: North Side Distribution Co.
Location: Pittsburgh
Primary Industry: Distribution/supply chain management
Award: Serious Commitment</font></i></pre>
<P>North Side Distribution Co. has a simple concept behind its total quality initiative: "Give the customer the lowest cost and best value."
NSD offers lower transportation rates, reduced administrative and operating costs, less traffic congestion at its centers and inventory management enhancements. It serves the nation's largest fast food chain: McDonald's.
<P>"This award provides important recognition for the work, dedication, and commitment of each North Side Distribution team member," says Edward Schreiber, general manager. "Their quality dedication to improving the work processes and company performance has brought us to a new level of operating excellence."
<P>North Side Distribution, a division of North Side Foods Corp., is an           8-year-old third-party redistribution organization that has managed to quickly grow in size and revenue. Last year alone, sales exceeded $6 million.
NSD works closely with 58 McDonald's vendors to supply the restaurant with paper, dry food, refrigerated food, frozen food and toys. In an effort to increase efficiency, NSD encourages the vendors to consolidate their products into one truck per restaurant. Its hub concept has been copied twice within the McDonald's family of suppliers.
<P>Early in 1992, NSD embarked on a journey toward improved quality by initiating a Crosby-based improvement process. NSD is being honored for a serious commitment to total quality.
<P><pre>
<i><font size =+1>Honoree: Pine-Richland School District
Location: Gibsonia
Primary industry: Education
Award: Serious Commitment</font></i></pre>
<P>The Pine-Richland School District believes that it is imperative to give children the opportunity to grow and flourish in an atmosphere geared towards quality education. The school district organized a Quality Steering Council to guide the district in the correct path toward total quality.
<P>The panel worked with curriculum, instruction, pupil services, management, personnel, support services and finances to form an integral program that offers the best caliber of education to the children. The district is being honored for making a serious commitment to total quality.
<P>"Our staff and community took a great leap of faith when we embarked on our training program and quality team approach to process improvement and problem solving," says George Szymanski, superintendent. 
<P>A two-day training session was developed during the summer of 1994 to help teachers, administrators and support staff to comprehend the importance of quality and process improvement.
<P>The Pine-Richland School District enrolls 2,539 students with enrollment increases each year of 150 students.

<font size =+1>The Significance of Marc Landing the Rite Aid Account Stretches Beyond Billings</font>
<i>By Richard Bierck</i></B>
<HR>
<P>

A full-sized canoe sits outside the office of Cliff Miller, an avid fisherman who also happens to be executive creative director of Ketchum Advertising. Above the canoe, covering a wall, is a huge photograph of a sylvan stretch of the upper Allegheny River.
<P>
Miller's visitors probably aren't completely surprised. They've already passed a Warhol-esque stack of more than a dozen wired televisions that leans like the Tower of Pisa and squawks a programmed stream of media consciousness like the Tower of Babble. Attentive visitors can hear the inane mutterings of that famous adman, Darren Stevens of "Bewitched."
<P>
And that's just the lobby of Ketchum's recently redecorated digs in PPG Place.
<P>
Across the Monongahela River, Marc Advertising is embarking on its own renovation, designed to make its Station Square offices conform with the agency's new team-oriented     structure. There are no canoes or river photos, but there is a diagram    describing Marc's new account       management structure hung proudly on a wall that likely will be torn down in the remodeling. 
<P>
CEO Tony Bucci touts the superiority of the new structure over more traditional setups. But Bucci is even prouder of another recent achievement: After an arduous and costly pitch last summer, Marc clinched the Rite Aid account -- a chunk of business that, according to Bucci, will escalate Marc's billings beyond those of any other agency in the Pittsburgh market.
<P>
After nailing the account in June, Marc promptly heralded itself as moving to the "top spot as the city's largest agency." It called the business of Camp Hill, Pa.-based Rite Aid "the largest ad account currently being handled by any Pittsburgh agency." Read that as a sinister grin aimed across the river at -- you guessed it -- Cliff Miller and his colleagues at venerable Ketchum.
<P>
At Ketchum, word of Marc's Rite Aid coup was about as welcome as a client at a creative brainstorming session. Executives at Ketchum, which for years enjoyed top billings, now insist that other gauges may be more indicative of an agency's size and clout.
<P>
"We've got 250 employees in this building," says Jim Ficco, president of Ketchum Pittsburgh, referring to the Pittsburgh headquarters of Ketchum Communications, a national company with international offices and affiliates. Marc has about 130 employees. Ficco's attitude is clear: We're still the straw that stirs the drink in Pittsburgh's advertising community.
<P>
Arguments aside, the talk of which agency is No. 1 in the Pittsburgh market has seemed to cloud one important footnote to Marc's landing of the Rite Aid account: Bringing a national account of that stature to Pittsburgh sure won't hurt the reputation of the collective creative talent here. That's why competitors were quick to offer pats on the back when Marc landed Rite Aid. Letters offering congratulations flowed in.
<P>
"They were excited for us," Bucci says. "There are very few agencies who could compete for that piece of business, and other agencies were glad to see a local agency bring it into town. There were agencies in other cities competing for it, so its coming here reinforces the level of advertising in Pittsburgh.
<P>
"There were only a few companies we didn't get a letter from,'' Bucci says.
<P>
<h2>The Billings Scoreboard</h2>
Do billings paint a true picture of an agency?
<P>
"Billings tell you absolutely nothing about what an advertising agency is worth," says Paul Alvarez, president, chairman and CEO of Ketchum Communications. "Billings [figures] are a reflection of media spending. But there are so many ways to get paid -- some agencies are paid by straight hourly rates."
<P>
Alvarez's disdain for his industry's tendency to play fast and loose with revenue figures is common -- most of the ad executives interviewed for this article expressed similar sentiments. The fact is, it is impossible to compare figures of volume and profitability with complete confidence. 
<P>
There are a number of reasons for this, the main one being that most, if not all, ad agencies are privately held companies, and they use varying methods to calculate size and revenue. Even when agencies' statements about their billings are accurate, this accuracy is relative. Agencies earn only a fraction of what they say they do, and that's when they're telling the truth.
<P>
Why? Because the industry has a standard practice of inflating revenues more than six-fold. Instead of reporting the actual amount of money that agencies collect from clients, they multiply their gross revenues by 6.667. This figure is known as "capitalized billings."
<P>
Agencies do this disingenuous, across-the-board tinkering to boost their revenues to a more impressive level, reminiscent of 10 to 15 years ago when they got a straight 15 percent commission on the dollar amount of the ads they placed. Since the early 1980s, margins have narrowed nationwide, making life tougher on ad folks.
<P>
With business dwindling, it's more necessary than ever for agencies to wear fiscal platform shoes to look lucrative so they can bag accounts.  Pittsburgh is no exception. It's survival of the fittest.
<P>
"The landscape is littered with agencies that have died," says advertising industry veteran John McGrath, a former media buyer for the nation's largest agency, Leo Burnett Co. of Chicago. McGrath, now a professor of marketing at the University of Pittsburgh at Johnstown, says agencies now live by the motto "Grow or die."
<P>
<h2>Who's on First?</h2>
Far and away the two biggest survivors in the shrinking Pittsburgh market are Marc and Ketchum. A CPA with a lot of time, and the agencies' full cooperation, could calculate which one is bigger in terms of gross revenues, but this would say nothing about profitability or solvency.
<P>
Marc reports 1994 capitalized billings of $80 million. Ketchum Pittsburgh claims $94 million. Aiming to top Ketchum's figure, Marc asserted last summer that the addition of  the Rite Aid account, "estimated to be worth $50 million in annual [capitalized] billings,"  would make Marc "the region's largest ad agency."
<P>
In September, the agency's revised figure for capitalized billings from the Rite Aid account was dropped to $40 million. Therefore, Marc's actual annual gross revenues from the account would be about $6 million, the quotient of $40 million divided by 6.667.
<P>
Though Marc and Ketchum may be close to the same size in capitalized billings, they are distinctly different in many other respects.
<P>
Founded 80 years ago, Ketchum has reigned supreme as the city's single shop of national renown, being the headquarters for Ketchum Commu-nications, the nation's 22nd largest advertising/public relations company. Clients of Ketchum Pittsburgh include PNC Corp. (Ketchum's first), PPG Industries, Eat'n Park, Heinz USA, the Pittsburgh Pirates, Westinghouse and Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania.
<P>
Marc, established in 1955, is   largely a retail agency, with clients including ServiceStar, Long John Silver's, Pearle Vision, DeBartolo Malls, HealthAmerica, the Pittsburgh Zoo and United Way.
<P>
In an interview this fall, Bucci downshifted briefly from the high-gear boasting he was doing last summer.
<P>
"The truth is, it isn't that important externally," Bucci says. "What's important for us, what has been an internal goal for us ... is that we have been growing so well. If we became  No. 1 because Ketchum lost $40 million, that would not be significant."
<P>
Because Ketchum already represents Thrift Drug, it didn't pitch the Rite Aid account. But if Ketchum had, it doubtless could have weathered the high costs involved if it had failed to get the business.
<P>
But if Marc had failed to land the account, the agency might have taken a big hit. In addition to countless hours of staff time spent on creative offerings for the review, Bucci says, Marc spent "well into six figures" on outside services, including production of costly television ads. Quips Bucci:  "You can't cross a ditch half at a time."
<P>
It paid off. Michael J. Foulkes, marketing director for Rite Aid, says Marc was selected over larger agencies for several reasons. 
<P>
"Marc, in terms of their overall package, was by far the best, and they had a strategic approach to our business and our situation," Foulkes says.
<P>
<h2>Swing, Batter</h2>

Although it seems not to have been a factor in winning the Rite Aid business, Marc's resources are basically local. Ketchum counts among their top strengths both national and international presence.
<P>
"Pittsburgh's not being the communications hub of the world means you don't look to Pittsburgh as the place where all the creative advertising standards are set,'' says Alvarez, a Greensburg native.
<P>
Ketchum executives pepper discussions about Ketchum Pittsburgh with references to Ketchum Com-munications' resources, which include offices in Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Francisco and Washington, plus international offices and affiliates.
<P>
But Ketchum Communications has, in some ways, been hampered from effectively pooling far-flung resources because the different offices have often worked independently. Alvarez says that there's an effort afoot to "to try to do a lot more sharing of talent between offices."
<P>
While Marc was retooling itself into client teams -- a scheme in which clients can communicate directly with virtually any member of the team serving them -- Ketchum was making some structural changes of its own. It was changing over from the traditional structure to an account planning approach which, like Marc's new structure, assigns teams to accounts. The account-planning approach is more linear and involves upper management in more matters than the traditional structure.
<P>
Ketchum's reconfiguration evidently sat well with Heinz USA, which awarded accounts for ketchup, steak sauce and its gravy products to Ketchum a year ago after parting company with Leo Burnett.
<P>
"We needed a different kind of agency with different kinds of skills," says Brian Ruder, president of Heinz USA Retail Products Group. "[Burnett] was looking for something like Nike or Nintendo, where you have one idea and advertise the heck out of it. We were looking for more guerrilla marketing for each of our businesses."
<P>

<h2>The Next Tier</h2>

<P>
Ketchum and Marc are not the only games in town, advertising-wise. But most, if not all, of Pittsburgh's other larger agencies are midsized -- a size that McGrath, the Pitt-Johnstown professor, says is a dangerous one.
<P>
"The midsized companies that cannot demonstrate that they're better than small shops will become extinct. Those that survive are the best of the best," says McGrath.
<P>
Some of the larger Pittsburgh agencies that trail Marc and Ketchum in capitalized billings survive by threading specialized expertise into market fissures. Others have undertaken mergers to consolidate the various types of experience needed to land, and maintain, targeted accounts.
<P>
It's a horse race for third place. In close contention are Hallmark-Tassone, whose merged components posted capitalized billings in 1994 totaling about $32 million; the St. George Group, which is reporting the same figure, and Blattner/Brunner, which posted capitalized billings of about $30 million last year.
<P>
A few weeks after the merger that created Hallmark/Tassone Inc. in December 1994, the newly formed company absorbed all six employees of the Van Dine Group. In March, the company added the four members of Point Communications. The result is an agency with about 60 employees, now housed in Gateway Center.
<P>
"This tripled Tassone Stevenson's size, essentially," says Tim Tassone, CEO of Hallmark/Tassone.
<P>
The goal of the merger was to get new business. In the short run, Tassone says, they lost some clients "who felt that we had become too big for them," including C&C Lumber and the Baierl Auto Group. "But since the merger, we've picked up Sani-Dairy of Johnstown and ATI."
<P>
This fall, Hallmark/Tassone signed the Pittsburgh Penguins and WQED.
<P>
Reporting the same amount in 1994 billings, the St. George Group handles highly visible clients such as Kennywood Corp. and the Italian Oven. Recently, the St. George Group has developed a marketing specialty in new product roll-outs -- advertising and testing consumer responses.
<P>
The agency used this technique for a new lens product of PPG Industries' Transitions Group, headquartered in Tampa, Fla. "We started work on it as a product that was being worked on by PPG, and we got in on the initial consumer design and testing,'' says George Garber, president.
<P>
The Transitions account is one of several recent additions that filled the void when Foodland left St. George. "Even with that occurring, we've had slight growth," says Garber.
<P>
Falling slightly behind in the race for third is Blattner/Brunner, with a client roster that includes the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Ladbroke Racing PA, Phipps Conservatory, Pittsburgh Paints and Mellon Retail Financial Services. The company also represents the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
<P>
The agency was formed in 1978 by CEO Joseph Blattner, who had another agency, and Michael J. Brunner, then one of Blattner's clients. Over the past five years, the agency has sought to increase its profile by plastering its self-moniker, "the killer B's," on billboards depicting two bees.
<P>
Blattner/Brunner has made a substantial investment in computer technology for market research and in developing interactive ad products. "That's the tail that's going to wag the dog," says Blattner.
<P>
Running slightly behind these three companies in reported 1994   capitalized billings, with $28 million,   is Burson-Marsteller Pittsburgh, the local office of Burson-Marsteller   Inter-national (owned by Young & Rubicam Inc.).
<P>
Clients of the Pittsburgh office include Federated Investors, Allegheny General Hospital, Cooper Industries, Gateway Center and, most recently, the Pittsburgh Foundation.
<P>
"We may have local billings of    $28 million, but we utilize worldwide offices extensively," says Laura Gongos, executive vice president and general manager, referring to the umbrella company's network of international offices that make Burson, like Ketchum, well positioned to expand and service clients outside the area. 
<P>
"The business available in Pittsburgh is shrinking and Pittsburgh agencies here are being forced to look outside this market," Gongos says, noting that 60 percent of the Pittsburgh office's business comes from outside the market.
<P>
And, like Ketchum, the agency is large enough, by virtue of its parent company, to avoid competition with small shops for small accounts. Gongos also stresses the resource of Young & Rubicam's massive electronic data base.
<P>
It's a plus. McGrath says that agencies belonging to multinational umbrella companies have the advantage of appealing to Fortune 500 companies seeking access in the expanding global consumer market.
<P>
"Advertising is a mature product, and we're in the mature stage of the life cycle. It's not rocket science anymore to create advertising. It now comes down to market share," he says.
<P>
McGrath says it is midsized agencies, with fewer than 50 employees, that face the ravages of underselling by small shops armed with what has become the nuclear weapon of Mom-and-Pop advertising: graphics software for personal computers. These programs enable the best of small shops and sole practitioners working out of their homes to produce quality work.
<P>
"They're stealing away work," says McGrath. "Many midsized agencies are too big to be efficient or local and too small to be international."
<P>

<h2>Deciding Factor</h2>

In Pittsburgh, 200 to 300 entities call themselves advertising agencies. Some are shops with less than five employees, and many others are individuals working at home and contracting out various services. 
<P>
To protect themselves from the competition from above and below, some firms have developed unusual niches to develop and hold specific clienteles.
<P>
One example is Krome Commu-nications Inc., which reports 1994 capitalized billings of $12 million.
<P>
Krome has a solid base of local clients that evidently prefer to work with an agency of comparable size. These include several community banks, accounting firms and the law firm of Dickie, McCamey & Chilcote.
<P>
Yet Krome competes with the likes of Ketchum, Marc and Burson-Marsteller for corporate business, too. Its corporate clients include Calgon Carbon, Allied Security and Bayer's industrial rubber products group. Krome vice president Bob Neville argues that agencies the size of his offer clients "a more direct relationship."
<P>
Despite what the agencies say is important in the market, clients themselves cast the most important votes each time they choose an agency based on their own business needs.

<i></i></B>
<hr>

<P>
Every time the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater faced its next challenge, managing director Steven Libman would pick up the telephone and fill   in Eugene Barone, the long-time chair of the Pittsburgh Ballet's board of directors.
<P>
Every time, Mr. Barone responded as if the world revolved around the  ballet.
<P>
"He made me feel like it was the most important part of his day, even though I knew that it wasn't," Libman says. "I knew when he hung up that he had more important matters, whether it be for Blue Cross or for another board he was on."
<P>
But that was classic Eugene Barone, constantly concerned about others. That's only one of the reasons why Mr. Barone's passing this fall was such a loss for the region he cherished.
<P>
Mr. Barone died suddenly Sept. 22 at his home in Rector, Westmoreland County. He was 61.
<P>
"He was a man of energy, commitment, inspiration and motivation," says William M. Lowry, who succeeded Barone as president and CEO of Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania.
<P>
Mr. Barone joined Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania in 1958 as a sales representative and quickly worked his way up through the company. He was named vice president of marketing in 1972 and became senior vice president in 1980.
<P>
After Mr. Barone became president and chief executive officer of Blue Cross in 1984, the healthcare insurer cemented its dominant position in    the western Pennsylvania marketplace. The company's revenues grew from $1.1 billion annually to $2.4 billion.
<P>
The Blue Cross board of directors elected Barone chairman of the    board, president and chief executive officer in 1992.
<P>
But Barone's hand was felt in more than the business side at Blue Cross. During his tenure, Blue Cross developed a number of successful programs aimed at providing affordable healthcare coverage to economically disadvantaged segments of the community.
<P>
The Caring Program for Children, which provides free healthcare coverage to children of low-income families, and Blue Cross' Special Care program, which provides coverage for the working uninsured, have served as models for other parts of the country. Both programs have been replicated in other parts of the country by a number of Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies.
<P>
In addition to his responsibilities with Blue Cross of Western Pennsyl-vania, Mr. Barone was appointed chairman of the board of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of the National Capital Area, Washington, D.C., in October 1993. He still held that position at the time of his death.
<P>
"He worked hard and motivated others to do the same," Lowry says. "He was generous with his time and was committed seven days a week to the corporation and the community."
<P>
Mr. Barone also was a strong supporter of the arts, evidenced by the five years during which he chaired the Pittsburgh Ballet board. Observers say Mr. Barone truly believed he must give back to the community and encouraged others to do the same.
<P>
"He would use the power of the chair effectively," Libman says. "When he would recruit someone to serve on the board, he would look them in the eye, and you could just sense the passion that he had for the job."
<P>
Mr. Barone was a native of Pittsburgh and earned his bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pittsburgh. He remained a passionate fan of University of Pittsburgh athletics, and also served on the school's board of trustees.
<P>Mr. Barone is survived by his wife, Janice; three children: Suzanne Barone of Bethesda, Md., Sandy Barone of Crofton, Md., and Sherry Javens of Monaca; five grandchildren; his mother, Frances Barone, and one sister, Dolores Chiocchi.
<P>

<B><P align=center><FONT SIZE=+2>What's in a Name?</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Corporate Sponsorship Goes Beyond What's in It for Me, <BR>
But That's Certainly Part of It</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Lydia Strohl</i></b>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE>
<HR>
<P>                                                        
It's hard, these days, to find something that's not commercial. Events, venues, interludes -- nothing, it seems, is logo free. The marketers of the world go to work every day and come up with more vehicles to brand with corporate image. 
<P>
Though much accused of being out of step with other areas of the country, Pittsburgh is no exception. The Thrift Drug Classic. IC Light Amphitheater. The Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheater. 
<P>
In fact, it might be said it started here: Andrew Carnegie begat a great tradition of philanthropy nationwide. Carnegie Mellon University. The Carnegie Library, Museum of Art, Science Center.  Carnegie, the Town of.
<P>
But in these days of corporate cost cutting and, more critically, in the wake of Pittsburgh's loss of several corporate headquarters, can sponsorship levels remain high?
<P>
Yes and no. Sponsorship, chosen correctly, can still pack amazing bang for the corporate buck. But sponsors, pressed with increasing requests, are becoming choosier. In response, entities seeking sponsorship are having to become more marketing driven, providing measurable results to would-be sponsors. And they're having to drive to more places, because smaller amounts from more corporations now make up the funding pot.
<P>

<h2>Bang for the Bucs</h2>

"We've played a big role in the community since 1889," says Jim Cameron, vice president of sales and marketing for Cameron Coca-Cola, which has named Star Lake Amphitheater after its brand and abundantly supports other local organizations, among them the Pirates and the Steelers. "We don't expect that just because we're involved, [the consumer] will go out and buy 10 cases of Coke. But we hope they will associate that involvement with us."
<P>
Still, Cameron is looking for more than a warm feeling when he chooses a   sponsorship.
<P>
"We look at what kind of visibility it can generate, and how we can take that visibility and translate it into     volume," says Cameron. "We try to make everything have a value, but it does get tough."
<P>
Cameron Coca-Cola, which works with both Steelers and Pirates, is currently running a picture of Steelers linebacker Greg Lloyd, along with a chance to order discounted Steeler merchandise, on the back of their 12-pack packaging. It's a service to Coca-Cola, to Cameron's customers and to the Steelers. The Steelers' Joe Gordon, director of communications, says it's more than a win-win situation.
<P>
"We win at least twice. There's a  visibility benefit, building and enhancing our fan base. We sell merchandise. And we win a third time, because we get the income from licensing and royalties," says Gordon.
<P>
Sports teams make good sense to Cameron, who says the vast majority of product relationships are made before age 18. Coca-Cola's target audience is ages 12 to 24. Due to Pitts-burgh's older demographic, Cameron must also appeal to other age groups. So he uses venues like the Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheater, with which the company just signed their second five-year contract to sponsor, and the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra.
<P>
"It's such an intangible," says Cameron. "We think the relationship the consumer has with these events  has a lot more credibility than straight    advertising."
<P>

<h2>Great Expectations</h2>

<P>
There are, however, great strides being made on both sides to define this intangible.
"The days of having to prove     neither your worth or your cause are gone," says Deb Magness, spokes-woman for Heinz USA., which gets more than 1,000 requests annually for everything from food donations to dollars. "Even the smallest request now says 'Here's my cause, please send me x dollars, and here's what I'll give you for funding me.' "
<P>
Magness says that's the beauty of Heinz Baby Foods' Miracle Labels for Kids programs, in which hospitals across the country motivate parents to collect labels from baby food jars and bring them to the hospital, which redeems them for six cents each. 
<P>
"It's really helped us assist hospitals, get our messages out and maintain brand loyalty over generations of infants," says Magness. "The hospitals realize they can generate dollars by promoting our product. But they're not just working on our behalf, because they realize they have something to say and they have parents walking through their doors to redeem those labels."
<P>
Since the program's inception 15 years ago, hospitals have collected approximately 60 million labels, for a collective $5 million. 
<P>
"We're willing to write out the check, but the hospital needs to        realize that work goes along with that," says Magness.
<P>
Forced to ante up, organizations are utilizing board members and hiring marketing professionals to help them suit up for the marketing games. 
<P>
"The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra is 100 years old and I don't go back that far, but I know that Carnegie and Heinz were involved," says Gideon Toeplitz, managing director of the PSO. "They decided Pittsburgh needed a symphony and raised the $2,000 they needed to start it that first year."
<P>
But in the past few years the symphony has had to develop a sophisticated sponsorship program to continue raising the $1.5 million (6.5 percent of their $23 million annual budget), for which they count on the corporate community. 
<P>
"We sit with corporations and say 'We are interested in satisfying your marketing needs.' Not just their phil-anthropic needs, but a deal that gives them visibility in the right time and  place," says Toeplitz. To that end, the symphony can offer any combination of a number of tools -- advertising in the program, direct mail, newspapers or radio, functions before and after the concert,  tickets, printed logos on tickets or ticket envelopes. The program, which Toeplitz says can apply to everyone from Heinz (which just wrote a $150,000 check for sponsorship of the PSO Pops on PBS) to the laundry down the street.
<P>
"We have developed a chart, and they must understand that if they pay for a hamburger they get a hamburger, and if they pay for a steak they get a steak," says Toeplitz. 
<P>
Their efforts have been sophisticated enough to garner a 10 percent increase in corporate funding each       of the past six years, increasing the    pot from $900,000 six years ago to   $1.2 million today. Generating even more will be an in-house closed circuit television system that will broadcast coming attractions and give credit to sponsors over monitors set up throughout the lobbies of Heinz Hall.
<P>
Television in Heinz Hall. Would Andrew Carnegie turn over in his grave?
<P>

<h2>Artist's Ethic?</h2>

<P>
Maybe not. Carnegie, above all else, was a consummate business man.
<P>
"We are in the entertainment business, and therefore are competing with the Steelers, the Pirates and Star Lake for the same dollars," Toeplitz says. "If you are going to sit there and say we are an artistic organization and therefore we shouldn't do that, you will go broke in a hurry. We use the same methods, within good taste. We know how far the lines go and are not close enough to define them."
<P>
Others, however, say the line        has moved.
<P>
"Certain sponsors have products they promote, a car, say, or a candy   bar, that's their livelihood. There was a time when museums had a lot of   trouble parking a [promotional] car in front of the museum. It was worrying. But that's changing," says Phillip M. Johnston, whose full title is the Henry J. Heinz II Director of the Carnegie Museum of Art. "There's a fairly fine line about how to promote or present a work of art, and we have to be sensitive about relationships with artists."
<P>
In 1994, the Carnegie Museum of Art depended on fund raising for $3.7 million of its $6.7 million operating budget, which includes the Andy Warhol Museum. 
<P>
This year, much of the fund raising and programming focus has been on the Carnegie International exhibit, which opens this month. Another Andrew Carnegie legacy, the Inter-national was first staged in 1896 at a cost of $7,000. To ensure its continuation in 1995, the Museum of Art had to raise $1.4 million. A third of that is income from the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust Endowment, and roughly another third is gifts from smaller funders, the Pennsylvania Council of the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts. But $600,000 of that came from one corporate sponsor, PNC Corp., in "unrestricted funds," that is, cash.
<P>

<h2>Funding Strength</h2>

"We need a strong community to create a strong business environment," says Susan Bohn, executive vice president for corporate development and communications at PNC. "We can't    be myopic. The heart is the people        in the community, and they need       the arts, quality health care and education ... there's a lot to be said for why people gravitate to a community and stay there."
<P>
The link with the Carnegie in its 100th year won't hurt PNC either.
<P>
"This is one of the top three major exhibits of art internationally, and     the top national exhibit," says Bohn.    "It can bring recognition to our headquarters city."
<P>
And, therefore, to PNC Corp. The Museum of Art's Johnston says that research done after the 1989 Impressionism exhibit at the museum showed that about 50 percent of the visitors recognized Ford as the sponsor of the exhibit.
<P>
PNC's commitment goes beyond that $600,000. To make the association, PNC paid Ketchum Advertising to create an advertising campaign. An internal video newsmagazine, also paid for by the bank, will reach 21,000 PNC employees in 30 states. Kiosks with brochures will be set up in the majority of PNC's 137 branches in 11 counties surrounding the Carnegie. And the Carnegie projects in excess of 100,000 visitors.
<P>
"A good corporate sponsor can bring many tools of promotion which we wouldn't have access to," says Johnston. "Through their employees, branches and clients, they can go beyond anything we could buy. And it reaches these people directly -- our promotion is through ads and membership."
<P>
Bohn says the bank knew that its sponsorship couldn't begin and end with money -- they rarely do.
<P>
"It's not enough just to give dollars, but you have to be willing to give time and energy," says Bohn. 
<P>
Corporate sponsorship often takes a number of forms in a company. The larger ones, like PNC and Heinz, have nonprofit foundations to channel  philanthropy. But sponsorships are also taken on by the marketing departments, and by individuals    who bring pet causes to their management. The question becomes how to allocate money.
<P>
"It's a tough call," says Rick Rehak, regional marketing manager for McDonald's. "It often gets down to our experience with similar opportunities. We get a lot of help from across the country; we all pool information."
<P>
McDonald's is involved with the Pirates, the Steelers, the Bills (Buffalo is in Rehak's region) and, nationally, with the NFL. They also support the activities of the Ronald McDonald house, for families of hospitalized children, and are just kicking off a scholarship program with Pitt. And, says Rehak, individual operators are getting involved in their own communities at their own discretion, and with their own cash.
<P>
Still, regionally, says Rehak, the promotions that have longevity and promise are those that can motivate volume, like the associations with sports teams. (McDonald's largest audience is young males.)
<P>

<h2>Heart Strings, or Purse Strings?</h2>

Which is why many nonprofits are packaging themselves with sports teams. And with the increased competition for funds and increasing costs, the sports teams are pushing themselves to bigger and better promotions. The Steelers realized a 30 to 35 percent increase in marketing revenue in the past off-season, according to Gordon, 10 to 12 percent of which was an increase in consumer promotions. The rest was attributable to higher prices the team was able to command after a successful season. But Gordon says that no matter how the Steelers play, sponsors are loyal -- because the fans are.
<P>
Visibility is key. Take, for example, Thrift Drug's sponsorship of the cycling race the Thrift Drug Classic. Five years ago, Thrift paid more than  $350,000 to establish the race and nab title sponsorship, effectively making certain that their name was synonymous with Pittsburgh's international cycling event. 
<P>
"The Thrift Drug Classic offered the opportunity to have the total title sponsorship at ground level," says Bob Dyer, manager of new store marketing and support for Thrift Drug. "And being a health and wellness company, it parallels the company's attributes."
<P>
Dyer says research shows that for every dollar they spend, they get three times that much in public relations, mentions in the media plus the attention of 350,000 spectators. But it's hard to gage.
<P>
"There's nothing tangible that you can put your finger on. It doesn't show up at the register," says Dyer. "We know that we have to get our name out there in front of the competition."
<P>
It is naive to believe that corporations engage in corporate sponsorships just because it's the right thing to do. Dyer acknowledges that were the event not named for the company, they would not be in it.
<P>

<h2>The Buc Stops Here</h2>

Perhaps the one case in which corporate sponsorship comes closest to charity is with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Pirates have 35 to 40 promotional games a year, making deals with corporations to sponsor giveaways to attract fans to the ballpark. The Pirates make no money on these deals, according to Mark Ferraco, sales manager, broadcasting and promotions, using them to bolster flagging attendance and create excitement. Both the Pirates and the Steelers get only the price of the tickets for the seats in the Stadium boxes -- out of  $53,000 per box the companies pay annually. The rest goes to the stadium authority. The real place corpo-rations support the Bucs is in their ownership.
<P>
"We're in a unique situation because the corporations in this       city show support by owning the     club and funding the losses," says  Steve Greenberg, Pirates' director of marketing.
<P>
Since 1985, a consortium including some of the city's largest companies and three private investors kept the team alive, until its recent proposed buyout by California newspaper heir Kevin McClatchy. Even in the proposed buyout, however, corporations are showing support. The H.J. Heinz Corporation pledged $5 million to McClatchy's effort, $1 million of which is chairman Tony O'Reilly's own money.
<P>
One can only assume Andrew Carnegie would have done the same.     Even in these days of change, being a good corporate citizen is just good business.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Why Marketing is Crucial to Attracting Business Here
</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Matthew Lucia
</i></b>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE><br>

Tony Crumbley earns a living trying to attract business to Charlotte, N.C. Ask him about his competition, and he reels off a list without even approaching the Mason-Dixon Line.
<P>
"Atlanta, Tampa, Jacksonville, Austin, Richmond, Norfolk ... maybe Nashville," says Crumbley, vice president of research for the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce. "I don't think we would include Pittsburgh as a   competitor."
<P>
Not many growth cities do, even though the Pittsburgh region offers several factors that would seem to place it in the same league. For one, Pittsburgh enjoys ideal geographical placement for product distribution. Overnight delivery runs of only 450 miles will reach 50 percent of the North American population.
<P>
The region also boasts a stable work force, which is evidenced by the high percentage of owner-occupied housing. Companies that locate here spend less time and money training workers than they do in cities of comparable size.
<P>
So why the dearth of economic development? Here's one theory: To land a fish, you first have to bait your hook. Some observers say this region does a poor job of marketing itself, that is, attracting fish in the first place. 
<P>
"The result is misconception," says Crumbley. "I always thought Pitts-burgh was a dirty old town. That perception is probably a very common perception.
<P>
"We thought it was the biggest joke in the world when Rand McNally ranked Pittsburgh as America's most liveable city. I later found out, only because I started asking, that Pitts-burgh has gone through a dramatic transition.
<P>
"I know now there is infrastructure in place," Crumbley says. "Strong arts. Strong cultural amenities. Strong parks. The steel industry is gone, but that was the negative thing that made it dirty. You haven't marketed what's really there now. You haven't moved people past the misconception of the dirty old steel town."
<P>
Even Penn's Southwest Asso-      ciation, the arm of the Allegheny Policy Council that is charged with attracting business, acknowledges that its own research shows that the perceptions of Pittsburgh vary dramatically between those already here and those the region would like to attract.
<P>
"Companies recently located and long-term, mainstay companies have fairly consistent and positive views of the region," says Bell Atlantic vice   president Thomas E. Richards, who chairs Penn's Southwest Competitive Study Commission.
<P>
"Companies with the least exposure to and least knowledge of the region provide the most consistent negative evaluations," Richards says.
<h2>To Market or Not</h2>

Much of the burden of attracting new business falls on Penn's Southwest Association. Penn's Southwest president Jay Aldridge favors the personal touch over multimedia bombardment. Penn's Southwest hasn't waged a       traditional marketing campaign in close to a decade. Instead, Aldridge markets the region at trade seminars here and abroad.
<P>
"We limit our advertisements," Aldridge says. "By focusing our energies on the personal, we find a much greater level of reception."
<P>
In personal meetings, Aldridge can attempt to reel candidates in. And to do that, Penn's Southwest often gets help from companies that already are located here.
<P>
"We base the marketing effort on company success stories," says Bell Atlantic's Richards. 
<P>
But others point out that you can't pitch a company that has no interest in listening in the first place. Thus, it's important to position Pittsburgh in a manner that makes people want to listen. And that returns us to the question of traditional marketing. How much? What type? What's the theme? What markets?
<P>

<h2>Another Approach</h2>

Crumbley of the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce says one key to marketing his region is the step before the personal contact - It helps if they come to you. He    doesn't see companies that would perceive Pittsburgh as a dirty town seeking it out as a place to locate.
<P>
"For some companies, it's a quality of life issue," Crumbley says. "We get companies coming to Charlotte from New York not because our labor is cheap, but because people will come to Charlotte to work for them. These companies from New York have trouble attracting workers because people don't want to live and work in New York."
<P>
So one key is positioning Pittsburgh as a place where outsiders would want to be. Ronnie Savion and her colleagues at Elias/Savion Advertising faced a similar challenge in developing a marketing program for the Greater Pittsburgh Convention & Visitors Bureaus (see ads on page 31).
<P>
The goal was to attract convention business and tourists. The campaign promoted the region in newspapers in cities including Baltimore, Buffalo and Cleveland, in national magazines such as Better Homes & Garden and Reader's Digest, and in trade publications such as Travel Weekly and Destination. The campaign also included outdoor billboards.
<P>
The ads were colorful and clean-looking, with messages that Pittsburgh was both an entertaining and relaxing place to live.
<P>
"Our challenge was to totally delete from people's minds what they knew about Pittsburgh," Savion says. "Then once you get them here, their whole mind changes once they come through the Fort Pitt Tunnels."
<P>
Does such a strategy work?
<P>
Ask Brent Fewell, an environmental engineer who works for the downtown law firm Doepken Keevican & Weiss. He had never visited Pittsburgh before he relocated here from North Carolina two years ago.
<P>
"Being from the south," Fewell recalls, "I heard a lot about the steel legacy, what a dirty city Pittsburgh    was at one time and how it had        been somewhat cleaned up.  But I   really had nothing to go on until I came here.
<P>
"My first time into the city was via the Fort Pitt Tunnel," Fewell says. "When I came out on the other side, it was actually breathtaking to see the city. My initial impression was, 'Wow, what a beautiful location.' "
<P>
Savion says it's best to save the skyline for the personal encounters. When used on promotional materials, one city's skyline looks just like the rest.  
<P>
"If I flashed brochures in front of you for Cleveland, Philadelphia and Baltimore, we'd all look alike. It blurs together," Savion says.
<h2>The Future</h2>

It is likely any regional campaign will be delayed until the state develops its new ad campaign.
<P>
That means Aldridge's personal approach to marketing will continue without much enhancement, and that is not necessarily bad.
<P>
"We have attracted over 200 firms to the region," Aldridge says. "We periodically hold roundtable discussions  as a follow-up courtesy to these businesses. By inviting candidate indus-tries to sit in on these discussions, we afford them an opportunity to talk to representatives from firms recently in their position.
<P>
"We expose them to our best form of marketing," Aldridge says, "which is the body of successful firms now operating out of the Pittsburgh area."
<P>
In Aldridge's corner is Con-   gressman Ron Klink, a Democrat from Westmoreland County, who thinks established business executives are the best messengers. But in the same breath, Klink chastises corporate    powers-that-be.
<P>"The responsibility of recruitment lies in the hands of the captains of southwestern Pennsylvania's successful companies," Klink says.  "Not only must a greater effort be made to convince existing companies to stay, but those who are familiar with Pittsburgh's amenities should be blaring trumpets to the corners of the world. It's time for the captains of industry  to speak up."

<FONT SIZE=+1>The Airport Corridor was Tight;  <BR>Now It is Loosening Up
</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Jim Urban
</i></b>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE><br>

Ted Brooks works out of two offices, each an equal distance from his suburban Pittsburgh home. So when clients want to meet with the Tucker Arensberg attorney, he often lets them choose the location: Tucker Arensberg's downtown office in PPG Place or the firm's suburban office along the airport corridor in Moon Township.
<P>
For the clients, the decision often is a no-brainer.
<P>
"Many would rather come to the Moon office," Brooks says. "There is not as much traffic, parking is not hard to find, nor is it as expensive as downtown. It's all about convenience."
<P>
For Brooks and many others, the airport corridor has become a prime place to conduct business. In fact, for a while it was downright difficult to find a substantial amount of office space in the corridor. Of a total 5 million square feet of office space in the airport corridor, only about 400,000 square feet were available at midyear, according to Gold & Co.'s second quarter report. That translated to a vacancy rate of about 8 percent, well below the region-wide vacancy rate of 15.9 percent and substantially lower than vacancy rates for Monroeville (21.7 percent), the North Hills (18.4 percent) and greater downtown Pittsburgh (20.9 percent).
<P>
It's exactly that kind of low vacancy rate that eventually will drive new development in a market. But in the airport corridor, it never quite reached the breaking point. Now it's headed the other way.
<P>
"We were close," says Jeff Schultz, vice president of Grubb & Ellis. "But now, you have a lot of space coming back on the market. It's moving back to a tenant's market. The tenants will be doing the deals they want to do."
<P>
Within several months, Schultz and other realtors see about 550,000 to 600,000 square feet of space hitting the airport corridor market, pushing the vacancy rate up as much as 10 percent to 18 percent. 
<P>
Roadway Package Systems, for example, is moving into its own facility and freeing up about 200,000 square feet. Add in another 100,000 square feet formerly filled by Legent Corp., which was acquired over the summer by Computer Associates. And brokers expect Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania eventually to vacate as much as 140,000 square feet as it consolidates in what is now the Lazurus store in downtown Pittsburgh. 
<P>
The significance for the airport corridor is that it likely will take about three to four years, brokers estimate, for the vacated space to be absorbed.  Lease rates -- now likely to drop a bit in the airport corridor -- at midyear ranged from $22.75 per square foot for prime space to $10.25 at the lower end. 
<P>
As for undeveloped tracts of land, they'll stay undeveloped for now unless potential tenants drive development by expressing willingness to lock themselves into long-term commitments.
<P>
Right now, few tenants are willing to do that, and brokers don't expect the atmosphere to change.
<P>
"You won't see any speculative development," says Jeremy Kronman of Gold & Co.
<P>

<h2>The Undeveloped Property</h2>

Even though speculative development won't occur, brokers say the fact that the market is not demanding development does not mean that undeveloped sites should sit untouched. In fact, steps that are taken now to make the sites more marketable could spur a variety of development in the near future.
<P>
Off the top of his head, Ron Tarquinio of Tarquin Realty can list undeveloped sites totaling 2,000 to 3,000 acres in the airport corridor. He says none of the sites are ready for development, and other brokers agree that there are some big problems with the undeveloped property in the corridor. Most notable is the fact that most property is sorely lacking when it comes to characteristics developers demand: basics like utilities, access and level ground.
<P>
"When the new airport terminal opened, there was so much hype," Tarquinio recalls. "There were people running around, looking at all the sites, without understanding all the principles."
<P>
But most of the better sites are  already developed. And before developers can hang structural steel or pour concrete at the sites that are left, they are looking at a lengthy process in mere site preparation. 
<P>
"There is a difference between having land available and having product available," says John Hoy, regional managing director for the Rubenstein Co., a Philadelphia-based developer. "In the airport corridor, there is lots of land and very little product. When I say product, what I mean is accessible according to national standards. 
<P>
"You can't tell a national firm, 'Take this two-lane road and turn right at Homer's barn," Hoy says. "That's not the kind of directions a national firm will listen to."
<P>
And reaching a potential site is only part of the problem. As Tarquinio points out, developers want sites that are ready for construction. Raw property won't cut the mustard because of the extra costs incurred in moving tons of earth.
<P>
Time plays into the decision, too. Most companies that would construct a large campus facility, for example, don't like to wait the extra six months to a year that it will take to have a raw site ready for construction.
<P>
Bayer is constructing an 80,000-square-foot headquarters in the airport corridor, but the site is Bayer's already established campus facility in Robinson Township. Many amenities are already in place, unlike undeveloped sites.
<P>
"You could be a year away from starting a construction project that will take 18 months to complete," says Schultz of Grubb & Ellis. "It's very difficult for these companies to plan that far ahead, with growth and those types of projections. RPS was an exception."
<P>
Yes, it was.
<P>
On Sept. 6, RPS cut the ribbon at its new 350,000-square-foot facility on a 115-acre hilltop site in Moon Township. The $40 million project included substantial excavation and took about two years to complete. But the tradeoff is that by the end of this year, RPS will have all its corporate  staff under one roof for the first time since 1988.
<P>

<h2>An Airport Corridor Plan</h2>

In addition to being a broker, Tarquin Realty's Tarquinio also serves on the Conference on Real Estate of Southwestern Pennsylvania, a group of real estate-based trade organizations with a common goal to create a regional marketing entity that will help drive economic development. CRE's initial project focuses on the airport corridor, which CRE members believe is decades away from extensive growth.
<P>
"It's going to take a while," says CRE member Elaine Kirsch, a self-employed appraiser. "It will take a lot of effort, both public and private. This is not something that will be done in six months. You are looking at a bunch of potential roadblocks."
<P>
Robert Ady, president of P.H.H. Fantus, the world's largest relocation firm, offered a grim outlook when he visited the region a month before the midfield terminal opened in September 1992. Ady didn't like the existing infrastructure. He didn't like the lack of vision. He didn't like the feuding between municipalities. He didn't like much at all.
<P>
Ady's message: Don't expect the billion-dollar midfield terminal to generate much economic development until things are in order.
<P>
Tarquinio and others believe it all starts with a plan for the airport corridor, where some communities want development and the enhanced tax base that comes with it. Others want to remain the sleepy communities they currently are. 
<P>
No problem, according to Tarquinio. The important thing is to find out who wants what and proceed accordingly.
<P>
"If you don't want any growth, that's fine," he says. "Don't put an interchange in. There is more than enough property elsewhere."
<P>
And once the planning is ironed out, the region can move ahead with adding the basics that developers want -- the interchanges off existing highways and the utility service. Some observers go as far as pushing for a beltway highway system, even though opponents argue a beltway is impossible because of Pittsburgh's terrain.
<P>
"There is a lot of infrastructure that has to happen," says Schultz of Grubb & Ellis.
<P>

<h2>Edge City?</h2>

As edge cities go, the airport corridor definitely qualifies as it currently stands. But don't be misled. As Tarquinio and his CRE colleagues point out, the corridor still has eons to go before it will be fully developed. 
<P>
And slow development has some advantages. For instance, developers of the airport corridor can learn from problems that have crept up in similar regions across the country. Edge cities are nothing new. Over the past 20 years, a large portion of commercial real estate investment and development occurred in the dozens of what ended up being suburban downtowns.
<P>
White Plains, N.Y., and Stamford, Conn., with high-density employment, retail and entertainment centers are prime examples in the Northeast. Both grew out of their close proximity to Manhattan.
<P>
Some other examples are Costa Mesa, Calif., Tysons Corner, Va., and Perimeter Center in Atlanta. They grew because of access to one or more highways, a regional shopping mall and high-end single-family housing. 
<P>
These suburban downtowns were praised for being newer, safer and closer to both executive and worker housing than traditional downtowns. Now, experts say, some suburban downtowns are struggling. Prime corporate tenants are moving out. Office buildings are slipping from Class A to Class B status, no matter what improvements the owners make. 
<P>
What's more, traffic congestion, high costs and crime -- which corporations thought they left downtown  -- migrated to the edge cities.
<P>
The Pittsburgh airport corridor won't have those kinds of worries for years. In fact, it probably won't ever have those kinds of worries unless residential development picks up soon. Residential development is the one thing that's sorely missing in some parts of the airport corridor.
<P>
"We have an edge city without the population, which is very weird," says Kronman of Gold & Co. "We have a ghost edge city."
<P>
The airport corridor's residential market competes with the region's other growth areas, such as Cranberry and Peters townships, but slow residential growth hasn't deterred retailers in the airport corridor. Just look at Sam's Club and Wal-Mart.
<P>
Some even expect retail ventures to drive residential development. Usually, it's the other way around.
<P>
"The expense of excavating land is very high," says Theresa Rooney, who handles retail clients for Gold. "A residential developer does not have the financial wherewithal to move ahead with a project. Sometimes, the big boys have to go first and then the residential will follow."
<P>
There's no argument from Lawrence Simpson, director of marketing for Johnson/Schmidt & Associates, an architectural firm located in Robinson Township that works extensively with retail developers. Simpson also is president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Association of Industrial and Office Properties.
<P>
"When these retailers cite facilities, they base it on things such as wealth creation and job generation," Simpson says. "I have to believe that these retail developers know what they are looking for. This development in the airport corridor is an acknowledgement that developers are getting the retail in place in anticipation of future growth."

</FONT SIZE><BR>
<i> By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher </i></b><P>


<P align=center><font size=+1><b>Gene Barone was the Last of a<br> 
Dying Breed: The CEO Who Cared</b></font>
<HR>

<P>
When the recently retired chairman of Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania passed away in late September, a chapter of this region's history closed. Gene Barone served in an era when the term CEO was synonymous with community and civic leader.
<P>
Not anymore. Today's and tomorrow's CEOs are slaves to their shareholders and sometimes to their customers. Unless their shareholders and customers are almost exclusively the citizens of the community in which their enterprises are located, today's CEOs cannot afford to spend significant time or money to further the community's interest.
<P>
As successful corporations expand both their shareholder and customer bases, in many ways their "community" becomes the world instead of their headquarters city. With ever-advancing communications technologies, CEOs can embrace the world. A decade ago, a CEO's reach was effectively limited to the city or, at best, the region in which his company was located.
<P>
By century's end, all CEOs will be citizens of Planet Earth, rather than the specific cities where their companies are headquartered. Their interests as well as their satellite operations will span the globe. To survive, let alone prosper, today's CEO must develop a globalized perspective. Of necessity, the world will become his oyster!
<P>
Because of the Pittsburgh region's pervasive parochialism, we effectively insulated ourselves from globalization's ever-tightening grip on a corporate leader's resources. We believed erroneously that somehow our CEOs would be different. We hoped that the core value system that distinguishes this area from all others would sustain the corporate leader's absolute commitment to his community. Our logic was flawed. We forgot that most of today's CEOs are not Pittsburghers. They are not imbued with Pittsburgh's notorious community spirit.
<P>
As the community leadership paradigms shifted throughout the nation, Pittsburgh remained on course. But, we haven't cultivated           a cadre of emerging leaders whose interests are vested in the region.       Our corporate leaders in general do not have understudies who are prepared to fill the leadership void when  it evolves. A narrowing pool of     emerging and potential leaders is increasingly evident.
<P>
Gene Barone was one of the few remaining corporate leaders who served both his community and his corporation well. Name a cause. During his 10-year tenure at the helm of Blue Cross, Gene Barone was there providing leadership, ideas and funding. To say goodbye to him was for me to say goodbye to a way of doing business in this region.
<P>
Gene built his career and his company's success on a simple value -- caring. He cared about his business and customers, but he also cared about his employees and his local community. When Gene Barone passed away, Pittsburgh lost its social conscience, but hopefully, it did not lose its capacity to care.
<P>
Like the program he conceived to provide desperately needed health insurance to this region's disadvantaged youth, Gene's life was a "Caring Program." Originating here, the Caring Program spread to 12 other markets throughout the nation.
<P>
Now Pittsburgh needs another caring program. This one should be targeted at opening leadership opportunities and building leadership capacity among those individuals whose vested interest is this community. To rely solely on the leadership models of our past is to guarantee that we will not have a future.
<P>
A community-minded CEO is a rare commodity these days, but community-minded people with leadership potential still proliferate here. Gene was a leader who cared. He proved that socially conscious corporate executives can be extremely successful. He broke the paradigm and established caring as a fundamental core value of effective leadership. Hopefully, this community will follow his example and nurture those, like him, who care.
<P>

<B><P align=center><font size=+2>Selling the Pirates
</font><BR>
<font size=+1>Is Baseball's Greed Helping to Keep the Pirates in Pittsburgh?
</font><BR>
<i> By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</i></b>

<HR>
<P>
Sometime this fall, it finally dawned on major league baseball's owners that it was in their best interest to do what they can to keep the Pirates right where they are.
<P>
Roadblocks to selling the team disappeared, and just before this magazine went to press, the major league owners gave their preliminary blessing to newspaper heir Kevin McClatchy's bid to buy the Bucs. McClatchy pledged to keep the team in Pittsburgh, provided the city did its part and built a new stadium.
<P>
But even if McClatchy was unsuccessful in closing the deal, and at press time the deal was still tentative, could the Pirates eventually move? I think not.
<P>
Thank Arlen Specter for timely politics, and thank that age-old human characteristic: greed. Those combined factors are helping to keep the Pirates in Pittsburgh
<P>
A little over four years ago, it was Specter - the Republican U.S. senator from Pennsylvania - who attacked the 73-year-old antitrust exemption enjoyed by major league baseball. At that time, Specter slammed owners in baseball and other team sports for their increasing move to cable and pay-per-view television programming. He argued that the pro teams did not deserve antitrust exemptions when they are depriving the public of basic sports viewing.
<P>
Specter renewed his threats to lead a charge against the exemption in late September should the Pirates leave Pittsburgh. 
<P>
"I think it's baseball's obligation to keep the Pirates in Pittsburgh," Specter says. "If they don't, if they're going to run it like any other business, I don't think they have standing to get an antitrust exemption." 
<P>
Right now, the antitrust exemption allows the teams to pool television receipts and to engage in other cooperative business efforts normally prohibited by the antitrust laws. In other words, it allows the owners to make more money than they would without the exemption.
<P>
The last thing the owners want is to lose that exemption. They would lose income. And losing the exemption is not that far-fetched a scenario.
<P>
Let's face facts: The owners don't have much public support right now, and neither do the players due to the strike-shortened 1994 season. Specter, a presidential candidate, would enjoy some nice public relations by leading a measure that decreased income for baseball owners. After all, the players lose, too. The less the owners make, the less the players make. Many baseball fans would love that.
<P>
And that would only be the first bit of financial fallout for the owners if they allow baseball to leave Pittsburgh. In the backs of the owners' minds is league expansion. Outside of McClatchy, the remaining bidders for the Pirates consist of groups that want to move the team to markets that are prime for expansion before the year 2000.
<P>
The owners, who decided last winter to expand the league, will be well served. They will extract an expansion            fee of $150 million or higher from the new teams.  
<P>
Two markets mentioned include northern Virginia and Orlando, Fla., where the Pirates could have been headed if and when McClatchy failed.
<P>
The owners likely could have tacked a transfer fee to any ownership group that tried to move the Pirates, but it would have been nothing approaching the expansion fees they could collect from those markets by awarding them an expansion franchise two or three years from now.
<P>
In the end, McClatchy was the owners' man because he wanted to keep the team here. No hassles. No lawsuits that are the inevitable when a group tries to move a team, but is blocked. Some owners still are stinging from the aborted move of the San Francisco Giants to Tampa in 1993. Florida investors sued the league and used the lawsuits as leverage to land an expansion team.
<P>
In the end, it doesn't make financial sense for the major league owners to permit the Pirates to leave Pittsburgh. Ironically, instead of a lack of money pushing the Pirates out of town, it is money that helped keep the Pirates here.
<P>
So just because Ted Turner pays Rafael Belliard millions to hit his weight and George Steinbren-ner finds some of his best talent in halfway houses, that does not mean that baseball's owners don't know what they are doing.
<P>
It just took them a little while to figure it out in the case of the Pirates.
<P>

<h2>Left Out</h2>
I was happy to see your report, "Competing for Cash" (September 1995), on the recent success being enjoyed by Pittsburgh educational institutions, which signals the continued vitality of the Pittsburgh region. Colleges and universities are indeed one of the chief factors in attracting business here, and it's wonderful to see our fellow institutions doing well.
<P>
However, there is a unique success story happening here at Pittsburgh's oldest private institution of higher education (and the country's third  oldest women's college), Chatham College, which your magazine completely missed.
<P>
Chatham's overall fund raising has increased 60 percent over the past two years, an unprecedented feat in our history. Contributions to our Alumnae Fund have increased 127 percent over the same period. Garnering nearly      $1 million in the past 18 months from local foundations for initiatives central to our programs has shown us that Pittsburgh has confidence in Chatham College. We are pleased to note as well that Chatham enrollment increased a robust 10 percent this year, after increasing 28 percent last year (triple the national rate for comparable colleges), another important sign of recent accomplishment.
<P>
Executive Report also failed to consider the percentage of alumni participation in fund raising, which, although not as immediately impressive as raw dollar figures, goes a long way toward predicting the future health of any college or university. Chatham, with a steady 37 percent of alumnae supporting the college through gifts in the past two years, is healthy indeed. This is the same measure by which foundations often decide to contribute larger gifts. By any measure, Chatham is a success story that must not be overlooked.

<h2>Clean Air Act</h2>

The Publisher's Note on the ozone issue (September 1995) was well-written and accurate, and I think it will be a major boost to awareness on the ozone issue. It also turns out to be very timely with all of the attention being paid to exceedences and the auto emissions issue, and will help remind everyone that the problem is both more serious and more complex than it might otherwise appear.
<P>
The Department of Environmen-tal Protection is getting ready to seek input on strategies for addressing the ozone "problem." I'm concerned that as a result of the exceedences over the summer, we are going to be portrayed as having a "problem" with ozone, when in fact high ozone levels have only occurred on a small number of days that already were considered unhealthy because of the heat.
<P>
Moreover, in order to address this "problem," it is going to be assumed that utilities, businesses and\or drivers need to do more on a year-round basis, even though we don't have any definitive evidence on how much of the problem is being caused by transported air, whether NOx or VOC reductions will help or hurt, etc.
<P>
We must make sure that the issue is examined in as comprehensive a fashion as possible.

<h2>Innovative Schools</h2>

I found Linda Dickerson's comments (August 1995 Publisher's Note) to be very insightful.
<P>
As a practicing superintendent, risk-taking is a way of life. Here at Latrobe, we are in the second of a three-year plan to implement technology as a tool to augment daily instruction. Our teachers selected software based on its alignment with our curriculum. The teachers are receiving comprehensive and sustained staff development in the use of hardware and software. This is a very expensive project, but we believe it is money    well spent. True education reform  must include some individualized instruction.
<P>
I could go into more detail, however I have another purpose for writing: Your comments aroused my   interest in your thoughts about choice and vouchers as promulgated by     Gov. Ridge.
<P>
My personal point of view is that fundamental change in schools must focus on three broad areas.
<OL>
<LI>We must lengthen the school day and increase the number of days students attend school so that we can provide additional time to cover the ever-expanding curriculum offerings.
<LI>Teachers must be given joint planning time to prepare for instruction and to develop performance assessment tasks.
<LI>We need to use technology to help to individualize instruction.
</OL>
With regard to the Governor's proposal, my concern is that it will do little to improve education and will expand the gap between the haves and the have-nots in our society. Further, the Governor's proposal exacerbates the equity funding issue.
<P>
On a larger scale, I, too, am concerned about the broader social implications resulting from the societal pressures. "The breakup of the family unit, a pervasive sense of hopelessness among disadvantaged populations of youth, exponential increases in teen pregnancies, and the emergence of burgeoning youth underclass" are all important problems that are difficult to solve. Without doubt, the status quo will not be an acceptable future course of action.

<b><P align=center><FONT SIZE=+2>A Second Look
</FONT SIZE><br>
<font size=+1>In Hindsight, This Political Advertising Guru Agrees <br>That There is a Need for a New Approach
</font><br>
 <i>By John Brabender
</b></i>

<HR>

<P>
It is November 1994, the day before Election Day. For a political media firm, this is one of the strangest days of the year. After spending six months working nonstop, addicted to caffeine, on a never-ending ride of daily tracking polls, there was absolutely nothing to be done. At this point, tomorrow's outcome could no longer be changed.
<P>
Tomorrow would certainly be a long and tense day. We are the media firm of record for eleven Republican candidates, nine of whom are in races considered a toss-up, including the campaign of Rick Santorum challenging U.S. Sen. Harris Wofford, possibly the most closely watched race in the country.
<P>
About the only thing left to do is return phone calls. There are a number of calls from various members of the press wanting to know where we will be on election night in case they need comment. I tell them I'd comment now: If our candidate wins, it was the result of brilliant advertising. If our candidate loses, it was because we had a poor candidate. Most of them quickly understand that this is simply consultant humor.
<P>
USA Today wants to know if I think James Carville, Harris Wofford's chief consultant, is washed up if Wofford loses. Commenting on the work of another consultant is difficult, particularly when it's possible the consultant will beat you the next day. I call USA Today back and tell them I think Carville is brilliant, and did an excellent job for Wofford. If Santorum wins tomorrow, I'll say what I really think.
<P>
Then I see "the" message. A reporter wants my comment regarding a full-page advertisement that will run in major newspapers across the country tomorrow, written and paid for by Ketchum Communications. In the ad, Ketchum loudly and proudly proclaims that "We Don't Do That Kind of Advertising."
<P>
Evidently, the copy makes clear that Ketchum does not and will not engage in the disgusting practice of political advertising. Furthermore, Ketchum will be leading the fight to save Americans from this relentless assault of vile, false and misleading advertising. 
<P>
It had been a few days since I had the opportunity to spin a good story, and this one is too attractive to pass up. How dare Ketchum attack my colleagues? After spending years honing my skills, taking on some of the most devious political consultants in the world, this would be easy.
<P>
Any good media consultant knows that the best way to spin a story is to change the focus. I must somehow make Ketchum the villain. I could say that if Ketchum had put this much ingenuity and creativeness into their client's work they might not have lost the Digital account. Or maybe I should simply point out Ketchum's hypocrisy in using a negative advertisement to criticize negative advertising. 
<P>
Then it happens. Every hired gun's nightmare. I hesitate. It would have been easy to conclude that it was fatigue from the long months of campaign battle, or simply pre-election jitters. But the truth of the matter is that I hesitate because I know Ketchum is right. For some time I had become increasingly disappointed at the win-at-all-costs, slash-and-burn, take-no-prisoners approach of many in my  profession.
<P>
Most campaigns start on the high road. But too often, when you're two weeks out and the polls show you five points down, what would have been a lie yesterday is easily justified as the truth today. This was best illustrated locally when the Wofford campaign aired a TV commercial with video footage seeming to show Rick Santorum supporting the idea of raising the age for Social Security to 70. Wofford also held a press conference declaring Santorum's plan "a slap in the face at World War II veterans."
<P>
What few knew then was that Wofford's consultants had deceptively edited the video, eliminating a critical part, where Santorum makes it clear that his plan would only affect Social Security recipients 50 years from now. Immediately after Wofford's ad aired,  Santorum dropped in the polls, only to recover when newspapers across the state wrote that the Wofford commercial was false and misleading.
<P>
It is time for a reform of political advertising. It is time voters know with confidence that the content of a political commercial is factually correct. 
<P>
As I sit in my office on election eve, I think it's fair to say that Ketchum is trying to exploit the present situation to receive some favorable ink. But if their efforts help raise the standards of political advertising, I applaud and thank them.

<h2>Property Assessments Revisited</h2>

So you think your real estate taxes are high? How about an assessment of $277,500? That's the latest assessment against the Sewickley home that Pittsburgh Penguins center Mario Lemieux purchased for $1.48 million in 1992.
<P>
Assessments typically amount to a quarter of the home's actual value. The assessment and respective millage rates then determine how much property tax the homeowner pays.
<P>
What's Lemieux paying for? The luxury of 11 bedrooms, eight bathrooms, six fireplaces and a three-car garage, all spread over 1.25 acres, according to Allegheny County assessment records.
<P>Some other assessments of note:
<UL>
<LI>Pirates president Mark Sauer's $920,000 home in Fox Chapel 
is assessed at $165,000. Assessors counted six bedrooms, six baths and a four-car garage, sitting on 6.7 acres. We hope the ceilings are high. Sauer has a 6-foot-7-inch son, Peter, who will play basketball for Stanford this season.
<LI>Steelers coach Bill Cowher also dropped anchor in Fox Chapel, paying $582,500 in 1992 for a four-bedroom home that is assessed at $135,000.
<LI>County Commissioner Tom Foerster still has his modest two-bedroom home in Pittsburgh. County records show no market value, but the assessed value is $17,375.

<h2>Building Up Cinema</h2>

Andrew Sproule remembers when Pittsburgh Filmmakers worked out of a hole in the wall on Craig Street, paying $70 in monthly rent to the University of Pittsburgh.
<P>
"We were sometimes looked down on because of the space we were in," says Sproule, the Filmmakers' director of public relations. "You never saw rodents, but you couldn't prove they hadn't been there the night before."
<P>
Well, only celluloid rodents would dare defile the Filmmakers' spanky new headquarters on Melwood Street in Oakland. The old digs had half the space of the new   facility, a former laboratory updated with $1 million given by various local foundations. The Filmmakers now boast new technology and spaces that the group hopes will continue to grow its educational programs in film and photography. The programs are linked with the likes of Pitt, Point Park, Carnegie Mellon, Carlow and Duquesne.
<P>
This semester's enrollment has already jumped, to 620 from 550 students last spring. But that's not unusual, according to director of education Brady Lewis, who says that enrollment has grown every year for the past 10 years. The new space, however, will allow the group to expand its class offerings by about 20 percent and add classes in hightech film editing on a newly purchased system.
<P>
"We had this 25-year-old arts organization that contuned to grow even though it was located in seriously distressed buildings," says Charlie Humphrey, executive director. "But our operations were largely self-sufficient: 83 percent of our budget was earned income."
<P>
In a world of arts organizations with their hands out, that looked good to funders, who anted up in style. Filmmakers plans to augment its traditional program at the downtown Fulton Theater with a "more artsy" cinema series in the new 110-seat screening room at the Melwood facility. The public will have their first chance to see the room during the Three Rivers Film Festival at the beginning of this month. Also planned are photography exhibits in an adjacent gallery.
<P>
"This will blow people away," says Sproule. "I believe we'll become as well known for our photography exhibits as for film."

<h2>Have Car, Will Travel</h2>

What's your most prized possession? Chances are it is parked in the garage.
<P>
A recent poll showed that 65 percent of Americans would rather forego romance than spend one day of the week without their car. The poll, sponsored by Enterprise Rent-a-Car, queried drivers on the importance of their car in daily life.
<P>
Sixty percent of those polled said they would rather disconnect their telephone than spend one day of the week minus a vehicle. Of the same sampling, 73 percent would skip their morning coffee and 71 percent not watch television for a weekend rather than lose access to the car for one day.
<P>
Enterprise, which has carved out a niche by picking up customers and delivering them to their rental car, estimates that drivers will spend nearly three years of their lives driving for business and personal reasons. More than a third of all drivers hate being without their vehicle so much that they purposely delay needed maintenance, the Enterprise poll showed.

<font size = +1>A New Bloomfield Restaurant Combines Neighborhood<BR> Grace With Atypically Classy Food
</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl
</I></B>
<HR>
<P>
Bloomfield is an area known for its spirit of community and vibrant main street. You can get a good meal, especially if what you want is a beer and a burger. But gastronomically, Bloomfield hasn't traversed much beyond that.
<P>
Now, there's a new kid classing up Liberty Avenue. Mojo Bay Bar and Bistro may look like the former Santucci's -- where this restaurant opened in July -- but look again. No, don't look at the decor. Look at the menu.
<P>
Start with the smoked salmon soup, served in a hollow loaf of Tuscan bread, piquant with dill. Though over-stocked with potatoes, its flavors are subtle and well combined, as are those of the steamed clams. In a sauce of garlic and white wine, this dish differentiates itself with the addition of spicy Italian sausage, parsley and diced tomatoes.
<P>
One of the house specialties is gourmet pizza, which co-owner Paul Pirollo advises has a beautiful dough. He should know -- he used to work at Abate, home of some of Pittsburgh's best pizza. The Margherita had sliced tomatoes, garlic and cheese, with fresh basil, in fact, fresh everything. And the dough was not thick or thin, just right, crusty and chewy in all the right places. 
<P>
The menu also features a variety of salads and sandwiches -- the fish sandwich, a holdover appropriately named for Ida Santucci, was a tail of cod, batter fried and served on a big, soft hoagie roll. The Portabella burger, a top seller, is a marinated and grilled cap on a whole wheat kaiser with bleu cheese.
<P>
Pastas are the high end of the menu, which tops out at $9.75. The crab linguini teams crab with portabella mushrooms and sun-dried tomatoes, over linguini in garlic and olive oil. The dish was well-rounded, with random, surprise bites of tomatoes and mushrooms. But the king of the table was the spinach ravioli: fresh ravioli stuffed with spinach and ricotta cheese, topped with grated parmesan and broiled with a brown butter sauce. The flavors melt in your mouth. All of the dishes were made of extremely fresh ingredients.
<P>
To accompany the meal, Mojo Bay has a short wine list, extremely palatable both in price and variety. A decent bottle of Rene Barbier, a Spanish table wine, is available for $11. The menu features 13 microbrews and an array of dessert coffees, all for under $4.
<P>
Unfortunately, there is a catch. It's not the food, which is outstanding, creative and due to expand with the planned purchase of a grill. It's not the service, which is friendly, interested and efficient. And it's not the prices, which are downright inexpensive.
<P>
But for now, all of this must be digested in an environment that is reminiscent of a hospital waiting room. Though a former bar, it is sterile and inexpensively furnished, without even the charm of a dive. At best, one might describe it as contemporary, due to a smattering of colorful graphic paintings. Unfortunately, Mojo Bay must retain Santucci's bar crowd to succeed, so the music is loud. We tuned it out with ravioli.
<P>
That's my advice -- get past it. Pirollo has plans. He and co-partners John Scott, also from Abate, and            Dr. Frank Santucci, son of the former owners, have done the obvious on a shoestring budget (they started up with $90,000, $60,000 of which went to buy the building), and that is, cook their hearts out. The menu was designed with Mike Loeffler, of Dingbats in Waterworks Mall. The 42-seat restaurant, with an additional 10 at the bar and a long function room downstairs, has potential. 
<P>
And the management is nothing if not eager. When he noticed that the nurses from nearby hospitals were walking past his $4.95 lunch specials (and I'm telling you, that cod sandwich could choke an alligator), Pirollo lowered them to $3.95. When his mother deemed the desserts too sweet, she made chocolate cake, rum cake and taramisu. When the wine we ordered was not in stock, they brought us a more expensive one at the same cost. Pirollo calls it "bull pen by committee. Everyone has a dish."
<P>
Even the name was decided democratically. "We didn't want anything ethnic, and we couldn't name it after one of us because then the other two would be mad," says Pirollo, who spent 10 years in the restaurant business in California, and wanted a name to evoke that environment. "It just came to me. And it's perfect, because it's vague, so we can be anything we want to be. We're California/Italian, but that's vague too -- pasta with anything you want on it."

<HR>

From his first solo venture, as a lawyer in Duquesne who kept office hours to capitalize on the mill workers' schedules, Edgar Snyder has realized the value of appealing to the needs of his customer. But it wasn't until 1982 that he placed his first ad, to please his wife Sandy, now his marketing guru. Thirteen years later, with tens of thousands of clients lured by his slogan -- "There is no fee unless we get money for you" -- the insurance companies must be wondering why one of their own gave him his first break. 
<P>
Advertising hasn't just changed him from a solo practitioner into  the CEO of a midsized, "quite profitable" company -- it's literally changed the man's life, making handing out autographs as routine as handing out business cards. Executive Report's Lydia Strohl talked to him in his Gulf Tower office.
<P>
<B>Executive Report: How long ago did you start practicing law?</B>
<P>
Edgar Snyder: I passed the bar examination in 1966 and opened an office in 1967. I practiced downtown working for a law firm, and opened up my own general practice in Duquesne, Pa. Duquesne at the time was a thriving steel community, and I used to keep my office open at the times people were coming out of the steel mill. So I was marketing myself with a sign in the window, and a light on, sitting at the door in case anybody needed a lawyer.  
<P>
<B>ER: Why Duquesne?</B>
<P>
ES: At the time, I was married to someone who had grown up in Duquesne, and I knew someone who would give me free office space in their insurance office. Plus, I believed that the best opportunity when I got out of law school to get business was in a community where there were not very many lawyers, and people themselves would not likely know lawyers. People who were hardworking, steel mill workers usually didn't have a lawyer unless they needed one, versus other areas where people had their own lawyers. Then I became a public defender in the late '60s, strictly criminal work. 
<P>
<B>ER: Why did you begin advertising?</B>
<P>
ES: In 1982, my wife Sandy had a marketing company. She said, 'Why don't we advertise you?' I kind of humored her. It started out as a lark. 
<P>
The first year I advertised in the Pittsburgh Press. I put a little ad in that said 'Know your rights.' Within one year I had the largest drunk driving practice in the City of Pittsburgh. I saw how powerful advertising was. We did a lot of experimenting at that time, and when we changed from the front part of the newspaper, which was world news, to the sports page, we doubled our business. I started to become fascinated by marketing. I had no notion we would even get money back enough to pay for the ads.
<P>
I changed the focus of my advertising after a while, from drunk driving to personal injury. For a while I did both, but I began to see that the public was not going to be impressed by my taking both sides, because a sizable portion of all accidents that happen are because of drinking and driving. 
<P>
<B>ER: How has the scope of your marketing effort changed since that time?</B>
<P>
ES: After we realized this was bigger than either one of us had thought it would be, Sandy gave up her advertising agency to work full-time as a marketing director after we got into television in 1986. In the beginning, I had one secretary and one employee. Today, we have 93 employees and 10 part-time people in five offices. So when you say how has this made a difference -- mixing the marketing and the law -- I've gone from being a small, almost solo practitioner to heading up what I consider to be a fairly large company. There is a world of difference.
<P>
Including Sandy, we have six people who are devoted entirely to marketing.  At one time we were in 27 newspapers in western Pennsylvania. We got rid of newspapers, primarily, because it wasn't cost effective. To us, television is so explosive. I had never been to Johnstown. We put an ad on Johnstown TV. I opened up an office. And the rest is history, as they say. It took off after that. We're on 13 TV stations in western Pennsylvania, and we're on all of those stations almost every day of the week, 365 days a year. That takes a lot of money.  We do a lot of other things within the scope of marketing, but certainly that's where a big part of this budget goes. 
<P>
<B>ER: What's your budget for marketing?</B>
<P>
ES: Total budget I think is proprietary, but we're well over a million dollars annually. For the last few years we have been one of the 10 largest TV legal advertisers in the country. But I don't know about those statistics, because they only get their figures from the 75 largest TV markets in America, and a great part of our advertising is not in large markets.  
<P>
<B>ER: What kind of ethical question for you was it to advertise?</B>
<P>
ES: I went from being a respectable lawyer by reputation, to in many ways becoming a pariah. It really got bad when I went on television, because then I really started to affect all of the smaller communities in western Pennsylva-nia economically, because the lawyers in those areas had to compete against my law firm. I never gave it a lot of thought, about doing this. Because, one, there was no question, the Supreme Court said you could do it. Two, it was being done in many other places across America, including Pittsburgh. I wasn't the first lawyer to advertise in Pittsburgh on TV.
<P>
When we decided to go mass media I knew already, on a smaller scale, how lawyers were coming down on me as not being professional, not creating dignity for the profession of law, and I knew that if I couldn't stand the heat I better get out of the kitchen. But that never bothered me, because I felt that what we were doing was not only legally right, but ethically correct, because I've had ethics counsel on every ad I've ever done. And I'm not thin-skinned.  
<P>
The interesting thing is that the only criticism that's ever been leveled in 13 years of advertising has come from other lawyers, not from the public.  
<P>
<B>ER: How was the criticism leveled at you? Have you had any serious confrontations?</B>
<P>
ES: We were denied admission in a county bar association that had never denied admission to anyone. I felt that was personal. Some of the criticism is subtle, and said behind my back. Some of it is overt, as recently as three months ago when I appeared as a guest at a statewide bar association function, and the president of  the organization leveled a personal attack on me in front of 450 people. That was direct. 
<P>
But I believe I know what the real underlying premise of all of this is. The lawyers who criticize me hide under the badge of dignity and professionalism, and what it really is is economic. I think this has been a substantial economic detriment to many, many lawyers in western Pennsylvania. 
<P>
<B>ER: Why is advertising such a dirty word in law?</B>
<P>
ES: Advertising has been a dirty word in law since 1978, when the now-famous case of the Arizona Bar Association vs. Bates was decided by the United States Supreme Court, which said that lawyers could advertise. There is a segment of the lawyer population who believe that lawyers should only be able to get business by word of mouth and reputation. Every lawyer who has to make a living today has to sell their services. But those who are avowed anti-advertising lawyers say it is just not professional.  
<P>
You have to understand something. Every big law firm in this city has marketing people on their staff. It is not marketing that bothers lawyers. It's TV advertising. Talk to your friendly yellow page rep and he'll tell you no one takes more full page ads than lawyers. 
<P>
<B>ER: Why is TV different?</B>
<P>
ES: Because it is so powerful. It goes out to everyone. The average family in America today watches 7.5 hours of television. That means average. The people that hire me probably watch 10 hours or more of television. If you're a lawyer who is trying to get business the old-fashioned way, by word of mouth, and here comes Edgar Snyder every 15 minutes even when you're switching the channels -- plus the fact that we give a message that says there's no fee unless we get money for you -- lawyers who don't advertise say, `We do the same thing; we don't take a fee either.' But the public doesn't know what lawyers do.  Now they don't have to get  a name from somebody. TV helps elect presidents, why shouldn't it help lawyers who want to get business.
<P>
I think it educates the public as a whole. When we first started advertising for personal injury cases, the average person who would call us had been in an accident six weeks before. Whereas today, with the education of 'Call a lawyer before you talk to an insurance company' mentality that's given in TV commercials, very often we get a call the same day as the accident happens. The public over the last 10 to 15 years has been educated as to what their rights are if they receive a personal injury in an accident. I've had many lawyers say to me, in their off-the-record candor, 'You've helped us all get more business.' The pie is larger of people who know they should get a lawyer. But I don't expect any medals.
<P>
<B>ER: Please explain your fee arrangement.</B>
<P>
ES: We don't bill. Personal injury practice is a contingency fee practice, and we don't get any money on any case unless we win it. And then when we win it, we get paid by the insurance company because we work on a contingent fee. If we don't win, we don't get paid anything. The percentages in this office generally range from 33 1/3 percent contingent fee to 40 percent depending upon the type of case.Those that have greater risk, we charge more. 
<P>
<B>ER: What percent of cases do you win?</B>
<P>
ES: We win most of the cases, but I don't want to mislead what that means. We're careful what we accept here. We have cases where the costs are in excess of $30,000 out-of-pocket on one case. I wouldn't want to take too many cases that I didn't believe we were going to win. But we don't win them all. 
<P>
There's always two issues in every case. One, liability: who's at fault. Two, what are the damages. I set the tone for what we should accept and shouldn't accept. If a case has substantial damages and a big liability question we would be much more likely to handle that case than if there was a big liability question and the damages, meaning the injuries, were very small. Because then on an economic basis it wouldn't be worth the risk and reward. We get well in excess of 10,000 calls a year. 
<P>
We're very careful in the area of product liability, whether it be automobiles, or home products. These companies have an inexhaustible supply of resources.
<P>
<B>ER: What percent of your cases actually go to trial?</B>
<P>
ES: I'll give you two statistics. About 22 percent of our cases are litigated in the personal injury field. In worker's compensation and social security you handle these cases before hearing administrators. So if we litigate 22 percent, I would say in the neighborhood of five percent or less actually go through the trial process, not including arbitration.  We find that if your case is reasonable, before it goes to the jury the insurance company will offer a reasonable  amount of money, though it may not be until    you are sitting on the doorstep of the courthouse.
<P>
<B>ER: How much profit is there in this industry?</B>
<P>
ES: I wouldn't want to say how much the company makes. We are very profitable so far, but if I make bad decisions I can see that margin of profitability go from good to bad.
<P>
<B>ER: What do you think of the term 'ambulance-chaser' ?</B>
<P>
ES: If you put an ad on television that the public watches, they have two choices. They can ignore your product, or be interested in your product, talk to you and make a decision to buy your product. What we're doing is not ambulance chasing, but it's a convenient handle that has been placed upon lawyers who are getting business from people who have been in accidents. Literally speaking, most of them are being taken away in ambulances. But they have the free choice. 
<P>
I had someone on a case that we just became involved in, this HOV case, call up a TV station and say, 'Isn't that terrible that Attorney Snyder would have contacted these people at their worst time.'
<P>
One, it would be against the canon of ethics, and if you got caught you would be disbarred. One of the families of the HOV victims contacted us based upon advertising. We filed a lawsuit against PennDOT in that case. It was the first lawsuit that was filed, and I think a very important step was taken to protect the safety of all the people that use the HOV lanes. And, in fact, we filed the lawsuits and right now, signs are going up. And thank God.
<P>
<B>ER: Have you seen the environment change for personal injury law?</B>
<P>
ES: Yes. The window has opened in terms of educating the public. The insurance companies would give you a counter argument, that all we've done is dig up litigation, but I know better. I know on a statistical basis that lawsuits are not up, but I think that representation of people who have been involved in an accident is up. Although I'll give you an interesting statistic -- in this region, I still believe that only 25 to 30 percent of all people who are involved in automobile accidents, who are injured, use a lawyer. So the vast majority of people injured in accidents are still not hiring a lawyer to handle their matter. Compare that to Philadelphia and it will make your hair stand on end, if you have any hair. I don't. It's like 90 percent in Philadelphia.
<P>
<B>ER: How do you feel about insurance companies?</B>
<P>
ES: I love 'em. I can't live without them, in more ways than one. I'm called to give more public speeches to insurance companies than I am from the law. I think they do a very good job. I wish I could model my profitability on the insurance companies. I've told them that if they could do a better job of dealing with the public, they would put a severe kink in the Edgar Snyders of this world.
<P>
<B>ER: What do you think of tort reform?</B>
<P>
ES: Tort reform, as it is now being used by the Newt Gingrich crowd, is one of the cruelest hoaxes that has been perpetrated on the American public. My hats are off to the insurance industry for the hundreds of millions of dollars that they have spent trying to show the American public that there is a problem. I don't think these measures will help. I think they will hurt victims in accidents, and everyone else doesn't have to worry about it until they're the victim. But we represent victims in this law firm, and I call it a hoax.
<P>
<B>ER: How has this change in your career affected you?</B>
<P>
ES: The recognition has been amazing. I cannot go anywhere in western Pennsylvania without being recognized, talked to, asked legal questions -- I have no private life in Pittsburgh. But I accept it because no one has made me do this. I am not a victim. 
<P>
Some of the market research that we have done over the years gives me a higher name recognition than the President of the United States in some areas. It has nothing to do with me being a lawyer, it has to do with me being a celebrity when the definition of celebrity is being on television every day. I'm like a friend of the family. 
<P>
<B>ER: Has it affected your family?</B>
<P>
ES: My ads obviously inspire a certain sense of humor in people in dealing with me because I can count on one hand the times where people have not been nice in public to me over the past 13 years. My children haven't chosen to be public persons and being Edgar Snyder's son or daughter has embarrassed them. They have become mini-celebrities themselves. 
<P>
They're more accepting as they've gotten older. I read that my daughter said she chose to go to school in the West because it was as far away from Pittsburgh as she could go. I think that was a little tongue in cheek. She's now living in Pittsburgh, and if it was that bad she wouldn't have come back.

<font size=+1>Bank Stocks Look Attractive in Wake<BR> 

of Integra Merger with National City
</font><BR>
<i>By Doug Thomas
</i></b>

<HR>
<P>
And then there were two -- as       in large, locally headquartered    banks -- following the announcement by Integra Financial that it would sell to Cleveland-based National City Corp. for $2.1 billion in stock. The two banks left are household names, Mellon and PNC, neither of which is rumored to be on anyone's short list. But with this wave of consolidation continuing to roll along, it seems almost inevitable, doesn't it? 
<P>
In the meantime, it is likely that the remaining independents stand to gain market share as borrowers and depositors who prefer to do business locally vote with their feet and head not only for banks like Mellon and PNC, but to other strong local institutions including Parkvale Financial, BT Financial, Southwest National, First Western and Laurel Savings. Mellon and Parkvale shares increased 12.5 percent and 13.8 percent respectively in the month on speculation that both could be merger candidates. So far, there is no evidence to support speculation in either case.
<P>
It is not clear yet whether local consumers, who tend to be parochial, will desire to deal with a Cleveland-based bank rather than a local alternative. Investors are probably well advised to buy a basket of the midtier local bank stocks, as they will either continue to perform well in this environment or will be acquired.
<P>

<h2>Around the ER Index </h2>

The ER Index reported an 8 percent gain in the five weeks ended Sept. 15, 1995, as compared to a 5.09 percent gain for the S&P 500. Since inception, the index posts a 30.42 percent gain versus 26.48 percent for the S&P 500. The strong gains continue to be fueled by acquisitions and better-than-expected earnings announcements.<P>
<DL> 
<LI>	Cable Design Technologies announced that it expects earnings in the fiscal fourth quarter ended July 31, 1995 to exceed analysts' estimates by more than 15 percent. The company cited strong business conditions for network systems cable products and other products for the stronger-than-expected earnings. Additionally, in recent weeks the company has announced several acquisitions. CDTC shares closed up 22.3 percent in the month to 31 1/2.
<P>
<LI>Mylan Laborato-ries Inc. an-nounced that it has formed a strategic alliance with VivoRx, Inc., a California-based biotechnology company. The licensing agreement grants Mylan the exclusive rights to market and sell this product in North America. Mylan shares finished up 14.8 percent for  the month to 23 1/4.<P>
<LI>Northstar Health Services says it plans to acquire Penn Vascular Lab PC and Vascusonics PC for an undisclosed amount.  The two affiliated companies, both Pennsylvania-based, will bring to Northstar 17 western Pennsylvania facilities and combined 1994 revenues in excess of $3 million. Shares of Northstar gained 10.8 percent in the month to $9 per share.<P>
<LI>On Sept. 11, Heinz announced a 12.8 percent increase in net income to $174.5 million, or 70 cents a share,      for its first quarter ended Aug. 2. Revenues for the period increased 21 percent to $2.09 billion. More than half of that increase was provided by the purchases of the North American pet food business of Quaker Oats, the All American Gourmet business of Philip Morris' Kraft division and other small acquisitions. Heinz shares climbed 9.7 percent in the month to close at 46 1/2.<P>
<LI>General Nutrition planned to split its common stock 2-for-1 in October. The split was contingent upon shareholder approval to double the number of authorized common shares to        200 million. General Nutrition shares finished up 12 percent in the month     to 44 1/4.<P>
<LI>II-VI Corp., a designer and manufacturer of infrared optical devices used in industrial and military lasers, was the largest gainer of the month, posting a 50.5 percent gain in its share price to 19 3/4. On Aug. 17, the company announced a 151.7 percent increase in net income to $833,000, or 31 cents per share, on a 62 percent increase in revenues to $8.4 million. The company attributed its strong performance to higher sales and lower per-unit costs, resulting mostly from increased production. The company also announced it filed to sell one million new shares of stock, which will be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Taking a High-Tech Look at the Way Tax <BR>Initiatives Affect the Economy
</FONT><BR>

<I>By Jim Strader</I></B>
<HR>  
<P>

Lawmakers trying to reform the state tax system have a new, high-tech tool to use. 
<P>
The innovative approach was suggested by The Pennsylvania Tax Blue-print Project. It includes computer-generated models that are used to evaluate various tax initiatives and their likely impacts on the economy. The project differs from previous efforts at tax reform by starting without a preconceived outcome, but with the goal of creating a mechanism to assess different proposals, says James C. Stalder, president of the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which is directing the nonpartisan venture.
<P>
At the heart of the project is the assumption that Pennsylvania's tax policies drive the economy -- either spurring growth or slowing it. The project seeks to move beyond the scope of previous analyses, which Stalder says often concluded with a comparison of tax rates between states, but without a broader view of the tax situation as a whole.
<P>
"Pennsylvania looks terrible in comparison, rate to rate," Stalder concedes, but adds that exemptions and other factors can bring down the net cost to do business in a state.
<P>
"What we want to demonstrate ... is how Pennsylvania stacks up in total," he says. "We're doing ourselves a real injustice by these reports that show Pennsylvania as one of the worst states."
<P>
With the use of state-of-the-art models as guides, policy makers can answer "what if" questions about the tax system, says Stalder, managing partner of the Pittsburgh office of Price Waterhouse LLP. Proposed tax reductions in one area can be examined through the models to determine the effects in other areas, he says. Likewise, broad revisions of the entire tax system can be analyzed.
<P>
Stalder looks at the value of the blueprint this way: "In the real world, how will all this stuff improve the business climate in Pennsylvania, or the tax climate? We're not going to be driven by misconceptions, we're going to be driven by facts."
<P>
Stalder speaks seriously about the practical value of the project, which has garnered support from Gov. Tom Ridge and from legislative leaders on both sides of the political aisle.
<P>
"Our goal is not to produce a glossy report that ends up on the shelf somewhere, but to produce a tool that can be used on a permanent basis whenever tax reform debate surfaces, whether it's next year or five years from now," Stalder says.
<P>
For his part, the governor expressed his desire to wait for the project's "unbiased technical data" before moving ahead with tax reform.
<P>
"It is my hope that we will then have the tools to produce objective  data that will allow us to deal with the       difficult decisions surrounding tax reform," Ridge wrote in a letter backing the effort.
<P>
The Pennsylvania Tax Blueprint Project also sought the input and support of the three certified public accountants in the Legislature, one of whom is Rep. Greg Fajt, a Democrat from Mount Lebanon. Fajt sees value in the effort's goal to provide the means to develop a coherent tax policy for the state, something he says has been lacking. He also thinks the nonpartisan character of the project lends credibility to the work.
<P>
"I think that the CPA profession has tremendous respect, both in the Legislature and in the public at large. They are independent, they are not affiliated," Fajt says. "What they are concerned with is keeping business taxes as low as possible and creating jobs."
<P>
Bipartisan support and the backing of a wide range of groups outside government is essential to the success of the project, Stalder says. Without that involvement and commitment --which Stalder terms a "buy-in'' -- the effort won't be worth as much down the road, he says.
<P>
Early work on the effort included formulating a steering committee and raising about $2.25 million in private funds. Stalder continues to solicit support for the endeavor.
<P>
"The choice is to get on the train, because it's leaving the station, or just sit back and watch this thing unfold. We want people to have a role in helping us establish this process," he says.
<P>
"It's not our objective -- not my objective on this committee -- to create the perfect answer. We're going to provide the legislators with alternatives. They're going to debate them  and society at large is going to decide what's best."
<P>

<font size = +1>Hospitals Increasingly Use Advertising to Get <BR>Their Messages Across -- But Do Consumers Care?
</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl
</I></B>

<HR>  

<P>
In the late '80s, when Pittsburgh television viewers started to see hospital ads flicker across their screens,  they might not have thought much about it, unless they were a doctor.
<P>
"At that time we felt the advertisements were misleading, that they suggested the ability to achieve some things that were unrealistic," says        Dr. Lee McCormick, chairman of the board of the Allegheny County Medical Society. "Also, there was very little advertising then, so there was a little bit of "What the heck is going on here?"
<P>
The campaign, for St. Francis' Laser Center, also used print and radio advertising. But it was the television ads that really ruffled feathers. 
<P>
"Television was controversial. It was reaching so many more people -- that was part of the reaction," says Shirley Freyer, director of public affairs for St. Francis. 
<P>
In 1988, Allegheny General Hospital launched an advertising   campaign titled "On the Frontier          of Advanced Specialty Care." Like        St. Francis, AGH realized it had something to say -- and that television was a vehicle with which to do it. Early campaigns from both institutions focused on high technology and specialty care. AGH even launched campaigns on local television stations during the Super Bowl broadcast, an effective way to reach a big audience.  
<P>
Today, healthcare advertising is prevalent, and hospital advertising is on the increase.  
<P> 
"Historically we have not undertaken paid advertising at all," says Nanci Case, director of planning,   marketing and media relations at Children's Hospital. "But, we've seen misperceptions in the market, and      we felt that paid advertising was the only and the best way to get the        message across."
<P>
Research showed that consumers identified Children's Hospital for tertiary care. But when it came to simpler procedures, consumers didn't think of Children's. 
<P>
To whit, the institution recently launched a campaign positioning Children's as a full-service hospital, and focusing on the institution being broader than its Oakland base, with 150 pediatric office affiliates. The campaign is Pittsburgh-based, and estimated to reach 97 percent of the hospital's target audience (women 25 to 49 with children) 10 or more times. 
<P>
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, too, forayed into advertising for the first time last spring. 
<P>
"For years we did not advertise," says Jane Duffield, director of the UPMC news bureau. "While we were renowned for the procedures like transplants that get quite a bit of media coverage, people didn't realize that they could get routine care here."
<P>
A change in focus is apparent throughout the region, says Pat Jurczak of the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania. Previously, she says, advertising focused on specialties. But now it has gone "back to basics."
<P>
"This is a whole new era of contracts," says Jurczak, "and hospitals are starting to ask themselves which managed care companies they will work with, and how they're going to keep costs down. Advertising is a way for   the hospitals to get the word out to   not just patients but to managed care companies, to get the contracts that keep them going."
<P>
Long-time advertiser AGH has changed its tactic, focusing on educating the consumer on this new environment of managed care. Tom Chakurda, vice president of communications for AGH, says that from the start the     hospital's focus has been educating   the consumer. That's why the AGH campaigns omit billboards.
<P>
"There's not enough room to really get our message across in outdoor," says Chakurda. 
<P>
Physicians have mellowed to advertising, in part, because of this focus on education, which McCormick says is helpful to the consumer. Also, the more prevalent advertising becomes, the more comfortable docs get with it. But he is still wary.
<P>
"My concern is that the patient is getting less and less choice about where they can go. So maybe it's fine that     the patient thinks that Metropolitan General is the best hospital in the world. But if his health care plan    doesn't allow him to go to Metropoli-tan General, he won't have a choice," says McCormick.
<P>
Influencing inclusion into networks via patient perception is one goal of the advertising -- but McCormick isn't convinced it will work.
<P>
"They will not necessarily be more willing to include them in their plan," says McCormick. "Insurers have all the bargaining chips, the patients and the dollars, and they will include hospitals for the most part not because of the public perception but because of the deal they can strike."

<P align=center><B><FONT SIZE=+2>A Shoestring Budget
</FONT><BR>
<font size=+1>Small Businesses Must Spend Their Limited <BR>Advertising Dollars Wisely
</font><BR>
<I>By Henry Lipput
</I></B>
<HR> 

<P>
Rick Rohac knows firsthand that small businesses, by their very nature, have small advertising budgets. But he also knows that businesses like his own still must reach potential clients and build name recognition.
<P>
Many small businesses that don't try even the simplest advertising         will lose the battle for success before     it starts.
<P>
"What's important for small business people to realize is if they don't have a budget allocated for advertising in their start-up, they shouldn't even start up," says Rohac, president of Business America/Pittsburgh Metro East, a business appraisal/valuation firm that also brokers the sale or purchase of businesses.
<P>
"There are ways of doing it relatively cost-free," Rohac says. "The two ways that I've found most effective are to network as extensively as possible in professional organizations and to canvass, to cold call, to get out and let business owners know that I'm out there with the service that I offer them."
<P>
It's advertising on a shoestring budget, a challenge faced by the majority of small businesses. Strategies can be as simple as a well-planned business card, which in Rohac's case is colorful and double-sided.
<P>
"So when we leave a business card, we're leaving not only our name and phone number, but a pretty good description of what we can do for them," Rohac says.
<P>
Other small businesses may spend more, but usually it's still a limited amount that without proper planning and research will go to waste. Billboards, broadcast commercials and newspaper advertisements are worthless if your target markets don't see or hear them.
<P>
"It really is doing your homework, as to what's out there, what's in the marketplace," says Ron Kaiser, president of the Kaiser Group, a Pittsburgh advertising agency. "It's learning to not only ask questions, but, more importantly, learning to listen to what people are saying, what people want." 
<P>
<h2>And then there's the budget.</h2>

"If you don't have enough money [to fund a traditional advertising campaign], don't spend any of it," Kaiser says. "And then you have to find other ways to attract customers. And those other ways sometimes go back to the old original ways to do it. I don't        care whether you put a person with a sandwich board out walking up and down the street. Or print up a bunch of fliers, and distribute them up and down the street where there are businesses.
<P>
"The small business person needs to be a guerrilla fighter," Kaiser says. "They need to be street-smart. You need to be able to not try to overwhelm a market -- because you don't have the dollars -- but to outsmart it. "
<P>
Being innovative helps. Often, an innovative approach will get the public's attention. One example was the cookies distributed by DoubleTree Hotel when it took over the former Vista International in downtown Pittsburgh. The DoubleTree is part of a national chain, but is independently owned, with a limited budget for promotion in the Pittsburgh market.
<P>
Other small businesses that elect to use traditional TV advertising can limit their costs by trimming production costs and hitting cable channels instead of the traditional networks.
<P>
One of Kaiser's clients, The Law Firm, wanted to have some immediate impact in the market where it phys-ically was located.
<P>
"We made the decision that we would focus our marketing on the northern tier of Allegheny County," says The Law Firm's Leonard Sweeney. "Hence, we used CableAdNet for the North Hills area, which is a pretty big area."
<OP>
"Local mom and pop clients represent 55 to 60 percent of our core business," says Pat Springer, CableAdNet's director of marketing.
<P>
Sweeney says his commercial brought results, even though it was produced on a limited budget.
<P>
"Anybody can throw a bunch of money into this and have    a Cecil B. deMille production," Sweeney says. "The trick is to have one that just looks like it."

<P align=center><b><FONT SIZE=+2>The Five-Year Plan
</FONT><BR>
<font size = +1>Finishing College in Four Years <BR>Has Become a Thing of the Past
</font><BR>
<I>By Jim Urban</I></B>

<HR>  

<P>
When Jack Daniel attended college, he blew right through it, attending summer school and finishing his bachelor's degree in less than three years. Today, as the University of Pittsburgh's vice provost, Daniel watches many young students taking five years and sometimes longer to complete their undergraduate work.
<P>
No problem.
<P>
"It is now normative to take more than four years to graduate," Daniel says. "A major reason is economics. A large number of students are working to pay tuition. Also, a large number of students are doing what I call 'stopping out' to gain work experience. Others stop out after they recognize the need to grow or mature a little."
<P>
Only 31 percent of the high school class of 1990 earned undergraduate degrees within four years,  down from 45 percent in 1977, when the National Center for Education Statistics began tracking graduation rates. 
<P>
Don't be misled by those numbers, educators say. Not graduating within four years does not always mean students are wasting time at parties, a view many parents mistakenly adopt. As Daniel notes, some students are gaining work experience, studying abroad or even staying in school an extra year to complete work for a second major or a minor. Others agree.
<P>
"We are finding students who take those options," Robert Morris College President Edward Nicholson says. "They slow down to get the extra minor, for example, as a strategy to enhance their own marketability.
<P>
"My own son, at Notre Dame, had two majors and a minor," Nicholson says. "He had to go two summers."
<P>
In the end, it's employers who benefit from this trend. The pool of entry-level college graduates is more polished and more seasoned, giving employers more value for their payroll dollars. Employers recognize the trend more every day, so they aren't quite as concerned as they used to be about the amount of time prospective employees spent in college.
<P>
"The difference is, we would ask for an explanation," says Michael Roark, a Mellon Bank vice president. "There are a lot of legitimate reasons. Spending more than four years in college is not necessarily a red flag, but it is something we would ask about."
<P>
Some students, especially those who attend more expensive private schools, can't afford to pay tuition for an extra year. Beyond the tuition, a typical student spends an additional $6,500 to $8,000 annually for college expenses, such as housing, meals and transportation. In other words, the five-year plan isn't for everyone. 
<P>
The schools themselves are not interested in collecting the extra  tuition. At Westminster College, 66 percent of students finish in four years. 
<P>
"We have a moral obligation to get these students through in four years,   as long as they are doing their part," says Elizabeth Hines, registrar at Westminster. "If they are flunking and repeating courses, there is little we can do. But it's scary to think that schools would keep a student for more than four years for monetary reasons. Moving them along is the name of     the game."
<P>
In fact, many schools are now working to remove administrative roadblocks that previously prevented students from finishing in four years. In Florida, for example, the board of regents went as far as requiring faculty members to spend more time teaching and advising.
<P>
In western Pennsylvania, schools have developed committees to review curricula and ensure that students get the classes they need to progress toward their degrees. When required courses aren't available, schools are more flexible than ever before in allowing students to substitute another class.
<P>
Community colleges also are being more precise with the articulation agreements they have with four-year schools. The agreements enable students to transfer most of their credits from the community college to the four-year school.
<P>
What's the message? Don't stereotype students who spend more than four years in college.
<P>
"Look at the student's record and see why the student didn't finish in four years," says Pitt's Daniel. "I think employers are going to see more and more students who actually were in good academic standing."

<font size =+1>Employers Cut Healthcare Costs By Restricting Employee Options </font size><BR> 
<i>By Lydia Strohl</i></B>
<HR>
<P>



When Maureen Bertonaschi lost her job as a funder at Mellon Bank last May, her family didn't just lose a valuable second income. Maureen, her husband Michael, and their two toddlers, Ryan and Adam, also lost their family doctor.
<P>   
"Our kids have been going to the same pediatrician all their lives," says Michael Bertonaschi, 39, director of financial aid at La Roche College. "So we decided to pay $400 a month to stay on HealthAmerica. We have until May 1996 and then we'll have to make a decision. Our feeling is that we will get the 17-month-old through most of his shots and visits with our pediatrician, and then it will not be as traumatic to change." The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, known as COBRA, mandates that employee health coverage must be extended for one year after an employee leaves their job -- but the employee is no longer eligible for the usually lower rates the employer has negotiated. To remain with Health-America, the Bertonaschis will bear a sizable increase in healthcare costs, on a sizably reduced income. 
<P>
This just when they were getting used to seeing their rates go down. 
Yes, down.
<P>
In 1993, the Bertonaschis subscribed to HealthAmerica through La Roche, at a family rate of $295 a month. They then switched their coverage to Mellon Bank's program, which in 1994 offered HealthAmerica at a family rate of $164 a month. In 1995, that coverage dropped to $135 a month. But they can't get back into HealthAmerica through La Roche. 
<P>
"In November 1994, we switched to Select Blue, [a Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania product] which allows people to use either an HMO [health maintenance organization] or indemnity program," says George Zaffuto, director of human resources at La Roche. "Blue Cross said they would not deal with us if we did not eliminate HealthAmerica. We fought with them, and even talked to our attorneys about it, but they also represent Blue Cross and were not comfortable with the situation."
<P>
Welcome to the brave new world of managed care in Pittsburgh. For so long considered the backwoods of managed care, Pittsburgh has of late seen greater acceptance of managed care. Partly responsible is the introduction of point of service products, which are less restrictive than pure HMOs, yet still realize cost control. Consequently, competition among health plans has heated up to a rolling boil: and though, as usual, competition is having a favorable impact on the market, some consumers are finding that they are the proverbial frog, trapped in the pot as the temperature rises. 
<P>
<H2>Over a Barrel</H2>
The upshot in this case was that La Roche capped enrollment into HealthAmerica.<P> 
"Our increases were astronomical, in the teens and twenties, so I said, 'What can we do to control this?' Managed care is virtually the only way left to have some sort of control," says Zaffuto. "[With Select Blue,] our rates went down 23 percent -- and without that reduction, we would have been hard pressed to fund the full amount."
<P>
Blue Cross says that without eliminating the competition, they have no way to predict whether the rates they offer, which are based on the health of the entire employee pool, are sustainable.
<P>
"In healthcare, 10 percent of the people account for 90 percent of the cost," says Dan Holtz, vice president of major accounts at Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania. "When we're deciding what to charge we look at the claims experience of the entire group over time. What causes problems is when you don't know which ones will stay [in our plan]. It's possible that if the healthy people move into the competitive program and we no longer have that to offset [the higher cost of caring for the sicker people], we can't predict the price as well."
<P>
But HealthAmerica doesn't see it that way.
<P>
"That's a bogus reason they trot out for the underlying reason, to protect their market share," says Tom Murray, senior vice president of HealthAmerica. "And the biggest proof I have is that they've done that where we have been losing money on groups -- they're taking back people we've paid to have transplants. Blue Cross is using the same tactic with large, self-funded employers where they take no risk, just administrate the claims. If their worry is adverse risk, then why do they do that in the self-funded market?"
<P>
Zafutto says Select Blue was the logical way to make the switch to complete managed care, because not all of La Roche's approximately 120 covered employees were comfortable with having their choice of doctor or hospital restricted. Select Blue is a point of service program, which allows patients to make the decision of where they receive care each time they need it. They may use the Select Blue network of providers or go outside that network and pay a higher co-payment charge. But the ability to go out of network doesn't help the Bertonaschis, since their pediatrician is on staff at HealthAmerica, and only cares for HealthAmerica subscribers.  
<P>
"We don't even want to think about getting another doctor," says Michael. "We got this big book that listed all the Blue Cross doctors and felt like we didn't even want to deal with it. Some doctors aren't even accepting new patients. We want the convenience and comfort of sticking with our pediatrician."
So they will pay for it. It's evidence that employers aren't the only ones making tough decisions in healthcare. Increasingly, they are passing along those decisions, in the form of provider restrictions and higher contributions, to employees. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, in 1993, 61 percent of full-time employees in medium and large firms were asked to make contributions to their health plans -- up from 27 percent in 1979. What's worse, in a healthcare environment crammed by economics into an increasingly one-size-fits-all system, not everyone will be satisfied.
<P>
"This year, it would cost $291 a month for all four of us to go on Select Blue," says Bertonaschi. "And since it's a point-of-service plan, that only covers 80 percent. We think even though we're paying more now [to stay with Health-America], we're better off in the long run."
<P>
La Roche is not alone in their move to managed care to stem healthcare costs. According to a survey by Johnson & Higgins, in 1994, 58 percent of all covered employees of mid-size employers (10-999 employees) participated in managed care, up from 46 percent in 1993. Yet they still saw average total healthcare costs per employee rise 3.4 percent in 1994, to $3,421 from $3,308. This was smaller than 1993's 6.2 percent increase, but hardly comparable to the decrease of 1.1 percent that employers overall experienced in 1994. Clearly, larger companies with more volume can offer deeper choices. But managed care is here to stay. Even in backwoods Pittsburgh.
<P>
"It's just recently, with the January 1, 1995 re-enrollments, that we saw  a great shift [in this market] to managed care," says Maureen Londino, a principal at Buck Consultants. That's when, she says, Blue Cross, which dominates the market, had its product "mature and ready to go. I think the market will continue to evolve, with United Health Care and Metro Health, the merger of Traveller's and Met Life, coming into the market."
<P>
This competitive situation has led to underpricing strategies to grab market share, say experts. Blue Cross makes no bones about the fact that they want to expand. For years the leaders in the traditional indemnity market, the name Blue Cross was synonymous with quality employer-provided health benefits. HealthAmerica came to town 20 years ago with their pure managed care product, which restricted choice to their network of physicians. Employers and employees alike were slow to take notice -- until the double digit healthcare cost inflation of the late '80s hit. Even then, it proved hard to change the mindsets of Pittsburghers, to whom healthcare quality equaled freedom of choice. Three years ago, health insurers began tailoring managed care to the marketplace, and by the end of the year, Blue Cross, with 65 percent of the insured market in western Pennsylvania, will have more than a million subscribers, 200,000 in their Keystone HMO, 100,000 in their PPO, and 700,000 in the POS plan, Select Blue.
<P>
"That's still less than 50 percent," says Blue Cross' Holtz. "We see 1997 as the year managed care will actually grow larger than indemnity enrollment."
<P>
HealthAmerica, with 250,000 subscribers, 170,000 in the HMO and 70,000 in the POS and PPO plans, is Blue Cross' closest competition, offering a deep array of products and services for not just the corporate but also the Medicare, Medicaid and small business markets. Other companies have come into serve special niches: Aetna, for instance, has a strong national network and is particularly attractive to corporate clients with employees throughout the country. US Healthcare, too, is rumored to be making plays for market share.
<P>
"There's a price war going on right now, so we stress to our clients that they don't just look at the first-year costs," says Angela Walker, vice president of employee benefits services for Johnson & Higgins in Pittsburgh. "We go for two- and three-year rate guarantees, because they will undercut the one-year -- it may be lower than the employer paid just in claims. The POS plans are where we're seeing the growth, and they're very competitively priced. Sometimes we shake our heads and wonder why, but it's whatever the carrier is comfortable with -- depending on how big, how high profile, how important the company is to them."
<P>
This is dangerous, says Walker, because if companies switch plans often to take advantage of lower costs, the market's cost for healthcare will go up in the long term. Besides, the lowest price doesn't always indicate the highest quality.
<P>
"Employers are always looking for ways to provide high quality healthcare at a competitive price, and short term, you can always get a lower price," says Londino of Buck Consultants. "But long term, if you can't negotiate better care and outcomes, you are just putting a band-aid on something that needs surgery."
<P>
<h2>Quest for Quality</h2>
Employers choose healthcare plans depending on the needs of the employees and the industry they serve.
<P>
"Cost, quality and access," says   Earl L. McKinley, director of Westing-house's employee service center, when asked how he buys corporate healthcare. "Since we are a multi-industry company, we have to align the benefits program with business strategy. In competitive conditions, we use benefits to attract and retain employees. On the flip side, we may see that we don't need overly generous benefits, if talent is more readily available."
<P>
In years past, employers judged their healthcare coverage by how efficiently its administration ran -- how responsive the carriers were to employees and how quickly claims were paid. Now, with carriers increasingly managing care, quality is taking on a whole new meaning, and buzzwords like 'measuring outcomes' are part of the benefit managers' daily repertoire.
<P>
Why? Because the numbers are increasingly demonstrating that in managed care, quality outcomes demonstrably affect cost. And employers can't afford to ignore that -- in 1993 public and private employers spent $235.6 billion, approximately 6.2 percent of total compensation, on group health insurance, according to an EBRI study. Health insurance is the fastest inflating element of compensation, increasing at an average annual rate of 13.7 percent from 1960 to 1993. Figures show managed care plans have the lowest cost per employee. Nationwide, according to Johnson & Higgins, indemnity plans for midsize employers cost an average of $3,503 per employee, HMOs cost $3,288 and PPOs cost $3,106. POS plans proved to have the lowest cost, $2,939 per employee. 
<P>
"What employers want to know is how much value am I getting for my insurance dollar? How many cardiac patients died or had to be readmitted? What's your C-section rate? How satisfied are your members?" says HealthAmerica's Murray. "If quality is a goal, then cost will follow."
<P>
The issue of quality has become such an important one that the Pittsburgh Business Group on Health, a coalition of 30 local employers, began collecting data on managed care options last year. 
<P>
"We saw a need on the part of business to get good comparative information," says Chris Whipple, executive director, who says their survey duplicates the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS 3.0) standards set up by the National Committee on Quality Assurance, one of the groups responsible for accrediting health plans. "Pittsburgh is the first region to release verifiable information. Plan to plan, the national report card project is not comparable. This is the first region where it's regionally applicable."
<P>
The results of this year's study are due out at the end of this month. They will cover HMO and PPO plans -- POS plans are not mature enough in this region, requiring five years to get valid results, according to Whipple. Last year's study included responses from Advantage, owned by St. Francis Health System; Aetna; Keystone, the HMO of Blue Cross; HealthAmerica and US Healthcare. Of the five, three (Aetna, HealthAmerica and US Healthcare) were fully accredited by the NCQA, and one (Keystone) had provisional accreditation. (Keystone has since been granted one-year accreditation, a step between provisional and full accreditation.) On the quality indicators like pediatric immunization, mammography and prenatal care, the locals scored at or above the national average.
<P>
Part of the reason may be the watchdogging of the state.
<P>
"I think in most states, even though the health department is given jurisdiction, they don't take a proactive role," says Tom Chepel, director of the bureau of healthcare financing for the Pennsylvania department of health. "But we have a history in Pennsylvania of coming up with the proper regulatory schemes to protect subscribers. The result is tough standards and longer to go through the regulatory stages. I'd like to say that generally the things we are looking for are arrangements that  lead to poor quality care or underservice. Most use capitation, which may lead to undertreatment."
<P>
The state monitors HMOs and PPOs by licensing them, making sure that they have the proper quality and access in place by doing an in-depth review on-site, and a random review of medical records. The health plan must also have an approved system for consumer complaints.
<P>
"We're proud of our consumer grievance system, and believe we have the most detailed set of guidelines on how to operate a grievance system," says Chepel. Since the system was implemented in April 1991, the DOH intervened in 1,920 complaint calls before a formal grievance was filed. Of the 240 grievances formally filed, 45 percent of those settled have been in favor of the member, saving complaintants an estimated $775,000. The most frequent type of grievance appealed involves a member who goes to the emergency room without contacting a primary care physician.
<P>
All this leads, says Chepel, to well-policed systems. "We are one of the first states requiring external quality assessments. They're done one year after licensing and every three years after that, or as necessary. Other states are adopting this. In fact, many employers are requiring accreditation." The state has approved three external assessment organizations that licensees can use for these check ups, which they pay for themselves. One of the approved groups is the NCQA, which runs a separate national accreditation program.
<P>
<h2>An Executive Decision</h2>
Just having manged care in place is not enough -- a case illustrated dramatically by the story of Allegheny County. In 1992, 70 percent of the county's 7,500 employees were enrolled in HMOs, 30 percent in indemnity programs. But all was not rosy.
<P>
"There were a lot of problems," says George Tkach, now executive assistant to Commissioner Pete Flaherty, but then assistant director of benefits. "Our costs were increasing dramatically. We had seven benefit plans with many different levels -- our employees were frankly confused. Our cost for healthcare per employee had increased from $2,760 in 1987 to $4,289 in 1992. Then I read an article in your publication that said the average cost per employee should be around $3,600 per year."
<P>
Unchecked, the county's healthcare bill would have been $32 million in 1993, and Tkach projected that healthcare costs would have reached $43.6 million by 1995. So the county decided to cut the number of carriers to two, and after a bid process chose Blue Cross, which provides both POS and HMO products, and HealthAmerica's HMO. They also did things like bring the carriers on-line, and offer bonuses to employees who opted out of the program.
<P>
"The first year bids came in at $25.8 million, a $4.5 million savings," says Tkach. After an intensive communications blitz advertising the new program to employees, 88 percent are now enrolled in HMOs and nine percent in POS. Only three percent remain in indemnity, all holdovers on union contracts. POS enrollees only opt out of the network 15 percent of the time. "With renewals, this year the program is up to $31 million. But remember, that's not actual cost savings, just savings over the increases we had projected before."
<P>
It's an important point. Though managed care has indeed slowed the rate of increase in healthcare expenditure, cases where the cost of care is actually decreasing are rare and the numbers negligible. Prices are still escalating: According to Johnson & Higgins, though indemnity plans rose the highest (13.6 percent from 1993), HMOs (7.4 percent) and PPOs (1.4 percent) also continued to increase. Some believe that though managed care has taken an initial bite out of healthcare costs, the true dirty work is yet to come.
<P>
"We've seen significant reductions in utilization by union and non-union employees that reflect changes in the plan designs and an effort to prevent unnecessary hospitalization and unnecessarily prolonged stays in the hospital," says Jim Carney, vice president of administration for U.S. Steel and Carnegie Pension Fund. After 10 years of double digit healthcare cost inflation, USX last year experienced no increase, paying out $255 million for medical insurance for 80,000 retirees and 100,000 employees and their dependents. At latest count, 37 percent of non-union and 22 percent of union employees were enrolled in HMOs.
<P>
"But though we've had success on the utilization side, we've had less success on the cost side," says Carney. "I am very concerned that costs are going to escalate again. One reason is government cost shifting -- the government pays less than its fair share for payments so doctors shift the cost to us. There's also this inability to get hospitals to take facilities out. Hospitals are trying to expand here. Pittsburgh hospitals have more helicopters than many third world countries, and that's ridiculous."
<P>
Carney says that because hospital stays are down, hospitals, which have fixed costs, are hiking prices to cover them. Dan O'Malley, a principal with Towers Perrin, agrees, and thinks the day of reckoning for hospitals will come soon, with the shifting of the region's hefty Medicare population into managed care.
<P>
<h2>Let the Games Begin</h2>
With southwestern Pennsylvania on a road without exits to managed care, new companies and new products are infiltrating the market. 
<P>
"Understand that managed care is still in its infancy," says LeMar Myers, chief of the HMO, PPO and POS review division of the Pennsylvania department of insurance. "Indemnity is still sold more than anything else and there are segments of the market that are untapped."
<P>
"For the last seven to eight years, the number of HMOs was fairly constant, there were always about 20 in operation," says Neil Bonhert, vice president of the Hospital Council of Western Pennsylvania. "In the past year, though, there have been a phenomenal number of new applications."
<P>
Of 14 new applications, three HMOs are coming into southwestern Pennsylvania. Jerry Silver, of Best Healthcare, one of the applicants, says they're coming in to tap the Medicaid market, which has abundant potential with coming regulations requiring disbursement of Medicaid via managed care.
<P>
Much of the competition will come from already established corporations. Myers predicts that US Healthcare, which has been putting on a big push in central Pennsylvania by undercutting competitive rates by 20 to 30 percent and pouring money into advertising, will come on strong in the Pittsburgh area too. And then there is Blue Cross' strategy.
<P>
"The competition in this market is very tough, from the standpoint of going after the employer. Blue Cross has a role in every company," says O'Malley of Towers Perrin. But he says that few have taken the bait and decreased employee choice. "In most cases, employers are reacting negatively to the monopolistic tactics of having only one choice. However, in some cases, Blue Cross has convinced them that if they aggregate their healthcare pool they can save, and they have basically bought their way in. It depends on the employer and the timing and their other business challenges."
<P>
Competition is also coming from providers, doctors and hospitals setting up networks. Pennsylvania does not yet have the legislation in place to allow these Physician Hospital Organizations to contract directly with employers to provide healthcare, but Chepel, whose department is studying that question right now, says he is leaning that way. This will lead to increased competition.
<P>
"Some large employer groups have come to the conclusion that HMOs are just middlemen who charge a 15 percent administrative fee and if I contract directly with the PHO it will be more competitive," says Chepel. "But most don't want to compete with the HMOs, they just want to assume more of the risk. They want to manage their own care and increase [their profit] by good medical management. But it may also increase competition because now it takes a lot of resources [for HMOs coming in from the outside] to credential enough doctors and hospitals to build a system. This way, they could just go to three PHOs and get enough."
<P>
Industry experts are split on the question of whether Pittsburgh is ready for direct contracting. In Minneapolis, where healthcare is light-years ahead of this market, a large alliance of business employers is switching from contracting with large HMOs, planning instead to initiate a voucher system that allows employees to shop among competing smaller groups. The groups will provide information on quality, cost and customer service.
<P>
Towers Perrin's O'Malley says that a good average for an administative fee is $25 per employee per month. The insurance department caps administrative fees at 15 percent of the price of the plan. McKinley says Westinghouse, which is self-insured, pays an administrative fee of under 10 percent, and that's too high.
<P>
"Our administrative cost is lower than buying insurance off the shelf, when there's a risk fee involved. We're taking the risk under our belt. If I'm going to spend money on administration, I better see a payback in management," says McKinley. "There is a point of dimishing returns for managed care, but we're not there yet."
<P>
In Meadville, Crawford County Hospital is contracting with 13 employers directly to provide healthcare. But direct contracting would be more difficult for employers like USX and Westinghouse, with employees throughout the market and the nation. A voucher system like the one to be implemented in Minneapolis, however, might solve that. But no one really knows quite what path the local market will take.
<P>
"I think the market is ready for [direct contracting] at this point, because the movement to managed care has been relatively painless -- what was deemed as unacceptable five years ago, to take away the freedom of choice, has been given up," says O'Malley. "Now that we've gone that far, the logical next step is to go to an even smaller network and improve cost control and quality. But there has to be painless implementation and administration."
<P>
This means that these smaller systems, like the recently incorporated Southwest Integrated Delivery Network -- comprised of Allegheny General Hospital, Allegheny Valley Hospital, Forbes Health System, St. Clair Hospital and Sewickley Valley Hospital and their physician organizations -- must acquire the technology and expertise to manage healthcare. The big carriers, who have been working hard to integrate themselves into healthcare, deny the attraction of smaller, manageable networks.
<P>
"If a group of providers can put together a system that does it as well, or for less, we can't prevent this kind of competition," says Steve Birek, vice president of primary care delivery systems for Blue Cross, which is opening medical centers of their own reminiscent of those of HealthAmerica. "But it's not as easy as it looks." 
<P>
"The one-hospital solution is not very realistic. Just look at the topography," says HealthAmerica's Murray. "This is not the kind of community where you can come in and contract with only two or three hospitals -- you better have a pretty big network. I don't think their product will rival ours -- and we have a lot of other choices."
<P>
With lots of strings attached. As Ryan and Adam Bertonaschi may soon find out, choice, for employees  and their families receiving healthcare benefits, will increasingly mean change and sacrifice.
<P>

<h2>How Important Is Your HMO's Fiscal Health?</h2>

Sure, your HMO can hook you up with a doctor, provide you with tests, even hospitalize you if you're going under the knife or delivering a baby. But would-be enrollees might want to check on the fiscal health of the HMO before joining, too.
<P>
Especially in the Pittsburgh area. Weiss Ratings Inc., which rates the fiscal security of HMOs nationwide, recommends only doing business with companies they rate a B+ or higher. None of the HMOs here achieved that mark. Should enrollees care? Certainly.
<P>
"Companies that are fiscally balanced and responsible are companies where consumers are more likely to get good care," says Sue Ann Bailey, spokeswoman for Weiss Ratings, Inc., which has just published its second annual report, rating 317 HMOs across the country. "If companies are in fiscal trouble they are less likely to schedule expensive treatments, tests, or refer patients to the care of more expensive specialists."
<P>
Weiss rates the HMOs' fiscal security by establishing a risk-adjusted capital index, a profitability index, a liquidity index and a stability index for each institution and coming up with a letter grade for each.
<P>
The HMOs they rate in the Pittsburgh area are Health America, which received a C, Keystone Health Plan, which received a grade of B-, US Healthcare, which also received a B-, and Aetna, which received a SD+. 
<P>
According to the Weiss report, a B is 'good,' indicating that the company has the resources to deal with a variety of adverse economic conditions, but in the event of a severe financial crisis should be reviewed to assure its fiscal strength. A C is 'fair,' indicating that the company offers fair financial security and is currently stable, but might have difficulties maintaining that stability during an economic downturn. A D is 'weak,' indicating that the company demonstrates significant weaknesses which could negatively affect policyholders and in an unfavorable economic environment, could be magnified. The plus sign is an indication that the company could be upgraded with new data, and the minus sign indicates that new data might downgrade the rating. The S means 'small' -- that the company has capital and surplus of less than $10 million, and is a 'reminder that consumers may want to limit the size of their policy with this company so that the policy's maximum benefits per risk do not exceed one percent of the company's capital and surplus.'

<b><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Making Business Decisions </FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b>Overestimating Your Own Business Expertise Could Send <BR>Your Business Down the Tubes </FONT SIZE></b><br>
<B><i>By Jack Hallman </i></B>
<hr>

<P>

It often starts with an "Aha!" A light bulb goes on and suddenly you see a better way to build that mousetrap, or repackage that widget.  Before you know it, a small business is born. But making a long-term success of a small business requires a lot more than the risk-taking needed to put that innovative idea into motion.
<P>
One small business owner took the plunge and saw booming sales for his product once it hit the market.  It was an entrepreneur's dream -- except that in this case the business was quickly running out of money.  The cash-flow crisis was spurred by the owner's failure to realize that, while his suppliers demanded payment now, he wouldn't be paid for the finished products until 30 to 60 days after delivery.  His lack of experience cost him dearly.
<P>
Many small business owners soon realize that the day-to-day business decisions they must make are not as straightforward as simply selling the product or services.  How do you know what prices to set?  Where to market your products?  Should you expand the business?  If so, when?  How these issues are handled can make or break a small business's bottom line. 
<P>
Inexperienced owners are left to learn how to make such decisions through a process of trial and error, which can end up affecting the business's profit margin.  
<P>
No wonder 80 percent of small businesses in Pennsylvania fail.  And since roughly 95 percent of all businesses in the state are small, and employ over half of the employees in this state alone, failing small businesses can potentially affect the economic health of the region.  
<P>
Small business is a mainstay of our economy, so the importance of training entrepreneurs to handle crucial business decisions cannot be overstated. 
<P>
As a volunteer counselor for small businesses, I've seen this need first hand.  Time and again I've watched small business start-ups fail because of an inexperienced owner's poor decision-making skills.  The reasons can range from poor location, lack of marketing savvy, faulty pricing or a combination of these.  The results can overshadow the quality of a fledgling business's goods or services. 
<P>
Even seasoned small businesses can fall victim to a lack of preparedness.  For example, countless companies have had to close their doors as a result of wrongly assessing an expansion opportunity. An owner's poor judgment about whether or not to open up another location can send the business spiraling downward, even if it was booming when the decision was made. 
<P>
When small businesses approach my group -- the Service Corps of Retired Executives -- we take for granted that, although they may be experts in their products or services, their understanding of what it takes to run a business is limited.  New business owners who come to us must attend a workshop that covers business planning, financing, sources of capital, taxes and insurance, legal forms of organization and business records.
<P>
After an introduction to the important issues and problem-solving, one or more of the retired executives in the group volunteers to work with the entrepreneurs for more individualized help on their specific problems.
<P>
Without the experience of a large organization to back them up, it is relatively common for small business owners to overlook common business strategies, basic as they may be.  
<P>
One owner, for example, came to SCORE complaining of high turnover rates in his small business.  Although his staff had minimal skills, he was wasting valuable time training workers who would leave the organization months later.  The SCORE advisors helped the entrepreneur create employment ads that would attract an employee pool that best matched the type of jobs he had to offer. 
<P>
There are several programs like SCORE designed to give the small business owner free advice on how to avoid the pitfalls common to running a small business.  Entrepreneurs should look  to such programs for help before it's too late.
<P>
The fact is that small business operators must first realize the depth of business knowledge necessary to successfully run their shop.  With that realization, there are places to come for advice on handling those elusive business details because, as they say, that is where the devil is.                           
<P>

<b><P align=center><Font Size=+2>Staying Alive</font><BR><BR><font size=+1>When Disaster Strikes, Keep a Cool Head and Expect Anything</font><BR>
<i>By Rebecca Fenoglietto</I></b><P>

When Morri Miller got the call at 7:30 a.m., he first thought that it was nothing serious. A little bit of water in the building, part of a wall fell -- so what? Call a contractor. Miller was in Cleveland, visiting relatives.
In fact, that little bit of water was more than one million gallons that had burst from a water main located within feet of the foundation of Izzy Miller's Furniture in Carnegie, a two-story structure comprised of three connecting buildings. The pipe had developed a 2-foot hole that allowed the water  -- half of the entire water supply from the nearby tower -- to empty into the store on Aug. 24, 1994.
<P>
"It looked like a bombed out building," Miller says. "The front portion of the building was gone. It looked like Oklahoma City on a smaller scale. Fortunately, no one was injured here."
<P>
According to Miller, the basement had filled instantly, the first floor took on 1 1/2 feet of water. When the front of the building collapsed, everything housed in the second floor was destroyed by the dust. By 11 a.m. the county's Delta Team was on site to stabilize the area, and the Salvation Army was giving out donuts.
<P>
"Oh, this is nice," thought Miller.
<P>
But it would take a lot more than donuts and the Delta Team to overcome the disaster that decimated approximately $750,000 worth of inventory. 
<P>
How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.
<P>
For Miller, overcoming this disaster was a matter of following a logical progression of questions that needed to be answered. Miller did so partly because it worked, and partly, he admits, because he was in shock.
<P>
The first question was whether or not to stay in business at all. Had he chosen to close, the building still needed to be repaired. Additionally, Miller, at 58, says that he felt that he was "too young and too poor to retire. It was never really an option."
<P>
The next question, then, was whether Miller's should stay in the location it occupied for nearly 50 years, or relocate. Miller discovered that the expenses of relocating from Carnegie's East Mall Plaza were too great. Thus, Miller resolved to rebuild.
<P>
The next step was to find a place from which to operate while the building was still unusable. 
<P>
With no inventory and no building, Miller Furniture and its staff of approximately 10 (who, says Miller, were all kept on salary throughout the crisis, and who he credits for working together to keep Miller's viable) operated from a bare-bones office across the street from his warehouse. His ads challenged customers: "If you can buy from a picture, you can save lots of money." Miller admits that it was a hard sell, but he nonetheless maintained his business at approximately 60 percent.
<P>
Keeping that line of communication open -- to employees, customer, suppliers and the community --  as Miller did is essential, says Marc Jampole, president of Jampole Communications. He advocates planning beforehand to minimize communications problems during a crisis.     He suggests listing possible disasters, a few simple messages your company always tries to convey -- be it focused on quality, service or price -- and then list all basic audiences. Have in place a basic set of communication procedures. Name a spokesman and a second choice.
<P>
Then, if a crisis occurs, immediately contact your audiences. "Tell them how you're dealing with the crisis in a way that will be beneficial to them," Jampole says. 
<P>
In a situation similar to Miller's, says Jampole, he would have launched a public relations campaign, explaining what happened and how customers would be served in the meantime. "If they had a promotional budget, I would have spent most of it there," he says. Other measures would include a letter to suppliers, prompt, even early payments to vendors to reassure them of your business's viability and even increased community involvement to raise visibility and unite employees.
<P>
One of the first tasks, Miller says, is to gather as much information as possible about insurance proceeds.
<P>
<h2>Cleaning Up</h2>

Insurance helps, but it can't replace the sheer effort it takes to rebuild after a tragedy. Repairing the building was, says Miller, "a Herculean effort." Simply drying out took until December. Nothing much happened until January. Then, crews were busy rebuilding what was down and refurbishing what was intact, work that was financed by Miller's insurance advance. Removing mud, hauling away debris, repainting, rewalling and recarpeting took more than three months to complete.
<P.
Eight months later, in April, Izzy Miller Furniture was back at East Mall Plaza. One year later, there hardly remains any evidence of a flood. There are some barely noticeable watermarks on the wall and, reports Miller, the floors are not level. The second floor and basement both remain under construction and contractors work to support a new foundation. Miller says he hopes to be completely finished by Christmas -- in time for the store's 50th anniversary.
<P>
Looking back, Miller contends  that there was not much he would do differently.
<P>

<H2>Insurance</H2>

Miller carried three types of insurance: building, contents and business interruption, as recommended by insurance agents. 
<P>
Mike McGroarty, president of McGroarty and Bradburn Insurance Inc. in Bridgeville, says that a good business owner's policy would include property insurance that covered the property, its contents and business interruption; and general liability in-surance that would cover bodily injury caused to others. Business interruption includes income loss and expenses. 
<P>
While the business owner policy is essential, McGroarty says that small business owners can plan for the unexpected with other policies: flood, earthquake, mine subsidence, tornado, snow and collapse of building insurance all are available either through commercial companies or through government in-surance programs. None, he says, are as popular as the business owner's policy.
<P>
In hindsight Miller says he's not convinced that anything would have been more helpful than using the thought-process he outlined.  "Normal decision-making, reasonably faced, is more important than having the answers to a few questions that can be costly if they're wrong." 
<P>
Says Miller, quite appropriately, "[When preparing for disasters beforehand], it's best to put your toe in the water, don't leap in." Even if that water has destroyed your business.

<B><P align=center><Font Size=+2>Getting Out</font><BR><BR><font size=+1>If You Don't Have a Plan, You are Asking for Trouble</font><BR>
<I>By Jim Urban</I></B><P>

<P>
In running their convenience store empire that spans parts of Pennsylvania and three other states, Steve Sheetz and his brothers face tough business decisions every day. In what regions do they expand? What services do they add? 
<P>
The biggie finally hit the board room of the privately held business last year.
<P>
"We had to make a decision about whether we indeed wanted to bring the next generation in. The six of us get along so well ... do we really want to risk that?" recalls Sheetz, who is company president.
<P>
"In the end? We said Yes.' We have a lot of talent in the second generation, so we basically went out and actively recruited them. We just brought two sons back. One is a Wharton School graduate. He has come back as director of personnel. The other has an MBA from Vanderbilt; he'll be a site selector in Pittsburgh."
<P>
Statistics show that about 90 percent of America's 20 million businesses are family-owned or family-controlled. Yet, less than a third of American businesses actually get passed to the second generation, and only 13 percent are passed to the third generation. Many of the others are sold to outsiders or to employees who in many cases maintain the integrity of the business to the original owner's satisfaction.
<P>
But sadly, many just become wasted assets because the business owner failed to develop an adequate succession plan. In simple terms, a succession plan is a road map for successors or heirs to follow in the event the business owner retires, becomes disabled  or dies.
<P>
About 75 percent of family-owned American businesses are operating without a succession plan, which usually sets out elements including  distribution of business stock and other assets, debt retirement schedules and division of responsibility among successors.
<P>
Part of the process includes estate planning. If an owner dies without having transferred stock ownership, that stock is an asset that can be included in the estate, experts say. It is likely that the value of the stock will exceed the $600,000 lifetime exclusion from estate taxation. In that case, the assets of the business might have to be liquidated to pay the estate taxes. The heir to the business becomes everybody's least favorite relative, Uncle Sam. 
<P>
One way to provide for enough liquidity at the time of the owner's death is life insurance. Adopting lifetime gifting strategies, whereby stock ownership is transferred during the owner's lifetime, is another method. And there are many others. 
<P>
The important point is to have an estate-tax strategy in place before the owner dies, and the earlier the better. The annual amount an individual will pay for a fixed amount of life insurance, for example, increases as a person ages. So it pays to plan early.
<P>
That's the easy part, with some help from qualified planners.
<P>
The decision to involve the second generation is the difficult one and often causes business owners to delay succession planning. Do the kids get the business? Or will it be sold to employees?
<P>
"It's absolutely crazy that for people who are so focused on making their business a success, this is the last thing they think about," says Jon Peters, vice president of Cigna Financial Advisors in Pittsburgh. 
<P>
<P>
Some questions to consider: Are the children qualified? Are they even interested? Sometimes family politics get pretty heated when trying to answer those questions.
<P>
"You almost have to have a clinical psychologist come in and evaluate everyone," Peters says, tongue in cheek. "These are delicate issues. For one, you have to find out whether the children can get along with other people."
<P>
In Sheetz's case, he's confident the second generation will work together as well as the current management team does.  The Sheetz business started in 1952 with one dairy store. Now there are more than 170.
<P>
"Our ideas are basically the same," Sheetz says. "People have different opinions, but we come out galvanized. Different ideas don't hurt, as long          as you come out with one idea in         the end."
<P>
If the second generation doesn't show potential or interest, it's best to evaluate the other options, experts say. But some business owners are so hell-bent on passing a business to children that they neglect to analyze the fate to which they may be dooming the business.
<P.
"Look beyond your heartstrings," advises Raymond H. Buehler Jr., a certified public accountant with the Pittsburgh accounting firm Schneider Downs. "You are facing two systems: the family system and the business   system. You can include family members in the company's wealth, but they do not have to be part of the future management."

<FONT SIZE=+1>Out-of-Town Firms Are Stealing Business And the Local Talent</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Earl Bohn</i></b>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Lawyering was a profession still known for its stability in 1974, the year Chuck Brodbeck earned his law degree from Princeton and joined the bar.
In fact, some might say the legal community in Pittsburgh in those days was just plain static.</B>
<P>
"People thought they would join a firm and spend the rest of their careers there. In terms of scale, the older members made the most; your production was not so important as the number of years you'd been with the firm," says Brodbeck, president of Cohen & Grigsby, a Pittsburgh firm with just over 60 attorneys.
<P>
Times change, and law is no exception. In any business where competitive forces take hold, those who produce and contribute to the enterprise will be rewarded or they will move on.
<P>
"In the mid to late 1980s, that began to be recognized," Brodbeck says. "No longer did seniority rule."
<P>
Nor does it today, if the swirl of players on the chessboard is any indication.
<P>
Over the last decade, that near continual movement of lawyers from one firm to another, plus the addition of a number of out-of-town firms, has upped the ante for the western Pennsylvania legal community. In the words of Chuck Brodbeck, "the economics of the practice of law has changed."
<P>
No single development can explain the movement, but without a doubt an evolution is under way. For law firms, it's this simple: Take care of rising stars or risk losing them to a competitor.
<P>
<h2>More Competition</h2>
There can be no doubt that 
the competition is growing. Consider these recent additions to the legal 
community:
<DL>	
<LI>Philadelphia stalwart Pepper Hamilton & Sheetz opened a Pittsburgh office, anchored by three commercial litigation stars from Doepken Keevican & Weiss.
	
<LI>Prominent Pittsburgh attorney Marvin Lieber led a group of corporate tax and healthcare specialists from Klett Lieber Rooney & Schorling to create an independent Pittsburgh firm a year ago. It recently affiliated with Philadelphia's Obermayer Rebmann Maxwell & Hippel.
<LI>Another Philadelphia firm, Marshall Dennehey Warner Coleman & Goggin, assembled a new Pittsburgh office two years ago around the prac-tice of veteran litigator Brennan Hart, formerly of Zimmer Kunz Loughren   & Hart.
<LI>In 1990, the New York labor and employment law specialists of Jackson Lewis Schmitzler & Krupman sent Lynn C. Outwater to open and manage a Pittsburgh office.
<LI>Shortly before that, in January 1989, the megafirm Jones Day Reavis & Pogue dispatched Erie native and Pitt Law School graduate Paul Michael "Mickey" Pohl to Pittsburgh to open an office that will number 45 lawyers when the current crop of outgoing judicial clerks arrive.
</DL>
<P>
Of course, Pittsburgh's major firms have long-established beachheads in Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. And they, too,   hire the local talent. For example, Pittsburgh's Klett Lieber hired        attorneys away from Pepper Hamilton when Klett Lieber opened its Philadelphia office.
<P>
<h2>Why Here?</h2>

In the eyes of some observers, the people of Pittsburgh and western Pennsylvania have refreshing qualities that would seem to lend a bit more  dignity, if you will, to lawyering in     this region.
<P>
"You have a very strong work ethic in western Pennsylvania. The people are not litigious. They're not out looking for people to sue," says Brennan Hart of Marshall Dennehey. 
<P>
"If they've been injured, they want to be compensated fairly, but they don't look at a lawsuit as a way to supplement their income or retire early, whereas in other parts of the country that's the way it is. You often see that in the big Eastern cities, like Philadelphia, New York and Boston, and in Florida and California. You'll find them to be far more litigious. 
<P>
"That's not the mentality of western Pennsylvania, or of most of Pennsylvania for that matter. This is still a fairly conservative jurisdiction."
<P>
At the same time, Pittsburgh has one of the highest concentrations of lawyers per capita in the nation. The Allegheny County Bar Association is the only one in the country that provides career counseling to lawyers. "And we are probably one of the few bar associations left in the United States that bothers with lawyer placements," says ACBA Executive Director James I. Smith.
<P>
"Up until about the early 1980s, I had as many openings for lawyers as I had applicants," Smith says. "Today, I have 200 people looking for work, and most of them are out of work rather than looking to move from their current position to another one."
<P>
The relatively non-litigious character of western Pennsylvanians seems all the more noteworthy when combined with the region's high concentrations of attorneys.
<P>
"We have probably right now one lawyer for every 100 to 130 residents. Of course, the first city in this category is Washington, D.C., but they count bureaucrats, so I'd have to say Pittsburgh is first," Smith says.
<P>
Considering the rule of thumb that only one out of every five people ever consult an attorney, "it doesn't take a genius to realize there isn't enough work to go around. The established firms are doing well, but it's a real problem for the youngsters coming out today," Smith says.
<P>
And therein lies a major distinction between the market for legal talent, which seems to be weak here due to the oversupply of lawyers, and the market for high-quality legal services, which would seem to be anything but weak if the arrival of out-of-town firms and the continued growth of certain native firms is any indication.
<P>
"Everybody seems to be busy at the firms I know," says George M. Medved, managing partner of the 3-month-old Pittsburgh office of Pepper Hamilton & Sheetz, a 105-year-old Philadelphia firm with 275 lawyers in nine cities.
<P>
But it is more than demand for high-quality legal services that is bringing law firms from other cities into Pittsburgh. Firms also face the increasingly discriminating taste of corporate clients.
<P>
"It used to be, and it still is in some instances, that the general counsel of a large corporation would go to New York and hire the biggest law firms he could find under the perception that he could never be criticized for hiring a named firm from New York," Lieber says.
<P>
"But those firms are very expensive, and don't necessarily get better results."
<P>
Now, corporations are retaining fewer outside law firms at any one time, and the ones they use tend to  be based closer to the company's   headquarters. Lawyers must learn all they can about their clients' businesses and how their in-house law departments function. Clients encourage the learning, but they     don't want to pay for the continual education of one new face after   another flying in from the outside counsel's home office. The result:     The firms set up shop where their clients are located. For some, that means setting up shop in Pittsburgh.
<P>
"In the old days, clients would have one or two lawyers in house,  passing out the work to firms. Now, with the overabundance of talent, clients have built up big talented staffs that they expect you [the outside firm] to work with," says Mickey Pohl of Jones Day. 
<P>
"There has been a fundamental restructuring in the way law firms distribute their services to the premier clients," Pohl says. "It's too easy to put lawyers on a plane and send them to the client. Now they want to have offices where the clients are."
<P>

<h2>The Newcomers</h2>

It pays to have lawyers on staff who know the personality of a city and understand the ins and outs of getting things done. Thus, outside firms looking to open an office will try to lure attorneys who have an established client base and know the legal terrain.
<P>
"Some of the early firms tried bringing in their own lawyers, but fell on their face. Then the firms started getting smart and began hiring locally," says the bar association's Smith. 
<P>
In some cases, attorneys find working in Pittsburgh for a firm that is based in another city to be exactly what they want.
<P>
"A lot of lawyers feel that being a lawyer -- not necessarily a partner -- at a satelite office of a large firm is the best of both worlds. They have the resources of the larger firm, but have a smaller environment where they have more control," says Lori Carpenter, principal of Carpenter Legal Search, a firm that recruits attorneys for law firms.
<P>
Pepper Hamilton had been considering a Pittsburgh office for quite some time because of the number of clients whose legal affairs touched western Pennsylvania. George Medved and his partners Thomas W. Trimm and Barry J. Trilling left the former Doepken Keevican Weiss & Medved to open Pepper Hamilton's new office. They brought some clients with them, and added them to the ones Pepper Hamilton already had in Pittsburgh to form an instantly viable operation.
<P>
"It became a natural event," Medved says. "I wouldn't say we're not open to new clients, but it's not a situation where we came here just to prospect for business."
<P>
The new office has four partners, including former state representative David W. Sweet, whose former legislative district covers parts of Washington County. Sweet concentrates on affairs in Harrisburg. Pepper Hamilton's Pittsburgh office also includes four associate attorneys.
<P>
Medved adds to the expertise in construction law that Pepper Hamilton already had in its Philadelphia office. The specialties of Trimm and Trilling -- environmental law being one -- give the firm reason to anticipate hiring additional lawyers in the next few months. Pepper Hamilton is looking for candidates among small firms and private practitioners, and the amount of business the candidates bring is not necessarily the top criterion.
<P>
"The emphasis is not so much on the business as the quality of the person as a lawyer," Medved says. "Another tangible factor is the ability of the person to fit within the firm's culture."
<P>
Take, for example, veteran Pittsburgh attorney George Yokitis, who now is managing partner of the Pittsburgh office opened one year ago by Schnader Harrison Segal & Lewis of Philadelphia. The 60-year-old Phila-delphia firm prides itself on soundly reasoned litigation by 230 lawyers who include nationally prominent members of the profession.
<P>
Enter Yokitis, who bootstrapped himself out of a tiny coal mining town in southwestern Pennsylvania with a college football scholarship. He used that opportunity to become one of the region's top environmental litigators while retaining personal qualities that endear him to members of the bar.
<P>
"It's an ideal firm if you believe that there's nothing more important  to a lawyer than quality work," Yokitis says. 
<P>
Schnader Harrison opened here on Aug. 1, 1994, with Yokitis and one other partner, Mindy Shreve, who also specializes in environmental litigation. This spring, Phillip Binotto Jr. merged his Washington, Pa., practice with the firm, and brought two other lawyers as new Schnader Harrison associates.
<P>
Lawyers will tell you that not every firm makes quality its top priority. As one veteran of the Allegheny County bar says, "Some firms are more entrepreneurial than others."
<P>

<h2>The Talent</h2>

The notion that the legal services industry today is first and foremost a business runs counter to a die-hard perception of the law as a calling that lifts its practitioners above matters as petty as self enrichment. 
<P>
That rosy perception rides the lips of both law school students when they're endeavoring to be frank and to some senior partners when they're pitching hard to prospective clients. 
<P>
In fact, every day a lawyer somewhere files a petition, argues a brief or jousts with a creditor, a judge or a plaintiff's attorney on behalf of a pro bono client or a client with shallow pockets and a fee payment schedule that stretches over the horizon. Those practitioners know full well that the profit margin on the services being rendered can be, well, gross. 
<P>
And in towns from Erie to Waynesburg, in counties and parishes from New Jersey to Louisiana to Oregon, there can be found career prosecutors willing to avow that their careers are well spent hounding serial rapists, thieves and drunken drivers. Likewise, there are career public defenders who believe society is better because they force prosecutors to prove their cases beyond a reasonable doubt. They stay in the public sector despite the knowledge that their houses could be bigger, their vacations more luxurious and their kids better schooled if they would trade their mantles of respectability for the mantras of the big firms. 
<P>
They content themselves with $850-a-week paychecks. But sooner or later, as they contemplate their tuition loan repayment schedules or their middle ages at a Medieval law department in a moribund corporation or the swelling pension plans of their elderly senior partners, most attorneys must ask themselves, "Couldn't I be making more money?"
<P>
Those who act on the question seem to be gaining ground on those who do not. The movement of lawyers and the arrival of firms from other cities are, as Brodbeck of Cohen & Grigsby sees it, proper functions of the market for legal talent.
<P>
"Midsize firms are going to have substantial difficulty maintaining themselves unless they're specialized, due to the cost of technology and the general economics of law firm practice," Brodbeck says.
<P>
In addition, the mid-1970s aren't so far in the past that the culture of seniority-above-all-else has been erased entirely. Within certain firms, as a consequence, "some departments are supporting many other departments," Brodbeck says.
<P>
Mickey Pohl of Jones Day echoes that sentiment.
<P>
"Pittsburgh is viewed from afar as a town of wonderfully talented lawyers who don't manage themselves well. The older ones take out the money and don't reward the younger associates. The history of this town has been young lawyers spinning off" and forming their own firms, he says.
<P>
"Look at the groups that have gone off on their own. They tend to be the good ones who left the top of their firms."
<P.
Those departures, on occasion, have come as body blows to the firm being left behind by its bright young stars. In one instance not many years ago, a senior partner is said to have broken down in tears upon receiving the news that his best stallions had crashed the gate of the corral.
<P>
"What seems to be happening now, more than ever, firms are being approached by unhappy lawyers who want to move," says Carpenter, the recruiter "These are lawyers in other firms who feel they don't have much control over their situation or compensation. Others looking to move have larger practices but don't have the support of larger offices."
<P>
Among the reasons Jones Day had for opening its Pittsburgh office was that the city's major firms "had a reputation for being excellent lawyers, but a little reluctant to work with in-house lawyers." Even in other states, Pitts-burgh and Philadelphia firms had a reputation for being "good but a little bit arrogant," Pohl said. 
<P>
It's an attitude that can't survive   in today's swirling competition for business.
<P>
"There are more lawyers than the world needs or than there is work to support, so you get turmoil," Pohl    says.

<P align=center><h2>The New Practice Concentration: Construction Law</h2>

The evolution of the law has been a factor for many lawyers, particularly George Medved, who has carved out a niche in construction law after helping represent the Port Authority of Allegheny County in disputes arising from the construction of the light rail transit system in the 1980s. 
<P>
Other firms also have attorneys who concentrate a portion of their practice on this emerging area        of law. For example, Tucker Arensberg's Gary P. Hunt does a good deal of work in construction cases, which often focus on the costs associated with projects when they are late being finished. 
<P>
"If you're the owner, the delay causes you to lose the revenue you'd make if the operation opened on time. If you're the contractor, the delay requires you to keep personnel and equipment in the field longer than planned," Medved says. "In the early 1980s, there were probably only 15 practitioners in Pittsburgh. Now the county bar association has started a construction law section."
<P>
ACBA Executive Director  James I. Smith chuckles at the recollection of a call he got from lawyers at Babst Calland Clements & Zomnir who specialize in construction law and said the field was expanding so rapidly it deserved to have a special section of its own with the bar association.
<P>
"Back in April, they said, `We're getting big enough that we want to form a committee.' Generally, anybody who can put together 25 or 30 lawyers has really got something. I thought maybe they'd get 40. We advertised for an organizational meeting, and I'll be a son of a gun, right now they've got well over 100."
<P>
The growth, which is not peculiar to Pittsburgh, stands to reason as owners write increasingly detailed performance incentives and delay penalties into their contracts. Even without the trend to tighter parameters on contractor performance, it would be a noteworthy feat to pull off a project like the construction of Pittsburgh's new airport terminal without a lawsuit being filed over something.

<h2>Seven Reasons Why Partners Explore New Employment Opportunities</h2>

<OL>

<LI>The partner feels he or she is not making a fair salary.

<LI>The partner's role in firm decision-making is limited.

<LI>The partner wants more control over the development of the practice.

<LI>The partner is not getting the administrative or associate support needed to build a practice.   

<LI>Many firms still compensate partners on the basis of seniority.  Thus, less senior partners leave for firms that reward a partner for the business he or she generates. 

<LI>Young partners feel some mid-level partners are not pulling their weight. 

<LI>Another firm may be starting a new practice area, offering the young partner immediate power as head of the new group if he or she jumps ship.

<FONT SIZE=+1>How a Weak Pennsylvania Law Places Children in Day Care Centers in Peril</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Jim Urban <FILL></i></b>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE><br>

It was the sweltering summer heat that slowly drained life from 4-year-old Alexandra LeVasseur. While under the care of the Creation Station Day Care Center located south of Pittsburgh, Alexandra was left sleeping in a van following a field trip to Pittsburgh. The co-owner of the facility simply forgot about the young girl, who died of heat stroke about 23 hours later.
<P>
State public welfare department workers inspected the Creation Station the next day and found too many children and too few day care counselors. The state had licensed Creation Station to care for 29 children, but counted 33 children during the inspection. The number of counselors fell two short of what the state required.
<P>
The welfare department shut down the center -- obviously deserved in light of what had happened to Alexandra the day before.
<P>
But in many cases, day care center operators across Pennsylvania exceed capacity or violate state-mandated staff-child ratios and receive little more than a reprimand. 
<P>
Don't blame the welfare department. Child care experts say the welfare department is just enforcing the weak, ineffective law that was legislated by Harrisburg lawmakers.
<P>
How weak?
<P>
"I believe there is no incentive for these day care centers to not cut corners," says Martha Isler, who once headed the state's Bureau of Child Development and now is director of the YWCA's Child Care Partnership in Pittsburgh. 
<P>
"It's a minority of day care providers who are abusing the process," Isler says. "But even if it's only, say, 10 percent -- with 350 licensed centers in Allegheny County alone -- 35 could be operating outside the health and safety standards.
<P>
"When you are talking about reducing risk to children, that 10 percent that is not in compliance is an unacceptable percentage," Isler says.
<P>
"I certainly agree that the law needs more teeth," adds Louise Sutton, director of the public welfare department's western region, which covers   23 counties. 
<P>
"The law is an antiquated law," Sutton says. "We do need better enforcement powers."
<P>
And soon. Day care is a booming industry. One recent count showed 3,697 licensed group homes or day care centers in Pennsylvania that care for seven or more children. Another 4,132 registered family day care homes care for four to six children. Expect those numbers to grow hand in hand with the increasing number of working parents and single parents.
<P>
<h2>A Weak Law</h2>
Under the Pennsylvania Public Welfare Code, the welfare department has several options when it finds a day care provider to be skirting laws and regulations.
<P>
A common step for repeat violators is downgrading the center's license to provisional status, which for the most part only puts the center on notice that it is out of compliance.
<P>
In more serious cases, the state can issue a cease and desist order in an effort to close a center, but the center retains the right to appeal, a lengthy process during which the center may remain open.
<P>
Then there is injunctive relief, under which the state seeks a court order to immediately close down the center. Good luck.
<P>
"We had a situation in the dead of winter a few years back," Sutton recalls. "There were infants in a day care center with no heat. They had to keep winter clothing on inside the facility. We asked for injunctive relief to close the center, but a judge denied it."
<P>
The only real power the welfare department has is to effectuate an emergency closure, as it did at Creation Station. But Section 1031 of the Public Welfare Code strictly limits such action to cases where immediate life-threatening danger is evident.
<P>
Complicating matters, the welfare department has to consider two distinct audiences when deciding whether it should even attempt to close down a facility. Along with the operators, the other audience is comprised of working parents who pay to have their children in day care. If a center is closed down, the parents are thrown into sudden hardship, trying to secure another place for Junior to go at 7 a.m. the next morning. It's not an easy task, especially in cases involving single parents.
<P>
As a result, the closures have been reserved for drastic cases, usually following incidents such as the one involving Alexandra LeVasseur. That same week, the Grandmom's House day care center on Pittsburgh's North Side voluntarily closed after a 4-year-old girl under that center's care           was found inside a locked van in         90-plus degree heat outside of a rollerskating rink.
<P>
But most day care centers cited   for overcapacity or staff-child ratio  violations are able to go about busi-ness as usual.
<P>
"There is no negative sanction, whatsoever," Isler says. "The day care providers are merely handed a piece    of paper that tells them to come        into compliance."
<P>
Compared to laws in other states, Pennsylvania's legislation has several shortcomings. Most notably:
<DL>
<LI>The state public welfare department has absolutely no authority to levy fines against licensed providers. Only unlicensed providers can be fined, $300 per day. In           some other states, licensed providers face fines for violating health and     safety regulations such as staff-child ratio violations.
<LI>There are no provisions for the public welfare department to suspend the licenses and temporarily close a facility for serious violations. Isler, Sutton and others believe such a measure, with proper enforcement, would motivate providers to follow the letter of the law.
<P>
North Carolina's law, for instance, allows for both suspensions and fines of up to $1,000 for violations committed by licensed providers.
<P>
"We use it -- not real frequently, but we use it," says Talitha Wright, chief of eastern regulatory services for the North Carolina Division of Child Development.
<P>
"Primarily, it's not a one-time thing," Wright says. "We use it for repeated violations."
<P>
Pennsylvania will use it the same way, if Sutton has her way. Her staff currently is building profiles of day care operators to include a history of past violations. Those centers that routinely have violated staff-child ratios or have been over capacity would be the first to face the penalties.
<P>
"Until a penalty affects their   pocketbook or their business, it won't carry any significance to the licensed providers," Sutton says. "Fines will send a clear message about the importance of the regulations. Fines will tell providers they must protect children in their care. Fines will tell providers the welfare department is serious about enforcement.
<P>
"As for suspensions? Thirty days would be meaningful," Sutton says. "Parents might be able to take a day off if the center is suspended for one day, but what parents can take off 30 days? When parents have to cover 30 days, they would shop elsewhere and that would affect that facility's business."
<P>
For the fines or suspensions to be  effective, child advocates say  inspectors must have the power to levy them on the spot, similar to the power police officers have to issue traffic citations.
<P>
That's one thing lawmakers forgot about in North Carolina, where fining day care centers is a lengthy process filled with plenty of paperwork and bureaucratic review. Sometimes, the cost of collecting a fine in North Carolina exceeds the actual fine, according to Wright.
<P>
"If it were more immediate, it would have more of an impact,"  Wright says.
<P>
<h2>Not So Fast</h2>

Natalie Kaplan considers herself lucky. She runs a large day care center with ample staff to allow her to move people around and compensate when a staffer is off sick.
<P>
"We just had a problem where one of the staff came to work with an eye problem,"  says Kaplan, who runs the Carriage House in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood. "We had to get    her out because if she has pink eye,    she cannot be near the children. Fortunately, I have a large center. We had to move a person over, but if we didn't have flexibility, we would have been one child over the staff-child ratio.
<P>
"These things happen. I'm sure the licensing agents see some centers that really are not the better centers. They feel frustrated," Kaplan says.
<P>
The problem is, according to Kaplan, that most day care centers do not enjoy the staff flexibility she enjoys, so they are more apt to cut corners when a staffer is out sick. These same centers are operating on shoe string budgets, so a fine levied against them would only further complicate their situation.
<P>
"A lot of day care operators don't have any money. If they get a fine, it's difficult," Kaplan says. "At the same time, I can understand how the licensing agents feel. There are always people out there trying to get away with more than they should. It's a real Catch 22."
<P>
The welfare department's Sutton says her workers understand that anything from illness to bad weather can put a day care center in a temporary staffing bind. She says penalties probably won't be levied is those cases.
<P>
It's the centers that repeatedly cut corners that she is after.
<P>
<h2>The Corner Cutters</h2>

On June 28, a 4-year-old autistic boy drowned in a pool behind a day care center just outside of Wilkes-Barre, Luzerne County. The welfare department determined that the owner of the center, Mable Roper, 63, had been watching 10 children by herself. State law required a second staffer.
<P>
What's more, state licensing agents conducted a sweep of every day care center in Luzerne County in the weeks that followed the drowning. The results were shocking: All but four of the 71 centers were found to be in some sort of violation.
<P>
Or were those numbers so shocking? Many day care centers operate by the book. But at the same time, these recent incidents show that other day care providers are cutting corners.
<P>
And consider this: State welfare regulations require the welfare department to forewarn centers when licensing agents will be conducting their annual inspection.
<P>
"Even when people know we are coming, we can end up with 11 pages of violations," Sutton says. "If they don't know, imagine what would be evident."
<P>
A simple business strategy calls for maximizing revenue while reducing costs. For some day care centers, that means caring for more children than the number permitted under the license. It also means employing as few caregivers as possible, sometimes less than what the state requires.
<P>
Sound familiar? 
<P>
Creation Station, where Alex-andra LeVasseur was left inside the van, had more children than permitted and less staff than required by law. And don't underestimate the graveness of those violations,  experts say.
<P>
"There should be automatic suspensions for violations concerning being over capacity or ignoring the staff-child ratios," Isler says. "These are the most serious violations.
<P>
"The question of how many children can be handled by an adult is well researched. Imagine during an emergency if you are caring for four infants and you have to get them out of a building during a fire. Imagine trying to get six or eight out of a building. What if they are toddlers, running every which direction?"
<P>

<h2>The Legislators' Part</h2>

At presstime, it was unclear whether child advocates would get the changes in the law that they desire. State Sen. Michael Fisher, a Republican from Upper St. Clair, started the ball rolling in August by calling for public hearings to investigate the western Pennsylvania incidents. Fisher says he wants to examine the training of day care workers and regulation and licensing of day care facilities.
<P>
Those in the day care industry complained quietly that Fisher was blindly jumping into the day care foray without really knowing the issues. Fisher himself was noncommittal when queried about how Pennsyl-vania's public welfare law lacks in comparison to other states.
<P>
"I am not a big proponent of new regulation," Fisher says. "But, that's an issue that needs to be looked at. I am not sure that our law, which is directed towards licensing, is adequate. It may not be adequate. It may not be much more than a lot of paperwork. A lot of paperwork does not mean that the facilities are safe. Is it really the level of care that parents want for their kids?"
<P>
In the meantime, the welfare department says it is increasing the number of unannounced visits and stepping up action against the licenses of serious violators. 
<P>

<h2>The Parents' Part</h2>

Even if legislators beef up the law, it still won't be foolproof. Child care experts say parents will have to do their part, which includes picking a good center to begin with and then holding that center to certain standards.
<P>
When Ellen Wein searched for a day care center for her two daughters, Amy and Robin, she treated the task as if her daughters' lives depended on the decision. In fact, they do.
<P>
"I left no stone unturned," says Wein, vice president of Jampole Communications Inc., a Pittsburgh public relations firm.
<P>
"I did the same type of research I would do for a project at work. I scrutinized alternatives. I asked a lot of questions. I inspected on-site, showing up unannounced to see how I was received and to catch daily activities at the center.
<P>
"There were some centers where there would an be adult sitting on a couch, then they would see me coming with an administrator and it would be like someone just turned them on. They all of a sudden would start interacting with the children. That's bad.
<P>
"At other centers, it seemed like the adults outnumbered the children. That's appealing."
<P>
Once Wein weeded the good from the bad, she was left with her finalists, about whom she conducted background checks to make sure they did not have excessive run-ins with the public welfare department. None did.
<P>
Until state licensing agents have more power to regulate centers, parents must be aggressive in investigating and eventually choosing the day care center that cares for their children. It's best to be deliberate in your search, as Wein and others have been.
<P>
"Our selection process was pretty lengthy," says Bob Bailey, a specifications architect for Williams Trebilock Whitehead. Bailey and his wife have a   4-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, in         day care.
<P>
"A lot of it had to do with the atmosphere of the place and the kind of connection you see between the caregivers and the kids," Bailey says. "We visited places where the impression was that the kids were dumped off, the kids were there, and for the caregivers, it was just a job. There was no connection with the kids whatsoever. You can sense it."
<P>
Sandy Lancia, art director for the St. George Group in Pittsburgh, had to find a day care facility after giving birth to twins, Ross and Michelle, about 2 1/2 years ago. She eventually narrowed the choice to three, at which point she also researched the public welfare department's record of violations by the finalists. Like Wein, she too found nothing alarming and eventually used other factors to chose the center where her children now spend their days.
<P>
Unfortunately, surveys show that the majority of parents choose a day care center based on cost and location. Instead, parents should be more concerned about ratios and the quality of caregivers, child care experts say.
<P>
Many centers staff beyond what the state requires, lessening the chance of the staff being outnumbered, as was Creation Station the day Alexandra LeVasseur was left in the hot van.
<P>
"I don't think there is any excuse for not being able to meet the staff-child ratios," says Wein. "Whether it be for safety, for discipline, for learning -- there are all sorts of reasons to have all hands on deck.
<P>
"Some people won't place their children in a day care center because they don't like the way the place looks," Wein adds. "To hell with how the rooms are decorated. If there are more adults than children there, I am willing to pay for that."
<P>
It doesn't stop there, according to the welfare department's Sutton. Parents are in and out of the centers every day, so they are the best to notice potential problems. When that happens, they should pick up the telephone.
<P>
"We have to do a better job of letting parents know what the regulations are so they can help us in the enforcement," Sutton says. "They can call us and let us know if there is insufficient staff. 
<P>
"Changing the law will help, but there is a whole range of things to be addressed to make day care more enforceable, to make the system safe and to protect children in day care."
<P>
Until these changes take place, some day care centers will continue to cut corners. And young children will still be in danger.
<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+3><IMG ALIGN=middle SRC="../pictures/publisher.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2>Politics As Usual? </FONT SIZE>
<i> By Linda A. Dickerson - Publisher </i></b><P>


<P>
The job of the politicians should be to combat the myriad problems in today's society. Alarming increases in youth violence, a lack of economic vibrancy, waning job opportunities and a pervasive sense of hopelessness evidence that ours is no longer a civil society. But instead, politicians use sound bites to battle each other. 
<P>
As campaign signs emerge on the landscape and political messages crowd the airwaves, I think of my own brief foray into politics.
<P>
Several days before the primary election, anonymous phone calls in-formed  Republican voters throughout the county that my health was failing.  Major broadcast media received anonymous calls indicating that I was hospitalized and in serious condition. At strategically identified polls, voters, many of them my friends, were pulled aside and told of my failing health. 
<P>
My phones rang repeatedly with calls about my well-being. But aside from the knot that formed in my stomach when I realized the reprehensible behavior that the political system permits, I was perfectly fine. I have had a physical disability since birth, but no serious, ongoing medical problems.
<P>
We are fighting the wrong enemy, destroying our political leaders before they take office. Respect must be re-stored to the practice of politics.
<P>
Fact: People are increasingly apathetic about the political process. Less than half of all adults are registered to vote. Though it was a beautiful day, less than 45% of those registered voted in the last primary election. 
<P>
No wonder. The public has fewer quality choices. Well-qualified people are discouraged by the experience of those who ran before them. They know history repeats itself.
<P>
A more discerning public wouldn't be fooled. Today's public, distanced from the political process by its inanity, must champion progressive approaches and demand integrity. Instead, principled leadership is a rare commodity, because today's politicians exchange their scruples for success. The price of admission to politics is years of stuffing envelopes or playing bingo. If this region needs to get out a bulk mailing in a hurry, trust me, several current leaders can handle the challenge.
<P>
"That's politics," we say, ultimately protecting the absence of humanity and civility in the political process. Conduct which is totally unacceptable elsewhere is condoned under the banner of politics.
<P>
Well, people get what they deserve. As long as the public tolerates abhorrent behavior between aspiring politicians, we will have politics as usual.
<P>

<B><P align=center><font size=+3>Competion</font><BR>
<font size=+2>We Need More Of It, Not Less </font><BR>
<i> By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</i></b>

<HR>
<P>
I once had a newspaper carrier who managed to deliver the Sunday edition just before noon, but well after my coffee was cold and  bagels hard. I wanted to relax and read the paper. Instead, I waited for the carrier to arrive.
<P>
The problem? There was no competition. He delivered when he wanted to deliver. Complaints fell on deaf ears. My other option was to drive to a store and purchase a copy. It's not the most attractive option in the middle of winter, minutes after climbing out of bed. 
<P>
Competition is crucial to our society. Competition allows the consumer to receive top quality goods or services and rewards those who supply those goods or services. 
<P>
For good reason, we talk about competition throughout this month's issue of Executive Report.
<P>
Take the legal community: Out of town firms are opening satellite offices in Pittsburgh. Some are hiring established attorneys who bring with them a Rolodex full of business. Not only is there competition between firms for business, there's also competition between firms for quality attorneys. Some attorneys who feel they are undervalued by their current employer will jump to other firms for more money or power. Good for them.
<P>
Then there's the healthcare community. Our cover shows two football helmets banging against one another. One is symbolic of Blue Cross and the other of HealthAmerica. Both are engaged in a price war right now that is having a trickle-down effect on the consumer.
<P>
This rivalry between Blue Cross and HealthAmerica has become a touchy subject for some. When Executive Report staffers were mulling over illustration ideas for this month's cover, Blue Cross expressed concern that we might depict it as being on the same level as HealthAmerica. Don't let us mislead you. As Lydia Strohl reports in the story that begins on page 24, Blue Cross definitely is the dominant carrier in this region, with a market share approaching 65 percent.
<P>
As for the quality of actual care? We find no reason to stray from a presumption that both Blue Cross and HealthAmerica provide quality healthcare with minimal administrative headaches for the consumer.
<P>
But what if one did not meet the standards set by the consumer? That's a critical question. What choices would the consumer have? Where could the consumer turn for better quality or service? Without ample competition, our options are limited.
<P>
Some observers think Blue Cross will further cement its dominance in this market. I don't think we want one carrier running away with this market. That leaves power resting in one place. Again, that likely would mean fewer options for the consumer.
<P>
Consider what happened last spring at the University of Pittsburgh: The university opted to give Blue Cross an exclusive contract for all of Pitt's healthcare business. Pitt already was fighting stagnant enrollment and stingy state legislators who wanted to minimize funding for the school. Pitt found it could save millions on the expense side of its budget by dealing exclusively with Blue Cross. An added benefit was the amount of business funneled into Pitt Medical Center, which has a PPO joint-venture with Blue Cross.
<P>
The contract angered many of Pitt's 6,500 employees, 76 percent of whom had voted to retain their choice of provider before the deal went through. About 5,000 employees who were enrolled in HealthAmerica were switched to Blue Cross. Many employees complained that they were left with no choices.
<P>
We, as healthcare consumers, should want to retain some of the power that competition gives to us. In the end, competition will not only ensure the quality of our healthcare, but it will also help contain costs.
<P>
This isn't a slam on Blue Cross. I sincerely hope that Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania will remain the thriving entity it already is. But here also is a vote for HealthAmerica, US Healthcare, Aetna and any other health insurer that is trying to make a go of it in the western Pennsylvania market. 
<P>
Competition is good. We need it in this healthcare market.
<P>
Long live the rivalries.
<P>

Bravo!
<P>
Your editorial on "Don't Fight Innovation in our Schools" is just 
what the doctor ordered.

<h4>				Helen Sobehart
				Fox Chapel School District</h4>
<HR>
Great article!

Know that I will have provided all the superintendents with a copy. 
Thanks for supporting public education.

<h4>				Joseph Lagana
				Executive Director
				Allegheny Intermediate Unit</h4>
<HR>
I very much enjoyed reading your valuable remarks in the August 1995 
Publisher's Note. The thoughts expressed very much echo my own sentiments 
when I have said time and again -- "Everybody wants school improvement but 
no one will allow school change to occur."

<h4>				Joseph C. Dimperio
			 	Superintendent of Schools
		 		West Mifflin Area School District</h4>
<HR>
The message of not fighting change in schools is such an important 
one and it's nice to see these words coming from a wide variety of 
speakers and reaching different audiences.

Some national official recently observed that the entire curriculum 
of Columbia University would fit on one CD-ROM. I make this observation 
to support Jim Urban's contention that an undergraduate education is 
probably overpriced, particularly in light of the advances in technology 
and the practical quality of the education product in today's exciting 
economy.

Not only are our college graduates burdened by debt just to pay for 
their college education, but they also accumulate an additional burden 
of credit card debts.

College students today are given credit cards like some people give 
candy to children. It is not unusual to find a college student carrying 
a MasterCard, Visa and a Discover Card, in addition to their retail 
store credit cards.

Unfortunately, they have very little self-control and even less income. 
This combination creates poor habits, and they then develop poor credit 
ratings.

While we are educating our young people as to the burden of student 
loan indebtedness, don't forget to educate them about the equally 
crushing burden of consumer loan indebtedness.

<b><P align=center><font size=+2>A Vote For Specter</font></b><P>
 
In February 1994, our firm, Compunetix Inc., installed a large 
teleconferencing system as part of the Air Traffic Control System 
Command Center in Herndon, Va. The system was accepted by the Federal 
Aviation Administration on March 26, 1994. The delivery was timed to
coincide with the grand opening of the new FAA facility.

Unfortunately, the contractual instruments had not been made definite 
because of continuing changes in the FAA requirements. Negotiations were 
marred by continuing, frustrating delays. Of course, Compunetix could 
not support the FAA's operations without payments. The FAA's ability 
to support national air traffic was placed into jeopardy.

In April, more than one year after the system acceptance, Compunetix 
brought the situation to the attention of U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter (R.-Pa.).

Sen. Specter immediately went to work. As a result, the acquisition 
department of the FAA recognized the seriousness of the situation 
and focused its resources on this negotiation. The contract was 
executed on July 21, 1995. Projected revenues under this contract 
exceed $7.3 million.

Compunetix expresses its sincere gratitude to Sen. Specter for his 
prompt and intelligent attention to the needs of Compunetix and of 
the FAA. This is one more sign of Sen. Specter's sensitivity to the 
relevance of the high technology industry in Pennsylvania.

<P align=center><font size=+2>For Small Business, the Awaiting Beasts Include Litigation, Regulation and Taxation</font><br>
 <i>By Neil F. Fogarty</b></i>
<HR>

<P>
Developing a small business? Welcome to the jungle. 
<P>
In this wilderness ruled by the world's most merciless tigers (litigation, regulation and taxation), small enterprises are amongst the must vulnerable of creatures, while new ventures constitute even weaker prey. Large companies groan, but at least they have the resources to shield themselves. Small and new companies have no such armor.
<P>
Numerous studies have concluded that job growth and economic development are heavily dependent on small businesses. Particularly in our area, a locale scarred by closed mills and limping from layoffs, small business development is vital. As a community, we must find a path that leads to secure and prosperous careers for all families. That's the path to small business development. But, we will fail miserably unless we change the disastrous small business environment. 
<P>
Pennsylvania ranks last in new business development and, within    our state, Pittsburgh ranks near the bottom. The problems hindering small business are obvious.
<P>
Take the litigious tiger. In the United States, a lawsuit is filed every 30 seconds.The average legal fee to defend a business through trial is $50,000. The average legal rate in Pittsburgh is around $200 an hour, and a local attorney was quoted recently as saying that he thought that a fee of $325 an        hour -- plus expenses, of course -- was "reasonably cheap"! In light of these, how can a small business afford to defend itself? Further, many of those who sue a small business are not paying such fees -- instead they are represented by attorneys who squawk, "There is no fee unless we collect for you." Why shouldn't someone seek a million dollar recourse because the coffee was too hot -- the price is right.
<P>
If the first tiger does not get you, the second might: The regulatory tiger never sleeps. A senator recently stated that last year over 65,000 pages of new governmental regulations were printed in the United States. Even if those pages were the size of postage stamps, that's mind-boggling. Considering that regulations are being spewed forth 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year from one federal government, 50 state governments, numerous territorial governments and more than 50,000 local governments, that horrendous number may be low. Although many assume that these new laws regulate big businesses, because only 2 percent of American businesses are big, most of these actually apply to small firms. To make matters worse (if that's possible), most small businesses don't even know that these new regulations exist until they are hauled into court, issued a fine and discover that the local media has told the world.
<P>
The last tiger may have the sharpest teeth: the insatiable tiger of taxation. At least until this year when Tommy Ridge and his Republican Roughriders stormed the heights of Harrisburg, our state had the highest business taxes in the nation. Various reforms have been and are being instituted, but keep in mind that the populace is being told that these are tax breaks for big business and the rich. It's an old song, but the tune can be catchy. Sadly, the singers often forget that 98% of the businesses that are benefiting from reduced taxes are small businesses, many of which barely make ends meet yet employ good, hard-working people upon whom families depend. No matter how jaunty the jingle, more taxes on cash-starved small businesses won't generate new jobs.
<P>
Our area is blessed with many  jungle-fighting organizations like      the small business development centers, the Service Corps of Retired Executives, Home Business Associ-ation, etc., who undertake a mountain of work armed with hardly anything more than nonprofit, plastic shovels. Nonetheless, they courageously endeavor to help fend off the menacing tigers and protect as many small businesses as they can. These heroic efforts notwithstanding, we desperately need more help. We need everyone to do their share. 
<P>
If nothing else, stop voting for politicians because of party affiliation or name familiarity. Many politicians who have never even run a lemonade stand (much less a small business) are now passing laws that generate more litigation, regulation and taxation. Furthermore, encourage your children to develop the creative energies necessary to start and run small businesses. This country was founded upon entrepreneurial spirit, so encourage it in your daughters and sons. Finally, quit thinking about starting a business of your own -- get out there and do it. It's a risk, but if you try you might succeed, and if you don't, you won't. Keep your overhead low (start it in your home) and do it part-time (keep your day job), but stop procrastinating.
<P>
Some of you may fear failing, but who has really failed? Someone who started a small business who did not succeed, or someone who has a great idea but does nothing?
<P>

Fogarty, an inductee into "Who's Who of American Professionals" because of his advocacy for small business development, is a lecturer of business law at the University of Pittsburgh, author of the book "Starting a Business in Pittsburgh," and managing attorney for the business law firm of Fogarty & Associates.</h4>

<h2>Wedge or Pickle?</h2>

The golf ball rests on the fringe of the 18th green at Oakmont. Tony O'Reilly checks the break, then pulls out his ... pickle putter?
<P>
Well, probably not. But O'Reilly's food conglomerate, Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co., does have pickle putters for sale. The golf club looks like a regular putter until you reach the head, then it looks like a regular pickle. 
<P>
Heinz tested the marketability of the pickle putter and other Heinz paraphernalia in a kiosk gift shop the company ran at suburban Pittsburgh's Ross Park Mall during August. Vendors handed out pickle pins for free. Customers had to pay for the other merchandise, which ranged from clothing to cookie jars to hats.
<P>
Heinz spokeswoman Deb Magness says the company traditionally has sold merchandise to employees, but has seen an increasing number of queries from the general public about Heinz merchandise.
<P>
Rolling Rock runs a popular gift shop at its brewery in Latrobe. Magness says Heinz has ruled out a similar gift shop at its North Side plant, citing security concerns.
<P>
Heinz planned to have a gift catalog out this fall. Magness says Heinz also will revisit the Ross Park shop in November, just in time for holiday shopping.

<h2>So Long Integra</h2>

Integra's announcement that it will sell to Cleveland-based National City Corp., along with a flurry of other such deals, has created speculation that other bank mergers are not far behind.
<P>
Mellon, which at press time was being mentioned as an attractive acquisition candidate, is clearly undervalued. Its retail franchise and asset management/investment services business are among the finest in the nation. If it remains independent, Mellon should benefit enormously from the acquisition of Integra.
<P>
ER Index columnist Doug Thomas notes that Pittsburghers are going to have to be convinced that banking with a Cleveland-based bank is better than Mellon or PNC or any of the other smaller area banks. Banks like Parkvale Financial, Southwest National and BT Financial, stand to pick up market share as a result of the defection of depositors and borrowers who prefer to deal with a local bank. As Gerry Swatsworth, the former chairman and CEO of BT Financial once told Thomas, the smaller banks in western Pennsylvania can prosper quite nicely by living off the crumbs the big banks leave on the table. With Integra set to be replaced by an even bigger out-of-town bank, there should be more crumbs.
<P>
One footnote to the Integra merger: The Chicago Corp., an investment house, in July downgraded from buy to hold its recommendation on Integra Financial Corp.'s stock. The investment house listed several reasons for the downgrade, the first of which was, "Loan demand continues to suffer from sluggish economic growth in western Pennsylvania."
<P>
The significance? It no longer is a secret that this region is stagnating economically. New business development lags behind both the national and statewide rates. Outsiders are noticing.
<P>
Chicago Corp. also expressed concern about the bank's declining margins over the past four quarters. 
<P>
"Unlike many banks, [Integra] has little in the way of loan growth to mitigate the ailing margin," Chicago Corp. wrote. 

<HR>

<h2>Tipping the Scales</h2>

Statistics show that about two-thirds of working Americans land their first jobs in the food service industry, at anything from a hospital cafeteria to the drive-thru window at McDonald's. 
<P>
When and if Congress increases the minimum wage, restaurants and other food service employers likely will be the hardest hit. 
<P>
"In the restaurant industry, the minimum wage enables employers to hire huge numbers of inexperienced workers and teach them the basic skills," says Ralph O. Brennan, president of the National Restaurant Association.  "When you artificially raise the minimum, you make it more expensive for employers to give unproven workers a chance."
<P>
Proponents of an increase argue that most minimum wage earners are heads of households below the poverty line. But the numbers don't show this to be the case. An estimated 80 percent of minimum wage earners do not reside in poverty level households. In fact, half of these households make double the poverty level.  
<P>
"In the food service industry and in many others, entry-level jobs are a way in and a way up," says Brennan, whose statements are supported by statistics.
<P>
In 1980, 12.4 percent of U.S. workers earned minimum wage; today that number is less than 4 percent. Research by Ralph E. Smith and Bruce Varichek of the U.S. Congressional Budget Office published in Industrial and Labor Relations Review shows that about 63 percent of minimum wage workers are promoted to higher-paying positions within their first year, with the median increase being a 20 percent raise.  Forty percent receive their first pay increase within their first four months of employment.  
<P>
Restaurant owners also argue there is not true minimum wage in their industry and many others because of tipping. In addition to restaurants, many minimum wage earners in hotels, hair salons, department stores and taxi companies increase their earnings via tips, bonuses and commissions.
<P>
This additional income is generally neglected by proponents of a minimum wage hike. In fact, some workers choose to remain in minimum wage positions because of the earning potential of tips and the like, restaurant owners say.
<P>     
The proposed 20 percent increase in the minimum wage would mean a potential 20 to 40 percent decrease in the hours of employment available to workers currently paid less than the new, higher minimum. If the government raises the minimum wage, restaurant owners say, it will curtail employment among just those people they're trying to help.

<HR>

<h2>More Than Just Aspirin</h2>

For years, the name Bayer meant aspirin when we had a headache. Now, you can soothe that migraine with some jazz.
<P>
Bayer has been a major player in the compact disc industry since Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics introduced the technology in 1982. Bayer's parent company, Bayer AG in Germany, was one of the original suppliers of polycarbonate, a tough plastic that was critical to the success of CD technology. A laser beam reads tiny pits molded into the surface of the disc.
<P>
Now comes a reminder of Bayer's role in the compact disc industry.  Bayer is sponsoring a compact disc featuring live performances from the Living and Contemporary Jazz Masters Series at Pittsburgh's Manchester Craftsmen's Guild. Featured performers include Stanley Turrentine, Louie Bellson and Ray Brown. The craftsmen's guild is a nonprofit community arts organization that provides cultural and educational opportunities for inner city youth.
<P>
The CD will sell for $20 at National Record Marts in western Pennsylvania, Borders Book Shops in suburban Pittsburgh and the craftsmen's guild. Proceeds will benefit the guild's Jazz Education Program.
<P>
Other sponsors are Sony and Digital Audio Disc Corp., a leading manufacturer of CDs.
<P>
"This is an important collaborative effort by the corporate world, the nonprofit arts community and the individual jazz performers," says guild executive director William E. Strickland Jr. "The CD has traditional to contemporary jazz and everything in between. The music is very, very strong."

<HR>

<h2>Many Happy Returns</h2>

Do the birthday cards you mail to friends and relatives routinely include the word "belated?" If so, Manhattan attorney Kevin Cohen has a solution.
<p>
Cohen, founder and president of Card Club, hopes to capitalize on business people whose lives are so busy that they struggle to find time to purchase and mail birthday cards to friends and relatives who are important to them. Cohen's firm will mail a card for you with a postmark from the state in which you live. Card Club also will use a computer to simulate your handwriting. The cost: $3.50 per card.
<P>	
"I adore my mother and would never fail to acknowledge her special days deliberately, but I just get caught up in my life on the road," says Peter Lane, a trade show consultant who uses Card Club. "By the time I remember her birthday, I'm apologizing profusely and spending $50 on flowers."
<P>
Until recently, Lane's mother, Frances, had gone decades without her son remembering her birthday via a card.
<P>
"I thought I had seen the last one," the mother says.
<P>
New York-based Card Club went national in August after several years of working on a regional basis.

<HR>

<h2>A Better Way to Pay</h2>

You may be clicking on all cylinders at work, but don't expect it to be reflected in your paycheck. Companies here still shy away from basing pay increases on performance.
<P>
In fact, merit increase budgets are at a six-year low, according to a nationwide survey by Towers Perrin of 1,383 U.S. companies. Those surveyed in the Pittsburgh area report merit budgets mirroring the national trend.
<P>
Although many industries have reported strong financial results this year, the trend in employment remains one of tight and ongoing cost control.
<P>
"Viewed in context, holding down salary increases is part of a broader effort to streamline and maintain peak efficiency and profitability regardless of economic conditions," says Antoinette Petrucci, leader of Towers Perrin's employee pay consulting practice in Pittsburgh. "We're seeing a continuing shift in the compensation ... away from merit increases toward variable pay opportunities that offer significant rewards tied to business results and give employers added flexibility to manage costs more carefully."
<P>
Many organizations today are reengineering the way work is done and restructuring their business operations to meet the challenges of growing competition. Companies are finding that traditional pay and performance management systems are poorly suited to new business environments. 
<P>
Traditional systems are designed to pay employees for performing narrowly defined tasks and jobs for a perceived value to the company. While in a competency-based system, employees are managed and rewarded on the basis of teamwork, risk-taking, technical expertise, customer relationship management and innovations, for example. 
<P>
When Towers Perrin surveyed 100 large employers in the Northeast, they found that one in four companies were seriously considering competency-based pay systems for at least some of their employees. For employees, the flexibility and the opportunity of the competency framework is limitless; for employers, this new pay system would prove to be a more effective use of their people resources. Competency-based pay better serves the organization needs in order to achieve its business objectives, experts say.

<HR>

<h2>Take the Week Off</h2>

Are you stingy in handing out vacation time to loyal employees? In the end, it could cost your business productivity or even employees, says Inga Harris, an employee benefit consultant with Hewitt Associates.
<P>
"Service-related paid time off remains an effective way to reward long-service employees," Harris says.
<P>
Americans actually receive less vacation time than employees in many foreign countries, where the government mandates that employees with over one year of service receive certain amounts of vacation.
<P>
Denmark, Austria and Brazil are the most liberal, mandating six weeks of vacation. Denmark, we should note, has a six-day work week.
<P>
Finland, France and Sweden all mandate five weeks of vacation, while Australia, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland mandate four weeks.
<P>
On the telephone to the realtor already? Don't move to Mexico, where the government mandates only six vacation days annually.
<P>
The average vacation allotment in the United States is two weeks, the same as in Japan.
<P>
Will the U.S. average grow? Probably not, since the modern workplace demands maximum productivity and permits little time off. In fact, almost a quarter of people who did vacation over the summer ended up working from the beach, the mountains, their hotel room, their boat or wherever they happened to be.
<P>
Steelcase Workplace Index, a semiannual survey of workplace trends. reports that 23 percent of its 1,000-person sample did work while on vacation. About 4 percent of those who worked while on vacation said they resented having to do it.

<h2>Spoils of a Legend</h2>

With forearms like oak trees, Arnold Palmer used golf clubs to carve his legend out of fairways near and far. He has the hardware to prove it, having walked away with championships from the British Open, the U.S. Open and the Masters, to name only a few.
<P>
The Westmoreland Museum of Art in Greensburg has brought together a collection of over 60 trophies Palmer earned during his career. The display, entitled The Art of Winning: Prizes of Palmer, runs through Oct. 29. 
<P>       
The venerable Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, Scotland, loaned the museum its silver claret jug, the oldest trophy in golf, which has been presented to the winner of the British Open since 1872. Augusta National Golf Club also has provided the original Masters trophy for the exhibition, and the USGA has provided a reproduction of the U.S. Open trophy.
<P>       
And don't forget the trophy Palmer earned when he first emerged on the golf scene, for winning the U.S. Amateur.
The museum hosted a black-tie dinner in September for Palmer, a native of Latrobe who is winding down his career. (Admission for the Palmer exhibit is $5.)

<HR>

<h2>Actions Speak Louder Than Words</h2>

When working face-to-face, body language plays an enormous part in conveying what one thinks and feels. Your mouth may be saying one thing,   but your actions may be saying something else. In the end, it could hurt       your chances of easing a client's concerns, winning new business or receiving a promotion.
<P>
"People who lean forward in a chair to communicate their interest in what's being said may at the same time glance around the room as if bored. That creates suspicion," says Frank Grazian, executive editor of Communication Briefings, a monthly newsletter dedicated to helping improve business communications.
<P>
In order to convey a clearer overall message, Grazian offers some tips on how to improve nonverbal communication. First, one should realize what their body language is saying to others. If you're not certain, ask a friend or a colleague to watch you and give feedback. Even better: Many companies videotape their sales representatives, then play it back for them. On videotape, one sales representative noticed his nervous habit of clicking his pen. From that point on, the salesman used twist pens so he would have nothing to click.
<P>
Another tip: Watch others and notice what they're saying both verbally and nonverbally. Watch nervous habits such as doodling and finger tapping. These mannerisms can imply that the other party is not paying attention.
<P>
Grazian also notes that one should be especially careful when conversing with people from other countries. Some gestures have less than complimentary meanings of which you may be unaware. For example, avoid scratching your chin downward when speaking with a German. This gesture is interpreted as you think what they are saying is garbage.

<h2>Economic Development</h2>

"The people of Pittsburgh, they think economic growth in our region is not all that bad. But in effect, everyone around us is growing so much that we are lagging well behind."

<P align=center><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Veal of Approval </B></FONT><BR>
<P align=center><B><font size = +1>Veal Lovers Have Their Pick at This Heinz Hall Neighbor </font><BR>
<I>By Jim Urban </I></B>
<HR>
<P>

The last time I had a veal dish at a Pittsburgh restaurant, I sent it back to the chef with this request: "Please finish cooking the veal." 
<P>
Sadly, the list of restaurants in this region that have mastered veal is a short one. But add to that list one restaurant, The Overture, which recently changed ownership and is hanging its hat on two dishes that veal eaters should love. 
<P>
The Overture sits across the street from Heinz Hall on Sixth Street. The entrees are pricey, averaging around $20, but the portions are generous and the service, attentive, making The Overture a good way to start an evening in the Cultural District.
<P>
The wine list features French and American, with the French wines (Premier Cru, Joseph Drouhin and Pouilly Fuisse, Louis Jadot) averaging in the low $40s. The American wines, primarily from the Sonoma and Napa valleys of California, average in the mid $30s. The domestics include Ferrari Carano Chardonnay and Chalk Hill Estate Cabernet Sauvignon.
<P>
We started with a first course of two house recommendations: a portabello mushroom and blackened gulf shrimp. The portabello mushroom was stuffed with fresh crabmeat, then topped with an imperial sauce that was tasty but not too rich. The crabmeat made the difference. 
<P>
The blackened gulf shrimp were nicely sized, sitting on roasted red bell peppers and topped with a spicy sauce that tasted of mesquite. Having to pick between the shrimp or the portabello mushroom, I would go with the   mushroom. Shrimp lovers, however,     should try the blackened gulf shrimp. It's a nice change from some unimaginative shrimp appetizers.
<P>
The salad was fresh and crisp, although I thought the house dressing, raspberry vin-aigrette, was flat. However, another in my party raved about the same dressing.
<P>
Chef Wayne Heuler brought one of the veal dishes, Veal Christian, with him from the former Fair-child's of Mon-roeville, tweaking the dish a bit along the way. Heuler stuffs the veal with crabmeat and  sautes it in wine before topping it with mushrooms. The veal melted in the mouth, but as with the portabello mushroom, the crabmeat made the difference.
<P>
The other veal entree was Veal Oscar, which is scallopini of veal sauteed and garnished with fresh asparagus and lump crabmeat. A bernaise sauce topped it off. Of the two veal specialties, the Veal Christian was definitely the more tasty. 
<P>
The menu features two other veal dishes: Veal Diablo and Veal & Peppers. Granted, not everyone is a veal eater. For those who don't indulge, other entrees include New York Strip Steak ($25.95), Blackened Yellowfin Tuna ($20.95). 
<P>
For dessert, we went with The Piano, which is bittersweet chocolate molded in the shape of a grand piano and topped with raspberry mousse. Chef Heuler adds fresh raspberries when they're in season. Lucky for us, they were.
<P>
Dinner for two, including a bottle of wine, is going to run around $100, not including the tip.
<P>
The highlight definitely was the Veal Christian. Downtown restaurants constantly fight an uphill battle. A dish that sets them apart from the competition can only help. The Overture has found one with its Veal Christian.

It's not public broadcasting, but it's not quite Wayne's World either. It's community television, a forum for Pittsburgh residents or nonprofit groups in the city to hit the airwaves with their own television shows. Programming on the station, channel 21 on the Pittsburgh cable system, covers a wide range of topics: art, sports and religion to name a few. Most of it is produced in the PCTV studio on Pittsburgh's North Side.
<P>
Now, PCTV is embarking on a project that will enable users to express themselves via another medium: the Internet. The project carries special importance to the business community because it will enable users such as small business owners and home-based entrepreneurs to set up a home page and e-mail address at minimal cost. More importantly, the city's young people, who might otherwise have no exposure to the evolving technology, also will be able to gain experience using the Internet.
<P>
ER Editor-in-Chief Jim Urban talked with Merritt H. Spier, executive director/general manager of Pittsburgh Community Television Corp., about her work at PCTV and her uphill battle in getting the Internet project off the ground.
<P>
<b>Executive Report: Before we talk about what you want to do, let's talk about what you already are doing. So what happens at PCTV?</b> 
<P>
Merritt Spier:  PCTV is the public access television station for the city of Pittsburgh. We have a staff of about seven people who facilitate and train ordinary citizens and members of city-based nonprofit organizations on how to produce their own television programs that will appear on TCI cable television channel 21.
<P>
We have a fully equipped studio. We have four edit suites, five portable camera units. We only require two free workshops -- orientation and preproduction -- before someone can begin producing a program in our studio. Most people who come in here want to be the host of their own show. They do the writing. They arrange their own guests. Our staff really only runs the technical side of things. Most of my job is fund raising. I'd say about 90 percent of my time is spent in that area.
<P>
<b>ER: And from television you are moving to the Internet?</b>
<P>
MS: Since we are in the business of teaching people how to use television as a medium to communicate, what we want to do is keep up with the times and add the digital medium. We believe the Internet is going to be the communications tool of the future. It already is a communications tool.
<P>
We serve a group in this community that does not have the financial wherewithal to have access to the Internet or a computer or a modem. With our television studio, we already are serving the underprivileged and the small nonprofits, giving them access to tools they would not be able to afford or use. We've come up with a project called the PCTV Public Internet Access Centers. We want to train the people not only to browse the Internet, but to use it as a communications tool. We will teach courses in electronic commerce that really will amount to in-depth training for people who have a home-based business or want to start a small business. If they have a talent they want to advertise, they can put it out on the Internet. We will give everyone a home page and an e-mail address.
<P>
<b>ER: But to get this off the ground, you need money. Please explain the funding process.</b>
<P>
MS: We have a proposal that has been submitted to the foundations for funding. We are asking for $500,000 over three years, which is not a lot of money for doing what we are trying to do. Some other programs are operated by nonprofits. The Carnegie, for example, is providing people with browsing capabilities. We are doing something completely different than that. We not only are allowing users to browse, but we are teaching them to use the Internet like they would use any other tool. They actually are going to create content on the Internet.
<P>
Locally, the foundations have been pretty slow in reacting. A lot of them already have made a large investment in other projects. I am out there trying to explain how this is different. This is a program that will reach out and train people who otherwise would not have access, plus connect all these nonprofits that really need to be talking to each other. That, to me, is very unique and very exciting. It is something completely different than most other Internet programs.
<P>
<b>ER: Community television is funded in part by the cable operator, in      this case TCI. Does that cover most of your costs?</b>
<P>
MS: Not really. When a cable company comes into a city like Pittsburgh, the city council sets up certain requirements. In Pittsburgh, one of the requirements is that people have a voice on cable television. The voice is PCTV. Along with that, TCI since 1981 has been required to provide PCTV with 25 cents per subscriber per month. That equals out to anywhere from $260,000 annually to $290,000 annually. The rest is up to us. We generate some funds through the sale of videotapes and workshops on certain aspects of production. We don't charge for airtime.
<P>
<b>ER: Does the community seize this opportunity?</b>
<P>

MS: We have about 450 active community producers. They can do just about anything they want. We screen everything that goes out just to make sure we don't violate any state, federal or local laws on obscenity. Another thing we watch for is libelous material. Most of the people who do this have full-time jobs and do this in their extra time. They are a very dedicated group.
<P>
You must live in the city or be part of a city-based nonprofit group. So if you live outside the city and belong to a church in the city, you could do something for your church.
<P>
We have people coming in here thinking all kinds of things, and that is the uniqueness of this place. We have a guy right now who produces a music video show featuring local bands. We have a lot of churches using us for religious programming. We also have a lot of people who are suffering from the problems of gang violence. They have turned that around and really, on a grass roots level, have come to PCTV to use the medium as a means of getting children out of these really violent     situations. 
<P>
We have a whole group of producers who really concentrate on bringing kids in and letting them express themselves on camera, whether they dance, sing, read a story or just talk about how violence is affecting them. The children see that there is more to the world than what is around the corner of their house. They are given the opportunity to see themselves on television, which is rewarding and a real morale booster. It helps build self-esteem, which they have very little of. That's been a very good thing -- a very good use of PCTV.
<P>
We also have some people who are artists who then translate their art into video. One guy does all his artwork on slides, then puts it to music and puts it on the station. We once had a guy who did a show called Plunger Fantastik. All it was was a plunger going up against a wall. Every so often a peanut on a string would fall into the shot. The producer wanted it to be a classical piece of filmmaking. He envisioned himself as the Andy Warhol of video.
<p>
Sports wise, we also have a bodybuilding, aerobics program. Most of our general programming evolves around the African American community.
<P>
The Internet project will not be limited to those who live in the city. We will set up the facility right here. The proposal calls for a classroom, a bank of computers with 32 modem ports and classes. We hope, by year three, that this project will be self-sustaining through the workshop fees, through the setup fees and through the monthly Internet fees. Right now, we are planning to charge $30 to set a person up, which will include the home page, an e-mail address and giving them software if they have a home computer. The connection fee will be $6 per month. The workshop fees are not set, but they will remain nominal.
<P>
We are not out to make money. We really are dedicated to serve this group of people who might otherwise not have the opportunity to experience this technology.
<b>ER: How do you protect against abuse of the system?</b>
<P>
MS: We can put in controls where someone has created something and wants to send it out on the Internet. We can have the ability to control what goes out. Like we monitor for obscenity or pornography on the television side, we would do the same thing here.
<P>
<b>ER: Even though the fees remain nominal, there still will be those who cannot afford the cost. How will you serve them?</b>
<P>
MS: We also have a scholarship committee, a group from our board of directors, that will award up to 100 scholarships for the severe financial hardship cases.
<P>
<b>ER: The notion of opening this up to the region, instead of limiting it to the city, sounds good. Will that fly with the city or with TCI?</b>
<P>
MS: If we run into problems with TCI or the city, we will have to rethink that. We still are maintaining the television side of this, which has always been all the city required. We really feel this is like adding another communications tool, adding to the services we already provide. We already train people to communicate one way. We are just training them to communicate another way. 
<P>
<b>ER: Where does the project stand now? What is the time frame for getting it up and running?</b>
<P>
MS: Right now, we need money to get this going. It will take three years. It will take us a year to get the hardware and the software set up. It will take us the second year to get the staff and other training components worked into the system, then test it a little. We'll open it up to some people to see where the kinks in the system are. By year three, we will be going strong.
<P>
<b>ER: Why are you so confident that the public will use the program? Has it been tried elsewhere?</b>
<P>
MS: They've done it in Minneapolis. They started three years ago, and now they are swamped. Our program is modeled after the Minneapolis one.
<P>
If we get swamped, we will just grow, grow, grow. I'm sure it will happen, because there is a need for this.
A producer walked into my office yesterday and asked when the Internet program would begin. I told him it would be a while because we had to get it funded first. He said, 'When can I pay? I have my money. I want to the first one on. I need to be on it.' There is a real pressure from our constituents to get this going.
<P>
I've got people who have been using PCTV for years and come to me in tears because of how this opportunity has changed their lives. Having access to the medium of television has got them out of bad situations they were in, has connected them with people from all over instead of isolating them in their community. It has made them popular and famous in the community where they do live. It has elevated their position in the community. I think this Internet project will do the same thing, only ten fold. 
<P>
It all started when we thought we would put up a computer terminal in the waiting area so people could browse the Internet. But when we started talking to those who use the facility, we realized that if we set the terminal up we would have a line all the way around the block. That's just browsing. That's not even using it. From there we started calling around to other community access facilities to see what they were doing and realized we were three years behind the times.
<P>
<b>ER:What roadblocks have you encountered as you try to fund this project? Are the decision-makers at the foundations tuned in to the importance of using the Internet?</b>
MS: The problem is that it is very hard to convince people that this is happening -- that this Internet stuff is real. I don't know if this is a Pittsburgh thing or what. People have to realize that if they don't use this, they are really going to miss out. The company that is helping us set this project up thinks of the Internet as a utility. If your electric bill is $300, you pay it because you need electricity and you wouldn't conduct business without it. The mindset should be, 'You don't want to think about running your business without paying for Internet service.'
<P>
We have established relationships with a number of foundations that have been very supportive in the past. This is the largest amount of funding we've ever asked for. It also is the most cutting edge.
<b>ER: How do you get past the roadblocks?</b>
MS: We have to educate them about the Internet. We have to explain that this is not a wild animal. We tell them, 'This is going to be coming to your desk, into your life. You might was well understand it. It is extremely beneficial to people we are trying to serve.' It is an educational process. I've been educating people all along since coming to PCTV. The thing about The Carnegie or WQED is that people know what it is. Our story is different: People don't understand what PCTV is. If they think it is public broadcasting, they already give to public broadcasting. I have to educate them and tell them it is something totally different. With this latest project, it is just more education on what the Internet is. And then what we want to do with it and somehow reduce this fear of the unknown.
<P>
<b>ER: Once the education part is complete, what is your message on why the foundations should ultimately fund a project of this type?</b>
<P>
MS: The foundations say they want to improve the life of the community in Pittsburgh. There are a lot of ways to do that besides, for example, funding cultural programming, which 80 percent of the people we serve do not even see. 
<P>
This technology will create the haves and the havenots. PCTV serves the havenots. The only way they are going to get access to technology is if organizations like PCTV and foundations with the heart to understand this can support the kind of thing that we want to do here.
<P>

<P align=center><B><FONT SIZE=+2>A Shoestring Budget</FONT><BR>
<font size=+1>Small Businesses Must Spend Their Limited <BR>Advertising Dollars Wisely</font><BR>
<I>By Henry Lipput
</I></B>
<HR> 

<P>

Rick Rohac knows firsthand that small businesses, by their very nature, have small advertising budgets. But he also knows that businesses like his own still must reach potential clients and build name recognition.
<P>
Many small businesses that don't try even the simplest advertising         will lose the battle for success before     it starts.
<P>
"What's important for small business people to realize is if they don't have a budget allocated for advertising in their start-up, they shouldn't even start up," says Rohac, president of Business America/Pittsburgh Metro East, a business appraisal/valuation firm that also brokers the sale or purchase of businesses.
<P>
"There are ways of doing it relatively cost-free," Rohac says. "The two ways that I've found most effective are to network as extensively as possible in professional organizations and to canvass, to cold call, to get out and let business owners know that I'm out there with the service that I offer them."
<P>
It's advertising on a shoestring budget, a challenge faced by the majority of small businesses. Strategies can be as simple as a well-planned business card, which in Rohac's case is colorful and double-sided.
<P>
"So when we leave a business card, we're leaving not only our name and phone number, but a pretty good description of what we can do for them," Rohac says.
<P>
Other small businesses may spend more, but usually it's still a limited amount that without proper planning and research will go to waste. Billboards, broadcast commercials and newspaper advertisements are worthless if your target markets don't see or hear them.
<P>
"It really is doing your homework, as to what's out there, what's in the marketplace," says Ron Kaiser, president of the Kaiser Group, a Pittsburgh advertising agency. "It's learning to not only ask questions, but, more importantly, learning to listen to what people are saying, what people want." 
<P>
And then there's the budget.
<P>
"If you don't have enough money [to fund a traditional advertising campaign], don't spend any of it," Kaiser says. "And then you have to find other ways to attract customers. And those other ways sometimes go back to the old original ways to do it. I don't        care whether you put a person with a sandwich board out walking up and down the street. Or print up a bunch of fliers, and distribute them up and down the street where there are businesses.
<P>
"The small business person needs to be a guerrilla fighter," Kaiser says. "They need to be street-smart. You need to be able to not try to overwhelm a market -- because you don't have the dollars -- but to outsmart it. "
<P>
Being innovative helps. Often, an innovative approach will get the public's attention. One example was the cookies distributed by DoubleTree Hotel when it took over the former Vista International in downtown Pittsburgh. The DoubleTree is part of a national chain, but is independently owned, with a limited budget for promotion in the Pittsburgh market.
<P>
Other small businesses that elect to use traditional TV advertising can limit their costs by trimming production costs and hitting cable channels instead of the traditional networks.
<P>
One of Kaiser's clients, The Law Firm, wanted to have some immediate impact in the market where it phys-ically was located.
<P>
"We made the decision that we would focus our marketing on the northern tier of Allegheny County," says The Law Firm's Leonard Sweeney. "Hence, we used CableAdNet for the North Hills area, which is a pretty big area."
<P>
"Local mom and pop clients represent 55 to 60 percent of our core business," says Pat Springer, CableAdNet's director of marketing.
<P>
Sweeney says his commercial brought results, even though it was produced on a limited budget.
<P>
"Anybody can throw a bunch of money into this and have a Cecil B. deMille production," Sweeney says. "The trick is to have one that just looks like it."
<P>

Shares fell 28.7 percent for the month to $9 following the surprise announcement of a 43 percent reduction in dividend to $0.80 per share, while planning to sell non-strategic properties and renovating and expanding core properties. Equity markets have been less than inviting as Crown's shares trade at levels significantly below its August 1993 initial public offering of $17.25 per share. Mean-while, a highly leveraged balance sheet has made debt financing less viable.
<P>
Crown's capital needs are undeniable.  In addition to debt service and dividend distributions, Crown Amer-ican requires capital to finance the renovation of several regional shopping malls for the opening of May Department Stores, and the renovation and expansion of the fire-damaged Logan Valley Mall in Altoona. Management believes that recent moves position the company to generate capital through a reduction of its dividend (approximately $22 million per year), proceeds from property sales (up to $90 million) and potential debt and equity offerings.
<P>
More problems may loom for Crown. In conjunction with its decision to sell two properties, Crown took a $35 million write-down on the value of these assets. Was Crown's balance sheet overstating the market value of other properties? Management appears to have lost a considerable amount of credibility on Wall Street. 
<P>
While it may appear that Crown addressed a short term cash flow problem at the expense of shareholders,  the family of Crown's CEO and President own over 35 percent of Crown's shares.
<P>

<h2>Around the ER Index</h2>

<P>
After two consecutive monthly gains, the ER Index fell 0.97 percent for the five weeks ended August 11, while the S&P for the same period fell 0.23 percent.The ER Index holds its lead at 20.77 percent, with the S&P 500 trailing closely with a 20.35 percent return.
<P>
<DL> 
<LI>Cable Design Technologies posted the largest gain, increasing 25.6 percent after the company ann-ounced that it had purchased Cole-Flex Corporation of West Babylon, N.Y. 
<LI>Also showing significant advances were Northstar Health Services and Parkvale Savings, which gained 14 percent and 12.7 percent respectively, on positive earnings announcements.  
<LI>Astrotech gained 7.4 percent on the announcement of an over 100 percent increase in earnings for its third quarter. Respironics trailed closely behind, appreciating 6.9 percent on record increases in sales and earnings for its fourth quarter ended June 30. 
<LI>In other news, Black Box Corp-oration gained 6.8 percent the month after the company announced a secondary offering from its principal stockholder, Odyssey, which represents approximately 45 percent of the shares owned by Odyssey.
<LI>Heinz shares, finished off 5.31 percent for the month reacting to news that the Heinz family foundations and trusts cut their stake by selling 12.75 million shares for $540 million. The sale served to dampen speculation that Heinz may soon be acquired. 
<LI>Allegheny Ludlum exceeded analyst's estimates in its second quarter, with earnings of $34.5 million or 49 cents per share. The gain was attributed to higher specialty steel prices and robust market demand. 
<LI>Kennametal reported record sales and earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30. Earnings from operations increased 118 percent to $68.3 million, or $2.58 per share. 
<LI>II-VI Corp. reported earnings for its fourth quarter ended June 30, of $833,000 or 31 cents per share as compared to $331,000 or 13 cents in the prior year, on a 62 percent increase in revenues to $8.4 million. Earnings increases were attributed to higher sales and lower per unit costs resulting mostly from increased production. Also in the month, the company declared a two-for-one stock split payable Sept. 7, 1995. 
<LI>American Eagle shares tumbled 8 percent for the month after the company announced that it expects earnings for the year ended July 1995 to come in lower than last year as a result of its aggressive inventory clearance program. The company is preparing to unveil a comprehensive new strategy within the next few weeks.

<P align=center><B><FONT SIZE=+2>Is Exporting The Answer?</font><BR> 

<FONT SIZE=+1>State Leaders Think A Push In Foreign Countries Will Spur Economic Development In Pennsylvania </FONT><BR>

<I>By Jim Strader</I></B>
<HR>  
<P>

Many Pennsylvania companies are well-established overseas. Heinz, PPG and Hershey are known the world over. But the nation's fifth-largest state ranks 11th in export trade, state commerce department administrators say, leaving plenty of room for improvement.
<P>
That's why boosting the presence of Pennsylvania products in the world market is a strategy being given renewed emphasis by the state. Gov. Tom Ridge notes that fewer than           20 percent of the state's manufacturers sell their products overseas.
<P>
"Pennsylvania's businesses must no longer think of exporting casually, but as a fundamental way of conducting business," the governor says.
<P>
Designed to meet that goal is the Pennsylvania Export Partnership, geared toward small and medium-sized companies. The program awards grants of as much as $2,500 to help companies attend international trade shows and access the export market.
<P>
Pittsburgh Tool Steel Inc., a specialty steel manufacturer based in Monaca, used the grant to visit an exhibition in Cologne, Germany last March. As a result, the Beaver County company's export business has increased from 2-3 percent in 1994 to about 20 percent this year.
<P>
The business generated by the German trade show and a handful of European sales calls made on the same trip sped the company's entrance to the export market, says Frank Cremeens, who took over Pittsburgh Tool Steel in a leveraged buyout early in 1994 with partner Lawrence Megan.
<P>
"When we bought the company, we had exports in mind, but because of the type of product, the real down-hard feeling was that this was four or five years away," Cremeens says.
<P>
Making contacts overseas is only the first step, Cremeens says. Follow-up is the key to keeping foreign customers, who often meet Americans on one-time junkets, more interested in Big Ben than big business.
<P>
"It's no different than being in Pittsburgh and selling to someone in Chicago," says Cremeens, who is planning another trip for this month to meet with current customers and pitch prospects in Germany and Italy.
<P>
The export partnership---known as PEP--- is available to Pennsylvania manufacturers with 500 or fewer employees and sales of $50 million or less.
<P>
The trade grants are geared primarily toward companies making their initial forays into exporting, but the state also looks to help businesses seeking to expand into new countries.
<P>
The program helped Pittsburgh Tool Steel learn how much was available in the export market, Cremeens says.  His firm consulted with the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Development Council, which administers the program in Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh Tool Steel also visited the Carnegie Library and the University of Pittsburgh's small business development center in preparation for the trip.
<P>
"You don't make the trip because of the PEP program," Cremeens says, noting that the grant money is only worthwhile if time and effort follow. "It does make it a little less painful. It provides the impetus to get off your tail."
<P>
In addition to the SRPDC in Pittsburgh, the Southern Alleghenies Planning and Development Commis-sion in Altoona assist area companies. These agencies, and eight others around Pennsylvania, act as regional export service providers, identifying and recruiting eligible companies to take part in the grant program. They also help with market research to evaluate export potential and readiness. State offices in Toronto, Tokyo, Brussels and Frankfurt act as economic development liaisons for Pennsylvania companies.
<P>
Other export initiatives in the works in Harrisburg include a Governor's Export Task Force, which will plan and oversee the state's export program. Ridge says he plans to lead trade delegations overseas. Commerce Secretary Thomas Hagen has already traveled to Canada and Great Britain on behalf of the state.
<P>
Despite the early success his company has had with exports, Cremeens says it remains only a portion of Pittsburgh Tool Steel's operation. With all the effort in making and maintaining overseas contacts, he says, the foreign customers can't overshadow domestic business.
<P>
"You have to be careful not to ig-nore the main part of your business."

<P align=center><b><FONT SIZE=+3>The Physician Practice </FONT><BR><font size = +2>Does the MD Need an MBA to Run One? </font><BR>
<I>By Jim Urban</I></B>

<HR>  

<P>

As an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Norman Krause is pretty good with a scalpel. But take him out of the operating room following a hip replacement surgery and you'll find him equally adept at slicing the fat from his office budget.
<P>
"I used to have enormous overhead," says Krause, a solo practitioner. "That was fine when things were fat. Now, it is anything but fine. My practice is like U.S. Steel or any other company. We look at expenses. We are more efficient and cost-conscious. We took the big picture and figured out a way to do it more cost-effectively."
<P>
For Krause and other physicians, it's come down to this simple reality: The days of loosely running a practice are over. The market is demanding cost containment from physicians. That means physicians must control their own operating costs to maintain profit margins. It's especially true for physicians like the 43-year-old Krause, who is too young to retire but is old enough to have an established practice.
<P>
"Running a medical practice now is very much like running any other business," Krause says. 
<P>
Unlike the old days, many physicians now develop and follow annual budgets, paying close attention to every line item. They regularly review their staffing levels and office technology to ensure maximum efficiency. They stay on top of accounts receivable to maintain adequate cash flow. And above all, they focus on keeping the customers satisfied, who now include not only patients, but insurers and their referral networks.
<P>
Krause's practice is a prime example of how times have changed. Krause once operated without a detailed office budget. Now, he develops one annually and follows it. Krause's payroll formerly funded 14 positions in his two offices in Squirrel Hill and Monroeville. He since reduced his payroll to        4 1/2 positions.
<P>
The same cost-containment pressures also influence larger multi-doctor practices, many of which have hired an  experienced healthcare administrator to run the business side of the practice. Take Michael Busch, whose past jobs included chief financial officer at Hershey Medical Center and vice president for finance at West Penn Hospital. He now is executive director of Oakland Neurosurgical Associates, a 10-physician practice group that employs 32 people in six offices in and around Pittsburgh.
<P>
"When it comes to business operations, many physicians really don't have any interest related to issues of human resources, finance or information systems," Busch says. "Think back to the way it was in the middle '70s. There really were no price controls and there were no contractual issues. The marketplace was so attuned to expansion that many physicans just treated patients and sent a bill."
<P>
With Busch tending to strategic planning, hiring, contractual issues and other administrative matters, the Oakland Neurosurgical doctors are free to spend most of their time practicing medicine. The doctors still dabble in the business side, meeting monthly for corporate meetings and participating in an annual two-day retreat focusing on the business side of the practice.
<P>
Other physician groups aren't willing to invest in a seasoned business manager.  Instead, some are tapping the emerging group of consultants, such as Carol McClain, president of Healthcare Business Cents.
<P>
Like Oakland Neurosurgical's Busch, McClain is a healthcare veteran, a registered nurse who once managed a seven-physician practice in suburban Pittsburgh.
<P>
When reviewing a practice from top to bottom, McClain hits 10 areas that she says are critical to success. They range from patient satisfaction to proper budgeting to coding and charges.
<P>
"There are some physicians who are really business savvy," McClain says. "These are people who are involved with the medical societies and other groups. They are much more in tune with what is going on in healthcare. Many are self-taught business people who are doing very well."
<P>
Include Krause, the orthopedic surgeon, in that group. He acquired his business sense at the office. Now, it is the key to survival for him and thousands like him.
<P>
"A lot of physicians in their mid- to late-50s had a period of time in which they did extremely well," says Krause. "They don't like this current atmosphere, but they can afford to ride it out. Other guys just coming out of school never knew what it is like. They may just go work for an HMO.
<P>
"Myself and other colleagues around my age?" Krause says. "We are right in the middle of it."

<P align=center><B><font size = +2>A SHARED CULTURE </font><BR><I>By Richard White<br>Chairman, 1995 Southwest Pennsylvania Business Hall of Fame </I></B>
<P>
<HR>  

<P>
In this increasingly global economy, we can learn much from other cultures.  From Africa comes the phrase, "it takes an entire community to raise a child."  In large part, we as members of the business community can do our part by showing tomorrow's leaders how "to value free enterprise, understand business and economics, and be 'workforce' ready."
<P>
The distinguished laureates upon whom we bestow membership in the Hall of Fame shine as examples of free enterprise at its best.  They show us that through hard work, perseverance and self-confidence, dreams can come true.  This is no less true for the many fine Junior Achievement volunteers who enter classrooms around western Pennsylvania to share their experiences and enthusiasm with tomorrow's business leaders, workers and customers.   
<P>
Orville Eberly, Eberly Coal and Coke and Gallatin Bank; Thomas A. McConomy, Calgon Carbon; Roy McKnight, Mylan Laboratories; Robert L. Vann, The New Pittsburgh Courier, and Dr. Richard C. Wallace, Pittsburgh Public Schools, will enter the Junior Achievement Southwest Pennsylvania Business Hall of Fame at the awards dinner and induction ceremony which I will host on Wednesday, October 25 at 6:00 p.m.  Present as honored guests will be many JA students from the area.  I also look forward to hosting and honoring this area's past and current business and community leaders, including John E. Connelly, this year's Achieve-ment Award Honoree, as we encourage our future leaders as well.
<P>
It will take more than a dinner awards ceremony to prepare our young people to achieve for tomorrow.  Important as it is to reward past success, the most vital part of JA's work occurs in today's classrooms.  Only by interacting with JA volunteers can our children gain the fullest benefits from a lifetime's business and community experience.  The dedication and time taken to illustrate, firsthand, the value of education and work pay off both immediately and in the future.  The sooner our young people learn how the economy works, the closer we step to the day when the average student seriously ponders the benefits of owning and/or running a business.
<P>
Junior Achievement volunteers run well-designed, time-tested programs that enrich and educate students.  Equally important are the individual business-person's own personality and stories.  Countless volunteers report attitude and career goal changes by students following their participation in JA. These experiences make all of our efforts worthwhile.  Your experiences offer untold possibilities for inspiration, enlightenment and motivation for our young people.  Consider making this investment in tomorrow's economy, as you will never get a more profitable return!

In this day and age, athletes, musicians, actors and other celebrities can no longer be held up as models of success and good citizenship. The negative publicity surrounding such pop culture icons as Michael Jackson, Pete Rose, Mike Tyson and of course, O.J. Simpson, has caused the country to question the people whom we hold up to our children as "successful."
<P>
Sometimes the best examples of perseverance, dedication, commitment and ultimately success, however we define it, can be found in the people we know. Our parents, peers and mentors can offer us a wealth of knowledge, experience, guidance and a pattern on which to shape our behavior.
<P>
By going into the classroom and working with students one-on-one, JA volunteers have the opportunity to provide students with a positive and accessible role model. The simplest commitment to a group of students can provide them with a lasting and positive impression.
<P>
A great way students can meet with adults who are positive role models is through Junior Achievement programs. More students than ever will get the opportunity to interact with Junior Achievement volunteers this school year. Each volunteer can benefit the life of each student. "There are many valuable causes to volunteer for," said Dennis Gilfoyle, vice president of marketing for Junior Achievement. "Junior Achievement is not volunteer firefighting or emergency service. But make no mistake, Junior Achievement is saving lives." 
<P>
The K-6 program allows young students in kindergarten through sixth grade to learn about their roles in the economy of the family, community, city and country. Volunteers from the business community visit the classroom to bring students a practical understanding of how free enterprise works in the community and the value of an education.Through hands-on activities, students in the K-6 program learn fundamental business principles and how they can become contributing members of society. These programs lay the foundation for continued learning and success in high school and beyond, according to Junior Achievement Program Manager Romy Banks. "These programs, aside from their scholastic value, get young people thinking about business and setting goals for success." 
<P>
Another JA program, ESIS, allows seventh grade students to see firsthand how staying in school makes sense. Through the Success board game, students learn the long-term benefits of getting their high school diploma. Students also see what the world holds for a high school dropout. They scan the classifieds trying to find a job they would be qualified for as a dropout. "They have to budget for food, rent, transportation, and other expenses based on their supposed income," Banks says. "It's a real eye-opening experience for them."
<P>
Junior Achievement's goal according to S. Lee Strayer, president of Junior Achievement of Southwest Pennsyl-vania, "is to provide a complete and sequential kindergarten-through-twelfth-grade curriculum over the next several years. The only way that can be accomplished is through business and community leaders going into the classroom." 
<P>
Junior Achievement's programs also represent a vital stepping-stone from a student's secondary education to college or directly to the work force.
<P>
The U.S. position in the world economy depends directly on our nation's ability to prepare tomorrow's work force. Business leaders recognize this challenge as they continually search for workers with new and more sophisticated skills. Junior Achievement knows from experience that a key to success is to bring business and community leaders directly into the classroom. Young students in search of positive role models find such volunteers important sources of inspiration. At the same time, the Junior Achievement classroom volunteers transform textbook theory into real-life experiences that greatly aid the learning process. 
<P>
As our children are confronted with challenges at an increasingly young age it is critical that this type of classroom involvement now begins in kindergarten. With the belief that it is never too early to start preparing our nation's youth for their futures, Junior Achievement programs begin in kindergarten and continue through 12th grade. The goal is to help children learn the parallel between success in school and success in the workplace. When our children learn this, it is far easier for them to continue their education through graduation and become contributing members of society.     
<P>
Students learn about their roles as individuals, consumers and workers in environments that extend from their homes to an international marketplace. A variety of activities are included to help each student develop decision-making and work force readiness skills. 
<P>
For further information on how you can get involved with the next generation of business leaders, call Junior Achievement at 1-800-522-6957.

The amount of gratitude owed to Orville Eberly is enough to keep many individuals and businesses in debt for several years to come. This native of Fayette county held many accomplishments throughout his lifetime; unfortunately many were known only by those who benifited from them. 
<P>
Eberly started on his path to greatness by following in his father's footsteps: straight into the coal industry as a mine electrician. He mastered his trade early on by simultaneously passing examinations for fire boss, assistant mine foreman and mine foreman, with the help of his attending school at night.
<P>
He then went on to hold the position of mine foreman at Allison and later became superintendent of the Old Home Mine of the W.J. Rainey Co. at McClellandtown, which he later purchased in 1933. Three years later he established Eberly Coal and Coke Co. in Uniontown.
<P>
Years of combined experience and interest in the oil and gas business in 1935 led Eberly to the late William E. Snee, an independent oil and gas producer until the time of his death in 1977. As a productive team, they explored and developed the Summit Gas Field near Uniontown and the Accident Field near Deep Creek, Md.
<P>
In 1956, Eberly took another step forward when he headed a group of shareholders who acquired control of Gallatin Bank. Under his guidance as chairman of the board from 1957 until his retirement in 1977, Gallatin Bank matured to its presently distinguished status as the largest bank in this area and one of the largest in the state.
<P>
Besides Eberly's many business fulfillments, he also greatly supported the advancement of youth through educational endeavors. Orville was the key individual in the addition of the Fayette Campus of Pennsylvania State University to the county. The Eberly Foundation was also established in 1965 to provide scholarship assistance to hundreds of students. A classroom building at the campus was named in Eberly's honor in 1977 as a thank you for his active involvement towards the development of our future. 
<P>
Eberly was an eager and accomplished trapshooter in his spare time. He was president of the Pennsylvania State Sportsmen's Association for five years and was named honorary president for life in 1975. A building was dedicated to him in his honor at Shamokin. His trapshooting skills were also noticed by the Amateur Trap-shooters Association and he was inducted into the Amateur Trapshooters Hall of Fame in 1976. His awards in that sport included the Pennsylvania state over-all championship four times, and the Eastern Zone doubles championship and northeastern United States clay pigeon championship, both in 1951.
<P>
Eberly's continued list of honors include being named Man of the Year by the Greater Uniontown Chamber of Commerce in 1971, serving as president of the Board of Trustees of the Uniontown Hospital Association, and as a member of the Fayette County Planning and Zoning Commission, Greater Uniontown Chamber of Commerce, Greater Uniontown Industrial Fund, and Regional Industrial Development Corporation.
<P>
<h2>ROY MCKNIGHT</h2>

Fortitude, integrity and foresight. These three words come to mind when characterizing Roy McKnight, the enterprising CEO of Mylan Labs. Before his death in 1993, McKnight earned the reputation as a dauntless leader who brought a company from mediocrity to greatness within years. 
<P>
McKnight graduated from Princeton University in 1942 with a bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering. In 1947, he founded Woessner-McKnight Company and spent the next 37 years as a manufacturers representative, selling electrical equipment for various companies, including Edwin L. Wiegand Company.
<P>
A decision in 1974 to invest $1,000 marked McKnight's first major interest in Mylan Labs. A year later, McKnight took up an invitation by Mylan's chairman, Mylan Puskar, to  become a board member of Mylan Labs.
<P>
After the tumultuous economy of 1975, Mylan's board, led by McKnight, investigated the operating procedures of the company. Then, on May 13, 1976, the board's executive committee grabbed the company's reins from Mylan's administration. McKnight's role in this restructuring helped elect him as Chairman and CEO of Mylan Labs.
<P>
Under McKnight's leadership, Mylan Labs became one of the nation's largest independent generic drug manufacturers. Mylan has grown from yearly sales of $13 million in 1976 to profits of $70 million by March 31, 1993.
<P>
By the way, the $1,000 McKnight orginally invested in Mylan Labs in 1974 grew to $337,500 at year end 1994. Some call it foresight -- we call it McKnight.
<P>


<h2>THOMAS MCCONOMY</h2>

Thomas A. McConomy was born and raised in Wilmerding, Pa., and he received his B.S. degree in chemical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. He began his career as a service engineer for Calgon Corporation in 1955, and, during the next 30 years, held positions of increasing responsibility, including manager of Calgon Interamerican in Caracas, Venezuela, from 1970 to 1972 and vice president and general manager of the Activated Carbon Division of Calgon where he was responsible for worldwide production and marketing.
<P>
In 1985, McConomy led a management buyout of the Activated Carbon Division from Merck & Co., Inc. At the time, the new entity, Calgon Carbon Corporation, employed 700 people worldwide and operated manufacturing facilities in the United States, Belgium, and England. Two years later, he took the company public; it is currently listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
<P>
Under McConomy's leadership as President, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of the Board, Calgon Carbon increased sales from $125 million to over $300 million, and the number of employees grew to more than 1,500. In 1988, the company aquired Degussa, AG's activated carbon and charcoal production facilities in Germany. In 1990, Calgon Carbon purchased Vara International, an engineering firm specializing in solving air pollution problems with activated   carbon-based systems, and, in 1991, acquired Trans-Pacific Carbon, a reactivation facility in Blue Lake, Calif. In 1992, the company started up a new state-of-the-art activated carbon production facility in Pearlington, Missi. In 1994, McConomy retired as Calgon Carbon's President and Chief Executive Officer. He remains Chairman and a member of the Board of Directors.
<P>
During his career, McConomy has contributed several articles and papers to technical trade journals and conferences. He has also been active in the Pittsburgh community, particularly with organizations and projects which are youth oriented. He is currently Chairman of the Board of Trustees of Carnegie Mellon University. He also holds directorships at PNC Bank, Equitable Resources, and the Pitts-burgh High Technology Council.
<P>
In 1989, McConomy received the "Enterprise Award" from The Pittsburgh Business Times, and in 1990, he was named "Entrepreneur of the Year" by Ernst & Young, Inc. magazine, and Merrill Lynch. In 1992, McConomy was the recipient of "The William Metcalf Award," given by the Engineers Society of Western Pennsylvania for outstanding engineering achievement.
<P>
McConomy was Chairman of Junior Achievement of Southwest Pennsylvania from 1988 to 1990. During his tenure, student enrollment increased from 14,000 to 24,000, and JASWPA received top honors as the best JA company in the nation. He was instrumental in the merger of Junior Achievement chapters in Pittsburgh and Johnstown, Pa., creating the eighth largest program in the nation. In 1991, McConomy received the National Junior Achievement Gold Leadership Award, the organization's top honor for volunteers.
<P>
<h2>RICHARD WALLACE</h2>

(Richard Wallace was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1994, but was unable to personally accept. He, too, will be honored at this year's ceremony.)
<P>
Under the leadership of Dr. Richard C. Wallace Jr., the Pittsburgh Public School system became a model for other cities. Wallace served as superintendent of schools from        1980 to 1992, developing ways to empower teachers and create options for students.
<P>
His most innovative way of helping teachers was a staff training program called PRISM (Pittsburgh Research-Based Instructional Super-visory Model).
<P>
Wallace thought the approach of personnel evaluation to rid the district of incompetent teachers and administrators was shortsighted. "I persuaded the board that they ought to take a constructive approach that would make certain all teachers and administrators understand the nature of effective teaching and leadership. Training, therefore, would precede evaluation," he explains.
<P>
Before teachers and administrators were evaluated, the board of education would make its expectations clear. Then the teachers would have the chance to see role models and practice their skills.
<P>
The Schenley Teacher Center operated from 1983 until 1990 in Schenley High School. There, teachers could take "mini-sabbaticals" to refine their instructional skills, expand subject area knowledge and learn to relate better to students.
<P>
During each quarter, 48 teachers from all 11 high schools would take part in an eight-week program. The teachers would then divide their time between teaching at Schenley High School and working with visiting teachers. When the teachers finished, they participated in follow-up programs led by principals and department chairmen.
<P>
The Schenley Teacher Center was so successful it was followed by the Brookline Elementary Teacher Center in 1985 and the Greenway Middle School Teacher Center in 1988.
<P>
In 1988, the Schenley Teacher Center was given the evaluation utilization award by the American Edu-cational Research Association.
<P>
Another major achievement during Wallace's tenure was the establishment of magnet programs, or specialty schools, which students choose to attend regardless of where they live in the city. The specialities range from high-tech to the arts.
<P>
One such magnet program is the International Studies Academy. It begins by teaching foreign languages in the first grade. A study showed that fifth graders involved in the program were just as fluent as high school students who had taken traditional language courses.
<P>
The school district received other accolades while Wallace was in charge. The Arts Propel program was named the best arts program in the world by Newsweek magazine in December 1991. Taylor Allderdice, the top academic high school, produced between 12 and 20 National Merit semifinalists each year.
<P>
Another program that Wallace receives credit for is the MAP (Monitoring Achievement in Pitts-burgh) program, which links basic skill instruction with a systematic testing program. The program is recognized for helping to raise the average student's achievement score on a standardized test from the national average to the mid-70th percentile.
<P>
<h2>ROBERT L.VANN</h2>

Robert L. Vann sensed the need for Blacks in Pittsburgh to have their own newspaper, so he founded the Pittsburgh Courier in 1910 with some help from associates. The intial press run was 500, with copies of the debut edition selling for 5 cents on a snowy Saturday morning. 
<P>
The paper quickly grew from a modest beginning to its eventual role as the voice for Pittsburgh's Black community. The newspaper became the platform from which Black leaders could speak out for equality.
<P>
Vann played a critical role, becoming the paper's publisher and editor in 1912 and guiding its growth. He combined an effective editorial policy with shrewd business sense. The Courier, under Vann's leadership, earned a reputation for honest reporting.  The Courier came into its own during World War I, leading the charge for complete integration of American life. 
<P>
But beyond Vann's abilities as a newspaper publisher, he also was an accomplished attorney. After attending Waters Normal Institute and Virginia Union University, Vann earned his law degree from the University of Pittsburgh.
<P>
Just as the Courier made rapid strides, so did Vann's other careers: law and politics.
<P>
Vann served as assistant city solicitor for Pittsburgh from 1917 through 1921. He also served as the national director of Negro publicity during the presidential campaigns of GOP candidates Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.
<P>
Vann later felt Hoover had betrayed the African American community, so Vann switched political allegiances to the Democrats, taking with him the votes of many African Americans who looked to Vann for guidance.  Vann eventually was named special assistant to the attorney general of the United States. He later was named to President Franklin Roosevelt's Black Cabinet.
<P>
At the time cancer claimed Vann's life in 1940, the Courier was the most widely read Black newspaper in America, with circulation numbering in the hundreds of thousands. The newspaper's influence was felt across the country during World War II, driving for desegregation through the Courier's "Double V" campaign that called for victory at home and abroad. 
<P>
During a period of great difficulty for African Americans, Vann prospered and was a role model of success.
<P> 
<h2>JOHN E.CONNELLY</H2>
<H3>ACHIEVEMENT AWARD</H3>

For 21 years, Junior Achievement of Southwest Pennsylvania has presented its annual Achievement Award to a local corporation's chief executive. These executives are honored for their personal accomplishments and those of their companies -- people and institutions which have done the most for the free enterprise system. The award has traditionally been presented at Junior Achievement's annual meeting; two years ago, however, a new tradition began with the presentation of the award at the annual Business Hall of Fame Dinner. This year's dinner continues the tradition with the event scheduled for Oct. 25, 1995, at the Pittsburgh Hilton & Towers.
<P>
The 1994 Achievement Award winner is John E. Connelly, chairman and chief executive officer of J. Edward Connelly Associates Inc. Connelly served the public as treasurer of the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority, overseeing more than $100 million in public funds directed toward the new sewerage infrastructure and the consequent rehabilitation of our rivers.
<P>
It was in 1958 that he decided to launch his now-famous riverboat excursion service, which is one of the largest such fleets in the nation. His enterprises are now channeled through a dozen companies, including the Gateway Clipper fleet and the Sheraton Inn at Station Square.
<P>
Connelly is most famous for his marketing ventures, including his "Apples for the Students" campaign that helped equip schools with high- tech equipment so students would be prepared for the computer age.
<P>
JA's mission is to inspire and educate young people to value free enterprise. The 1995 Achievement Award winner and his predecessors are symbols of this mission. Past recipients of this award provide an honor roll of some of the top names in business in southwestern Pennsylvania.

<h2>The Future of Our Colleges and Universities Depends on the Money They Raise Today</h2>
<P>
Duquesne University used to be a sleepy commuter school, for more than a century providing undergraduate degrees principally for western Pennsylvania residents. The wake- up call finally came in 1988, when the school named John E. Murray Jr. as its president. 
<P> 
Eight years later, enrollment is up, a 43 percent jump over the past six years. The school is adding 45 new majors and constructing a new science school. Other changes include an expanded student union and a new dormitory. 
<P>
 
"The attitude used to be, 'We'd better not try something because we can't afford it,' " says Murray, drawing on a cigarette in his office on the Bluff. "My view is that growth is essential. If we don't want to grow, we should just stay in bed." 
<P>
Instead, Murray is quite the early riser. His vision for the school required cash, so he has become a rainmaker extraordinaire. Despite a fund-raising environment wracked by corporate downsizing, Murray has amassed contributions to fill the Catholic university's coffers, fuel expansion, increase faculty salaries and add programs. 
<P> 
"I don't know how much longer he can keep it up," a Duquesne professor says of Murray's fund-raising prowess. "I just hope he can sustain it." 
<P>
For now, Murray is making it look easy. A former law school dean at the University of Pittsburgh and a nationally recognized expert on contract law, Murray capitalizes on  his connections to the corporate world. Some of those he solicits are former students who now hold positions of power in the corporate world. Others are people who know Murray because of his stature as a contracts expert. 
<P>
Murray slips into corporate boardrooms or executive suites, talks a little business and walks away with a million here, a million there. So much for the sleepy commuter school. 
<P> 
Experts say the ability to raise money is crucial for survival in higher education. 
<P>
"Money raised today is, in fact, a guarantee of the quality of the school's future," said Tim Seiler, director of operations for the fund-raising school at Indiana University's Center on Philanthropy in Indianapolis. 
<P>
Seiler, who teaches the art of rainmaking, says Murray's contacts in the corporate world are invaluable. But he also points to another advantage: Private schools like Duquesne, Seiler says, usually are smaller and have a loyal group of alumni, a definite benefit when it comes to fund raising.  "Alumni who feel that loyalty are more apt to give," Seiler says. 
<P>
Duquesne, in turn, can beef up programs, hire name faculty members, keep class sizes down and improve facilities, offering a more polished image to prospective students. The tangible, immediate results? One, an enrollment jump at Duquesne when other institutions are trying to stem enrollment declines. 
<P>
Pitt, Duquesne's state-funded neighbor that sits a few miles up Forbes Avenue, is one example. Pitt has seen enrollment decline at the same time that state legislators are becoming more stingy with funding dollars. What complicates matters, Seiler says, is that Pitt -- with branch campuses and sprawling graduate schools -- is the opposite of Duquesne. 
<P>
"Some institutions are so large that it is difficult for individuals to feel loyalty," Seiler says. "What complicates the problem at a school like Pitt is that state funding is staying flat or going down, so there is an increased need for fund raising. Often, alumni do not understand this predicament." 
<P>
Pitt administrators cite general fund-raising numbers that exceed totals of recent years, but trouble raising dollars for some specific goals, such as the establishment of an undergrad-uate business school. J. Dennis O'Connor, who joined the university as chancellor in 1991, resigned last spring after falling out of favor with some members of the university's board of trustees. 
<P>
Do Pitt's recent troubles warrant dire consequences for the university's ability to deliver qualified graduates in the immediate future? Hardly. The university has a firm foothold in the academic world, strengthened by a well-regarded undergraduate program and some outstanding graduate and professional schools. Its medical school, for example, has achieved widespread recognition. 
<P>
But if Pitt's current problems continue, particularly its fund-raising malaise, they might ultimately affect the quality and quantity of the graduates it delivers into the work force. 
<P>
<H2>Duquesne's Rising Star</H2> 
<P> 
In April, Duquesne officials stunned competitive counterparts when they announced numbers reflecting some meteoric fund raising. A $100 million drive for capital improvements, begun in 1993, had already brought in $52 million. By July, the total was $57.5 million. 
<P>
Duquesne plans to reach the $100 million mark by 1999, and Murray's confidence, are supported by the success of a drive launched in 1988, the same year Murray became president. The drive set out to raise $25 million, but in the end brought in $75 million. A lot of the money has come from corporate types, and Murray does not deflect the credit. "I'm comfortable with CEOs," he says. His growth of the school is reflected in the quality of student enrolling there, with SAT scores an average 48 points higher now than six years ago. 
<P>
Of course, the growth also is reflected by the number of buildings currently under construction on the uptown campus. One project is the 40,000 square-foot environmental research center. In planning the structure, the university solicited input from environmental scientists in both government and industry. As a result, Murray says, the center will have a practical orientation. "It's one thing to sit in an ivory tower and talk about the programs you're going to have. But we don't do it that way. We go to the people who do it for a living," Murray says. 
<P>
Another focus of fund raising has been the Bayer School of Natural and Environmental Science, which will support a new master's program. Construction began on the school's structure in January, and is expected to be completed this fall. Bayer's pledge: $2 million. 
<P> 
Other goals for the projected $100 million pool include $25 million to support 45 new academic programs, $15 million for scholarship endowments and $10 million to rehabilitate buildings. 
<P> 
<H2>Pitt's Battle </h2> 
By contrast, the development picture at Pitt is static.
<BR>
Lawrence Weber, vice-chancellor for institutional advancement, says general annual campaigns for voluntary support totaled $29 million in 1992, $33 million in 1993 and $32 million in 1994. The high-water mark was $38 million in 1991. In addition, he says, the university has $20 million in outstanding pledges. <P>But the university has fallen flat in its efforts to raise money for some key capital projects.
<P>
Among these is a proposed undergraduate business school, estimated to cost $30 million. Since fund raising for the school isn't progressing, Pitt is studying the idea of using an existing building to save up to $18 million. 
<P>
Pitt officials readily concede that efforts to raise the $30 million, which have yielded little more than $1 million in two years, are in the doldrums. Some faculty members at Pitt have openly questioned whether there is a need for the business school. 
<P>
Also on hold is fund raising for a sports and convocation center. "The state has funded $13 million for it," says Weber. "But we hope to get more. Penn State and Temple University each got $30 million [from the Common-wealth] for comparable structures. We still hope to raise another $20 million." 
<P>
Early last spring, a consultant hired by the university told Pitt administrators something they already knew all too well: The university wasn't ready to proceed with fund-raising drives for such capital projects. The consultant had based this assessment on a finding that there were differences between some trustees and the administration. 
<P>
It's now clear there were differences aplenty between some of the 36 members of the board of trustees and Chancellor O'Connor. One insider said that some of the trustees who had lost faith in O'Connor's leadership abilities were closely tied to big business -- the most likely source of contributions, particularly those that would go towards a business school. 
<P>
O'Connor came to Pitt, a quasi-public institution, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, a state university, where he had been provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs. UNC-CH is lavishly funded by state legislators (many of whom are graduates of its law school), and the university has a highly productive private fund-raising machine that enjoys the advantage of linking alumni contributions to its nationally ranked athletic teams. 
<P>
As O'Connor's friction with trustees became public last spring, there ensued intimations that he had fallen short of the mark as a rainmaker. 
<P> 
Yet some suggest that trustees are every bit as responsible as the chancellor. <P> 
"My view is that fund raising is a joint activity between the president and key board members. Many of the trustees reflect corporate Pittsburgh, and this would open the doors to rainmaking activity. Needless to say, the board can also close the door," says Ron Cowell, a trustee and state representative from the 34th district in eastern Allegheny County. 
<P> 
Cowell, who wasn't on the board when O'Connor was hired, says the trustees apparently weren't "clear about their expectations" when they hired him. 
<P>
"I think the board has a responsibility to be clear in articulating the type of leadership that it wants; it should be part of the interviewing process," says Cowell. 
<P> 
O'Connor, who has been loath to make any statements concerning his depar-ture, couldn't be reached for comment.
<P>
<h2> The Other Players</h2>
As Pitt has made headlines for O'Connor's short stint and Duquesne, for bringing in cash, Pitt's Oakland neighbor, Carnegie Mellon University, has continued its national renown for having some of the best computer science and engineering programs, and perhaps the best robotics program. Some of the liberal arts graduate programs were ranked in the top 10 of a Newsweek magazine survey earlier this year. 
<P>
CMU isn't currently in a fund-   raising mode -- not publicly anyway. "We're in the early stages of a campaign that won't be announced for another year and a half or so," says Eric Johnson, vice president for development at the 7,000 student school. 
<P>
CMU's last major campaign raised $226 million in five years. Much of this money has gone for capital projects that include the $47 million university center and the $22 million Pernell Performing Arts Center, which will break ground next spring. Also resulting from the campaign were Roberts Engineering Hall, a $17 million home for materials research (including those for data storage) that still is under construction; the planned renovation of undergraduate chemistry labs, to cost $12 million; the Pittsburgh Technology Center, the recently finished $16 million industrial park on the Mon River, and Posner Hall, the graduate school of industrial administration, completed two years ago at a cost of $14 million. 
<P> 
Other local colleges are just gearing up, however. 
<P>
Chatham College is planning its first campaign since the late 1980s, when the college raised more than $10 million. More than $2 million in contributions that came in over the past year are helping the college rewire its campus for the information age, said Mary Kay Poppenberg, a Chatham vice president. Personal computers, including those in residence halls, will have data and voice links with the institution's mainframes. 
<P>
Annual giving at Carlow College has been increasing about 10 percent a year for the past three or four years, and totaled about $400,000 for the year that ended June 30, said the college's president, Sister Grace Ann Geibel. This fall, she says, Carlow will announce a capital campaign for renovations and "enhancing technology. We're now in the quiet solicitation phase." The college is seeking to offer increased computer capacity along with information management courses and more business-oriented writing courses to prepare students for financial careers. 
<P> 
La Roche College, too, is in the midst of a capital campaign. The school has raised more than $19.5 million since 1990, and hopes to reach its goal of $30 million by 1999, says Paul Stabile, vice president for college relations. La Roche has recently completed and opened two new buildings, a $1 million chapel and a $6.8 million fitness and sports center that has enabled the school to establish men's and women's basketball programs to attract more students. Goals include a new academic building estimated to cost $7.2 million. 
<P>
Robert Morris College is in the early stages of a development campaign. It garnered more than $1 million over the past year, says university spokesman Jeff Durosko. Goals for future fund raising include scholarships, new buildings and academic programs. New academic programs will place a stronger emphasis on oral and written communications. 
<P>
Point Park College's several-year drive has brought in $10 million, some of which will go to the college's library center. Planned for the vacant structure that formerly enclosed Bank Center Mall downtown, it will also house the Carnegie Library's downtown and business branches. Interior demolition began over the summer. 
<P> 
In higher education, fund raising today affects what facilities and programs an institution can offer in the future. In the end, it also will affect the number of students who enroll. It is a key to survival.

<HR>
<h2>What Do Employers Want From Future Graduates?</h2> 
Every employer seeks some basic qualities from the college graduates they interview for jobs: an ability to think conceptually, an intellectual reflex for organizing information and basic research skills to find answers quickly. 
<P>
But in today's intensively competitive workplace, there are some additional qualities that are being stressed, to some measure because of the degree to which they are found to be absent in the hordes of applicants. 

<P>
Chief among these is the ability to communicate clearly, succinctly and effectively, both orally and in writing.
<p>
Grant Wirth, a partner at the CPA firm of D.G. Sisterson & Co., believes that graduates could and should be emerging with better verbal skills than what he's seen in many recent applicants. 
<P>
"Communication is a skill that is not emphasized enough," he says. "And I'm not talking about just touchy-feely communication, but the ability to take complex information and dummy it down, make it simple without over-simplifying it. As the amount of information available grows at an exponential rate, I think people will be required more and more to communicate clearly and succinctly to understand narrow technical fields in order to manage them." vVerbal skills are also high on the list of Marc Herman, senior vice president of PNC Bank Corp., who runs the company's new Financial Services Center. Herman likes to say he needs people who can "smile over the phone," but in order for that smile to be recognized on the other end, and for it to produce a smile in the customer, Herman needs employees who can communicate clearly the things they know about PNC's services. 
<P>
"When people call a bank, they're not looking for a banker," Herman says. "They're looking for someone to help them. The employee needs to know banking, and to know how to handle the call in a way that is not intimidating, but knowledgeable and friendly." 
<P>
Richard DeYoung, a partner in the architectural firm of Williams Trebilcock Whitehead, says he, too, is looking for good communicators. "If we have ideas and can't convey them to partners and clients, what good are they?" says DeYoung, adding that he doesn't expect graduating seniors to communicate as effectively as architects who have been on the job a while. "When they come in to interview, some are in a shell, but when you get some of them talking, they're good." 
<P>
If applicants lack some basic written skills, they never get this chance, DeYoung adds. "The first thing they're rejected for is misspellings or resumes that are graphically displeasing."

<HR><h2>CCAC's Kingsmore Sees Light at End of Budget Crunch</h2> 
Just like most other higher education institutions, some of the numbers facing the Community College of Allegheny County are frightening. 
<P>
Enrollment is down, a 6.1-percent drop last spring from the previous year. Additionally, a change in the way the state funds community colleges will cost CCAC about $4 million in funding next budget year. 
<P> 
But before any programs disappear or class sizes suddenly jump at CCAC's four campuses, CCAC President John M. Kingsmore is trying to manage the budget crunch by re-engineering the manner in which the college operates. That means a focus on having the four campuses operate as one college to eliminate redundant tasks that eat up the budget. Other cost-cutting measures include limiting hiring and offering early retirement to veteran employees. Kingsmore also has brought unions representing college employees into the fold with minimal salary increases until the college gets past its budget crunch.
<p>
In the end, Kingsmore hopes the college will avoid a bud get shortfall while maintaining academic integrity. <P>"We are trying to keep our class sizes relatively low," Kingsmore said. "We are keeping our focus on learning and on the students."
<p>
The average CCAC class size is around 25, a number that undoubtedly will jump if the college has to resort to cutting instructional staff. 
<P>
Kingsmore said this school year is a key for CCAC because of the change that is forthcoming. 
<P>
"I am optimistic," Kingsmore says, "but I don't want to downplay the challenge in front of us." 
<P>
CCAC is the state's fourth largest higher education institution, with full-time enrollment of about 22,000 students. Its strongest selling point is its cost in comparison to four-year institutions. Tuition for this school year is $64 per credit, costing a full-time student less than $2,000 per year for credits that is most cases will transfer to the four-year institutions in the region. Students can finish their degrees at a four-year school after completing two years at CCAC.

<b><P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2> GOVERNER TOM RIDGE</FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b><fill></FONT SIZE></b><br>

<P>

<font size =+2><B><fill></B></font size> 
When Gov. Tom Ridge took office in January, many business leaders in Pennsylvania felt new hope that this state would become a more friendly place to do business. In their words, that meant lower business taxes, less regulation and workers' compensation reform, just to name a few items on their wish list.<BR>During the campaign against Democrat Mark Singel, Ridge himself was critical of the business atmosphere in Pennsylvania. A common image in the campaign was a widely played Ridge television commercial in which he stood in a town square espousing the state's pathetic rate of new business starts. 
<P> 
Now, Ridge has been through his first go-round with the state Legislature and has been gearing up for the Legis-lature's return to Harrisburg this fall. <P>While in Pittsburgh this summer, Ridge reflected on his early months in office and what the future holds. 
<P>
<B>ER: Some say your early months have been a huge success. Others aren't as complimentary. What's your appraisal? 
<P>
Ridge:</B> When I ran for this job, I said there were several things we    needed to do in order to change Pennsylvania. We had to make Pennsylvania a job-friendly state. We had to do more to make Pennsylvania competitive. We had to do more to make Pennsylvania's streets safer. We had to do more to change the relationship between government and the  people it serves. 
<P>
We set a very aggressive agenda, I think, to change Pennsylvania. In the first six months, we kept many of those promises we made during the campaign.  We promised we would have a disciplined, focused budget that cut taxes, produced savings for future years and identified priorities with increased funding consistent with Pennsylvania's needs. We did just that. 
<P> 
We cut taxes. We moved an unprecedented amount over to the rainy day fund, and we increased funding for public education and public funding. Promises made. Promises kept. 
<P>
We talked about holding a special session on crime. It was pretty clear the concerns Pennsylvanians had about crime in their streets, neighborhoods and schools. It was a large part of the campaign. We said we would have a special session. Within several days of my swearing-in, we called the Legislature back in. With considerable help from both sides of the aisle, I think we not only got an unprecedented amount of crime-fighting legislation, but finally some legislation that brings long overdue, fundamental changes to the justice system, with a special emphasis on the juvenile justice system, victims' rights and other related matters. In the long term, these measures will prove to be valuable aids to the law enforcement community and will go a long way to improving our ability to fight crime. 
<P> 
<B>ER: There are issues intimately essential to business -- taxes, workers' compensation to name two. What inroads have you made? 
<P>
Ridge:</B> We talked a lot during the campaign about economic development ... about making Pennsylvania job-friendly. For too long, we've had this outward migration of Pennsyl-vania's jobs and Pennsylvania's businesses to other states. What we need to do is understand that we are in competition with other states and that competition is serious. That competition is even more fierce if you look at the competition of the global marketplace. What we need to do in Pennsylvania is peel off some of these layers of government that I think have disadvantaged our workers and our employers. To that end, we accelerated the reduction of the corporate net income tax, we elevated the level of deductions you can take -- losses from one year and carrying them over to the next. We've begun to change the regulatory environment. We put together a Keystone Export Task Force comprised of Pennsylvanians that will help me design a strategy to promote Pennsylvania's goods offshore. 
<P>
We certainly need to sell our goods in the other 49 states, but I think there are other huge markets out there internationally. We must have a strategy to promote exports. We must have a mind-set that says export, export, export. There are billions of potential consumers out there for the widest possible range of products. We have world class workers who produce world class products in Pennsylvania. I think we ought to stamp them 'Made in Pennsylvania' and get them out the door. 
<P>
Another issue critically important to our competitiveness is workers' compensation reform. This is not a special interest issue. It is not a labor vs. management issue. Clearly, we need workers' compensation to help people who get hurt on the job. But again, as we look to the burden on our businesses in a fiercely, fiercely competitive marketplace, we are disadvantaged in this state and we need to bring some changes to the workers' compensation system as well. 
<P>
<B>ER: Exporting is definitely important, but it tends to lead to gradual economic growth, something that might not produce headlines. Will the voters in Homestead and other small communities even notice if your strategy works? 
<P> 
Ridge:</B> I hope so. They will start noticing right away in some of our urban communities. One of the other initiatives we have involves reuse of old industrial sites. There is no better example of a community that needs that kind of initiative than Allegheny County. We have a strong tradition of steelmaking and manufacturing, but we've been looking at these vacated facilities for a long time. 
<P>
As far as exporting is concerned, the long-term implications for Penn-sylvania's workers probably won't be as visible. But I will tell you it is my firm belief that if you reduce those job-crushing corporate taxes, get the regulatory environment under control, make workers' compensation rates more competitive and you promote exports, it will bring a stability to our communities and businesses that we have not seen, and then you build on that stability. I would like to think that in a couple years, once we get everything in place, that Pennsylvania businesses that have been inclined for a variety of reasons to expand outside Pennsylvania, will stay and expand in Pennsylvania. 
<P>
What will the voters notice? The most immediate and visible reflection of the change will occur in the next couple years as we target some of these abandoned industrial sites, clean them up and give incentives to get people back to these sites and get people back to work. 
<P> 
<B>ER: What about small business? What are you doing to help the small businesses? 
<P>
Ridge:</B> The first step in that direction was changing from $500,000 to   $1 million the amount of net operating loss permitted to be carried forward. That helps the small business, the entrepreneur. The focus on exports will really benefit those small- to medium-sized businesses that have never exported before or are increasing exports. Part of that focus is trying to work within the financial community to develop different kinds of financing instruments. Financing is a huge obstacle to any kind of exporting today. 
<P>
Small businesses also are the ones crying out for workers' compensation reform. We want to begin addressing that agenda this fall. Whether we get it accomplished or not remains to be seen, but we are going to put it out there for discussion. 
<P>
<B>ER: You revamped what was the Department of Environmental Re-sources, an agency many businesses loathed in this state. What will the new regulatory environment be like? 
<P>
Ridge:</B> The Department of Environmental Resources was a job-crushing, community-harassing, regulatory nightmare. The notion we desire is that government should treat citizens it is designed to serve in a manner that is fair, responsible and reasonable, reaching out to them and helping them comply with the law. It is a notion that government should be a partner in protecting the environment, rather than a police force that is sitting back and waiting for someone to make a mistake and then pouncing on them from a punitive point of view. 
<P>
Most citizens I know want to be good stewards of the environment. Treat them accordingly until they show you something different. If you show them what the law is, show them how to comply with the law, and then they willfully ignore it or disobey it, then your response has to be swift and uncompromising. But absent that, we wanted to go from a policing and punitive mentality to more of a collaborative and compliance-based mentality. We've changed the DER. It is now the Department of Environmental Protection. We've created a new department to take care of our parks and forests. Clearly Pennsylvania's parks and forests compose one of the finest and largest such systems in the country. This system needs special attention, a place at the cabinet table before the appropriate legislative committees. Thus, we now have the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. 
<P>
<B>ER: You also tackled education, an issue of interest to business leaders since business needs a qualified work force in the future. Why did you move ahead with your school choice initiative so early in your administration when you knew success was questionable? 
<P>
Ridge:</B> I raised the level of public debate on education by submitting early on the education reform package. Some people questioned the timing, but I will tell you there was never going to be an easy time to promote fundamental reform in a system that has operated pretty much the same way for 15 to 20 years. The education establishment predictably, and I'm not saying this critically, would resist fundamental reform at any time during the Ridge administration. I felt it was important just to raise the issue early in my administration and let people know I am committed to education reform. 
<P>
<B>ER: What should we expect when you take another run at the Legislature this fall with the education reform package? 
<P>Ridge:</B> I have some basic preconditions that I think are integral to the education reform package and must be preserved. I'm sure there also will be some recommendations I may want to graft on to that package. I think we need an education opportunity grant program. You need to create that kind of choice. 
<P>
Education, in my judgment, has been a priority ignored for too long in Pennsylvania. Clearly, we need to challenge and change the system so there is much greater accountability and better delivery of educational services. The consumers of the educational product are the children. I don't think that product is consistent with what the children's parents are paying for. We have an extremely high per capita expenditure on public education in Pennsylvania. There are good schools and good teachers and these good schools and good teachers have little to worry about in the education reform package. In fact, some of the innovations would be attractive to them. We raised the issue and it is not going away. Even if we get this fundamental package of reform passed, there will be other things we want to do down the road. 
<P>
<B>ER: Do you think you can maintain the level of success you have had with the Legislature? 
<P>
Ridge:</B> There is an energy level, a commitment to change Pennsylvania that has just continued to accelerate. I hope we can maintain that energy, maintain that commitment over the next couple of years. Pennsylvanians need it and deserve it. We've got great people and enormous potential in this state that will only be realized when we change the relationship between government and the people it serves.
