<H2>Press Release<BR>
For Immediate Release</H2>

<P>Montreal, August 9, 1996</P>

<H2>Cambior Announces its Second Quarter Results and The Startup of the Omai Mill Expansion</H2>

<P><B>Since the beginning of 1996, Cambior has reported its financial statements in US $.</B></P>

Cambior Inc. announced today that its second quarter production was 111,800 ounces of
gold, 14,300 tonnes of zinc and 1,900 tonnes of copper.  Gold production in the second
quarter showed a 24% improvement over the first quarter's gold production of
90,200 ounces as operations at Omai reached full capacity by quarter's end.<P>

Revenues for the second quarter amounted to $74.0 million compared to $76.4 million for
the same quarter of 1995.  Cash flow from operations (before changes in working capital
items) amounted to $14.0 million ($0.23 per share) compared to $20.1 million
($0.41 per share) for the second quarter of 1995, and the net earnings totaled $1.1 million
($0.02 per share) versus $1.9 million ($0.04 per share).<P>

Revenues for the first half of 1996 totaled $134.7 million compared to $144.4 million for
the same period in 1995.  Cash flow from operations amounted to $25.6 million
($0.44 per share) compared to $35.7 million ($0.73 per share) for the first half of 1995. 
Net earnings were $2.1 million ($0.04 per share) compared to $5.7 million
($0.12 per share) for the same period in 1995.<P>

Results for the first half of the year were negatively impacted by lower production at Omai
due to the gradual resumption of operations since February 1996.  Results were also
affected by the loss of production at the Doyon mine due to the eight-week strike during
the second quarter.<P>

<H3>PRODUCTION UPDATE</H3>

The Omai mine produced 58,000 ounces of gold in the second quarter, a marked
improvement over the 27,000 ounces produced in the first quarter.  Since the resumption
of operations in February, production gradually increased and reached full capacity by June
1996.  The mill expansion was successfully commissioned in early July and is expected to
gradually reach its design capacity during the third quarter.<P>
The strike at Doyon has resulted in a loss of production estimated at 6,000 ounces
(Cambior's share) with resulting higher costs for the period.  The mine has resumed full
production but was shutdown for two weeks in early July for a previously scheduled
maintainance period.  The production target for Doyon (Cambior's share) has been
adjusted accordingly to 105,000 ounces for the year 1996.<P>
Production at the Langlois mine (formerly the Grevet mine) has gradually improved since
its startup earlier this year.  Production and mill throughput steadily improved to reach an
average of 1,700 tonnes/day by the end of the quarter.  Further improvements in mill
throughput and metal recoveries are expected through the second half of the year.<P>
Operations at Bouchard-H&eacute;bert were affected in June due to two weeks of major repairs to
the shaft.  Mill throughput progressively improved with the introduction of increased mill
capacity.  Mill throughput averaged 2,500 tonnes/day by the end of the quarter and is
expected to run at full capacity during the second half of the year.<P>
Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cambior, stated "Production at
Omai is expected to continue to improve in the third and fourth quarters with the full access
of the higher grade ore of the Fennell pit and the successful startup of the mill expansion
occurring in early July.  The production at Omai is expected to be 255,000 ounces for
1996.  Cambior has adjusted its full year production target to 500,000 ounces of gold,
66,000 tonnes of zinc and 8,400 tonnes of copper."<P>

<H3>INVESTMENTS AND FINANCING</H3>

Investments during the second quarter totaled $30 million, and were principally focused on
the completion of the mill expansion at Omai ($7 million), the funding of major
international development projects ($12 million) and ongoing expenditures at producing
mines.<P>
Benefitting from a successful hedging program, the Company generated, for the quarter, an
average price of $428 per ounce, a $38 premium over the average market price of $390. 
For the first half, the Company obtained an average price of $432 per ounce, a premium of
$37 over the average market price of $395.  For the second half of 1996, the Company has
gold hedging positions on 179,000 ounces assuring a minimum price of $423 per ounce.<P>
During the quarter, Cambior extended the maturity of its gold loan for a period of one year. 
Repayments will now begin on June 30, 1997 and extend over the period to
December 31, 2000.  Cambior maintains a strong financial position to pursue its growth
strategy with $143 million of cash and a net debt of only $75 million at the end of the
second quarter.<P>

<H3>DEVELOPMENT AND EXPLORATION PROJECTS</H3>

During the second quarter, the Company pursued its development and exploration work on
the El Pach&oacute;n, La Granja, Gross Rosebel and Metates projects.<P>
At the <B>El Pach&oacute;n (Argentina)</B> project, work continues to finalize mining reserves and
optimize operating parameters in order to further improve the project economics.  The
feasibility study, scheduled for completion during the first quarter of 1997, is expected to
take into account an increase in the original throughput from 40,000 tonnes per day to
70,000 tonnes per day.  This project, located at the Chilean/Argentinean border, will benefit
from the recently announced agreement by both governments to sign a treaty permitting the
efficient operations of mining projects at the border.  In this respect, both governments
have agreed to establish a specific protocol for the El Pach&oacute;n project which is scheduled for
signing in the fall of 1996.  Such an agreement and protocol would allow the shareholders
of Pach&oacute;n S.A. Minera to draw on the most economical services from the most
appropriate country and could positively impact the economics of the project.  During the
quarter, Cambior met its spending obligations and earned an additional 10% equity interest
in the Argentinean company to own a 50% equity interest in the El Pach&oacute;n project.<P>
At <B>La Granja (Peru)</B>, drilling continued in the second quarter in order to explore and
better define the orebody.  It is expected that a significant portion of the possible reserves
will be upgraded to the proven and probable category and improve the stripping ratio of the
deposit. Work continues in the preparation of the feasibility study with a view to improving
the project economics from the prefeasibility study completed earlier this year.  The
feasibility study is now scheduled for completion by the spring of 1997.  As a result of the
world class size and potential of the project, Cambior will be seeking a partner to supply
smelter capacity and support the financing requirements.<P>
At the <B>Gross Rosebel (Suriname)</B> project (50% Cambior), work continues to complete
the feasibility study by early 1997.  Further drilling of the deposits continues with a view to
increasing the mining reserves previously established at 1.1 million ounces.  Engineering
studies are underway to better define the metallurgical aspects of the ore and optimize the
capital expenditure and operating cost parameters.<P>
Development also continued on the <B>Metates (Mexico)</B> project with the principal focus on
metallurgical testing to confirm earlier results and optimize processing scenarios and
further enhance the project economics.  The feasibility study is scheduled for completion
by the end of spring 1997.<P>
During the first half of 1996, the Company spent $4 million on <B>exploration expenses</B>
relating to identifying high potential gold projects.  The results seem encouraging and the
Company has decided to accelerate its exploration expenditures, especially in Peru and
Mexico, during the second half of the year on the most promising gold properties and has
approved a 50% increase in funding to over $6 million for the second half of 1996.<P>

<H3>STRATEGIC OUTLOOK</H3>

Mr. Gignac stated that "Production at existing operations and financial performance are
expected to show marked improvement during the second half of the year as Omai benefits
from the mill expansion and mill throughput increases at the Bouchard-H&eacute;bert and
Langlois mines.  We should establish, during the second half of the year, a sustainable
level of production and financial performance.  The major development projects are being
aggressively pursued and we are increasing our efforts and funding to identify and develop
gold projects, including the indicated potential on the new mineralized structure on the
Doyon property and the ongoing programs, especially in Suriname, French Guiana,
Mexico and Peru.  Cambior has considerable potential for enhancing shareholder value and
we are pursuing all avenues to maximize the realization of this value."<P>
Cambior is a major gold producer with base metal production and operations/exploration
activities in North and South America.  Cambior shares ("CBJ") are listed on the Toronto,
Montreal and American (AMEX) stock exchanges.<P>

<H2>Press Release<BR>
For Immediate Release</H2>

Montreal, June 20, 1996<P>

<H2>Official Inauguration of the Gonzague Langlois Mine</H2>

Cambior Inc. is pleased to announce that today it officially inaugurated the Gonzague Langlois Mine, located near Lebel-sur-Qu&eacute;villon, Quebec and formerly known as the Grevet mine.<P>

The event took place before 250&nbsp;guests that included representatives of both levels of government, numerous dignitaries and representatives of the mining industry.<P>

Cambior took the opportunity to pay tribute, posthumously, to Mr. Gonzague Langlois, a pioneer of the Canadian mining industry as we know it today, and a former member of Cambior's board of directors.  A mining engineer by training, Gonzague Langlois devoted most of his life to the mining industry, both in terms of know-how and the grouping of common strengths and interests.  "He was a person who became totally involved, who acted out of passion.  He was like a rock.  He either liked something or he didn't...", his wife, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Langlois, told us.  This deposit was put into production at a cost of Cdn $90&nbsp;million.  It entered into commercial production in the first quarter of this year and will provide employment for 200&nbsp;people, in addition to other important economic spin-offs for the Lebel-sur-Qu&eacute;villon region.<P>

The mine is expected to produce annually 62,000&nbsp;tonnes of zinc, 3,000&nbsp;tonnes of copper, 700&nbsp;ounces of gold and 313,000&nbsp;ounces of silver from 910,000 tonnes of ore.  Mining reserves at the Gonzague Langlois mine stand at 11 million tonnes grading 8.41% zinc, 0.46% copper, 37.0&nbsp;g/t silver and 0.1&nbsp;g/t gold.  The mine has a life of over 12&nbsp;years.<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operations and exploration activities in North and South America.  Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal, Toronto and American (AMEX) stock exchanges under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

For Immediate Release</H2>

Montreal, May 9, 1996<P>

<H2>Cambior Announces a Semi-Annual Dividend Payment</H2>

The Board of Directors of Cambior has approved a semi-annual dividend of US&nbsp;$0.052 per common share payable on June&nbsp;28,&nbsp;1996 to the shareholders of record at the close of business on June&nbsp;7,&nbsp;1996.<P>

Cambior traditionally pays dividends in June and December.  The last semi-annual dividend payment was in December&nbsp;1995 for an amount of Cdn&nbsp;$0.07 (US&nbsp;$0.0517).<P>

In conjunction with Cambior's transition to United States dollar reporting as its currency of reporting for financial statement purposes, dividends will be declared in US&nbsp;dollars.  However, dividend payments will be paid to Canadian residents in the equivalent amount in Canadian currency (Cdn&nbsp;$) by using the noon rate of the Bank of Canada on the record date unless the shareholder, by written notification to the Montr&eacute;al Trust Company, requests payment in US&nbsp;dollars.<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operations and exploration activities in North and South America.  Cambior shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal, Toronto and American (AMEX) stock exchanges under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

For Immediate Release</H2>

Montreal, April 9, 1996

<H2>Prefeasibility Study Completed for the El Pach&oacute;n Project</H2>

Cambior Inc. is pleased to announce that a prefeasibility study has been completed for the El Pach&oacute;n copper project in Argentina and that Cambior's Board of Directors has agreed to proceed with the continuation of exploration and engineering work in preparation for the completion of the feasibility study in the first quarter of 1997.<P>

The El Pach&oacute;n project is situated in the Argentinean Andes, in the Province of San Juan, approximately three kilometres from the Chilean border.  Mining reserves at the project, based on data from 193&nbsp;drill holes totaling over 34,000&nbsp;metres, are estimated to be 687 million tonnes at 0.63%&nbsp;copper using a cutoff of 0.4%&nbsp;copper, representing over 9.5&nbsp;billion pounds of copper <I>in situ</I>.<P>

</TABLE><P>

Under the terms of its agreement, Cambior paid US $10 million to acquire 40% of the common shares of Pach&oacute;n S.A. Minera from Compa&ntilde;ia Minera San Jos&eacute; S.A. in 1994.  Cambior is currently completing the funding commitment of US&nbsp;$5&nbsp;million required to acquire an additional 10% interest.  San Jos&eacute; will then retain a 50% interest in Pach&oacute;n and will be responsible for funding its proportionate share of ongoing project expenditures.  San Jos&eacute;'s shareholders include Andean Resources (60%), Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ) (33%), and International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private financing arm of the World Bank (6%).<P>

The El Pach&oacute;n orebody is a porphyry copper deposit.  Chalcopyrite and molybdenite form the economic minerals.  Copper is associated with fracture filling and molybdenum is primarily found with quartz veinlets.  The host rocks are diorite, andesite and intrusive breccia.  Approximately 94% of the mineralization lies within the primary zone.<P>

Based on the results of the prefeasibility study, mining of the deposit would be based on an initial milling capacity of 40,000&nbsp;tonnes per day with a subsequent expansion to 60,000&nbsp;tonnes per day after seven years of production for an initial investment in the order of US&nbsp;$500&nbsp;million.  Ongoing metallurgical testwork has confirmed that flotation recoveries should be in the order of 92% for copper and 70% for molybdenum and that copper and molybdenum concentrates would be in the order of 28% and 45% respectively.<P>

According to a preliminary mine plan, some 111&nbsp;million tonnes grading 0.92%&nbsp;Cu could be milled with a waste/ore ratio of 1.8 in the first seven years of commercial production.  These preliminary results indicate an average annual production of 135,000&nbsp;tonnes of copper in concentrate during this first phase of mining at average direct cash costs of US&nbsp;$0.57 per pound of copper.  Construction could begin in 1998, following the confirmation of financing, with commercial production anticipated in the year 2000.<P>

<h3>Strategic Impact</h3>

According to Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer, &quot;The prefeasibility study has demonstrated the economic potential of this project and has enhanced shareholder value.  The feasibility study, expected in the first quarter of 1997, will include more advanced and technical studies on all aspects of the project in order to optimize costs and scheduling.  We look forward to working with San Jos&eacute; and with government officials at all levels in Argentina and Chile with a view to realizing the potential of El Pach&oacute;n for the benefit of all stakeholders.&quot;<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operations and exploration activities in North and South America.  Cambior shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal, Toronto and American (AMEX) stock exchanges under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

<H2>Joint Press Release</H2>

Montreal and Denver, March 26, 1996

<H2>Mining Reserves of Over One Million Ounces of Gold at&nbsp;Gross&nbsp;Rosebel</H2>

Cambior Inc. and Golden Star Resources Ltd. are pleased to announce mining reserves of 24&nbsp;million tonnes grading 1.4&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t on the Gross Rosebel property in Suriname, representing 1.1&nbsp;million ounces of gold <I>in&nbsp;situ</I>.<P>

This reserves estimate is based on results from 420&nbsp;diamond drill holes for a total of over 37,500&nbsp;metres, 4064&nbsp;Auger holes for a total of 25,000&nbsp;metres and 14&nbsp;kilometres of trenches.  Mining reserves identified to date lie in two areas of the huge Gross Rosebel property.  The South block contains the Mayo, Royal Hill and Rosebel deposits and the North block hosts the Pay Caro and Koolhoven deposits.  Eighty-six percent (86%) of the mining reserves identified to date are in soft rock (saprolite and laterite).  A breakdown of mining reserves in the South and North blocks is as follows:<P>

<H3>Geology</H3>
The Gross Rosebel exploration concession covers an area of 17,000&nbsp;hectares located 80&nbsp;km south of the Suriname capital, Paramaribo, and is easily accessible by road.  The property lies in a lower Proterozoic metasediment and metavolcanic belt that is crossed by tonalites and granites along its southern border.  The rocks form a large synclinal structure trending east-west and dipping west.  The gold mineralization is associated mainly with hydrothermal-type quartz veins and quartz carbonate veins.  Gold concentrations also occur along the contact of the metasediments and metavolcanics.  Because of intense tropical weathering, surficial laterite and saprolite extend to a depth of 50&nbsp;metres below surface.<P>

Under the terms of a mineral agreement signed on April&nbsp;7,&nbsp;1994 with the Republic of Suriname and Grasshopper Aluminium Company&nbsp;N.V., Golden Star owns the exploration rights to Gross Rosebel and the right to obtain a mining concession for the property after filing a feasibility study and environmental impact statement with the Suriname government.<P>

In December 1995, Cambior exercised its option to acquire a 50% interest in Golden Star's rights on the property, having provided US&nbsp;$6&nbsp;million in exploration and development expenditures for the property over the past 18&nbsp;months.  Cambior must also fund alone a further US&nbsp;$2.5&nbsp;million in expenditures, subject to a priority repayment from any future mining cash flow, and has undertaken to use its best efforts to arrange third party financing for at least 65% of any future construction costs and other investments related to the development of a mine on the property.  Golden Star manages the exploration work on the property, while Cambior will assume managerial responsibility for the preparation of a feasibility study and all subsequent phases of the project.<P>

<H3>Outlook</H3>
Some 33,000&nbsp;metres of drilling are scheduled to be conducted in 1996 on all the known deposits in the northern and southern areas to test their lateral and depth extensions, and on three new targets (&quot;J&quot; zone, Spin zone and Mama Creek zone) to identify additional reserves mineable by open pit.  The 1996 program will attempt to define new mining reserves from known soil anomalies found on the property between some of the zones and in the eastern and northeastern parts of the property.  The Pay Caro deposit also merits assessment of its underground potential.  Results of drilling below the initial pit outline returned 16.7&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t over 3&nbsp;metres, 8.2&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t over 10&nbsp;meters and 9.3&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t over 4.3&nbsp;metres.  A budget of US&nbsp;$5.5&nbsp;million is planned for 1996 to complete the drilling program and a feasibility study by year end, including an environmental impact study and condemnation and geotechnical drilling of the potential mill site and tailings pond.  A prefeasibility study will be tabled in the coming weeks.<P>

Montreal, March 13, 1996

<H2>Prefeasibility Study Completed for the La Granja Project; Mining Reserves for the Project Increase Substantially</H2>

Cambior Inc. is pleased to announce that a prefeasibility study has been completed for the La Granja copper project in Peru, and that the Board of Directors has approved the continuation of exploration and engineering work in preparation for the completion of the feasibility study in the first quarter of 1997.<P>

Mining reserves at the project have increased significantly since September 1995 to 1,300 million tonnes at 0.61% copper using a cutoff of 0.4% copper, representing nearly 16 billion pounds of copper <I>in situ</I>.<P>

</TABLE><P>

This update in the mining reserves is based on additional data from 59 new holes drilled specifically in the southeastern and northern parts of the deposit.  A total of 58,000 meters have been drilled to date in 179 holes.  Certain areas of the deposit appear to remain open laterally and at depth, which indicates the possibility of further increases in mining reserves.  Exploration drilling on a 200 m x 200 m grid is almost completed on the property, and definition drilling will continue on a 100 m x 100 m grid in 1996 to better delineate the size and characteristics of this deposit.<P>

The La Granja deposit consists of a strongly altered, late Tertiary intrusive and contains two zones.  The larger primary zone contains chalcopyrite, while the secondary enrichment zone contains an important proportion of leachable copper sulphides that could be processed by SX-EW (Solvent Extraction and ElectroWinning).  The secondary zone has more than tripled in size to 568 million tonnes grading 0.64% Cu.<P>

Based on the results of the prefeasibility study, the most economical alternative would be an operation based on a milling capacity of 90,000 tonnes per day with a total capital cost of approximately US $800 million.  Ongoing metallurgical testwork has confirmed that flotation recoveries for copper should be in the order of 90-93% and that copper concentrates would be in the 26-30% range.  According to a preliminary mine plan, some 220 million tonnes grading 0.87% copper could be mined with a waste/ore ratio of 0.47 in the first seven years of commercial production; these preliminary results indicate an average annual production of 250,000 tonnes of copper in concentrate during this first phase of mining at average direct cash costs of US $0.57 per pound of copper.  Subsequent to the confirmation of the feasibility study and arrangement of financing, construction of the open pit mine could begin in 1998 with commercial production anticipated in 2001.<P>

<H3>Strategic Impact</H3>

According to Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer, &quot;Mining reserves and the project economics at La Granja have improved steadily since Cambior became involved in the project in 1994.  Investment to date has totalled US $18 million and we have budgeted US $14 million for 1996, which will bring us to full feasibility study in the first quarter of 1997.  The size and potential of this world class copper project are such that Cambior will eventually investigate all avenues to maximize shareholder value, including seeking partners to further enhance the value of the project by sharing in the project financing and marketing.&quot;<P>

Montreal, February 9, 1996

<CENTER><H2>Cambior Inc. Reports 1995 Financial Results</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Inc. today announced its financial results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1995 with revenue of $344.4 million compared to $306 million in 1994.  Despite the interruption of the Omai mine operations, revenues increased by 13% due principally to the start-up of commercial production at the Bouchard-H&eacute;bert mine in January 1995.  Cambior's gold hedging program also contributed by generating an average of US $420 per ounce, a US $36 premium over the average market price of US $384 per ounce.<P>

Cash flow from operations (before changes in working capital) amounted to $61.4 million, or $1.22 per share compared to $72.9 million, or $1.49 per share in 1994.  The company reports a net loss of $9 million, or $0.18 per share compared to a net earnings of $2.5 million or $0.05 per share in 1994.<P>

The reduction of cash flow and the reporting of a loss in 1995 are attributable to the interruption of operations at the Omai mine, the production shortfall at the Valdez Creek Placer and the writedown of two underperforming mining assets.<P>

Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented that 1995 had been a difficult year with the Omai incident and the underperforming assets.  Nevertheless, with the resumption of operations at Omai, we are looking forward to a promising year in 1996.  We expect to return to normal profitability and improve upon it with the successful start-up of operations at Grevet in January and with the phasing in of the Omai mill expansion beginning in the second quarter.  With the start-up of operations at Omai, we now anticipate an increase in production from 1995 levels and have set a target of 530,000 ounces of gold production for Cambior in 1996.<P>

<B>Investment Program</B><P>

Capital expenditures of $160 million are planned for 1996 to support ongoing growth including the Omai mill expansion, major development projects and the eventual start-up of construction on the Carlota project.  The first half of 1996 will be very active for the Company with the completion of prefeasibility studies on several major projects (La Granja, El Pach&oacute;n, Gross Rosebel and Metates).<P>

<B>Hedging Program</B><P>

For 1996, Cambior has hedged 425,000 ounces of gold at a minimum price of US $419 per ounce.  For 1997 and 1998, Cambior has hedged 175,000 ounces of gold at a minimum price of US $435 and 73,000 ounces at a minimum price of US $438 per ounce respectively.  If the market price of gold increases Cambior has the flexibility to roll forward most of its hedging position.<P>

<B>Equity Financing</B><P>

On February 6, 1996 Cambior announced a financing agreement to raise $167 million by issuing 8 million common shares.  Upon closing, expected later this month, the net proceeds of the offering, estimated at $160 million, will be added to working capital and applied to general corporate purposes.  The completion of this financing will provide the Company with a sound base from which to pursue its growth strategy in the Americas.<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in Canada, the United States, Guyana and various other countries of the Americas.  Cambior's shares and warrants trade on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges as well as on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montreal, February 5, 1996

<CENTER><H2>Omai Gold Mine Resumes Production</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Inc. and Golden Star Resources Limited are pleased to announce that the Government of Guyana has approved the resumption of operations at the Omai Gold Mine. The construction of the first stage of the new tailings pond has been completed and all measures have been taken to ensure safe and environmentally sound operations. The mine resumed operations on Sunday, February 4, 1996.<P>
The total incident-related costs at Omai for the shutdown period are estimated at US $11.3 million. The impact on Cambior's results is estimated at Cdn $10 million of which Cdn $2.2 million was incurred at September 30, 1995.<P>
Cambior is the principal shareholder and operator of the Omai Mine. Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities throughout the Americas.<P>
Golden Star is an exploration and production company with gold and diamond exploration interests in South America and Africa including a 30% common share equity interest in Omai Gold Mines Limited. The primary impact of the Omai incident on Golden Star has been the deferral of approximately US $1.0 million of expected preferred share redemptions in 1995.<P>

Montreal, January 30, 1996

<CENTER><H2>Cambior Inc. Announces its 1995 Production Results and Reserves Estimates and a Writedown of Mining Assets</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Inc. announced today that its gold production for 1995 amounted to 446,000 ounces and that its gold reserves have been increased by 12%, excluding its share of the 14.1 million ounces of gold equivalent in mineral inventory at Metates.  The company has reviewed its underperforming mining assets and has decided to incur an after tax writedown adjustment of $7 million in their 1995 financial results.<P>
<B>1995 Production</B><P>
Cambior's gold production, for the year ended December 31, 1995, totalled 446,000 ounces compared to 522,000 ounces the previous year.  This decrease was due to the shutdown of the Omai Mine in August 1995.<P>
Cambior's share from the Doyon Mine totalled 109,000 ounces and its other Canadian mines produced 129,000 ounces compared to 107,000 ounces in 1994.  This 7% increase in production from Canadian operations is due mainly to the Bouchard-H&eacute;bert Mine (formerly the Mobrun Mine) which entered its first full year of commercial production and produced 26,000 ounces of gold equivalent.<P>
Cambior's share of production from the Niobec Mine in 1995 totalled 1,113,546 kg of ferroniobium produced with its new pyrochlore-to-ferroniobium converter.  Copper and zinc production began in 1995 with the start-up of the Bouchard-H&eacute;bert Mine.  Zinc production totalled 23,642 tonnes and copper production totalled 5,272 tonnes in 1995.<P>
<B>Outlook for 1996</B><P>
The Omai Mine is expected to resume production shortly pending Government approval.  Upon start-up, the mill will process stockpiled ore and lower grade softrock from the Wenot Pit.  During the second quarter mining activities should resume in the Fennell Pit and allow the return to production levels attained in the second quarter of 1995 (70,000 ounces per quarter).  The completion of the mill expansion, also scheduled for the second quarter, will increase the milling capacity from 12,000 tonnes/day to 18,000 tonnes/day.<P>
The Doyon Mine should maintain its 1995 production level and the other Canadian mines are expected to produce more than 140,000 ounces of gold in 1996.  This will assure continued growth of gold production from our Canadian operations.<P>
The Bouchard-H&eacute;bert Mine is currently undergoing a mill expansion to increase its capacity by 10%.  The Bouchard-H&eacute;bert Mine should produce 25,000 tonnes of zinc, 6,000 tonnes of copper and 20,000 ounces of gold in 1996.  The Grevet Mine commenced commercial production in January 1996 and is expected to produce 62,000 tonnes of zinc and 2,600 tonnes of copper.<P>
<B>Reserves</B><P>
Gold reserves as of December 31, 1995 are estimated at 5.7 million ounces contained compared to 5 million ounces contained at December 31, 1994.  This 12% increase is mainly attributable to a significant increase in mining reserves at Omai.  The Wenot Lake deposit remains open laterally and shows its continuing potential to increase mining reserves.  In 1996, drilling will be done in the western part of the Wenot Pit and on a geochemical anomaly extending over 1.2 km to the east of the Wenot area.<P>
The total mineral inventory at Metates increased significantly during 1995 from 7.6 to 14.1 million ounces of gold equivalent.  The prefeasibility study, due the first half of 1996, will determine the potential of this project.<P>
The mining reserves estimate for Gross Rosebel is expected during the first quarter 1996.  Cambior recently exercised its option to acquire 50% of the project from its partner Golden Star Resources.<P>
Copper reserves were also greatly increased during 1995.  The copper reserves at La Granja have more than tripled to 725 million tonnes grading 0.69% copper representing 11 billion lbs of copper <I>in situ</I>.  Total copper reserves at El Pach&oacute;n increased by 60% from the 1994 estimates, to 687 million tonnes grading 0.63% copper representing 9.5 billion lbs of copper.<P>
<B>Writedown</B><P>
As a result of the decrease of mining reserves at Chimo and Silidor and the higher costs of production at these mines the book value of these assets will be adjusted negatively by $10.7 million.  This will result in a $7 million after tax charge in 1995.  Both of these mines are expected to shut down in 1997.<P>
Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in Canada, the United States, Guyana and various other countries of the Americas.  Cambior shares and warrants trade on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges as well as the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

<H2><B>CAMBIOR ANNONCE SES R&Eacute;SULTATS DU TROISI&Egrave;ME
TRIMESTRE</B> <B>REVENUS RECORDS ET AM&Eacute;LIORATIONS IMPORTANTES
DES R&Eacute;SULTATS D'EXPLOITATION ET FINANCIERS</B></H2>

<P><B>Depuis le d&eacute;but de 1996, Cambior reporte ses
r&eacute;sultats financiers en dollars am&eacute;ricains.</B></P>

<P>Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui que sa production du
troisi&egrave;me trimestre a &eacute;t&eacute; de 145&nbsp;000 onces
d'or, 18&nbsp;800&nbsp;tonnes de zinc et 2&nbsp;600&nbsp;tonnes de
cuivre. La production d'or du troisi&egrave;me trimestre a connu une
hausse de 30&nbsp;%, par rapport au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre, en
raison du franc succ&egrave;s de la mise en op&eacute;ration du
deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage de l'usine Omai.</P>

<P><B><U>R&Eacute;SULTATS FINANCIERS</U></B></P>

<P>Les <B>revenus</B> pour le troisi&egrave;me trimestre ont atteint
un record de 91,7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ par rapport &agrave;
64,2&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante en
1995. Les <B>fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par
l'exploitation</B> (avant variations d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments du
fonds de roulement) ont atteint 21,9 millions&nbsp;$ (0,36 $ par
action) comparativement &agrave; 6,8&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$
(0,13&nbsp;$ par action) pour le troisi&egrave;me trimestre de 1995.
Le <B>b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net</B> s'est &eacute;lev&eacute;
&agrave; 3,3&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,05&nbsp;$ par action) contre une
perte de 4,7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,09&nbsp;$ par action).</P>

<P>Pour les neuf premiers mois de 1996, les revenus ont atteint
226,4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ comparativement &agrave;
208,6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante en
1995. Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation se
sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; 47,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$
(0,81&nbsp;$ par action) comparativement &agrave;
42,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,85&nbsp;$ par action) pour les neuf
premiers mois de 1995. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net a atteint
5,4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,09&nbsp;$ par action) par rapport
&agrave; 1,1&nbsp;million&nbsp;$ (0,02&nbsp;$ par action) pour la
p&eacute;riode correspondante en 1995. Pour les neuf premiers mois de
1996, 81&nbsp;% des revenus nets et 85&nbsp;% des fonds
g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation mini&egrave;re
proviennent de la production aurif&egrave;re de Cambior.</P>

<P>Les r&eacute;sultats du troisi&egrave;me trimestre de 1996
indiquent une am&eacute;lioration marqu&eacute;e par rapport au
trimestre correspondant en 1995 et aux deux premiers trimestres de
1996, marquant ainsi le retour de la compagnie &agrave; sa base de
performance et de rentabilit&eacute; soutenue des op&eacute;rations.
Les r&eacute;sultats du troisi&egrave;me trimestre de 1995 ont
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;s par l'arr&ecirc;t de l'exploitation
de la mine Omai &agrave; la mi-ao&ucirc;t de 1995 en raison du bris
de la digue du parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus. La reprise des
activit&eacute;s de la mine Omai s'est effectu&eacute;e en
f&eacute;vrier&nbsp;1996 et atteint sa pleine capacit&eacute; en
mars&nbsp;1996. Les r&eacute;sultats du troisi&egrave;me trimestre de
1996 refl&egrave;tent l'augmentation de la capacit&eacute; d'usinage
&agrave; la mine Omai &agrave; la suite de la mise en service du
deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage de l'usine de traitement en
juillet ainsi que la pleine capacit&eacute; des activit&eacute;s
d'exploitation de la mine Doyon. Cette derni&egrave;re avait
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;e au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre de
1996 par une interruption de travail.</P>

<P><B><U>EXPLOITATION</U></B></P>

<P>Pour le troisi&egrave;me trimestre, la mine <B>Omai</B> a produit
un record de 77&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces d'or, une augmentation importante
par rapport aux 58&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces produites au deuxi&egrave;me
trimestre. Le deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage a &eacute;t&eacute;
mis en marche avec succ&egrave;s au d&eacute;but de juillet et a
atteint sa capacit&eacute; nominale en ao&ucirc;t. Pour le
troisi&egrave;me trimestre, la cadence d'usinage du minerai a atteint
18&nbsp;300&nbsp;tonnes par jour. Le taux de
r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration de l'or a atteint 92&nbsp;% et les
co&ucirc;ts d'exploitation ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;duits
&agrave; 233&nbsp;$ par once, repr&eacute;sentant une
am&eacute;lioration de 49&nbsp;$ l'once par rapport aux co&ucirc;ts
du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre. La production du quatri&egrave;me
trimestre b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera de la pleine op&eacute;ration du
deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage et permettra ainsi
d'&eacute;tablir la capacit&eacute; potentielle soutenue de l'usine
d'Omai.</P>

<P>Au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre, le forage se poursuivait
&agrave; Wenot afin d'augmenter les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res
dans la fosse. Du forage distanc&eacute; se poursuivra
&eacute;galement dans la r&eacute;gion &agrave; l'est de la fosse
Wenot.</P>

<P>La quote-part de Cambior dans la mine <B>Doyon</B>, pour le
troisi&egrave;me trimestre, a &eacute;t&eacute; de
27&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une augmentation de
30&nbsp;% par rapport au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre qui avait
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;e par une gr&egrave;ve de huit
semaines. En d&eacute;pit d'un arr&ecirc;t temporaire de deux
semaines en juillet pour effectuer des travaux de maintenance, la
production aurif&egrave;re du troisi&egrave;me trimestre &eacute;tait
plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e comparativement au trimestre correspondant
en 1995.</P>

<P>Le programme d'exploration de surface s'est poursuivi au cours du
troisi&egrave;me trimestre pour explorer le potentiel de la
r&eacute;gion situ&eacute;e &agrave; l'ouest de la mine et sur la
propri&eacute;t&eacute; Mouska, adjacente &agrave; la
propri&eacute;t&eacute; Doyon. Une galerie d'exploration au
8i&egrave;me niveau de la mine Doyon est pr&eacute;sentement en cours
afin d'&eacute;valuer en profondeur la nouvelle d&eacute;couverte et
le potentiel de la nouvelle zone ouest.</P>

<P>La mine <B>Bouchard-H&eacute;bert</B> a d&eacute;montr&eacute; au
cours du trimestre une excellente performance de ses
op&eacute;rations alors que l'usine a atteint une cadence de
traitement de 2&nbsp;600&nbsp;tonnes par jour en raison de
l'agrandissement du circuit de broyage. Des teneurs usin&eacute;es
plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es pour l'or, le cuivre et l'argent et de
meilleures r&eacute;cup&eacute;rations des m&eacute;taux ont permis
une production accrue de l'or et du cuivre du plus du double par
rapport au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre.</P>

<P>La production continue de s'am&eacute;liorer &agrave; la mine
<B>Langlois</B> (anciennement connue sous le nom de la mine Grevet)
pour atteindre, &agrave; la fin du trimestre, une cadence d'usinage
de 1&nbsp;900&nbsp;tonnes par jour. Les r&eacute;sultats ont
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;s de fa&ccedil;on n&eacute;gative par
un faible prix du zinc. Le prix moyen du zinc pour le trimestre a
&eacute;t&eacute; de 45&#162;/lb. Des am&eacute;liorations
suppl&eacute;mentaires des op&eacute;rations, de la cadence de
traitement et du prix du zinc sont pr&eacute;vues &agrave; moyen
terme.</P>

<P><B><U>INVESTISSEMENTS ET FINANCEMENT</U></B></P>

<P>Les investissements au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre ont
totalis&eacute; 25&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ et portaient principalement
sur Omai (7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$), le financement des principaux
projets de d&eacute;veloppement internationaux
(6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$), les frais reli&eacute;s &agrave; la
pr&eacute;paration du projet Carlota (6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$) et les
investissements sur les exploitations courantes. En raison de
l'attente de la r&eacute;ception des permis environnementaux, la
construction du projet Carlota a &eacute;t&eacute; report&eacute;e au
d&eacute;but de 1997.</P>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; pour le
trimestre, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; son programme de couverture, un prix
moyen de 423&nbsp;$ l'once, soit une prime de 38&nbsp;$ l'once par
rapport au prix moyen du march&eacute; de 385&nbsp;$. Pour les neuf
premiers mois de 1996, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a
r&eacute;alis&eacute; un prix moyen de 430&nbsp;$ l'once,
repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une prime de 38&nbsp;$ par rapport au prix
moyen du march&eacute; de 392&nbsp;$. Pour le quatri&egrave;me
trimestre de 1996, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a pris des engagements
sur les march&eacute;s &agrave; terme pour livrer
45&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces d'or &agrave; un prix minimum de 424&nbsp;$
l'once.</P>

<P>Au cours du trimestre, Cambior a rembours&eacute;
9&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ de son emprunt d'or. La portion non
utilis&eacute;e de la facilit&eacute; de cr&eacute;dit de l'emprunt
d'or s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve pr&eacute;sentement &agrave;
25&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$. Cambior maintient une solide situation
financi&egrave;re afin de poursuivre sa strat&eacute;gie de
croissance. &Agrave; la fin du troisi&egrave;me trimestre, l'encaisse
totalisait 124&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ alors que la dette nette
s'&eacute;levait &agrave; seulement 88&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<P><B><U>PROJETS EN D&Eacute;VELOPPEMENT ET EXPLORATION</U></B></P>

<P>Au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a
poursuivi ses travaux de d&eacute;veloppement et d'exploration sur
les projets Gross Rosebel, El&nbsp;Pach&oacute;n, La&nbsp;Granja,
Metates et Yaou-Dorlin.</P>

<P>Les travaux se poursuivent au projet <B>Gross Rosebel
(Suriname)</B> (Cambior 50&nbsp;%) afin de compl&eacute;ter
l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; pr&eacute;vue pour
avril&nbsp;1997. Les forages sur les d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts se
poursuivent en vue d'augmenter les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res.
Les r&eacute;serves ont &eacute;t&eacute; mises &agrave; jour au
cours du trimestre pour atteindre 30&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave;
une teneur de 1,5&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t repr&eacute;sentant ainsi
1,4&nbsp;million d'onces d'or <I>in situ</I>. Des forages
espac&eacute;s sont actuellement en cours afin de confirmer
l'extension des d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts. Il est pr&eacute;vu que les
r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res atteindront 2&nbsp;millions d'onces
<I>in situ</I> avant le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de l'&eacute;tude de
faisabilit&eacute;.</P>

<P>Les travaux se poursuivent au projet <B>El&nbsp;Pach&oacute;n
(Argentine)</B> (Cambior&nbsp;50&nbsp;%) afin de compl&eacute;ter le
calcul des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res et optimiser les
param&egrave;tres de l'exploitation dans le but d'augmenter les
aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet. L'&eacute;tude de
faisabilit&eacute;, pr&eacute;vue au cours du premier trimestre de
1997, prendra en consid&eacute;ration une augmentation de la cadence
&agrave; 70&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour par rapport &agrave; la
cadence originale de 40&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour. Ce projet,
situ&eacute; &agrave; proximit&eacute; de la fronti&egrave;re
Chili-Argentine, b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera de l'entente
r&eacute;cemment annonc&eacute;e par les deux gouvernements pour la
signature d'un trait&eacute; et d'un protocole sp&eacute;cifique pour
le projet El&nbsp;Pach&oacute;n permettant la mise en place efficace
d'op&eacute;rations de projets miniers situ&eacute;s le long de la
fronti&egrave;re. La signature du protocole est pr&eacute;vue avant
le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute;. Au
cours du trimestre, Cambior a orient&eacute; ses efforts vers la mise
en march&eacute; future des concentr&eacute;s aupr&egrave;s de
clients raffineurs potentiels. Les contacts pr&eacute;liminaires sont
encourageants, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; la propret&eacute; du
concentr&eacute; de Pach&oacute;n ainsi que sa teneur favorable en
cuivre.</P>

<P>Le programme de forage s'est poursuivi au cours du trimestre sur
le projet <B>La&nbsp;Granja (P&eacute;rou)</B> afin d'explorer et de
mieux d&eacute;finir le gisement et le plan minier pour les
premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es d'exploitation. Il est pr&eacute;vu
qu'une portion significative des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de
cat&eacute;gorie possible sera reclass&eacute;e dans la
cat&eacute;gorie prouv&eacute;e et probable et qu'une mise &agrave;
jour des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res devra &ecirc;tre
annonc&eacute;e d'ici la fin de 1996. Les travaux se poursuivent pour
compl&eacute;ter l'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; et
am&eacute;liorer les aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet.
L'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; devrait &ecirc;tre
compl&eacute;t&eacute;e au printemps de 1997.</P>

<P>Les travaux de d&eacute;veloppement se poursuivent
&eacute;galement sur le projet <B>Metates (Mexique)</B>,
sp&eacute;cifiquement sur les essais m&eacute;tallurgiques, afin de
confirmer les r&eacute;sultats ant&eacute;rieurs et optimiser les
diff&eacute;rents sc&eacute;narios d'exploitation, lesquels
pourraient accro&icirc;tre les aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet.
</P>

<P>Les r&eacute;sultats des forages ont &eacute;t&eacute;
d&eacute;voil&eacute;s au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre sur les
propri&eacute;t&eacute;s <B>Yaou</B> et <B>Dorlin</B> (Cambior
50&nbsp;%) situ&eacute;es en Guyane Fran&ccedil;aise. Sur la
propri&eacute;t&eacute; Dorlin, les r&eacute;sultats de la
premi&egrave;re phase de forages ont &eacute;t&eacute;
annonc&eacute;s et le programme, d'ici la fin de l'ann&eacute;e,
comprend l'ajout d'une deuxi&egrave;me foreuse de plus grand
diam&egrave;tre. Les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res probables
annonc&eacute;es &agrave; Yaou se chiffrent &agrave;
10,3&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de
2,7&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t repr&eacute;sentant ainsi
875&nbsp;900&nbsp;onces d'or <I>in situ</I>. Le programme en cours se
concentrera sur l'extension des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res et
sur l'exploration et l'identification de nouvelles zones
min&eacute;ralis&eacute;es. Exploration Cambiex&nbsp;inc. a une
option pour se gagner une participation de 30&nbsp;% de
l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de Cambior dans ses propri&eacute;t&eacute;s.
</P>

<P>Des r&eacute;sultats encourageants de la premi&egrave;re phase de
forage au diamant ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;galement obtenus sur
le projet cuprif&egrave;re et aurif&egrave;re <B>Sultana</B>
situ&eacute; dans l'&Eacute;tat de l'Idaho. Le programme de forage
qui comprend &agrave; ce jour quatorze sondages, continue de
recouper, pr&egrave;s de la surface, des valeurs hautement
significatives en cuivre, or et argent contenues dans une zone de
skarn min&eacute;ralis&eacute; et oxyd&eacute; large d'environ
300&nbsp;m&egrave;tres et s'&eacute;tendant sur une longueur de plus
de 1,5&nbsp;kilom&egrave;tre. Exploration Cambiex fournit
pr&eacute;sentement le financement pour les travaux d'exploration sur
le projet. Cambiex a d&eacute;j&agrave; acquis un
int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 15&nbsp;% dans le projet et d&eacute;tient
une option pour augmenter sa participation &agrave; 50&nbsp;% contre
un investissement de 5,0&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<P>Pour les neuf premiers mois de 1996, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a
investi 6,8&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ en <B>frais d'exploration</B> pour
identifier des projets aurif&egrave;res &agrave; haut potentiel. Les
r&eacute;sultats semblent encourageants et la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a
d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer, d'ici la fin de
l'ann&eacute;e, ses d&eacute;penses en exploration, plus
sp&eacute;cifiquement au P&eacute;rou et au Mexique sur les
propri&eacute;t&eacute;s les plus prometteuses. Le budget
approuv&eacute; indique une augmentation de 50&nbsp;% du programme
d'exploration pour le deuxi&egrave;me semestre &agrave; plus de
6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$. Les frais d'exploration pour le
troisi&egrave;me trimestre se sont chiffr&eacute;s &agrave;
3&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<P><B><U>STRAT&Eacute;GIE ET PERSPECTIVES</U></B></P>

<P>Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction,
soulignait que &#171;&nbsp;La performance financi&egrave;re et les
r&eacute;sultats de production se sont am&eacute;lior&eacute;s au
cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre d&ucirc; &agrave; une production
plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e &agrave; la mine Omai qui a
b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; de l'expansion de l'usine, du retour
normal aux op&eacute;rations mini&egrave;res &agrave; Doyon
subs&eacute;quemment &agrave; la gr&egrave;ve des employ&eacute;s et
&agrave; des augmentations des cadences de traitement aux mines
Bouchard-H&eacute;bert et Langlois. Nous pr&eacute;voyons atteindre
notre production cible pour l'ann&eacute;e 1996 et devrions
&eacute;tablir au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre de
l'ann&eacute;e, un niveau soutenu de production et de performance
financi&egrave;re. Les travaux se poursuivent avec assiduit&eacute;
afin de compl&eacute;ter, au d&eacute;but de 1997, les &eacute;tudes
de faisabilit&eacute; sur nos importants projets en
d&eacute;veloppement. Ceci nous permettra de mieux d&eacute;finir le
potentiel &eacute;conomique de ces projets et de fournir aux
investisseurs une meilleure connaissance pour leur &eacute;valuation.
Cambior intensifiera &eacute;galement ses efforts et investissements
pour identifier et d&eacute;velopper les projets aurif&egrave;res,
incluant le potentiel de la nouvelle structure
min&eacute;ralis&eacute;e identifi&eacute;e sur les
propri&eacute;t&eacute;s Doyon et Mouska ainsi que sur les programmes
actuellement en cours au Suriname, Guyane Fran&ccedil;aise, Mexique
et au P&eacute;rou. Avec le r&eacute;tablissement d'une
productivit&eacute; et d'une performance financi&egrave;re accrues
ainsi que le d&eacute;veloppement de projets avanc&eacute;s, Cambior
a le potentiel consid&eacute;rable de maximiser la valeur pour
l'actionnaire&nbsp;&#187;</P>

<P>Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re
diversifi&eacute;e avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation, de
d&eacute;veloppement de projets et d'exploration en Am&eacute;rique
du Nord et du Sud. Ses actions (&#171;&nbsp;CBJ&nbsp;&#187;) sont

Pour publication imm&eacute;diate</H2>

<P>Montr&eacute;al, le 9&nbsp;ao&ucirc;t&nbsp;1996</P>

<H2>Cambior annonce ses r&eacute;sultats du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre et
la mise en service du deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage &agrave; Omai</H2>

<P><B>Depuis le d&eacute;but de&nbsp;1996, Cambior reporte ses r&eacute;sultats
financiers en dollars am&eacute;ricains.</B></P>

<P>Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui que sa production du deuxi&egrave;me
trimestre a &eacute;t&eacute; de 111&nbsp;800&nbsp;onces d'or, 14&nbsp;300&nbsp;tonnes de zinc
et 1&nbsp;900&nbsp;tonnes de cuivre. La production d'or du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre
a connu une hausse de 24&nbsp;%, par rapport aux 90&nbsp;200&nbsp;onces produites au premier
trimestre, en raison des op&eacute;rations mini&egrave;res &agrave; Omai
qui ont atteint la pleine cadence de production &agrave; la fin du trimestre.</P>

<P>Les revenus pour le deuxi&egrave;me trimestre se sont chiffr&eacute;s
&agrave; 74,0&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ par rapport &agrave; 76,4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour la p&eacute;riode
correspondante en&nbsp;1995. Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation (avant variations d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments du fonds de roulement) ont atteint14,0&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,23&nbsp;$ par action) comparativement &agrave; 20,1&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,41&nbsp;$ par action) pour le deuxi&egrave;me trimestre de&nbsp;1995. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net s'est &eacute;lev&eacute; &agrave; 1,1&nbsp;million&nbsp;$ (0,02&nbsp;$ par action)
contre 1,9&nbsp;million&nbsp;$ (0,04&nbsp;$ par action).</P>

<P>Pour le premier semestre, les revenus ont atteint 134,7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ comparativement
&agrave; 144,4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante en 1995.
Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s
&agrave; 25,6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,44&nbsp;$ par action) comparativement &agrave; 35,7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,73&nbsp;$ par action) pour le premier semestre de 1995. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice
net a atteint 2,1&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,04&nbsp;$ par action) par rapport &agrave; 5,7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,12&nbsp;$ par action) pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante en
1995.</P>

<P>Les r&eacute;sultats pour le premier semestre de l'ann&eacute;e ont
&eacute;t&eacute; n&eacute;gativement affect&eacute;s par une production
moindre &agrave; la mine Omai en raison de la reprise graduelle des activit&eacute;s
d'exploitation depuis f&eacute;vrier&nbsp;1996. Les r&eacute;sultats ont &eacute;t&eacute;
aussi affect&eacute;s par la perte de production &agrave; la mine Doyon
en raison d'une gr&egrave;ve d'une dur&eacute;e de huit semaines au cours
du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre.</P>

<H3>PRODUCTION</H3>

<P>La mine Omai a produit 58&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces d'or au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une augmentation importante par rapport aux 27&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces produites au premier trimestre. Depuis la reprise des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation &agrave; la mine Omai en f&eacute;vrier, la production a augment&eacute; graduellement pour atteindre la pleine capacit&eacute; en juin&nbsp;1996. La mise en service du deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage de l'usine au d&eacute;but de juillet a connu un franc succ&egrave;s et selon les pr&eacute;visions, atteindra graduellement sa capacit&eacute; nominale au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre.</P>

<P>La gr&egrave;ve &agrave; la mine Doyon a provoqu&eacute; un manque &agrave;
gagner, pour la quote-part de Cambior, estim&eacute; &agrave; 6&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces,
ce qui a r&eacute;sult&eacute; &agrave; des co&ucirc;ts plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s
pour cette p&eacute;riode. La mine a repris ses activit&eacute;s d'exploitation
&agrave; une cadence normale mais a subi, pour une p&eacute;riode de deux
semaines au d&eacute;but de juillet, un arr&ecirc;t temporaire planifi&eacute;
pour effectuer des travaux de maintenance. La production cible pour la
quote-part de Cambior dans la mine Doyon a &eacute;t&eacute;, par cons&eacute;quent,
r&eacute;ajust&eacute;e &agrave; 105&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces pour l'ann&eacute;e&nbsp;1996.</P>

<P>La production &agrave; la mine Langlois (ant&eacute;rieurement connue
sous le nom de mine Grevet) s'est am&eacute;lior&eacute;e graduellement
depuis le d&eacute;but de sa mise en production plus t&ocirc;t cette ann&eacute;e.
La production et la cadence journali&egrave;re de traitement se sont constamment
am&eacute;lior&eacute;es pour atteindre une moyenne de 1&nbsp;700&nbsp;tonnes/jour
&agrave; la fin du trimestre. Des am&eacute;liorations suppl&eacute;mentaires
sur la cadence de traitement et les taux de r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration
des m&eacute;taux sont pr&eacute;vues au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre.</P>

<P>Les op&eacute;rations &agrave; la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert ont &eacute;t&eacute;
affect&eacute;es en juin pour une p&eacute;riode de deux semaines en raison
de r&eacute;parations importantes au puits. La cadence de traitement s'est
am&eacute;lior&eacute;e progressivement avec la mise en place d'&eacute;quipements
pour accro&icirc;tre la capacit&eacute; d'usinage. La cadence de traitement
a atteint &agrave; la fin du trimestre une moyenne de 2&nbsp;500&nbsp;tonnes par
jour et il est pr&eacute;vu qu'elle atteindra sa pleine capacit&eacute;
au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre.</P>

<P>Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction de Cambior,
mentionnait que &quot;la production &agrave; la mine Omai devrait continuer
de s'am&eacute;liorer aux troisi&egrave;me et quatri&egrave;me trimestres
avec le plein acc&egrave;s &agrave; du minerai de plus haute teneur de
la fosse Fennell et la mise en service du deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage,
qui a connu un franc succ&egrave;s au d&eacute;but de juillet. La production
de la mine Omai en&nbsp;1996 est pr&eacute;vue &agrave; 255&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces. Cambior
a ajust&eacute; toute sa production cible pour l'ann&eacute;e &agrave;
500 000 onces d'or, 66&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes de zinc et 8&nbsp;400&nbsp;tonnes de cuivre.&quot;</P>

<H3>INVESTISSEMENTS ET FINANCEMENT</H3>

<P>Les investissements au cours du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre ont totalis&eacute;
30&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ et portaient principalement sur la fin des travaux d'agrandissement
de l'usine de traitement d'Omai (7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$), le financement des principaux
projets de d&eacute;veloppement internationaux (12&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$) et les investissements
sur les exploitations courantes. La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute;
pour le trimestre, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; son programme de couverture, un
prix moyen de 428&nbsp;$ l'once, soit une prime de 38&nbsp;$ l'once par rapport au
prix moyen du march&eacute; de 390&nbsp;$. Pour le premier semestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un prix moyen de 432&nbsp;$ l'once, repr&eacute;sentant
ainsi une prime de 37&nbsp;$ par rapport au prix moyen du march&eacute; de 395&nbsp;$. Pour le deuxi&egrave;me semestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a pris des
engagements sur les march&eacute;s &agrave; terme pour livrer 179&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces
d'or &agrave; un prix minimum de 423&nbsp;$ l'once.</P>

<P>Au cours du trimestre, Cambior a report&eacute; d'un an l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ancier
des remboursements de l'emprunt d'or. Les remboursements d&eacute;buteront
le 30&nbsp;juin&nbsp;1997 pour s'&eacute;chelonner jusqu'au 31&nbsp;d&eacute;cembre de
l'an&nbsp;2000. Cambior maintient une solide situation financi&egrave;re afin
de poursuivre sa strat&eacute;gie de croissance. &Agrave; la fin du deuxi&egrave;me
trimestre, l'encaisse s'&eacute;levait &agrave; 143&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ avec une
dette nette de seulement 75&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<H3>PROJETS EN D&Eacute;VELOPPEMENT ET EXPLORATION</H3>

<P>Au cours du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a poursuivi
ses travaux de d&eacute;veloppement et d'exploration sur les projets El
Pach&oacute;n, La Granja, Gross Rosebel et Metates.</P>

<P>Les travaux se poursuivent au projet <B>El Pach&oacute;n (Argentine)</B>
afin de compl&eacute;ter le calcul des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res
et optimiser les param&egrave;tres de l'exploitation dans le but d'augmenter
les aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet. L'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute;,
pr&eacute;vue au cours du premier trimestre de&nbsp;1997, prendra en consid&eacute;ration
une augmentation de la cadence &agrave; 70&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour par rapport
&agrave; la cadence originale de 40&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour. Ce projet, situ&eacute;
&agrave; proximit&eacute; de la fronti&egrave;re Chili-<wbr>Argentine, b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera
de l'entente r&eacute;cemment annonc&eacute;e par les deux gouvernements
pour la signature d'un trait&eacute; permettant la mise en place efficace
d'op&eacute;rations de projets miniers situ&eacute;s le long de la fronti&egrave;re.
Les deux gouvernements ont en effet convenu d'&eacute;tablir un protocole
sp&eacute;cifique pour le projet El Pach&oacute;n qui est pr&eacute;vu
pour signature &agrave; l'automne&nbsp;1996. Un tel accord et protocole permettraient
aux actionnaires de la compagnie Pach&oacute;n S.A. Minera d'utiliser les
infrastructures les plus appropri&eacute;es dans le pays le plus avantageux
pour eux et avoir ainsi un impact positif sur les aspects &eacute;conomiques
du projet. Au cours du trimestre, Cambior a rencontr&eacute; l'engagement
financier pour l'obtention d'un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t additionnel de 10&nbsp;% dans la compagnie argentine pour ainsi porter son int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
&agrave; 50&nbsp;% dans le projet El Pach&oacute;n.</P>

<P>Le programme de forage s'est poursuivi au cours du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre
sur le projet <B>La Granja (P&eacute;rou)</B> afin d'explorer et de mieux
d&eacute;finir le gisement. Il est pr&eacute;vu qu'une portion significative
des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de cat&eacute;gorie possible sera reclass&eacute;e
dans la cat&eacute;gorie prouv&eacute;e et probable et d'am&eacute;liorer
le ratio st&eacute;rile/minerai du gisement. Les travaux se poursuivent
pour compl&eacute;ter l'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; et am&eacute;liorer
les aspects &eacute;conomiques de l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute;
compl&eacute;t&eacute;e plus t&ocirc;t cette ann&eacute;e. L'&eacute;tude
de faisabilit&eacute; devrait &ecirc;tre compl&eacute;t&eacute;e au printemps
de&nbsp;1997. L'envergure et le potentiel de ce projet de classe mondiale sont
tels que Cambior sollicitera un partenaire pour fournir la capacit&eacute;
de raffinage et supporter les exigences financi&egrave;res.</P>

<P>Les travaux se poursuivent au projet <B>Gross Rosebel (Suriname)</B>
afin de compl&eacute;ter l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; au d&eacute;but
de&nbsp;1997. Cambior d&eacute;tient un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50&nbsp;% dans ce
projet. Les forages sur les d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts se poursuivent en vue d'augmenter
les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res ant&eacute;rieurement &eacute;tablies
&agrave; 1,1&nbsp;million d'onces. Les &eacute;tudes d'ing&eacute;nierie sont
en cours afin de mieux d&eacute;finir les caract&eacute;ristiques m&eacute;tallurgiques
du minerai et d'optimiser les d&eacute;penses en capital et les param&egrave;tres
des co&ucirc;ts d'exploitation.</P>

<P>Les travaux de d&eacute;veloppement se poursuivent &eacute;galement
sur le projet <B>Metates (Mexique)</B> , sp&eacute;cifiquement sur les
essais m&eacute;tallurgiques, afin de confirmer les r&eacute;sultats ant&eacute;rieurs
et optimiser les diff&eacute;rents sc&eacute;narios d'exploitation, lesquels
pourraient accro&icirc;tre les aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet. L'&eacute;tude
de faisabilit&eacute; est pr&eacute;vue pour le printemps de&nbsp;1997.</P>

<P>Pour le premier semestre de&nbsp;1996, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a investi
4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ <B>en frais d'exploration</B> reli&eacute;s &agrave; l'identification
de projets aurif&egrave;res &agrave; haut potentiel. Les r&eacute;sultats
semblent encourageants et la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a d&eacute;cid&eacute;
d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer au deuxi&egrave;me semestre ses d&eacute;penses
en exploration, plus sp&eacute;cifiquement au P&eacute;rou et au Mexique
sur les propri&eacute;t&eacute;s les plus prometteuses. Le budget approuv&eacute;
indique une augmentation de 50&nbsp;% pour un programme d'exploration pour le
deuxi&egrave;me semestre de plus de 6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<H3>STRAT&Eacute;GIE</H3>

<P>Louis P. Gignac soulignait que &quot;la production de nos exploitations
courantes et la performance financi&egrave;re devraient s'am&eacute;liorer
de fa&ccedil;on marqu&eacute;e au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre de
l'ann&eacute;e avec l'impact de l'agrandissement de l'usine d'Omai et des
augmentations des cadences journali&egrave;res de traitement aux mines
Bouchard-<wbr>H&eacute;bert et Langlois. Nous devrions &eacute;tablir, au cours
de la deuxi&egrave;me moiti&eacute; de l'ann&eacute;e, un niveau soutenu
de production et de performance financi&egrave;re. Les projets importants
en d&eacute;veloppement se poursuivent de fa&ccedil;on agressive et nous
augmentons nos efforts et investissements pour identifier et d&eacute;velopper
les projets aurif&egrave;res, incluant le potentiel de la nouvelle structure
min&eacute;ralis&eacute;e identifi&eacute;e sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute;
Doyon et les programmes actuellement en cours au Suriname, Guyane fran&ccedil;aise,
Mexique et au P&eacute;rou. Cambior a le potentiel pour accro&icirc;tre
la cr&eacute;ation de valeur pour l'actionnaire et nous continuons d'&eacute;valuer
toutes les avenues pour maximiser la r&eacute;alisation de cette valeur.&quot;</P>

<P>Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec
des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration dans l'Am&eacute;rique
du Nord et du Sud. Ses actions (&quot;CBJ&quot;) sont inscrites &agrave;
la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock

Montr&eacute;al, le 9 mai&nbsp;1996<P>

<H2>Cambior annonce ses r&eacute;sultats pour le premier trimestre</H2>

<B>En raison de l'importance grandissante des op&eacute;rations et des investissements de Cambior&nbsp;&agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur du Canada, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sente ses&nbsp;&eacute;tats financiers en dollars am&eacute;ricains. Les&nbsp;&eacute;tats financiers ant&eacute;rieurs ont&nbsp;&eacute;t&eacute; convertis en dollars am&eacute;ricains en utilisant le taux de change du 31&nbsp;d&eacute;cembre&nbsp;1995 de 1,3640&nbsp;$ Can pour 1&nbsp;$ US.</B><P>

<H3>R&eacute;sultats financiers du premier trimestre</H3>

Cambior inc. a annonc&eacute; aujourd'hui un retour&nbsp;&agrave; la rentabilit&eacute; au premier trimestre de&nbsp;1996&nbsp;&agrave; la suite de la reprise de l'exploitation &agrave; la mine Omai au d&eacute;but de f&eacute;vrier. Le premier trimestre se solde donc par des revenus de 60,7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ comparativement&nbsp;&agrave; 68,0&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour le premier trimestre de&nbsp;1995. Les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices nets s'&eacute;l&egrave;vent quant&nbsp;&agrave; eux&nbsp;&agrave; 1,0&nbsp;million&nbsp;$ (0,02&nbsp;$ par action) comparativement&nbsp;&agrave; 3,8&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,08&nbsp;$ par action) pour le m&ecirc;me trimestre en&nbsp;1995. Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation ont pour leur part atteint 11,6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,21&nbsp;$ par action) en&nbsp;1996 comparativement&nbsp;&agrave; 15,6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,32&nbsp;$ par action) pour la m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode en&nbsp;1995. Par rapport&nbsp;&agrave; l'ann&eacute;e pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente, les r&eacute;sultats ont&nbsp;&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;s n&eacute;gativement par l'arr&ecirc;t de l'exploitation d'Omai jusqu'en f&eacute;vrier et la production limit&eacute;e au cours de la p&eacute;riode de d&eacute;marrage de l'exploitation de la mine. Par contre, un niveau de production favorable fut enregistr&eacute; aux mines Doyon et G&eacute;ant Dormant. Gr&acirc;ce&nbsp;&agrave; son programme de couverture sur l'or, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un prix moyen de vente de 438&nbsp;$ l'once, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une prime de 38&nbsp;$ l'once au-dessus du prix moyen du march&eacute; de 400&nbsp;$ l'once.<P>

Le pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction de Cambior, Monsieur Louis P. Gignac, s'est "dit heureux du retour&nbsp;&agrave; la rentabilit&eacute; de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; au premier trimestre et attribue ce r&eacute;sultat&nbsp;&agrave; la reprise des op&eacute;rations&nbsp;&agrave; Omai. La production aurif&egrave;re&nbsp;&agrave; Omai a augment&eacute; graduellement pour atteindre un total de 27&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces d'or, net des onces accumul&eacute;es dans le circuit, du 4&nbsp;f&eacute;vrier&nbsp;&agrave; la fin du premier trimestre."<P>
Les investissements au cours du premier trimestre ont totalis&eacute; 36,2&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ et portaient principalement sur la fin des travaux au projet Grevet, l'agrandissement de l'usine de traitement d'Omai et le financement de divers projets de d&eacute;veloppement internationaux. <p>

Profitant du succ&egrave;s qu'a connu en f&eacute;vrier l'&eacute;mission de 8&nbsp;millions d'actions qui a g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; un produit net de 117&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$, Cambior est maintenant financi&egrave;rement en mesure de poursuivre agressivement sa strat&eacute;gie d'expansion dans les Am&eacute;riques. Au 31&nbsp;mars&nbsp;1996, l'encaisse s'&eacute;levait&nbsp;&agrave; 172&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$. &nbsp;&Agrave; la suite de cette&nbsp;&eacute;mission, 60&nbsp;millions d'actions de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; sont en circulation.<P>

<H3>Perspectives 1996</H3>

La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;voit graduellement am&eacute;liorer ses r&eacute;sultats au cours des prochains trimestres en raison de l'accessibilit&eacute; au minerai de la fosse Fennell de la mine Omai cet&nbsp;&eacute;t&eacute;. De plus, elle b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera de l'impact de l'agrandissement de l'usine au deuxi&egrave;me semestre de&nbsp;1996. Des am&eacute;liorations de productivit&eacute; similaires sont pr&eacute;vues d'ici la fin de l'ann&eacute;e avec la mise en production commerciale de la mine Grevet au premier trimestre et d'une plus grande capacit&eacute; de traitement accrue en d&eacute;but d'ann&eacute;e&nbsp;&agrave; Bouchard-H&eacute;bert. Bas&eacute; sur le maintien d'une forte production&nbsp;&agrave; la mine Doyon, et si la gr&egrave;ve actuelle des employ&eacute;s &agrave; taux horaire n'affecte pas les activit&eacute;s d'exploitation, nous pr&eacute;voyons atteindre nos objectifs de production et augmenter graduellement notre profitabilit&eacute; au cours de l'ann&eacute;e.<P>

<H3>Projets de d&eacute;veloppement</H3>

Le premier trimestre de&nbsp;1996 a&nbsp;&eacute;t&eacute; tr&egrave;s actif avec l'ach&egrave;vement des&nbsp;&eacute;tudes de pr&eacute;-faisabilit&eacute; sur trois&nbsp;(3) projets de d&eacute;veloppement: La Granja, El Pach&oacute;n et Gross Rosebel. Les travaux se poursuivent sur ces projets afin de terminer les&nbsp;&eacute;tudes de rentabilit&eacute; au d&eacute;but de&nbsp;1997.<P>

<H3>La Granja (P&eacute;rou)</H3>

Les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res du projet La Granja ont augment&eacute; consid&eacute;rablement depuis septembre&nbsp;1995 pour s'&eacute;tablir&nbsp;&agrave; 1,3&nbsp;milliard de tonnes &agrave; 0,61&nbsp;% Cu en utilisant une teneur de coupure de 0,4&nbsp;% Cu, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi pr&egrave;s de 16&nbsp;milliards de livres de cuivre <I>in&nbsp;situ</I> (selon les donn&eacute;es provenant de 179 trous de forage totalisant 58&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&egrave;tres). Certains secteurs du gisement semblent demeurer ouverts lat&eacute;ralement et en profondeur, ce qui indique la possibilit&eacute; d'accro&icirc;tre les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res.<P>

D'apr&egrave;s les r&eacute;sultats de l'&eacute;tude pr&eacute;liminaire, l'alternative la plus&nbsp;&eacute;conomique serait une exploitation bas&eacute;e sur une capacit&eacute; de traitement de 90&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi un investissement d'environ 800&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$. Selon le plan de minage pr&eacute;liminaire quelque 220&nbsp;millions de tonnes d'une teneur de 0,87&nbsp;% Cu seraient usin&eacute;es avec un ratio st&eacute;rile/minerai de&nbsp;0,47 au cours des sept premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es de production commerciale. Ces r&eacute;sultats pr&eacute;liminaires indiquent une production annuelle moyenne de 250&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes de cuivre dans les concentr&eacute;s pendant la premi&egrave;re phase d'exploitation&nbsp;&agrave; un co&ucirc;t d'exploitation moyen de 0,57&nbsp;$ la livre de cuivre.<p>

L'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; devrait&nbsp;&ecirc;tre compl&eacute;t&eacute;e d'ici le premier trimestre de&nbsp;1997. L'investissement total de Cambior dans le projet&nbsp;&agrave; ce jour s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve&nbsp;&agrave; 20&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$. Une fois l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; confirm&eacute;e et l'entente de financement conclue, le d&eacute;veloppement et la construction de la mine&nbsp;&agrave; ciel ouvert pourraient d&eacute;buter en&nbsp;1998 avec une production commerciale pr&eacute;vue en l'an&nbsp;2001. L'envergure et le potentiel de ce projet cuprif&egrave;re de classe mondiale sont tels que Cambior&nbsp;&eacute;tudiera&nbsp;&eacute;ventuellement toutes les avenues pour maximiser la valeur pour les actionnaires. De plus, elle sollicitera des partenaires pouvant partager le financement et la commercialisation afin d'accro&icirc;tre davantage la valeur du projet.<P>

<H3>El Pach&oacute;n (Argentine)</H3>

D'apr&egrave;s les donn&eacute;es provenant de 193&nbsp;trous de forage totalisant plus de 34&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&egrave;tres, les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res du projet El Pach&oacute;n sont&nbsp;&eacute;valu&eacute;es&nbsp;&agrave; 687&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; 0,63&nbsp;%&nbsp;Cu, en utilisant une teneur de coupure de 0,4&nbsp;% cuivre, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi plus de 9,5&nbsp;milliards de livres de cuivre <I>in&nbsp;situ</I>.<P>

Selon les termes de l'entente, Cambior a vers&eacute; 10&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour acqu&eacute;rir 40&nbsp;% des actions ordinaires de Pach&oacute;n S.A. Minera de Compa&ntilde;ia Minera San Jos&eacute; S.A. en&nbsp;1994. Cambior a respect&eacute; l'engagement financier de 5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ requis pour acqu&eacute;rir un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t additionnel de 10&nbsp;% afin de d&eacute;tenir ainsi une participation de 50&nbsp;%. Selon les r&eacute;sultats de l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;-faisabilit&eacute;, l'exploitation du gisement serait bas&eacute;e sur une capacit&eacute; de traitement initiale de 40&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour, passant ensuite&nbsp;&agrave; 60&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour apr&egrave;s sept ans de production, n&eacute;cessitant ainsi un investissement initial de l'ordre de 500&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.<P>

Selon un plan de minage pr&eacute;liminaire, quelque 111&nbsp;millions de tonnes d'une teneur de 0,92&nbsp;% seraient usin&eacute;es avec un ratio st&eacute;rile/minerai de&nbsp;1,8 au cours des sept premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es. Les r&eacute;sultats du plan indiquent une production annuelle moyenne de 135&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes de cuivre dans les concentr&eacute;s pendant la premi&egrave;re phase d'exploitation&nbsp;&agrave; un co&ucirc;t d'exploitation moyen de 0,57&nbsp;$ la livre de cuivre.<P>

L'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute;, pr&eacute;vue au premier trimestre de&nbsp;1997, comprendra des&nbsp;&eacute;tudes plus approfondies et techniques sur tous les aspects du projet afin d'optimiser les co&ucirc;ts et l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ancier. &nbsp;&Agrave; la suite de l'approbation de l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; et de la mise en place du financement, la construction pourrait d&eacute;buter en&nbsp;1998, pour une mise en production commerciale en l'an&nbsp;2000.<P>

<H3>Gross Rosebel (Surinam)</H3>

Des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de 24&nbsp;millions de tonnes&nbsp;&agrave; une teneur de 1,4&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t ont&nbsp;&eacute;t&eacute; annonc&eacute;es sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Gross Rosebel au Surinam, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi 1,1&nbsp;million d'onces d'or <I>in&nbsp;situ</I>. Le potentiel d'augmenter les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res demeurent excellent.<p>

Cambior a exerc&eacute; son option en d&eacute;cembre&nbsp;1995 pour l'acquisition d'un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50&nbsp;% des droits de Golden Star dans la propri&eacute;t&eacute; en injectant, depuis 18&nbsp;mois, 6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ en frais d'exploration et de d&eacute;veloppement dans le projet. Quelque 33&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&egrave;tres de forage seront effectu&eacute;s en&nbsp;1996, afin de v&eacute;rifier les extensions lat&eacute;rales et en profondeur des d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts connus des r&eacute;gions nord et sud, et de trois nouvelles cibles afin d'identifier des r&eacute;serves additionnelles pouvant&nbsp;&ecirc;tre exploit&eacute;es&nbsp;&agrave; ciel ouvert. Un budget de 5,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ est pr&eacute;vu en&nbsp;1996 pour compl&eacute;ter la campagne de forage et une&nbsp;&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; pour la fin de l'ann&eacute;e&nbsp;1996, incluant une&nbsp;&eacute;tude d'impact sur l'environnement ainsi que du forage g&eacute;otechnique pour&nbsp;&eacute;valuer les sites potentiels de l'usine et du parc&nbsp;&agrave; r&eacute;sidus.<P>

Les r&eacute;sultats pr&eacute;liminaires de l'&eacute;tude indiquent un investissement de l'ordre de 120&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ avec un d&eacute;but de construction au cours de&nbsp;1997. La production aurif&egrave;re annuelle pourrait se situer entre 100&nbsp;000 et 150&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces avec un co&ucirc;t unitaire d'exploitation similaire&nbsp;&agrave; la mine Omai.<P>

<H3>Metates (Mexique)</H3>

Le d&eacute;veloppement du projet Metates se poursuit o&ugrave; un inventaire min&eacute;ral total de plus de 14&nbsp;millions d'onces d'or&nbsp;&eacute;quivalent <I>in&nbsp;situ</I> a&nbsp;&eacute;t&eacute; annonc&eacute;&nbsp;&agrave; la fin de&nbsp;1995. Des essais m&eacute;tallurgiques exhaustifs se poursuivent afin de confirmer les taux de r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration du minerai lixivi&eacute; ou des concentr&eacute;s de sulphures apr&egrave;s bio-oxydation. Les r&eacute;sultats&nbsp;&agrave; ce jour sont encourageants et d&eacute;montrent que le proc&eacute;d&eacute; par bio-oxydation du minerai de Metates et sur le concentr&eacute; s'est av&eacute;r&eacute; une m&eacute;thode de pr&eacute;-traitement efficace, avec des taux de r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration des m&eacute;taux pr&eacute;cieux r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement obtenus en laboratoire de plus de 80&nbsp;%.<P>

Des travaux suppl&eacute;mentaires sont en cours afin d'&eacute;valuer tous les aspects reli&eacute;s aux processus m&eacute;tallurgiques, au d&eacute;veloppement du circuit de traitement et&nbsp;&agrave; l'optimisation des diff&eacute;rents sc&eacute;narios d'exploitation, lesquels pourraient potentiellement accro&icirc;tre significativement la rentabilit&eacute; du projet. L'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; est pr&eacute;vue pour le premier trimestre de&nbsp;1997 et ceci pourrait possiblement amener&nbsp;&agrave; construire une usine pilote sur le site au cours de la prochaine ann&eacute;e.<P>

<H3>Strat&eacute;gie</H3>

Monsieur Gignac a soulign&eacute;, lors de l'assembl&eacute;e annuelle des actionnaires, les r&eacute;sultats prometteurs pr&eacute;liminaires de la nouvelle zone ouest de Doyon qui semble se diriger vers la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Mouska de Cambior. Selon Louis P. Gignac "Ce potentiel sur nos propri&eacute;t&eacute;s Doyon-Mouska ajout&eacute; au progr&egrave;s des projets de d&eacute;veloppement et d'exploration souligne le potentiel consid&eacute;rable d'accro&icirc;tre la cr&eacute;ation de valeur pour l'actionnaire. Nous&nbsp;&eacute;tudions&nbsp;&eacute;galement toutes les alternatives pour maximiser la valeur des actions, incluant la sollicitation de partenaires sur nos projets majeurs et l'&eacute;tude de diverses structures corporatives, lesquels pourraient faciliter le financement de ces projets".<p>

Nous d&eacute;sirons vous informer sur les r&eacute;cents d&eacute;veloppements concernant la Commission d'enqu&ecirc;te sur les activit&eacute;s mini&egrave;res de la mine Omai.<P>
Comme vous le savez d&eacute;j&agrave;, les travaux de la Commission sont support&eacute;s par trois (3) comit&eacute;s techniques regroupant des experts et des consultants.  Les comit&eacute;s sur les &eacute;valuations de la digue principale et du proc&eacute;d&eacute; ont soumis leur rapport cette semaine. <A HREF="../../InfoReEn/1995/InfoReEn95-11-17b.html">L'information ci-jointe</A> inclut un r&eacute;sum&eacute; et les faits saillants de certaines pages extraites de ces rapports.  Si vous d&eacute;sirez obtenir de plus amples informations ou d&eacute;sirez obtenir copie compl&egrave;te de ces rapports, veuillez contacter Robert LaValli&egrave;re ou Victoria Putnam.  Les experts de la mine Omai soumettront leurs commentaires sur ces rapports &agrave; la Commission la semaine prochaine.  Le rapport du comit&eacute; pour la v&eacute;rification environnementale est pr&eacute;vu prochainement et nous pr&eacute;voyons que la Commission d&eacute;posera son rapport tel que pr&eacute;vu au calendrier, soit d'ici le 7 d&eacute;cembre 1995.<P>
Vous constaterez que les deux rapports supportent une reprise de la production &agrave; la mine Omai dans les plus brefs d&eacute;lais.  Tous les efforts sont d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s par la compagnie afin de permettre la reprise des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation d'ici la fin de 1995 et nous persistons &agrave; croire que cette date peut &ecirc;tre maintenue.<P>

<P>Montr&eacute;al, le 3 d&eacute;cembre 1996</P>

<H2>Suspension temporaire de la production &agrave; la mine Gonzague-Langlois</H2>

<P>Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui la suspension temporaire de la production
de zinc &agrave; la mine Gonzague-Langlois situ&eacute;e &agrave; Lebel-sur-Qu&eacute;villon,
Qu&eacute;bec. Cette suspension est requise en raison de la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;
de modifier la m&eacute;thode d'extraction souterraine dans certains secteurs
du gisement et de la faiblesse des march&eacute;s du zinc.</P>

<P>Environ 100&nbsp;employ&eacute;s seront mis &agrave; pied temporairement.
Certains employ&eacute;s seront affect&eacute;s aux travaux de d&eacute;veloppement
souterrains et de pr&eacute;paration de nouveaux chantiers d'extraction
dans le cadre d'un nouveau plan d'exploitation. La compagnie pr&eacute;voit
la reprise de la production au second trimestre de 1997 dans des conditions
plus favorables dans le march&eacute; du zinc.</P>

<P>Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re diversifi&eacute;e
avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation, de d&eacute;veloppement de projets
et d'exploration en Am&eacute;rique du Nord et du Sud. Ses actions (&#147;CBJ&#148;)
sont inscrites &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto
et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX).</P>

fonds de roulement) ont atteint 21,9 millions&nbsp;$ (0,36 $ par
action) comparativement &agrave; 6,8&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$
(0,13&nbsp;$ par action) pour le troisi&egrave;me trimestre de 1995.
Le <B>b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net</B> s'est &eacute;lev&eacute;
&agrave; 3,3&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,05&nbsp;$ par action) contre une
perte de 4,7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,09&nbsp;$ par action).</P>

<P>Pour les neuf premiers mois de 1996, les revenus ont atteint
226,4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ comparativement &agrave;
208,6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante en
1995. Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation se
sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; 47,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$
(0,81&nbsp;$ par action) comparativement &agrave;
42,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,85&nbsp;$ par action) pour les neuf
premiers mois de 1995. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net a atteint
5,4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,09&nbsp;$ par action) par rapport
&agrave; 1,1&nbsp;million&nbsp;$ (0,02&nbsp;$ par action) pour la
p&eacute;riode correspondante en 1995. Pour les neuf premiers mois de
1996, 81&nbsp;% des revenus nets et 85&nbsp;% des fonds
g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation mini&egrave;re
proviennent de la production aurif&egrave;re de Cambior.</P>

<P>Les r&eacute;sultats du troisi&egrave;me trimestre de 1996
indiquent une am&eacute;lioration marqu&eacute;e par rapport au
trimestre correspondant en 1995 et aux deux premiers trimestres de
1996, marquant ainsi le retour de la compagnie &agrave; sa base de
performance et de rentabilit&eacute; soutenue des op&eacute;rations.
Les r&eacute;sultats du troisi&egrave;me trimestre de 1995 ont
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;s par l'arr&ecirc;t de l'exploitation
de la mine Omai &agrave; la mi-ao&ucirc;t de 1995 en raison du bris
de la digue du parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus. La reprise des
activit&eacute;s de la mine Omai s'est effectu&eacute;e en
f&eacute;vrier&nbsp;1996 et atteint sa pleine capacit&eacute; en
mars&nbsp;1996. Les r&eacute;sultats du troisi&egrave;me trimestre de
1996 refl&egrave;tent l'augmentation de la capacit&eacute; d'usinage
&agrave; la mine Omai &agrave; la suite de la mise en service du
deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage de l'usine de traitement en
juillet ainsi que la pleine capacit&eacute; des activit&eacute;s
d'exploitation de la mine Doyon. Cette derni&egrave;re avait
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;e au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre de
1996 par une interruption de travail.</P>

<P><B><U>EXPLOITATION</U></B></P>

<P>Pour le troisi&egrave;me trimestre, la mine <B>Omai</B> a produit
un record de 77&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces d'or, une augmentation importante
par rapport aux 58&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces produites au deuxi&egrave;me
trimestre. Le deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage a &eacute;t&eacute;
mis en marche avec succ&egrave;s au d&eacute;but de juillet et a
atteint sa capacit&eacute; nominale en ao&ucirc;t. Pour le
troisi&egrave;me trimestre, la cadence d'usinage du minerai a atteint
18&nbsp;300&nbsp;tonnes par jour. Le taux de
r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration de l'or a atteint 92&nbsp;% et les
co&ucirc;ts d'exploitation ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;duits
&agrave; 233&nbsp;$ par once, repr&eacute;sentant une
am&eacute;lioration de 49&nbsp;$ l'once par rapport aux co&ucirc;ts
du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre. La production du quatri&egrave;me
trimestre b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera de la pleine op&eacute;ration du
deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage et permettra ainsi
d'&eacute;tablir la capacit&eacute; potentielle soutenue de l'usine
d'Omai.</P>

<P>Au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre, le forage se poursuivait
&agrave; Wenot afin d'augmenter les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res
dans la fosse. Du forage distanc&eacute; se poursuivra
&eacute;galement dans la r&eacute;gion &agrave; l'est de la fosse
Wenot.</P>

<P>La quote-part de Cambior dans la mine <B>Doyon</B>, pour le
troisi&egrave;me trimestre, a &eacute;t&eacute; de
27&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une augmentation de
30&nbsp;% par rapport au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre qui avait
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;e par une gr&egrave;ve de huit
semaines. En d&eacute;pit d'un arr&ecirc;t temporaire de deux
semaines en juillet pour effectuer des travaux de maintenance, la
production aurif&egrave;re du troisi&egrave;me trimestre &eacute;tait
plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e comparativement au trimestre correspondant
en 1995.</P>

<P>Le programme d'exploration de surface s'est poursuivi au cours du
troisi&egrave;me trimestre pour explorer le potentiel de la
r&eacute;gion situ&eacute;e &agrave; l'ouest de la mine et sur la
propri&eacute;t&eacute; Mouska, adjacente &agrave; la
propri&eacute;t&eacute; Doyon. Une galerie d'exploration au
8i&egrave;me niveau de la mine Doyon est pr&eacute;sentement en cours
afin d'&eacute;valuer en profondeur la nouvelle d&eacute;couverte et
le potentiel de la nouvelle zone ouest.</P>

<P>La mine <B>Bouchard-H&eacute;bert</B> a d&eacute;montr&eacute; au
cours du trimestre une excellente performance de ses
op&eacute;rations alors que l'usine a atteint une cadence de
traitement de 2&nbsp;600&nbsp;tonnes par jour en raison de
l'agrandissement du circuit de broyage. Des teneurs usin&eacute;es
plus &eacute;lev&eacute;es pour l'or, le cuivre et l'argent et de
meilleures r&eacute;cup&eacute;rations des m&eacute;taux ont permis
une production accrue de l'or et du cuivre du plus du double par
rapport au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre.</P>

<P>La production continue de s'am&eacute;liorer &agrave; la mine
<B>Langlois</B> (anciennement connue sous le nom de la mine Grevet)
pour atteindre, &agrave; la fin du trimestre, une cadence d'usinage
de 1&nbsp;900&nbsp;tonnes par jour. Les r&eacute;sultats ont
&eacute;t&eacute; affect&eacute;s de fa&ccedil;on n&eacute;gative par
un faible prix du zinc. Le prix moyen du zinc pour le trimestre a
&eacute;t&eacute; de 45&#162;/lb. Des am&eacute;liorations
suppl&eacute;mentaires des op&eacute;rations, de la cadence de
traitement et du prix du zinc sont pr&eacute;vues &agrave; moyen
terme.</P>

<P><B><U>INVESTISSEMENTS ET FINANCEMENT</U></B></P>

<P>Les investissements au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre ont
totalis&eacute; 25&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ et portaient principalement
sur Omai (7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$), le financement des principaux
projets de d&eacute;veloppement internationaux
(6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$), les frais reli&eacute;s &agrave; la
pr&eacute;paration du projet Carlota (6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$) et les
investissements sur les exploitations courantes. En raison de
l'attente de la r&eacute;ception des permis environnementaux, la
construction du projet Carlota a &eacute;t&eacute; report&eacute;e au
d&eacute;but de 1997.</P>

<P>La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; pour le
trimestre, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; son programme de couverture, un prix
moyen de 423&nbsp;$ l'once, soit une prime de 38&nbsp;$ l'once par
rapport au prix moyen du march&eacute; de 385&nbsp;$. Pour les neuf
premiers mois de 1996, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a
r&eacute;alis&eacute; un prix moyen de 430&nbsp;$ l'once,
repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une prime de 38&nbsp;$ par rapport au prix
moyen du march&eacute; de 392&nbsp;$. Pour le quatri&egrave;me
trimestre de 1996, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a pris des engagements
sur les march&eacute;s &agrave; terme pour livrer
45&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces d'or &agrave; un prix minimum de 424&nbsp;$
l'once.</P>

<P>Au cours du trimestre, Cambior a rembours&eacute;
9&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ de son emprunt d'or. La portion non
utilis&eacute;e de la facilit&eacute; de cr&eacute;dit de l'emprunt
d'or s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve pr&eacute;sentement &agrave;
25&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$. Cambior maintient une solide situation
financi&egrave;re afin de poursuivre sa strat&eacute;gie de
croissance. &Agrave; la fin du troisi&egrave;me trimestre, l'encaisse
totalisait 124&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ alors que la dette nette
s'&eacute;levait &agrave; seulement 88&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<P><B><U>PROJETS EN D&Eacute;VELOPPEMENT ET EXPLORATION</U></B></P>

<P>Au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a
poursuivi ses travaux de d&eacute;veloppement et d'exploration sur
les projets Gross Rosebel, El&nbsp;Pach&oacute;n, La&nbsp;Granja,
Metates et Yaou-Dorlin.</P>

<P>Les travaux se poursuivent au projet <B>Gross Rosebel
(Suriname)</B> (Cambior 50&nbsp;%) afin de compl&eacute;ter
l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; pr&eacute;vue pour
avril&nbsp;1997. Les forages sur les d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts se
poursuivent en vue d'augmenter les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res.
Les r&eacute;serves ont &eacute;t&eacute; mises &agrave; jour au
cours du trimestre pour atteindre 30&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave;
une teneur de 1,5&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t repr&eacute;sentant ainsi
1,4&nbsp;million d'onces d'or <I>in situ</I>. Des forages
espac&eacute;s sont actuellement en cours afin de confirmer
l'extension des d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts. Il est pr&eacute;vu que les
r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res atteindront 2&nbsp;millions d'onces
<I>in situ</I> avant le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de l'&eacute;tude de
faisabilit&eacute;.</P>

<P>Les travaux se poursuivent au projet <B>El&nbsp;Pach&oacute;n
(Argentine)</B> (Cambior&nbsp;50&nbsp;%) afin de compl&eacute;ter le
calcul des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res et optimiser les
param&egrave;tres de l'exploitation dans le but d'augmenter les
aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet. L'&eacute;tude de
faisabilit&eacute;, pr&eacute;vue au cours du premier trimestre de
1997, prendra en consid&eacute;ration une augmentation de la cadence
&agrave; 70&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour par rapport &agrave; la
cadence originale de 40&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour. Ce projet,
situ&eacute; &agrave; proximit&eacute; de la fronti&egrave;re
Chili-Argentine, b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera de l'entente
r&eacute;cemment annonc&eacute;e par les deux gouvernements pour la
signature d'un trait&eacute; et d'un protocole sp&eacute;cifique pour
le projet El&nbsp;Pach&oacute;n permettant la mise en place efficace
d'op&eacute;rations de projets miniers situ&eacute;s le long de la
fronti&egrave;re. La signature du protocole est pr&eacute;vue avant
le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute;. Au
cours du trimestre, Cambior a orient&eacute; ses efforts vers la mise
en march&eacute; future des concentr&eacute;s aupr&egrave;s de
clients raffineurs potentiels. Les contacts pr&eacute;liminaires sont
encourageants, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; la propret&eacute; du
concentr&eacute; de Pach&oacute;n ainsi que sa teneur favorable en
cuivre.</P>

<P>Le programme de forage s'est poursuivi au cours du trimestre sur
le projet <B>La&nbsp;Granja (P&eacute;rou)</B> afin d'explorer et de
mieux d&eacute;finir le gisement et le plan minier pour les
premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es d'exploitation. Il est pr&eacute;vu
qu'une portion significative des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de
cat&eacute;gorie possible sera reclass&eacute;e dans la
cat&eacute;gorie prouv&eacute;e et probable et qu'une mise &agrave;
jour des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res devra &ecirc;tre
annonc&eacute;e d'ici la fin de 1996. Les travaux se poursuivent pour
compl&eacute;ter l'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; et
am&eacute;liorer les aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet.
L'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; devrait &ecirc;tre
compl&eacute;t&eacute;e au printemps de 1997.</P>

<P>Les travaux de d&eacute;veloppement se poursuivent
&eacute;galement sur le projet <B>Metates (Mexique)</B>,
sp&eacute;cifiquement sur les essais m&eacute;tallurgiques, afin de
confirmer les r&eacute;sultats ant&eacute;rieurs et optimiser les
diff&eacute;rents sc&eacute;narios d'exploitation, lesquels
pourraient accro&icirc;tre les aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet.
</P>

<P>Les r&eacute;sultats des forages ont &eacute;t&eacute;
d&eacute;voil&eacute;s au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre sur les
propri&eacute;t&eacute;s <B>Yaou</B> et <B>Dorlin</B> (Cambior
50&nbsp;%) situ&eacute;es en Guyane Fran&ccedil;aise. Sur la
propri&eacute;t&eacute; Dorlin, les r&eacute;sultats de la
premi&egrave;re phase de forages ont &eacute;t&eacute;
annonc&eacute;s et le programme, d'ici la fin de l'ann&eacute;e,
comprend l'ajout d'une deuxi&egrave;me foreuse de plus grand
diam&egrave;tre. Les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res probables
annonc&eacute;es &agrave; Yaou se chiffrent &agrave;
10,3&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de
2,7&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t repr&eacute;sentant ainsi
875&nbsp;900&nbsp;onces d'or <I>in situ</I>. Le programme en cours se
concentrera sur l'extension des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res et
sur l'exploration et l'identification de nouvelles zones
min&eacute;ralis&eacute;es. Exploration Cambiex&nbsp;inc. a une
option pour se gagner une participation de 30&nbsp;% de
l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de Cambior dans ses propri&eacute;t&eacute;s.
</P>

<P>Des r&eacute;sultats encourageants de la premi&egrave;re phase de
forage au diamant ont &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;galement obtenus sur
le projet cuprif&egrave;re et aurif&egrave;re <B>Sultana</B>
situ&eacute; dans l'&Eacute;tat de l'Idaho. Le programme de forage
qui comprend &agrave; ce jour quatorze sondages, continue de
recouper, pr&egrave;s de la surface, des valeurs hautement
significatives en cuivre, or et argent contenues dans une zone de
skarn min&eacute;ralis&eacute; et oxyd&eacute; large d'environ
300&nbsp;m&egrave;tres et s'&eacute;tendant sur une longueur de plus
de 1,5&nbsp;kilom&egrave;tre. Exploration Cambiex fournit
pr&eacute;sentement le financement pour les travaux d'exploration sur
le projet. Cambiex a d&eacute;j&agrave; acquis un
int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 15&nbsp;% dans le projet et d&eacute;tient
une option pour augmenter sa participation &agrave; 50&nbsp;% contre
un investissement de 5,0&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<P>Pour les neuf premiers mois de 1996, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a
investi 6,8&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ en <B>frais d'exploration</B> pour
identifier des projets aurif&egrave;res &agrave; haut potentiel. Les
r&eacute;sultats semblent encourageants et la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a
d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer, d'ici la fin de
l'ann&eacute;e, ses d&eacute;penses en exploration, plus
sp&eacute;cifiquement au P&eacute;rou et au Mexique sur les
propri&eacute;t&eacute;s les plus prometteuses. Le budget
approuv&eacute; indique une augmentation de 50&nbsp;% du programme
d'exploration pour le deuxi&egrave;me semestre &agrave; plus de
6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$. Les frais d'exploration pour le
troisi&egrave;me trimestre se sont chiffr&eacute;s &agrave;
3&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<P><B><U>STRAT&Eacute;GIE ET PERSPECTIVES</U></B></P>

<P>Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction,
soulignait que &#171;&nbsp;La performance financi&egrave;re et les
r&eacute;sultats de production se sont am&eacute;lior&eacute;s au
cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre d&ucirc; &agrave; une production
plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e &agrave; la mine Omai qui a
b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; de l'expansion de l'usine, du retour
normal aux op&eacute;rations mini&egrave;res &agrave; Doyon
subs&eacute;quemment &agrave; la gr&egrave;ve des employ&eacute;s et
&agrave; des augmentations des cadences de traitement aux mines
Bouchard-H&eacute;bert et Langlois. Nous pr&eacute;voyons atteindre
notre production cible pour l'ann&eacute;e 1996 et devrions
&eacute;tablir au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre de
l'ann&eacute;e, un niveau soutenu de production et de performance
financi&egrave;re. Les travaux se poursuivent avec assiduit&eacute;
afin de compl&eacute;ter, au d&eacute;but de 1997, les &eacute;tudes
de faisabilit&eacute; sur nos importants projets en
d&eacute;veloppement. Ceci nous permettra de mieux d&eacute;finir le
potentiel &eacute;conomique de ces projets et de fournir aux
investisseurs une meilleure connaissance pour leur &eacute;valuation.
Cambior intensifiera &eacute;galement ses efforts et investissements
pour identifier et d&eacute;velopper les projets aurif&egrave;res,
incluant le potentiel de la nouvelle structure
min&eacute;ralis&eacute;e identifi&eacute;e sur les
propri&eacute;t&eacute;s Doyon et Mouska ainsi que sur les programmes
actuellement en cours au Suriname, Guyane Fran&ccedil;aise, Mexique
et au P&eacute;rou. Avec le r&eacute;tablissement d'une
productivit&eacute; et d'une performance financi&egrave;re accrues
ainsi que le d&eacute;veloppement de projets avanc&eacute;s, Cambior
a le potentiel consid&eacute;rable de maximiser la valeur pour
l'actionnaire&nbsp;&#187;</P>

<P>Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re
diversifi&eacute;e avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation, de

<CENTER><B>AUGMENTATION DE 25 % DES R&Eacute;SERVES MINI&Egrave;RES &Agrave; GROSS
ROSEBEL</B></CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Cambior inc. et Golden Star Resources Ltd. sont heureuses d'annoncer une
augmentation des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de cat&eacute;gorie prouv&eacute;e et probable sur le projet
Gross Rosebel situ&eacute; au Suriname.  Les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de cat&eacute;gorie prouv&eacute;e et
probable se chiffrent pr&eacute;sentement &agrave; plus de 30 millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de
1,5 g Au/t, repr&eacute;sentant environ 1,4 million onces d'or <I>in situ</I>, soit une hausse de 25
% par rapport aux r&eacute;serves calcul&eacute;es en mars 1996.  De plus, le nouveau calcul de
r&eacute;serves refl&egrave;te une teneur plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e et un ratio st&eacute;rile/minerai plus faible. 
L'augmentation des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res provient uniquement de la zone Pay Caro, qui
comprend maintenant les zones Pay Caro et East Pay Caro.  Ce nouveau calcul est
bas&eacute; sur les r&eacute;sultats de forages et de tranch&eacute;es compl&eacute;t&eacute;s au 30 juin 1996.  Les
r&eacute;serves actuelles excluent cependant les r&eacute;sultats de forages et de tranch&eacute;es
compl&eacute;t&eacute;s &eacute;galement le 30 juin 1996 sur les zones Koolhoven et Bigi Asanjangmoni
du bloc nord de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Gross Rosebel.  La saprolite (roche molle) constitue 72
% des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res actuelles.<BR>

R&Eacute;SULTATS DE LA PREMI&Egrave;RE PHASE DE FORAGES SUR LA PROPRI&Eacute;T&Eacute;
DORLIN</B><P>
Montr&eacute;al, Denver, le 21 ao&ucirc;t 1996<BR>
<BR>
Guyanor Ressources S.A. (Guyanor), Golden Star Resources Ltd. (Golden Star), Cambior Inc.
(Cambior) et Exploration Cambiex Inc. (Cambiex) sont heureuses d'annoncer les r&eacute;sultats de
forage de la premi&egrave;re phase du programme d'exploration sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Dorlin en Guyane
Fran&ccedil;aise.  La propri&eacute;t&eacute; Dorlin comprend 6 permis de type "B" et couvre une superficie de 141
km2 situ&eacute;e dans la partie sud-ouest de la Guyane Fran&ccedil;aise.  Cambior finance pr&eacute;sentement les
travaux d'exploration, suite &agrave; une entente qui lui permet de se gagner un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50 % dans le
projet.  Cambior a &eacute;galement sign&eacute; une entente ind&eacute;pendante avec Cambiex.  Cette derni&egrave;re peut se
gagner un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 30 % dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de Cambior dans le projet Dorlin.<P>
Les forages se sont concentr&eacute;s sur la Montagne Nivr&eacute; dans la partie sud-ouest d'un faci&egrave;s
hydrothermalis&eacute; (br&egrave;che volcanique).  Cette structure a &eacute;t&eacute; identifi&eacute;e sur une distance de plus de 5
kilom&egrave;tres par la cartographie g&eacute;ologique, &eacute;chantillonnage de sol et auger et par des &eacute;chantillons de
roches en provenance d'affleurements et de tranch&eacute;es.  La structure semble se pr&eacute;senter sur une
distance de 9 kilom&egrave;tres et a &eacute;t&eacute; identifi&eacute;e de fa&ccedil;on discontinue sur une distance additionnelle de
plus de 4 kilom&egrave;tres.  Dix-neuf sondages totalisant 4 323 m&egrave;tres ont &eacute;t&eacute; effectu&eacute;s sur la zone West
Nivr&eacute; par le BRGM en 1986.  Les informations obtenues ont &eacute;t&eacute; int&eacute;gr&eacute;es &agrave; la base de donn&eacute;es
actuelle de Dorlin et les intersections les plus importantes sont pr&eacute;sent&eacute;es au tableau 1 ci-joint. 
Guyanor a compl&eacute;t&eacute;, en utilisant une foreuse &agrave; petit diam&egrave;tre, environ 2 000 m&egrave;tres de forage pour
31 sondages d'une profondeur moyenne de 65 m&egrave;tres.  Les intersections importantes de la
campagne initiale de forages de Guyanor sont repr&eacute;sent&eacute;es au tableau 2 ci-joint, &agrave; l'exception de
trois trous de forage, DO 96-26, 27 et 28, sur lesquels nous attendons les r&eacute;sultats.<P>
La cible vis&eacute;e par le programme de forages de Guyanor constitue une br&egrave;che volcanique avec
tourmaline et des shistes silicifi&eacute;s et pyritis&eacute;s.  La min&eacute;ralisation aurif&egrave;re semble &ecirc;tre associ&eacute;e avec
les sulfures, principalement la pyrite et occasionnellement associ&eacute;e avec de la gal&egrave;ne et la
chalcopyrite avec une forte alt&eacute;ration de chlorite et de sericite.  Les r&eacute;sultats de forages de Guyanor
indiquent, aux profondeurs for&eacute;es, deux zones avec des &eacute;paisseurs moyennes de 40 &agrave; 50 m&egrave;tres. 
La compilation des donn&eacute;es de forage de 1996 semble indiquer une zone similaire avec une forte
alt&eacute;ration de chlorite, dans la zone West Nivr&eacute;, &agrave; une profondeur de plus de 140 m&egrave;tres ainsi que
de l'extension de la zone de tourmaline de Nivr&eacute; Sud, au nord &agrave; une profondeur de plus de 240
m&egrave;tres.  Les donn&eacute;es actuelles et ant&eacute;rieures des forages fournissent de l'information sur une
structure d'environ 1,5 kilom&egrave;tre dans la partie sud-est de la br&egrave;che volcanique de 5 kilom&egrave;tres.<P>
Selon Carlos Bertoni, administrateur de Guyanor et directeur de l'exploration "Apr&egrave;s avoir
syst&eacute;matiquement analys&eacute; la br&egrave;che volcanique de la Montagne Nivr&eacute;, nos r&eacute;sultats de la
campagne de forages ont essentiellement rencontr&eacute; nos expectatives, illustrant ainsi une bonne
corr&eacute;lation entre les r&eacute;sultats des &eacute;chantillons de surface et la continuit&eacute; de la min&eacute;ralisation aux
profondeurs for&eacute;es.  La compilation des forages ant&eacute;rieurs au nord semble indiquer une extension
de la structure en profondeur.  Les partenaires ont approuv&eacute;, pour la deuxi&egrave;me moiti&eacute; de l'ann&eacute;e,
des programmes d'exploration agressifs sur les projets Yaou et Dorlin.<P>
Sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Dorlin, nous allons mobiliser une foreuse de plus large diam&egrave;tre afin de v&eacute;rifier la
zone Sud Nivr&eacute; en profondeur.  Nous allons toutefois poursuivre le forage, vers le nord, afin de
d&eacute;finir la zone le long de la structure en utilisant la premi&egrave;re foreuse.  D'importants travaux doivent
&ecirc;tre accomplis &agrave; Dorlin.  Nous devons analyser la structure compl&egrave;te de la br&egrave;che volcanique ainsi
que la poursuite de l'analyse d'un large intrusif granitique d&eacute;couvert deux kilom&egrave;tres au nord,
lequel a donn&eacute; une anomalie g&eacute;ochimique de sol de plus de 300 ppb sur une surface couvrant 1
000 m&egrave;tres par 500 m&egrave;tres."<P>

Pour publication imm&eacute;diate</H2>

<P>Montr&eacute;al, le 9 ao&ucirc;t 1996</P>

<H2>Cambior annonce ses r&eacute;sultats du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre et
la mise en service du deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage &agrave; Omai</H2>

<P><B>Depuis le d&eacute;but de 1996, Cambior reporte ses r&eacute;sultats
financiers en dollars am&eacute;ricains.</B></P>

<P>Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui que sa production du deuxi&egrave;me
trimestre a &eacute;t&eacute; de 111 800 onces d'or, 14 300 tonnes de zinc
et 1 900 tonnes de cuivre. La production d'or du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre
a connu une hausse de 24 %, par rapport aux 90 200 onces produites au premier
trimestre, en raison des op&eacute;rations mini&egrave;res &agrave; Omai
qui ont atteint la pleine cadence de production &agrave; la fin du trimestre.</P>

<P>Les revenus pour le deuxi&egrave;me trimestre se sont chiffr&eacute;s
&agrave; 74,0 millions $ par rapport &agrave; 76,4 millions $ pour la p&eacute;riode
correspondante en 1995. Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation
(avant variations d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments du fonds de roulement) ont atteint
14,0 millions $ (0,23 $ par action) comparativement &agrave; 20,1 millions
$ (0,41 $ par action) pour le deuxi&egrave;me trimestre de 1995. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice
net s'est &eacute;lev&eacute; &agrave; 1,1 million $ (0,02 $ par action)
contre 1,9 million $ (0,04 $ par action).</P>

<P>Pour le premier semestre, les revenus ont atteint 134,7 millions $ comparativement
&agrave; 144,4 millions $ pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante en 1995.
Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s
&agrave; 25,6 millions $ (0,44 $ par action) comparativement &agrave; 35,7
millions $ (0,73 $ par action) pour le premier semestre de 1995. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice
net a atteint 2,1 millions $ (0,04 $ par action) par rapport &agrave; 5,7
millions $ (0,12 $ par action) pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante en
1995.</P>

<P>Les r&eacute;sultats pour le premier semestre de l'ann&eacute;e ont
&eacute;t&eacute; n&eacute;gativement affect&eacute;s par une production
moindre &agrave; la mine Omai en raison de la reprise graduelle des activit&eacute;s
d'exploitation depuis f&eacute;vrier 1996. Les r&eacute;sultats ont &eacute;t&eacute;
aussi affect&eacute;s par la perte de production &agrave; la mine Doyon
en raison d'une gr&egrave;ve d'une dur&eacute;e de huit semaines au cours
du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre.</P>

<H3>PRODUCTION</H3>

<P>La mine Omai a produit 58 000 onces d'or au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre,
repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une augmentation importante par rapport aux 27
000 onces produites au premier trimestre. Depuis la reprise des activit&eacute;s
d'exploitation &agrave; la mine Omai en f&eacute;vrier, la production a
augment&eacute; graduellement pour atteindre la pleine capacit&eacute;
en juin 1996. La mise en service du deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage
de l'usine au d&eacute;but de juillet a connu un franc succ&egrave;s et
selon les pr&eacute;visions, atteindra graduellement sa capacit&eacute;
nominale au cours du troisi&egrave;me trimestre.</P>

<P>La gr&egrave;ve &agrave; la mine Doyon a provoqu&eacute; un manque &agrave;
gagner, pour la quote-part de Cambior, estim&eacute; &agrave; 6 000 onces,
ce qui a r&eacute;sult&eacute; &agrave; des co&ucirc;ts plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s
pour cette p&eacute;riode. La mine a repris ses activit&eacute;s d'exploitation
&agrave; une cadence normale mais a subi, pour une p&eacute;riode de deux
semaines au d&eacute;but de juillet, un arr&ecirc;t temporaire planifi&eacute;
pour effectuer des travaux de maintenance. La production cible pour la
quote-part de Cambior dans la mine Doyon a &eacute;t&eacute;, par cons&eacute;quent,
r&eacute;ajust&eacute;e &agrave; 105 000 onces pour l'ann&eacute;e 1996.</P>

<P>La production &agrave; la mine Langlois (ant&eacute;rieurement connue
sous le nom de mine Grevet) s'est am&eacute;lior&eacute;e graduellement
depuis le d&eacute;but de sa mise en production plus t&ocirc;t cette ann&eacute;e.
La production et la cadence journali&egrave;re de traitement se sont constamment
am&eacute;lior&eacute;es pour atteindre une moyenne de 1 700 tonnes/jour
&agrave; la fin du trimestre. Des am&eacute;liorations suppl&eacute;mentaires
sur la cadence de traitement et les taux de r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration
des m&eacute;taux sont pr&eacute;vues au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre.</P>

<P>Les op&eacute;rations &agrave; la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert ont &eacute;t&eacute;
affect&eacute;es en juin pour une p&eacute;riode de deux semaines en raison
de r&eacute;parations importantes au puits. La cadence de traitement s'est
am&eacute;lior&eacute;e progressivement avec la mise en place d'&eacute;quipements
pour accro&icirc;tre la capacit&eacute; d'usinage. La cadence de traitement
a atteint &agrave; la fin du trimestre une moyenne de 2 500 tonnes par
jour et il est pr&eacute;vu qu'elle atteindra sa pleine capacit&eacute;
au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre.</P>

<P>Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction de Cambior,
mentionnait que &quot;la production &agrave; la mine Omai devrait continuer
de s'am&eacute;liorer aux troisi&egrave;me et quatri&egrave;me trimestres
avec le plein acc&egrave;s &agrave; du minerai de plus haute teneur de
la fosse Fennell et la mise en service du deuxi&egrave;me circuit de broyage,
qui a connu un franc succ&egrave;s au d&eacute;but de juillet. La production
de la mine Omai en 1996 est pr&eacute;vue &agrave; 255 000 onces. Cambior
a ajust&eacute; toute sa production cible pour l'ann&eacute;e &agrave;
500 000 onces d'or, 66 000 tonnes de zinc et 8 400 tonnes de cuivre.&quot;</P>

<H3>INVESTISSEMENTS ET FINANCEMENT</H3>

<P>Les investissements au cours du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre ont totalis&eacute;
30 millions $ et portaient principalement sur la fin des travaux d'agrandissement
de l'usine de traitement d'Omai (7 millions $), le financement des principaux
projets de d&eacute;veloppement internationaux (12 millions $) et les investissements
sur les exploitations courantes. La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute;
pour le trimestre, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; son programme de couverture, un
prix moyen de 428 $ l'once, soit une prime de 38 $ l'once par rapport au
prix moyen du march&eacute; de 390 $. Pour le premier semestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;
a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un prix moyen de 432 $ l'once, repr&eacute;sentant
ainsi une prime de 37 $ par rapport au prix moyen du march&eacute; de 395
$. Pour le deuxi&egrave;me semestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a pris des
engagements sur les march&eacute;s &agrave; terme pour livrer 179 000 onces
d'or &agrave; un prix minimum de 423 $ l'once.</P>

<P>Au cours du trimestre, Cambior a report&eacute; d'un an l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ancier
des remboursements de l'emprunt d'or. Les remboursements d&eacute;buteront
le 30 juin 1997 pour s'&eacute;chelonner jusqu'au 31 d&eacute;cembre de
l'an 2000. Cambior maintient une solide situation financi&egrave;re afin
de poursuivre sa strat&eacute;gie de croissance. &Agrave; la fin du deuxi&egrave;me
trimestre, l'encaisse s'&eacute;levait &agrave; 143 millions $ avec une
dette nette de seulement 75 millions $.</P>

<H3>PROJETS EN D&Eacute;VELOPPEMENT ET EXPLORATION</H3>

<P>Au cours du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a poursuivi
ses travaux de d&eacute;veloppement et d'exploration sur les projets El
Pach&oacute;n, La Granja, Gross Rosebel et Metates.</P>

<P>Les travaux se poursuivent au projet <B>El Pach&oacute;n (Argentine)</B>
afin de compl&eacute;ter le calcul des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res
et optimiser les param&egrave;tres de l'exploitation dans le but d'augmenter
les aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet. L'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute;,
pr&eacute;vue au cours du premier trimestre de 1997, prendra en consid&eacute;ration
une augmentation de la cadence &agrave; 70 000 tonnes par jour par rapport
&agrave; la cadence originale de 40 000 tonnes par jour. Ce projet, situ&eacute;
&agrave; proximit&eacute; de la fronti&egrave;re Chili-Argentine, b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiera
de l'entente r&eacute;cemment annonc&eacute;e par les deux gouvernements
pour la signature d'un trait&eacute; permettant la mise en place efficace
d'op&eacute;rations de projets miniers situ&eacute;s le long de la fronti&egrave;re.
Les deux gouvernements ont en effet convenu d'&eacute;tablir un protocole
sp&eacute;cifique pour le projet El Pach&oacute;n qui est pr&eacute;vu
pour signature &agrave; l'automne 1996. Un tel accord et protocole permettraient
aux actionnaires de la compagnie Pach&oacute;n S.A. Minera d'utiliser les
infrastructures les plus appropri&eacute;es dans le pays le plus avantageux
pour eux et avoir ainsi un impact positif sur les aspects &eacute;conomiques
du projet. Au cours du trimestre, Cambior a rencontr&eacute; l'engagement
financier pour l'obtention d'un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t additionnel de 10
% dans la compagnie argentine pour ainsi porter son int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
&agrave; 50 % dans le projet El Pach&oacute;n.</P>

<P>Le programme de forage s'est poursuivi au cours du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre
sur le projet <B>La Granja (P&eacute;rou)</B> afin d'explorer et de mieux
d&eacute;finir le gisement. Il est pr&eacute;vu qu'une portion significative
des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de cat&eacute;gorie possible sera reclass&eacute;e
dans la cat&eacute;gorie prouv&eacute;e et probable et d'am&eacute;liorer
le ratio st&eacute;rile/minerai du gisement. Les travaux se poursuivent
pour compl&eacute;ter l'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; et am&eacute;liorer
les aspects &eacute;conomiques de l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute;
compl&eacute;t&eacute;e plus t&ocirc;t cette ann&eacute;e. L'&eacute;tude
de faisabilit&eacute; devrait &ecirc;tre compl&eacute;t&eacute;e au printemps
de 1997. L'envergure et le potentiel de ce projet de classe mondiale sont
tels que Cambior sollicitera un partenaire pour fournir la capacit&eacute;
de raffinage et supporter les exigences financi&egrave;res.</P>

<P>Les travaux se poursuivent au projet <B>Gross Rosebel (Suriname)</B>
afin de compl&eacute;ter l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; au d&eacute;but
de 1997. Cambior d&eacute;tient un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50 % dans ce
projet. Les forages sur les d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts se poursuivent en vue d'augmenter
les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res ant&eacute;rieurement &eacute;tablies
&agrave; 1,1 million d'onces. Les &eacute;tudes d'ing&eacute;nierie sont
en cours afin de mieux d&eacute;finir les caract&eacute;ristiques m&eacute;tallurgiques
du minerai et d'optimiser les d&eacute;penses en capital et les param&egrave;tres
des co&ucirc;ts d'exploitation.</P>

<P>Les travaux de d&eacute;veloppement se poursuivent &eacute;galement
sur le projet <B>Metates (Mexique)</B> , sp&eacute;cifiquement sur les
essais m&eacute;tallurgiques, afin de confirmer les r&eacute;sultats ant&eacute;rieurs
et optimiser les diff&eacute;rents sc&eacute;narios d'exploitation, lesquels
pourraient accro&icirc;tre les aspects &eacute;conomiques du projet. L'&eacute;tude
de faisabilit&eacute; est pr&eacute;vue pour le printemps de 1997.</P>

<P>Pour le premier semestre de 1996, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a investi
4 millions $ <B>en frais d'exploration</B> reli&eacute;s &agrave; l'identification
de projets aurif&egrave;res &agrave; haut potentiel. Les r&eacute;sultats
semblent encourageants et la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a d&eacute;cid&eacute;
d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer au deuxi&egrave;me semestre ses d&eacute;penses
en exploration, plus sp&eacute;cifiquement au P&eacute;rou et au Mexique
sur les propri&eacute;t&eacute;s les plus prometteuses. Le budget approuv&eacute;
indique une augmentation de 50 % pour un programme d'exploration pour le
deuxi&egrave;me semestre de plus de 6 millions&nbsp;$.</P>

<H3>STRAT&Eacute;GIE</H3>

<P>Louis P. Gignac soulignait que &quot;la production de nos exploitations
courantes et la performance financi&egrave;re devraient s'am&eacute;liorer
de fa&ccedil;on marqu&eacute;e au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre de
l'ann&eacute;e avec l'impact de l'agrandissement de l'usine d'Omai et des
augmentations des cadences journali&egrave;res de traitement aux mines
Bouchard-H&eacute;bert et Langlois. Nous devrions &eacute;tablir, au cours
de la deuxi&egrave;me moiti&eacute; de l'ann&eacute;e, un niveau soutenu
de production et de performance financi&egrave;re. Les projets importants
en d&eacute;veloppement se poursuivent de fa&ccedil;on agressive et nous
augmentons nos efforts et investissements pour identifier et d&eacute;velopper
les projets aurif&egrave;res, incluant le potentiel de la nouvelle structure
min&eacute;ralis&eacute;e identifi&eacute;e sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute;
Doyon et les programmes actuellement en cours au Suriname, Guyane fran&ccedil;aise,
Mexique et au P&eacute;rou. Cambior a le potentiel pour accro&icirc;tre
la cr&eacute;ation de valeur pour l'actionnaire et nous continuons d'&eacute;valuer
toutes les avenues pour maximiser la r&eacute;alisation de cette valeur.&quot;</P>

<P>Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec
des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration dans l'Am&eacute;rique
du Nord et du Sud. Ses actions (&quot;CBJ&quot;) sont inscrites &agrave;
la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock
Exchange (AMEX).</P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 20 juin 1996<P>

<H2>Inauguration officielle de la mine Gonzague Langlois</H2>

Cambior inc. est heureuse d'annoncer aujourd'hui l'inauguration officielle de la mine Gonzague Langlois, situ&eacute;e &agrave; proximit&eacute; de Lebel-sur-Qu&eacute;villon, Qu&eacute;bec et connue jusqu'&agrave; tout r&eacute;cemment sous le nom de mine Grevet.<P>

L'&eacute;v&eacute;nement s'est d&eacute;roul&eacute; devant plus de 250&nbsp;invit&eacute;s parmi lesquels on pouvait notamment remarquer la pr&eacute;sence des repr&eacute;sentants des deux paliers gouvernementaux, de plusieurs dignitaires et repr&eacute;sentants de l'industrie mini&egrave;re.<P>

&Agrave; cette occasion, Cambior a rendu un hommage particulier, &agrave; titre posthume, &agrave; Monsieur Gonzague Langlois, un pionnier de l'industrie mini&egrave;re canadienne telle que nous la connaissons aujourd'hui et ancien membre du Conseil d'administration de Cambior.  Ing&eacute;nieur minier de formation, Gonzague Langlois aura consacr&eacute; l'essentiel de sa vie &agrave; l'industrie mini&egrave;re, autant sur le plan de la connaissance qu'en termes de regroupement des forces et des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs.  "C'&eacute;tait un homme qui s'impliquait beaucoup, qui fonctionnait par coup de coeur.  Il &eacute;tait entier comme un roc.  Gonzague aimait ou n'aimait pas...", nous confie son &eacute;pouse, Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Langlois.  Ce  gisement a &eacute;t&eacute; mis en production au co&ucirc;t de 90&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$&nbsp;Can.  La production commerciale a d&eacute;but&eacute; au cours du premier trimestre de&nbsp;1996 et assure le maintien de 200&nbsp;emplois, en plus de repr&eacute;senter des retomb&eacute;es &eacute;conomiques importantes dans la r&eacute;gion de Lebel-sur-Qu&eacute;villon.<P>

La production annuelle pr&eacute;vue de la mine est de 62 000 tonnes de zinc, 3&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes de cuivre, 700&nbsp;onces d'or et 313&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces d'argent &agrave; partir de l'extraction de 910&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes de minerai.  Les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de la mine Gonzague Langlois sont de 11&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de 8,41&nbsp;% zinc, 0,46&nbsp;% cuivre, 37,0&nbsp;g/t argent et 0,1&nbsp;g/t or.  La dur&eacute;e de la mine est &eacute;valu&eacute;e &agrave; plus de 12&nbsp;ans.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration dans l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord et du Sud.  Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

<H2>Communiqu&eacute; de presse<BR>
Pour publication imm&eacute;diate</H2>

Montr&eacute;al, le 9 mai 1996<P>

<H2>Cambior inc. annonce le versement d'un dividende semi-annuel</H2>

Le Conseil d'administration de Cambior a approuv&eacute; le versement d'un dividende semi-annuel de 0.052&nbsp;$&nbsp;US par action ordinaire payable le 28&nbsp;juin&nbsp;1996 aux actionnaires inscrits&nbsp;&agrave; la fermeture des bureaux le 7&nbsp;juin&nbsp;1996.<P>

Traditionnellement, Cambior paie des dividendes en juin et en d&eacute;cembre.  Le dernier paiement du dividende semi-annuel a&nbsp;&eacute;t&eacute; effectu&eacute; en d&eacute;cembre&nbsp;1995 pour un montant de 0,07&nbsp;$&nbsp;Can (0,0517&nbsp;$&nbsp;US).<P>

En rapport avec la d&eacute;cision de Cambior de pr&eacute;senter dor&eacute;navant ses&nbsp;&eacute;tats financiers en dollars am&eacute;ricains, les dividendes sont maintenant d&eacute;clar&eacute;s en dollars&nbsp;US.  Cependant, pour les r&eacute;sidents canadiens, le paiement de dividendes sera vers&eacute; en une somme&nbsp;&eacute;quivalente en dollars canadiens ($&nbsp;Can) selon le taux officiel du midi de la Banque du Canada&nbsp;&agrave; la date de cl&ocirc;ture&nbsp;&agrave; moins que l'actionnaire demande par&nbsp;&eacute;crit&nbsp;&agrave; la Compagnie Montr&eacute;al Trust de recevoir le paiement en dollars&nbsp;US.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration dans l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord et du Sud.  Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits&nbsp;&agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles de CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 22 avril 1996

<H2>Cambior annonce sa production pour le premier trimestre de&nbsp;1996</H2>

Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui que la production aurif&egrave;re du premier trimestre a atteint 90&nbsp;200&nbsp;onces repr&eacute;sentant une augmentation par rapport &agrave; la production du quatri&egrave;me trimestre de&nbsp;1995.<P>

La mine Omai a red&eacute;marr&eacute; ses op&eacute;rations le 4&nbsp;f&eacute;vrier&nbsp;1996 et a graduellement augment&eacute; sa production pour produire 27&nbsp;200&nbsp;onces en excluant les onces d'or accumul&eacute;es dans le circuit de traitement.<P>

La production commerciale &agrave; la mine Grevet a d&eacute;but&eacute; au cours du premier trimestre.  La mine devrait progressivement atteindre son niveau normal de capacit&eacute; au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre.  La production totale de zinc et de cuivre aux mines Bouchard-H&eacute;bert et Grevet, au cours du premier trimestre, est de 12&nbsp;800&nbsp;tonnes de zinc et de 1&nbsp;600&nbsp;tonnes de cuivre.<P>

Selon Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction, "Une augmentation de la production aurif&egrave;re est pr&eacute;vue au cours du deuxi&egrave;me semestre avec la hausse de la capacit&eacute; de l'usine de traitement d'Omai pr&eacute;vue pour le mois de juin, ce qui devrait g&eacute;n&eacute;rer de bons r&eacute;sultats pour les troisi&egrave;me et quatri&egrave;me trimestres.  Cambior maintient son objectif de production de 530&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces d'or en&nbsp;1996.".<P>

Les r&eacute;sultats financiers du premier trimestre seront diffus&eacute;s &agrave; l'assembl&eacute;e des actionnaires le 9&nbsp;mai&nbsp;1996.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 9 avril 1996

<H2>D&eacute;p&ocirc;t de l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; sur le projet El Pach&oacute;n</H2>

Cambior inc. annonce que l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; du projet cuprif&egrave;re El Pach&oacute;n en Argentine a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;pos&eacute;e aupr&egrave;s du Conseil d'administration de Cambior et que ce dernier accepte de poursuivre la continuation des travaux d'exploration et de d&eacute;veloppement, et d'ing&eacute;nierie en vue de compl&eacute;ter une &eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; pr&eacute;vue pour le premier trimestre de 1997.<P>

Le projet El Pach&oacute;n est situ&eacute; en Argentine, dans la province de San Juan, &agrave; environ trois kilom&egrave;tres de la fronti&egrave;re chilienne.  Bas&eacute; sur les r&eacute;sultats de 193&nbsp;trous de forage totalisant plus de 34&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&egrave;tres, les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res sont estim&eacute;es &agrave; 687&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de 0,63&nbsp;%&nbsp;cuivre en utilisant une teneur de coupure de 0,4&nbsp;%&nbsp;cuivre, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi pr&egrave;s de 9,5&nbsp;milliards de livres de cuivre <I>in situ</I>.<P>

</TABLE><P>

Selon les termes de l'entente concernant le projet El Pach&oacute;n, Cambior a vers&eacute; en 1994, <NOBR>10 millions $ US</NOBR> &agrave; la Compa&ntilde;ia Minera San Jos&eacute; S.A. pour acqu&eacute;rir 40 % des actions ordinaires de Pach&oacute;n S.A. Minera.  Cambior est sur le point de compl&eacute;ter un investissement de <NOBR>5 millions $ US</NOBR> requis pour l'acquisition d'un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t additionnel de 10&nbsp;%.  Une fois l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t additionnel acquis, San Jos&eacute; d&eacute;tiendra un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50&nbsp;% dans le projet El Pach&oacute;n et devra contribuer aux d&eacute;penses du projet au prorata de sa participation.  La compagnie San Jos&eacute; est d&eacute;tenue ultimement par Andean Resources (60&nbsp;%), par Rio Tinto Zinc (RTZ) (33&nbsp;%) de m&ecirc;me que par International Finance Corporation (IFC), la branche de financement au secteur priv&eacute; de la Banque Mondiale (6&nbsp;%).<P>

Le gisement El Pach&oacute;n est qualifi&eacute; de porphyre cuprif&egrave;re.  La min&eacute;ralisation se retrouve sous forme de chalcopyrite et de molybd&eacute;nite.  Elle est associ&eacute;e &agrave; un r&eacute;seau de fractures dans le cas du cuivre et &agrave; des petites veines de quartz pour ce qui est du molybd&egrave;ne.  Les roches h&ocirc;tes sont la diorite, l'and&eacute;site et la br&egrave;che intrusive.  Environ 94&nbsp;% de la min&eacute;ralisation se retrouve dans la zone primaire.<P>
D'apr&egrave;s les r&eacute;sultats de l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute;, l'exploitation du gisement serait bas&eacute;e sur une capacit&eacute; initiale de traitement de 40&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour avec une expansion subs&eacute;quente apr&egrave;s la septi&egrave;me ann&eacute;e de production &agrave; 60&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour.  L'investissement initial serait de l'ordre de 500&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ US.  Les &eacute;tudes m&eacute;tallurgiques pr&eacute;sentement en cours confirment que la r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration du cuivre par flottation est de 92&nbsp;% alors que celle du molybd&egrave;ne est de 70&nbsp;%.  Les teneurs du cuivre et du molybd&egrave;ne dans les concentr&eacute;s seront de l'ordre de 28&nbsp;% et 45&nbsp;% respectivement.<P>

Selon la planification pr&eacute;liminaire de l'extraction mini&egrave;re, quelque 111&nbsp;millions de tonnes avec une teneur de 0,92&nbsp;% de cuivre pourraient &ecirc;tre extraites au cours des sept premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es de la production commerciale avec un ratio st&eacute;rile/minerai de 1,8.  Ces r&eacute;sultats pr&eacute;liminaires indiqueraient une production annuelle moyenne de 135&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes de cuivre dans le concentr&eacute; durant cette premi&egrave;re phase de minage &agrave; un co&ucirc;t direct moyen d'exploitation de 0,57&nbsp;$&nbsp;US par livre de cuivre.  La construction pourrait d&eacute;buter en 1998, subs&eacute;quemment &agrave; l'approbation de l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; et de la mise en place du financement, pour une production commerciale anticip&eacute;e en l'an 2000.<P>

<h3>Impact strat&eacute;gique</h3>

Selon Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction, &quot;L'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; a d&eacute;montr&eacute; le potentiel &eacute;conomique du projet tout en accroissant la valeur pour l'actionnaire.  L'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute;, pr&eacute;vue au premier trimestre de 1997, inclura des &eacute;tudes d'ing&eacute;nierie plus d&eacute;taill&eacute;es sur tous les aspects du projet afin d'optimiser les co&ucirc;ts et les c&eacute;dules.  Nous anticipons avec plaisir de travailler avec la compagnie San Jos&eacute; et les membres de tous les niveaux des gouvernements argentin et chilien dans le but de mettre &agrave; jour le potentiel du gisement El Pach&oacute;n afin que ce dernier puisse b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier &agrave; tous ses d&eacute;tenteurs.&quot;<P>

<H2>Communiqu&eacute; de presse conjoint</H2>

Montr&eacute;al et Denver, le 26 mars 1996

<H2>R&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de plus d'un million d'onces d'or &agrave;&nbsp;Gross&nbsp;Rosebel</H2>

Cambior inc. et Golden Star Resources Ltd. sont heureuses d'annoncer des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de 24&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de 1,4&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Gross&nbsp;Rosebel au Suriname, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi 1,1&nbsp;million d'onces d'or <I>in&nbsp;situ</I>.<P>

Ce calcul de r&eacute;serves a &eacute;t&eacute; effectu&eacute; &agrave; partir des r&eacute;sultats de 420&nbsp;trous de forage au diamant pour un total de plus de 37&nbsp;500&nbsp;m&egrave;tres, de 4&nbsp;064&nbsp;sondages &agrave; la tari&egrave;re de plus de 25&nbsp;000&nbsp;m&egrave;tres et de 14&nbsp;kilom&egrave;tres de tranch&eacute;es.  Les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res r&eacute;pertori&eacute;es &agrave; date proviennent de deux r&eacute;gions sur l'immense propri&eacute;t&eacute; Gross Rosebel.  Le bloc sud comprend les d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts de Mayo, Royal Hill et Rosebel et le bloc nord, les d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts de Pay Caro et Koolhoven.  Quatre-vingt-six pour-cent (86&nbsp;%) des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res identifi&eacute;es &agrave; ce jour se trouvent dans la roche molle (saprolite et lat&eacute;rite).  La r&eacute;partition des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res dans les blocs sud et nord est la suivante&nbsp;:<P>

<H3>G&eacute;ologie</H3>
La concession d'exploration Gross Rosebel couvre une superficie de 17&nbsp;000&nbsp;hectares et est situ&eacute;e &agrave; 80&nbsp;km au sud de Paramaribo, la capitale, et est facilement accessible par route.  La propri&eacute;t&eacute; est situ&eacute;e dans une ceinture de m&eacute;tas&eacute;diments et de m&eacute;tavolcaniques datant du prot&eacute;rozo&iuml;que inf&eacute;rieur, qui est elle-m&ecirc;me travers&eacute;e le long de sa bordure sud par des tonalites et des granites.  Les roches forment une large structure synclinale orient&eacute;e est-ouest et plongeant vers l'ouest.  La min&eacute;ralisation aurif&egrave;re est associ&eacute;e principalement &agrave; des veines de quartz de type hydrothermal et des veines de quartz carbonat&eacute;.  Des concentrations d'or se pr&eacute;sentent &eacute;galement au contact des m&eacute;tas&eacute;diments et des m&eacute;tavolcaniques.  Un d&eacute;p&ocirc;t alt&eacute;r&eacute; (lat&eacute;rite et saprolite) de 50&nbsp;m&egrave;tres s'est d&eacute;velopp&eacute; sous la surface en raison d'un climat tropical intense.<P>

<H3>Projet</H3>
Selon les termes d'une entente mini&egrave;re conclue le 7&nbsp;avril&nbsp;1994 avec la r&eacute;publique du Suriname et la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; mini&egrave;re d'&Eacute;tat Grasshopper Aluminum Company,&nbsp;N.V., Golden Star d&eacute;tient les droits d'exploration de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Gross Rosebel de m&ecirc;me que le droit d'acqu&eacute;rir la concession d'exploitation de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; une fois que des &eacute;tudes de rentabilit&eacute; et d'impact environnemental seront d&eacute;pos&eacute;es aupr&egrave;s du gouvernement du Suriname.<P>

Cambior a lev&eacute; en d&eacute;cembre&nbsp;1995 son option pour l'acquisition d'un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50&nbsp;% des droits de Golden Star dans l'entente mini&egrave;re et le projet en injectant, depuis 18&nbsp;mois, 6&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$&nbsp;US en frais d'exploration et de d&eacute;veloppement dans la propri&eacute;t&eacute;. Cambior devra &eacute;galement financer seule, des d&eacute;penses suppl&eacute;mentaires de 2,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$&nbsp;US dans le projet.  Ce dernier montant est remboursable en priorit&eacute; &agrave; partir des fonds &eacute;ventuels g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par le projet.  De plus, Cambior a convenu d'utiliser ses meilleurs efforts pour obtenir du financement provenant de tiers pour au moins 65&nbsp;% des co&ucirc;ts de construction et autres investissements relatifs &agrave; la mise en production d'une mine sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute;.  Golden Star sera le gestionnaire des activiti&eacute;s d'exploration du projet alors que Cambior sera responsable de la pr&eacute;paration de l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; et de toutes les &eacute;tapes suivantes du projet, le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant.<P>

<H3>Perspectives</H3>

Quelque 33 000&nbsp;m&egrave;tres de forage sera effectu&eacute; en 1996, afin de v&eacute;rifier les extensions lat&eacute;rales et en profondeur des d&eacute;p&ocirc;ts connus des r&eacute;gions nord et sud, et de trois nouvelles cibles (zone &quot;J&quot;, zone Spin et zone Mama Creek) afin d'identifier des r&eacute;serves additionnelles pouvant &ecirc;tre exploit&eacute;es &agrave; ciel ouvert.  Le programme d'exploration de 1996 vise &agrave; identifier de nouvelles r&eacute;serves &agrave; partir des anomalies g&eacute;ochimiques de sol connues sur cette propri&eacute;t&eacute; entre certaines zones et dans les parties est et nord-est de la propri&eacute;t&eacute;.  De plus, le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de Pay Caro doit &ecirc;tre &eacute;valu&eacute; pour son potentiel souterrain.  Certains r&eacute;sultats de forage en dessous des limites initiales des fosses ont donn&eacute; 16,7&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t sur 3&nbsp;m&egrave;tres, 8,2&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t sur 10&nbsp;m&egrave;tres et 9,3&nbsp;g&nbsp;Au/t sur&nbsp;4,3 m&egrave;tres.  Un budget de 5,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$&nbsp;US est pr&eacute;vu en 1996 pour compl&eacute;ter la campagne de forage et une &eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; pour la fin de l'ann&eacute;e 1996, incluant une &eacute;tude d'impact sur l'environnement ainsi que du forage g&eacute;otechnique pour &eacute;valuer les sites potentiels de l'usine et du parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus.  Une &eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; sera d&eacute;pos&eacute;e d'ici quelques semaines.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.  Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles respectifs de CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

Golden Star est une compagnie de production d'or et de prospection d'or et de diamant, qui d&eacute;tient une participation de 30&nbsp;% dans les actions ordinaires de la mine d'or Omai en Guyana, l'une des mines d'or les plus importantes en Am&eacute;rique du Sud.  Golden Star d&eacute;tient &eacute;galement d'importants int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de prospection d'or et de diamant en Afrique et en Am&eacute;rique du Sud.  La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; est inscrite &agrave; la bourse de Toronto (symbole GSC) et &agrave; l'American Stock Exchange (symbole GSR).<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 13 mars 1996

<H2>D&eacute;p&ocirc;t de l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; sur le projet La Granja et augmentation importante des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res</H2>

Cambior inc. annonce que l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; du projet cuprif&egrave;re La Granja au P&eacute;rou a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;pos&eacute;e et que le Conseil d'administration a donn&eacute; son aval pour poursuivre les travaux d'exploration et de d&eacute;veloppement, et d'ing&eacute;nierie en vue de compl&eacute;ter une &eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; pr&eacute;vue pour le premier trimestre de 1997.<P>

Les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res ont augment&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on significative depuis septembre 1995 pour atteindre 1 300 millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de 0,61 % cuivre en utilisant une teneur de coupure de 0,4 % cuivre repr&eacute;sentant ainsi pr&egrave;s de 16 milliards de livres de cuivre <I>in situ</I>.<P>

<BR>
La mise &agrave; jour de ces r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res est bas&eacute;e sur l'addition de 59 sondages effectu&eacute;s sp&eacute;cifiquement dans les secteurs sud-est et nord du d&eacute;p&ocirc;t.  Un total de 58 000 m&egrave;tres ou 179 sondages ont &eacute;t&eacute; for&eacute;s &agrave; ce jour.  Il semble que certains secteurs du gisement demeurent ouverts lat&eacute;ralement et en profondeur, ce qui laisse pr&eacute;sager d'autres augmentations de les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res.  Le patron de forage d'exploration de 200 m x 200 m est pratiquement compl&eacute;t&eacute; sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute; et en 1996, nous poursuivons le programme de forage de d&eacute;finition, sur un patron de 100 m x 100 m afin de mieux d&eacute;finir les limites et les caract&eacute;ristiques de ce gisement.<P>

Le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t La Granja consiste &agrave; une formation intrusive fortement alt&eacute;r&eacute;e de la fin de l'&acirc;ge tertiaire et comporte deux zones.  La plus importante zone, la zone primaire comprend la chalcopyrite alors que la zone d'enrichissement secondaire contient une importante proportion de sulfures de cuivre lixiviable, pouvant &ecirc;tre proc&eacute;d&eacute;s par SX-EW (Solvent Extraction and ElectroWinning).  La zone secondaire a plus que tripl&eacute; pour atteindre 568 millions de tonnes &agrave; 0,64 % Cu.<BR>

<BR>
D'apr&egrave;s les r&eacute;sultats de l'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute;, l'alternative la plus &eacute;conomique consisterait &agrave; une exploitation bas&eacute;e sur une capacit&eacute; de traitement qui pourrait atteindre 90 000 tonnes par jour repr&eacute;sentant un investissement de l'ordre de 800 millions $ US.  Les &eacute;tudes m&eacute;tallurgiques pr&eacute;sentement en cours confirment que les r&eacute;cup&eacute;rations du cuivre par flottation sont de 90-93 % et que les concentr&eacute;s de cuivre seront de l'ordre de 26-30 %.  Selon la planification pr&eacute;liminaire de l'extraction mini&egrave;re, quelque 220 millions de tonnes avec une teneur de 0,87 % de cuivre pourraient &ecirc;tre extraites au cours des sept premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es de la production commerciale avec un ratio st&eacute;rile/minerai de 0,47; ces r&eacute;sultats pr&eacute;liminaires indiqueraient une production annuelle moyenne de 250 000 tonnes de cuivre dans le concentr&eacute; durant cette premi&egrave;re phase de minage, &agrave; un co&ucirc;t direct moyen d'exploitation de 0,57 $ US par livre de cuivre.  Subs&eacute;quemment &agrave; la confirmation de l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; et de la mise en place du financement, la construction pourrait d&eacute;buter en 1998 avec une production commerciale anticip&eacute;e en 2001.<P>

Impact strat&eacute;gique

Selon Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction, &quot;Les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res et les param&egrave;tres &eacute;conomiques du projet La Granja se sont am&eacute;lior&eacute;s constamment depuis que Cambior est impliqu&eacute;e dans le projet en 1994.  Les investissements &agrave; ce jour ont atteint 18 millions $ US et nous pr&eacute;voyons pour 1996, un investissement de 14 millions $ US, lequel nous am&egrave;nera au d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de l'&eacute;tude de faisabilit&eacute; compl&egrave;te au premier trimestre de 1997.  La dimension et le potentiel de ce gisement cuprif&egrave;re de classe mondiale sont tels que Cambior regardera &eacute;ventuellement toutes les avenues afin de maximiser la cr&eacute;ation de valeur pour l'actionnaire, incluant la possibilit&eacute; de regarder pour des partenaires afin d'accro&icirc;tre la valeur du projet par le partage de l'aspect financier et de la mise en march&eacute;.&quot;<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration en Am&eacute;rique du Nord et en Am&eacute;rique du Sud.  Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles respectifs de CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Cambior inc. annonce ses r&eacute;sultats financiers de 1995</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui ses r&eacute;sultats financiers pour l'exercice termin&eacute; le 31 d&eacute;cembre 1995 avec des revenus de 344,4 millions $ comparativement &agrave; 306 millions $ en 1994.  En d&eacute;pit de l'interruption des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation de la mine Omai, les revenus se sont accrus de 13 %, principalement en raison de la mise en production commerciale de la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert en janvier 1995.  Le programme de couverture sur le march&eacute; de l'or a &eacute;galement contribu&eacute; &agrave; la hausse des revenus en g&eacute;n&eacute;rant un prix moyen de 420 $ US par once, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une prime de 36 $ US sur le prix moyen au march&eacute; de 384 $ US l'once.<P>

Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation, avant variations d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments du fonds de roulement, ont totalis&eacute; 61,4 millions $, ou 1,22 $ par action, comparativement &agrave; 72,9 millions $ ou 1,49 $ par action en 1994.  La perte nette se chiffre &agrave; 9 millions $, ou 0,18 $ par action comparativement &agrave; un b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net de 2,5 millions $ ou 0,05 $ par action en 1994.<P>

La diminution des fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s et la perte enregistr&eacute;e en 1995 sont attribuables &agrave; l'interruption des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation &agrave; la mine Omai, &agrave; une production aurif&egrave;re moindre au Placer de Valdez Creek et &agrave; la d&eacute;valuation de deux actifs miniers qui ne rencontraient pas les objectifs de performance de la compagnie.<P>

Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de direction, pr&eacute;cisait que 1995 fut une ann&eacute;e difficile avec l'incident survenu &agrave; Omai et certains actifs miniers qui ne rencontraient pas les objectifs de performance.  N&eacute;anmoins, avec la reprise des activit&eacute;s mini&egrave;res &agrave; Omai, nous envisageons une ann&eacute;e 1996 prometteuse.  Nous pr&eacute;voyons revenir &agrave; une rentabilit&eacute; normale et am&eacute;liorer celle-ci avec, en janvier, la mise en production de Grevet qui a d'ailleurs connu un franc succ&egrave;s de d&eacute;marrage, et avec l'augmentation de la capacit&eacute; de l'usine de traitement de la mine Omai au cours du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre.  Avec la reprise des activit&eacute;s mini&egrave;res &agrave; Omai, nous pr&eacute;voyons une augmentation de la production par rapport &agrave; 1995 avec une production cible pour Cambior en 1996 de 530 000 onces d'or.<P>

<B>Programme d'investissement</B><P>

Des d&eacute;penses en immobilisations de 160 millions $ sont pr&eacute;vues en 1996 afin de soutenir notre croissance actuelle, notamment l'expansion de l'usine de traitement de la mine Omai, les projets en d&eacute;veloppement importants et la mise en construction &eacute;ventuelle du projet Carlota.  Le premier semestre de 1996 sera tr&egrave;s actif pour la compagnie avec le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t d'&eacute;tudes de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; sur les projets avanc&eacute;s d'exploration importants de Cambior (La Granja, El Pach&oacute;n, Gross Rosebel et Metates).<P>

<B>Programme de couverture</B><P>

Cambior a pris des engagements sur les march&eacute;s &agrave; terme pour 425 000 onces d'or &agrave; un prix minimal de 419 $ US l'once pour 1996.  Les engagements pour 1997 et 1998 sont respectivement de 175 000 onces d'or &agrave; un prix minimum de 435 $ US et 73 000 onces &agrave; un prix minimum de 438 $ US l'once.  Advenant une augmentation du prix au march&eacute; de l'or, Cambior d&eacute;tient la flexibilit&eacute; requise pour diff&eacute;rer la majeure partie de ses positions.<P>

<B>Financement</B><P>

Le 6 f&eacute;vrier 1996, Cambior annon&ccedil;ait une entente de financement de 167 millions $ au moyen d'une &eacute;mission de 8 millions d'actions ordinaires.  La cl&ocirc;ture du placement est pr&eacute;vue vers la fin du mois et le produit net, estim&eacute; &agrave; 160 millions $, sera ajout&eacute; au fonds de roulement et utilis&eacute; pour les besoins g&eacute;n&eacute;raux de la compagnie.  Ce financement permettra &agrave; Cambior de renforcir sa situation financi&egrave;re afin de poursuivre sa strat&eacute;gie de croissance dans les Am&eacute;riques.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.  Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles respectifs de CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 5 f&eacute;vrier 1996

<CENTER><H2>La Mine Omai reprend ses activit&eacute;s d'exploitation</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. et Golden Star Resources Limited sont heureuses d'annoncer que le gouvernement de la Guyana a autoris&eacute; la reprise des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation &agrave; la mine d'or Omai. La construction de la premi&egrave;re phase du nouveau parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus a &eacute;t&eacute; compl&eacute;t&eacute;e et toutes les mesures ont &eacute;t&eacute; prises afin d'assurer que les activit&eacute;s d'exploitation de la mine s'effectuent dans le respect de l'environnement et de la s&eacute;curit&eacute;. Les activit&eacute;s d'exploitation de la mine ont repris dimanche le 4&nbsp;f&eacute;vrier&nbsp;1996.<P>
Les co&ucirc;ts totaux reli&eacute;s &agrave; cet incident &agrave; Omai pour la p&eacute;riode d'arr&ecirc;t des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation de la mine sont &eacute;valu&eacute;s &agrave; 11,3 millions $US. L'impact sur les r&eacute;sultats de Cambior est &eacute;valu&eacute; &agrave; 10&nbsp;millions $ Can dont 2,2 millions $ Can qui ont d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; imput&eacute;s au 30 septembre 1995.<P>
Cambior est le principal actionnaire et gestionnaire de la mine Omai. Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration dans les Am&eacute;riques.<P>
Golden Star est une soci&eacute;t&eacute; oeuvrant dans le domaine de l'exploitation et de la prospection d'or et de diamant qui d&eacute;tient une participation de 30 % dans les actions ordinaires de Omai Gold Mines Limited. L'impact principal de l'incident &agrave; Omai pour Golden Star consiste en un report du rachat pr&eacute;vu des actions privil&eacute;gi&eacute;es rachetables en 1995 pour un montant de 1 million $US.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 30 janvier 1996

<CENTER><H2>Cambior inc. annonce ses r&eacute;sultats de production et ses estimations des r&eacute;serves de 1995 ainsi qu'une d&eacute;valuation d'actifs miniers</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui que sa production aurif&egrave;re en 1995 a atteint 446 000 onces, que ses r&eacute;serves aurif&egrave;res, en excluant notre quote-part dans l'inventaire min&eacute;ral de 14,1 millions d'onces d'or &eacute;quivalent du projet Metates, ont augment&eacute; de 12 %.  La compagnie a r&eacute;&eacute;valu&eacute; ses actifs miniers qui ne rencontraient pas les objectifs de performance et a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de radier un montant apr&egrave;s imp&ocirc;ts de 7 millions $ &agrave; ses r&eacute;sultats financiers de 1995.<P>
<B>Production de 1995</B><P>
La production aurif&egrave;re de Cambior inc. pour l'ann&eacute;e termin&eacute;e le 31 d&eacute;cembre 1995 totalisait 446 000 onces comparativement &agrave; 522 000 onces l'ann&eacute;e pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente.  Cette diminution est due &agrave; l'arr&ecirc;t des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation &agrave; la mine Omai en ao&ucirc;t 1995.<P>
La quote-part de Cambior dans la mine Doyon totalisait 109 000 onces et ses autres mines canadiennes ont produit 129 000 onces comparativement &agrave; 107 000 onces en 1994.  Cette hausse de 7 % en provenance de la production des mines canadiennes est principalement due &agrave; la mise en production commerciale de la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert (anciennement connue sous le nom de la mine Mobrun).  La mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert a produit lors de sa premi&egrave;re ann&eacute;e compl&egrave;te de production commerciale 26 000 onces d'or &eacute;quivalent.<P>
La quote-part de la production de Cambior dans la mine Niobec totalisait 1 113 546 kg de ferroniobium produite &agrave; partir de sa nouvelle usine de conversion de pyrochlore en ferroniobium.  La production de cuivre et de zinc a d&eacute;but&eacute; en 1995 avec le d&eacute;but de la mise en production de la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert.  En 1995, la production de zinc a atteint 23 642 tonnes m&eacute;triques, alors que la production de cuivre s'est chiffr&eacute;e &agrave; 5 272 tonnes m&eacute;triques.<P>
<B>Perspectives 1996</B><P>
La r&eacute;ouverture de la mine Omai est pr&eacute;vue tr&egrave;s bient&ocirc;t d&egrave;s l'obtention de l'autorisation du gouvernement.  &Agrave; la reprise de l'exploitation, l'usine traitera le minerai empil&eacute; &agrave; la surface et la roche molle &agrave; plus faible teneur de la Fosse Wenot.  Au cours du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre, il est pr&eacute;vu que les activit&eacute;s d'exploitation reprennent dans la Fosse Fennell, ce qui nous permettra de retrouver le niveau de productivit&eacute; obtenu au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre de 1995 (70 000 onces par trimestre).  Les travaux d'expansion de l'usine sont &eacute;galement pr&eacute;vus pour le deuxi&egrave;me trimestre, permettant ainsi d'accro&icirc;tre la capacit&eacute; de traitement de 12 000 tonnes m&eacute;triques par jour &agrave; 18 000 tonnes par jour.<P>
La mine Doyon devrait maintenir son niveau de production de 1995 et les autres mines canadiennes devraient produire plus de 140 000 onces d'or en 1996.  Ceci assurera une croissance continue de la production aurif&egrave;re en provenance de nos op&eacute;rations canadiennes.<P>
La mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert conna&icirc;t actuellement une expansion de son usine de traitement, permettant ainsi d'augmenter sa capacit&eacute; de 10 %.  La mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert devrait produire en 1996, 25 000 tonnes de zinc, 6 000 tonnes de cuivre et 20 000 onces d'or.  La mine Grevet a d&eacute;but&eacute; sa production commerciale en janvier 1996 et pr&eacute;voit produire 62 000 tonnes de zinc et 2 600 tonnes de cuivre.<P>
<B>R&eacute;serves</B><P>
Au 31 d&eacute;cembre 1995, les r&eacute;serves aurif&egrave;res sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es &agrave; 5,7 millions d'onces, comparativement &agrave; 5,0 millions d'onces <I>in situ</I> au 31 d&eacute;cembre 1994.  Cette hausse de 12 % est principalement attribuable &agrave; l'augmentation importante des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res de la mine Omai.  Le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t Wenot Lake demeure ouvert lat&eacute;ralement et continue de d&eacute;montrer son potentiel croissant pour augmenter les r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res.  Des forages d'exploration seront effectu&eacute;s en 1996 dans la partie ouest de la Fosse Wenot ainsi que sur une anomalie g&eacute;ochimique qui s'&eacute;tend sur plus de 1,2 km &agrave; l'est de Wenot.<P>
L'inventaire min&eacute;ral total &agrave; Metates a augment&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on importante au cours de 1995 de 7,6 &agrave; 14,1 millions d'onces d'or &eacute;quivalent.  L'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute;, qui est pr&eacute;vue pour le premier semestre de 1996, d&eacute;terminera le potentiel de ce projet.<P>
L'estimation des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res sur le projet Gross Rosebel est pr&eacute;vue au cours du premier trimestre de 1996.  Cambior exer&ccedil;ait r&eacute;cemment son option pour l'acquisition d'un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50 % dans le projet de son partenaire Golden Star Resources.<P>
Les r&eacute;serves cuprif&egrave;res ont &eacute;galement augment&eacute; de fa&ccedil;on consid&eacute;rable au cours de 1995.  Les r&eacute;serves de cuivre &agrave; La Granja ont plus que tripl&eacute; pour atteindre 725 millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de 0,69 % cuivre repr&eacute;sentant 11 milliards de livres de cuivre <I>in situ</I>.  Les r&eacute;serves cuprif&egrave;res totales &agrave; El Pach&oacute;n ont augment&eacute; de 60 % par rapport &agrave; 1994 pour atteindre 687 millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de 0,63 % cuivre, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi 9,5 milliards de livres de cuivre <I>in situ</I>.<P>
<B>D&eacute;valuation</B><P>
En raison de la diminution des r&eacute;serves mini&egrave;res aux mines Chimo et Silidor et des co&ucirc;ts &eacute;lev&eacute;s de production &agrave; ces mines, la valeur aux livres de ces actifs sera ajust&eacute;e n&eacute;gativement par un montant de 10,7 millions $, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi 7 millions $ apr&egrave;s imp&ocirc;ts aux r&eacute;sultats de 1995.  La fermeture de ces deux mines est pr&eacute;vue pour 1997.<P>
Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.  Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles respectifs de CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 8 janvier 1996<P>

Cambior inc. et Golden Star Resources Ltd. annoncent aujourd'hui que la commission d'enqu&ecirc;te, portant sur les causes de la d&eacute;faillance de la digue survenue &agrave; Omai Gold Mines Limited (OGML), a soumis son rapport final au gouvernement de la Guyana. La principale recommandation du rapport indiquait que, "La commission d'enqu&ecirc;te ne voit aucune raison justifiable &agrave; ce que OGML ne soit pas autoris&eacute; &agrave; reprendre la production.". La commission a fait un certain nombre de recommandations concernant la construction du nouveau parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus, le traitement de l'eau avant son d&eacute;versement dans l'environnement ainsi que la mise en oeuvre de la politique environnementale.<P>

La mine Omai pr&eacute;voit compl&eacute;ter la construction du nouveau parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus et recevoir l'approbation n&eacute;cessaire du gouvernement afin que la production puisse reprendre avant la fin du mois de janvier 1996.<P>

Cambior d&eacute;tient une participation de 65&nbsp;% dans les actions ordinaires de Omai Gold Mines Limited et assume la gestion de l'exploitation de la mine. Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques. Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles de CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

Golden Star est une soci&eacute;t&eacute; oeuvrant dans le domaine de l'exploitation et de la prospection aurif&egrave;re qui d&eacute;tient une participation de 30 % dans les actions ordinaires de la mine d'or Omai en Guyana, l'une des mines d'or les plus importantes en Am&eacute;rique du Sud. Golden Star d&eacute;tient &eacute;galement d'importants int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de prospection d'or et de diamant en Am&eacute;rique du Sud et en Afrique. La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; est inscrite &agrave; la bourse de Toronto (symbole GSC) et &agrave; l'American Stock Exchange (symbole GSR).<P>

<CENTER><H2>Cambior Wins Reclamation Award for Valdez&nbsp;Creek</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Alaska Inc., a subsidiary of Cambior Inc., is proud to have been chosen as a recipient for the 1995 Governor's Award For Reclamation by the State of Alaska based upon a recommendation by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.<P>
A letter received from the Department of Natural Resources, Division of Mining and Water Management (DMWM), states "A review of your mining and reclamation plans, plus field reports and photo documentation by DMWM staff, shows that your mining and reclamation was conducted in a well organized and responsible manner.  The resulting landscape shows your careful attention to minimizing the potential for future erosional degradation, while providing an excellent growth medium for rapid recolonization by local plant species.  In addition, good planning, with consideration of possible future uses of the ground, has resulted in what promises to be excellent fish and wildlife habitat".<P>
Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer, is pleased to receive this award and congratulates the employees of Cambior Alaska, Inc. for their excellent work in the reclamation of the Valdez Creek Placer.<P>

Montreal, November 3, 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior Results for the First Nine Months and the Third Quarter of 1995</H2></CENTER>

Cambior&nbsp;Inc. today announced its results for the first nine months of 1995, with revenues of $284.5&nbsp;million compared to $226&nbsp;million for the same period in 1994. Cash flow from operations amounted to $57.9&nbsp;million ($1.16 per share) compared to $56.4&nbsp;million ($1.15 per share) for the first nine months of 1994. Net earnings were $1.5&nbsp;million ($0.03 per share) compared to a net loss of $4.7&nbsp;million ($0.10 per share) for the same period in 1994.<P>

For the third quarter, revenues were $87.5&nbsp;million compared to $74.8&nbsp;million for the same quarter of 1994. Cash flow from operations amounted to $9.2&nbsp;million ($0.18 per share) compared to $12.1&nbsp;million ($0.25 per share) for the third quarter of 1994, and the net loss totalled $6.3&nbsp;million ($0.12 per share) versus a loss of $15.4&nbsp;million ($0.31 per share).<P>

Revenues increased despite the interruption in the Omai mine operations due to the commencement of commercial production at the Bouchard-H&eacute;bert Mine in January&nbsp;1995. Furthermore, for the first nine months of 1995, the Company's gold hedging program generated an average price of US&nbsp;$414 per ounce, a $30 premium over the average market price. In the third quarter, the Company obtained an average price of US&nbsp;$424 per ounce.<P>

The poor financial results for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year were mainly due to the interruption of mining activities at the Omai Mine, an increase in surface exploration expenses, and higher operating costs and a shortfall in gold production at the Valdez Creek Placer. The Omai Mine incident resulted in a net cost of $2.2&nbsp;million for the quarter. Excluding Valdez Creek, unit operating costs were US&nbsp;$244 per ounce in the third quarter and US&nbsp;$237 per ounce for the year to date.<P>

Cambior's total gold production for the first nine months was 378,672&nbsp;ounces compared to 386,820&nbsp;ounces for the same period in 1994. Third quarter gold production amounted to 111,654&nbsp;ounces compared to 126,780&nbsp;ounces for the same quarter of 1994. The decreases in production were mainly related to the suspension of mining activities at the Omai Mine on August&nbsp;19.

<H3>Valdez Creek Placer</H3>
As planned, operating activities at the Valdez Creek Placer ceased on September&nbsp;30. For the first nine months of 1995, Valdez produced 32,750&nbsp;ounces of gold, less than its target for the year, with higher operating costs. In addition, a sum of US&nbsp;$2.8&nbsp;million representing closure and site rehabilitation costs for the placer were accounted for in the financial results. Operation of the Valdez Creek Placer therefore generated a loss of some US&nbsp;$10.5&nbsp;million for Cambior this year. Due to a provision for site reclamation of US&nbsp;$1.8&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30,&nbsp;1995, the Company's earnings should no longer be affected by the Valdez Creek Placer.

<H3>Omai Mine</H3>
The Omai Mine (Guyana) posted an excellent performance early in the quarter, producing 40,640&nbsp;ounces of gold. The gold production rate has progressed steadily since the beginning of 1995. Unit operating costs have also improved, reaching US&nbsp;$215 per ounce in the third quarter.<P>

On August&nbsp;19, mining activities were interrupted following a break in the main tailings pond dam. Since this incident occurred, OMAI Gold Mines has been working on rehabilitating the site and cleaning up the Omai River, as well as carrying out equipment maintenance.<P>

The Company is making every effort to resume mining operations by the end of 1995. The Government of Guyana's Commission of Inquiry looking into the causes of the dam rupture was officially mandated on October&nbsp;7 to submit a report within two months. Public hearings began on October&nbsp;23, and we expect to receive shortly the authorizations required to build the second tailings pond and resume production.<P>

The suspension of mining activities at Omai will entail a shortfall of about US&nbsp;$2.5&nbsp;million in cash flow from operations for each complete month that operations are suspended. In addition, the costs incurred at the Omai Mine during this period are estimated at between US&nbsp;$1-2&nbsp;million per month. Capital expenditures related to this incident are currently estimated at US&nbsp;$5&nbsp;million.<P>

Mill expansion work was extended by approximately two months due to events at the Omai Mine. We expect to complete the work towards the end of the first quarter of 1996 in order to increase milling capacity from 12,000 to 18,000&nbsp;tonnes per day in the second quarter of 1996.

<H3>Exploration and Development Projects</H3>
During the third quarter, the Company announced substantial increases in mining reserves at the La Granja copper project (Peru) and in mineral inventories at the Metates gold project (Mexico).<P>

The results of the advanced exploration program at La Granja has yielded mining reserves that have more than tripled since we first became involved in 1994, to 600&nbsp;million tonnes grading 0.73%&nbsp;copper representing 9.7&nbsp;billion pounds of copper <I>in situ.</I> The development of this project has further allowed us to establish a presence in Peru and access other interesting exploration projects. The prefeasibility study planned for the first quarter of 1996 will enable us to determine the full value and potential of the project.<P>

At the Metates Project, drilling has confirmed the project's potential, generating a mineral inventory of over 14&nbsp;million ounces of gold equivalent <I>in situ.</I> The ore is refractory in nature, and the Company is conducting intensive metallurgical testing aimed at finding an efficient method of recovering the precious metals and establishing the potential profitability of the project. A prefeasibility study will also be carried out in the first quarter of 1996.<P>

Construction and preproduction continues on schedule at the Grevet Project (Qu&eacute;bec), with start-up planned for the beginning of 1996.<P>

We also expect to obtain the environmental permits for construction of the Carlota Project (Arizona) in the first quarter of 1996, and plan to prepare prefeasibility studies on the Gross Rosebel gold project (Suriname) and the El&nbsp;Pach&oacute;n copper project (Argentina).

<H3>Outlook</H3>
&quot;The Company is making every effort to resume mining operations at the Omai Mine by the end of 1995&quot;, says Louis&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Gignac, Cambior's President and Chief Executive Officer. &quot;We are also confident that our financial performance will improve following the closing of the Valdez Creek Placer, which had a considerable negative impact on the Company's earnings in 1995. In the near term, the expansion of the Omai mill, an increase in production at the Bouchard-H&eacute;bert Mine and the start-up of the Grevet Project will generate increased cash flow from operations. The coming six months will be very active for the Company, with the completion of four prefeasibility studies. Depending on the results of the studies, we will determine the most advantageous strategy for the long-term maximization of shareholder value. Finally, due to the Omai incident, we anticipate a global gold production of about 450,000&nbsp;ounces compared to our initial target of 550,000&nbsp;ounces. For 1996, with production resuming at Omai, we expect to produce over 550,000&nbsp;ounces of gold.&quot;<P>

With the favorable financial position created by cash assets of $116&nbsp;million at September&nbsp;30,&nbsp;1995, the Company plans to continue to vigorously pursue its strategy of growth in the Americas.<P>

Montreal, September 26, 1995<P>

<CENTER><H2>Substantial Increase in Mineral Inventory at Metates</H2>
</CENTER>
Cambior is announcing a substantial increase in mineral inventory at the Metates gold project in Mexico. The mineral inventory estimate has increased to over 430 million tonnes at 1.0 g/t of gold equivalent representing 14.1 million ounces of gold equivalent <I>in situ.</I> Since Cambior began its involvement in this project in 1993, intensive exploration work has taken place and the new estimate is now based on a total diamond drilling of 47,000 meters in 137 holes over a 100 m x 100 m grid pattern. The breakdown of the revised mineral inventory is detailed in the following table:<P>

<TR align=center><Th>Silver</Th><TD>18.6</TD><TD>260 million</TD></TR>
</TABLE><P>

<H3>Strategic Impact</H3>

Mr. Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, &quot;The results of the advanced exploration program have confirmed the immense potential of the project with a mineral inventory of over 14&nbsp;million ounces of gold equivalent. Due to the refractory nature of the ore, we are pursuing extensive metallurgical testing in order to devise an efficient process to economically recover the precious metals and define the feasibility of the project. We expect to complete a prefeasibility study by the beginning of 1996.&quot;<P>



<H3>Geology</H3>

The Metates project consists of one exploration and four exploitation concessions covering an area of over 47&nbsp;square kilometers. Since Cambior became involved in early 1993, an extensive exploration program has been completed and two mineralized zones -- the Main Zone and the North Zone -- have been defined.<P>

The geology of the Metates project area consists of folded sediments intruded by a sill-like igneous body; both of which are unconformably overlain by younger volcanic rocks. Most of the gold and silver mineralization is disseminated or in thin sulfide veinlets consisting of micron-sized gold present within pyrite, sphalerite, galena, and other sulfides, within both the igneous and sedimentary rocks.<P>


<H3>Project</H3>

The Metates project is located in northwestern Durango state, Mexico, about 160&nbsp;kilometers northwest of the city of Durango, in the municipality of Santiago Papaswuiro. The property is situated in rugged terrain, at an altitude ranging from 600 to 2,600&nbsp;meters above sea level, and the development of this project would require important investments in related infrastructures.<P>

Cambior's joint venture agreement with Industrias Luismin, S.A. de C.V. currently provides that Cambior can acquire a 50% interest in the Metates project (i)&nbsp;by spending <NOBR>US $9 million</NOBR> and producing a feasibility study by April 1997, or (ii)&nbsp;by spending <NOBR>US $15 million</NOBR> and producing a feasibility study by April&nbsp;1998. Cambior can increase its interest to 70% if it provides the required project financing at Luismin's option.<P>

Cambior has invested a total of <NOBR>US $9.4 million,</NOBR> as of <NOBR>June 30, 1995,</NOBR> on this advanced project and has budgeted a further <NOBR>US $2.2 million</NOBR> for the remainder of 1995. For the second half of 1995, the focus of additional work will be the continued investigation of various metallurgical processes to extract the gold and silver from the refractory ore. Processes under investigation include bio-oxidation, pressure oxidation and roasting of concentrates, and various chemically-based sulfide oxidation recovery methods. The objective is to define a metallurgical process which results in an economical recovery of gold, silver and other metals.<P>

The prefeasibility study is expected to be completed by early 1996 and would be followed by the completion of a full feasibility study within the following year.<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in North and South America. Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges and on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in the United States under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montreal, September 21, 1995

<CENTER><H2>Substantial Increase in Mining Reserves at La&nbsp;Granja</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Inc. is announcing a substantial increase in mining reserves at the La&nbsp;Granja copper project in Peru. Proven and probable mining reserves have been increased to nearly 600 million tonnes at 0.73%&nbsp;Cu representing <NOBR>9.7 billion lbs</NOBR> of copper <I>in situ.</I><P>

The following table details the change in mining reserves from March 1994 to September 1995.<P>

</TABLE><P>

This reserve update is based on a hundred additional holes, for a total of 36,000&nbsp;meters, which have been drilled at the La&nbsp;Granja project since Cambior's involvement in the project began in 1994.<P>

<H3>Strategic Impact</H3>

Mr. Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer stated, &quot;We are very pleased with the results of this advanced exploration program as the mining reserves have more than tripled since our involvement began in&nbsp;1994. The investment to date of <NOBR>US $14 million</NOBR> has increased the value of the project. Furthermore, the development of this project has helped us establish an important presence in Peru with a number of other promising exploration projects. The prefeasibility study, expected by the beginning of 1996, will further determine the full value and potential of the project. Based on the results of this study, Cambior will determine the strategy that will best enhance long-term shareholders' value relative to this project.&quot;<P>

<H3>Background</H3>

The La&nbsp;Granja project is located about 650&nbsp;kilometers north of Lima, Peru. By road, the project is 217&nbsp;kilometers east of Chiclayo, on the east flank of the Northwestern Cordillera of the Andes at an altitude of 2,000 to 2,700&nbsp;meters above sea level.<P>

The La&nbsp;Granja deposit is a highly altered intrusive formation of late Tertiary age and is comprised of two zones. The most important zone, the primary zone, contains the copper mineral chalcopyrite. The secondary zone contains copper sulfide minerals that might be recovered by lixiviation. Some areas are still open laterally as well as at depth which could lead to further increases in the mining reserves.<P>

In 1994, Cambior secured an option to acquire 100% of the La Granja project from the state-owned mining corporation, Minero Peru&nbsp;S.A. and can exercise this option by funding <NOBR>US $25 million</NOBR> in exploration and development over five years and preparing a feasibility study. In May&nbsp;1995 a payment of <NOBR>US $2 million</NOBR> was made to Minero Peru for the second year option payment. The third option payment of <NOBR>US $4 million</NOBR> will be due in May&nbsp;1996. In the first half of 1995, expenditures on the La&nbsp;Granja project amounted to <NOBR>US $6 million.</NOBR> As of <NOBR>June 30, 1995,</NOBR> Cambior had invested <NOBR>US $14 million</NOBR> on the La&nbsp;Granja project.<P>


<H3>Development Program</H3>

The current program for the second half of this year, includes 14,000&nbsp;meters of drilling (40&nbsp;holes) to better define the boundary of the deposit. These holes will complete the 200m x 200m pattern and infill certain sectors on a tighter grid of 100m x 100m. Ongoing metallurgical testwork confirmed that flotation recoveries for copper should be in the order of 90% and that copper concentrates would be in the 30-32% range. The prefeasibility study is expected to be completed by the beginning of 1996 and the full feasibility study should be completed during the following year. Subsequent to the confirmation of the feasibility study and arrangement of financing, construction could begin in 1997 with commercial production anticipated in&nbsp;1999.<P>

According to a preliminary mine plan, some 70&nbsp;million tonnes grading 1%&nbsp;copper could be mined with a waste/ore ratio of 1.31:1 in the first five years of commercial production. These preliminary results indicate an average annual production of <NOBR>275 million lbs</NOBR> of copper.<P>

Montreal, August 20, 1995
<CENTER><H2>Omai Gold Mines Limited Suspends Mining Operations at The Omai Mine</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Inc. and Golden Star Resources Ltd. announced today that operations at the Omai Mine have been suspended for an indefinite period due to important seepage at the main tailings dam. The extent of the resulting spill and its impact on the surrounding environment and the mine operations are being assessed by a professional team of design and environmental experts in order to quickly contain the spillage and provide a long term solution.<P>

The environmental impact of a spill is the primary concern of Omai Gold Mines Limited. Extensive sampling is being done on the Omai River immediately downstream from the mine, which is showing some contamination. Extensive regular testing is also being done to monitor contamination levels in the Essequibo River some four kilometers away, but no significant contamination has yet been detected.<P>

Omai Gold Mines is monitoring the situation closely, and the inhabitants of the region have been notified as a precautionary measure. The government of Guyana was also advised immediately, and is working closely with Omai Gold Mines to contain the spill and its environmental impact.<P>

Golden Star is a gold exploration and production company which holds a 30% common share equity interest in the Omai gold mine in Guyana, one of the largest operating gold mines in South America. Golden Star also holds gold and diamond exploration interests in South America and Africa. The Company is listed on The Toronto Stock Exchange (under the symbol "GSC") and the American Stock Exchange (under the symbol "GSR").<P>

Cambior is the operator of the Omai Mine and owns 65% of the common shares of Omai Gold Mines Limited. Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in Canada, the United States, Guyana and various other countries of the Americas. Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges and on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in the United States, under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montreal, August 11, 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior Announces its Results for the First Half of 1995, with Higher Revenues and Cash Flow from Operations</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Inc. today released its results for the first half of 1995, which include revenues of $197.0&nbsp;million, a 30% improvement over revenues of $151.2&nbsp;million for the first half of 1994. Cash flow from operations rose 10% to $48.7&nbsp;million ($0.99 per share) compared to $44.3&nbsp;million ($0.90 per share) for the first half of 1994. Net earnings for the period were $7.8&nbsp;million ($0.16 per share) compared to $10.7&nbsp;million ($0.22 per share) for the same period in 1994.<P>

For the second quarter, revenues amounted to $104.2&nbsp;million, up 35% from $77.0&nbsp;million in the same quarter of 1994. Cash flow from operations rose 40% to $27.4 ($0.56 per share) compared to $19.6&nbsp;million ($0.40 per share) in 1994. Net earnings amounted to $2.6&nbsp;million ($0.05 per share) compared to $3.8&nbsp;million ($0.08 per share).<P>

The strong increase in revenues resulted mainly from the start-up of the Bouchard-H&eacute;bert Mine (formerly the Mobrun Mine) last January and the excellent performance of the Omai Mine during the second quarter. The Company also obtained an average price of US&nbsp;$410 per ounce through its hedging program for a premium of US&nbsp;$27 per ounce over the average market price. In the second quarter, the Company realized an average price of US&nbsp;$417 per ounce.<P>

The decline in net earnings is mainly attributable to an increase of $4.3&nbsp;million in exploration expenses following the abandonment of the Santa Rosa property in Peru; exploration expenses incurred on this property were previously capitalized, but have now been transferred to surface exploration expenses. This transfer had no impact on cash flow from operations for the quarter.<P>

Unit operating costs, excluding Valdez Creek, have improved steadily since the beginning of the year, falling to US&nbsp;$228 per ounce in the second quarter from US&nbsp;$241 per ounce in the first quarter.<P>

Cambior's total gold production for the first half of 1995 was 267,018&nbsp;ounces compared to 260,040&nbsp;ounces for the first half of 1994. The excellent performance of the Omai Mine helped generate an overall second quarter gold production of 140,565&nbsp;ounces, 8% higher than for the same quarter of 1994. The Sleeping Giant Mine posted record production for the quarter, as well as very low production costs (US&nbsp;$145/ounce) due to a substantially higher head grade.<P>

According to <NOBR>Louis P. Gignac,</NOBR> President and Chief Executive Officer, "Improved mine productivity at the Omai and Doyon mines had a positive impact on operating profits. The Omai Mine yielded record production in the second quarter and the lowest production cost (US&nbsp;$220/ounce) since mining began in 1993, due to higher tonnage and grade milled. The mining sequence for the Main Zone at the Doyon Mine returned to normal, and second quarter operating costs were US&nbsp;$196 per ounce due to better grades milled and improved recovery. Given the excellent operating results for the first half of the year, we are confident that we will achieve our targets for the year. Despite the higher exploration expenses arising from the abandonment of the Santa Rosa property, we are adhering to our original 1995 exploration budget of $16&nbsp;million. Finally, the imminent shutdown of the Valdez Creek Placer will have a positive impact on the Company's earnings."<P>

<H2>Outlook</H2>
Mill expansion work at the Omai Mine (Guyana) and construction and preproduction work at the Grevet Project (Quebec) continue on schedule, with start-up planned for the first quarter of 1996. Prefeasibility studies on the Metates (Mexico) and Gross Rosebel (Suriname) gold projects and the La Granja (Peru) and El Pach&oacute;n (Argentina) copper projects should be completed by the beginning of 1996. Drilling at the Metates project has now ended, and data compilation is now underway. The exercise of the June&nbsp;30 warrants (CBJ.WT) generated $40&nbsp;million in cash, strengthening Cambior's financial position and enabling it to aggressively pursue its growth objectives in the Americas.<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in North and South America. Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges and on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in the United States under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

</H2>
<FONT SIZE=4>For immediate Release</FONT><p><br></CENTER>
Montreal, August 4, 1995<P>

Cambior Inc. (&quot;Cambior&quot;) is pleased to make the following announcement:

<CENTER><H2>Offer to Acquire all of the Outstanding Common Shares
of Audrey Resources Inc. (&quot;Audrey&quot;)</H2></CENTER>

Cambior will launch no later than <NOBR>September 1st, 1995</NOBR> an offer to acquire (the &quot;Offer&quot;) all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Audrey (excluding the common shares of Audrey owned at the date thereof by Cambior) at a price of CDN. $1.40 per share, payable at the option of the holder, (i)&nbsp;in cash or (ii)&nbsp;in common shares of Cambior pursuant to an exchange ratio to be fixed by Cambior on the day of the launching of the Offer.  Cambior currently owns 34,121,998&nbsp;common shares of Audrey or 75.03% of the total number of outstanding common shares of Audrey.  No fractional common shares of Cambior will be issued.<P>

A copy of the <A HREF="PressEn95-08-04b.html">Offer and the Offering Circular</A> will be mailed to all registered holders of Audrey common shares no later than <NOBR>September 1st, 1995.</NOBR><P>

The Offer is conditional upon, among other things, not less than 90% of the outstanding common shares of Audrey (including any common shares of Audrey issued prior to the expiry of the Offer pursuant to the exercise of outstanding options to purchase common shares of Audrey but excluding common shares of Audrey owned at the date hereof by Cambior) being validly deposited and not withdrawn prior to the expiry of the Offer.<P>

The complete text of the conditions to the Offer is attached to this press release.<P>

The purpose of the Offer is to enable Cambior to acquire all of the common shares of Audrey not currently owned by Cambior in order to permit the full integration of Audrey's activities with those of Cambior.<P>

This transaction will allow the minority shareholders of Audrey to divest their holdings in a relatively illiquid, sparsely traded stock at a premium to the current market price.<P>

Cambior intends, if the Offer is successful, to pursue commercial production at the Bouchard-H&eacute;bert Mine with a view to realizing its full potential.  Cambior is a major North American gold producer with operating and exploration activities in Canada, the United States, Guyana and various other countries in the Americas.  Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges and on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in the United States, under the symbols CBJ and CBJ.WTA.<P>

In connection with the Offer, Coopers & Lybrand/Lalibert&eacute; Lanct&ocirc;t has been retained by Cambior to provide an independent valuation of the common shares of Audrey.<P>

Audrey's Board of Directors is expected to meet on <NOBR>August 9, 1995</NOBR> to commence its review of the Offer.<P>

The Offer is subject to applicable regulatory approvals and will be made only by means of a takeover bid circular.<P>


<H3>Financial Position</H3>

For the three-month period ended <NOBR>March 31, 1995,</NOBR> Audrey realized net earnings of $1.4&nbsp;million, or $0.03&nbsp;per share.  Results for the quarter ended June 30, 1995 will be released following the Audrey Board of Directors' meeting of August 9, 1995.<P>

Montreal, May 11, 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior Announces Its First Quarter Results</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Inc. today announced its first quarter results with revenues of $92.7&nbsp;million, a 25% increase compared to $74.2&nbsp;million for the first quarter of 1994. The increase was mainly due to the commencement of commercial production at the Mobrun Mine in January, which generated gross revenues of $16.2&nbsp;million.  Furthermore, Cambior's successful gold hedging program generated an average gold selling price of US&nbsp;$402 per ounce, US&nbsp;$23 per ounce above the market price for the first quarter of 1995.<P>

Net earnings for the first quarter were $5.2&nbsp;million ($0.11 per share) compared to $6.9&nbsp;million ($0.14 per share) for the same quarter of 1994.  The decline in net earnings was attributable to higher unit operating costs at the Doyon and other Canadian mines as well as the Valdez Creek Placer and higher exploration expenses.  Cash flow from operations was $21.3&nbsp;million ($0.44 per share) compared to $24.6&nbsp;million ($0.50 per share) for the first quarter of 1994.<P>

Gold production was slightly lower at 126,452&nbsp;ounces compared to 130,369&nbsp;ounces for the first quarter of 1994.  This decrease resulted mainly from the suspension of production activities at the Mouska Mine to allow for shaft deepening work, and a lower milled grade at the Doyon Mine due to the mining sequence.<P>

Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cambior, stated that &quot;we are pleased with our first quarter results, particularly with the progress of the Omai Mine, which reduced  operating costs by 5% to US&nbsp;$234 in the  first quarter  compared to an  average of US&nbsp;$244 for the full year 1994.  This reduction was principally due to a higher grade and tonnage milled and improved mill recovery.  The drilling program completed in the Wenot pit at Omai resulted in the identification of additional mining reserves of 9&nbsp;million tonnes grading <NOBR>1.6 g Au/t</NOBR> containing 446,000&nbsp;ounces of gold <I>in situ</I> relative to mining reserves at <NOBR>December 31, 1994.</NOBR>  The Wenot deposit remains open laterally, and the partners are very hopeful about identifying additional mining reserves on the Omai property.  Meanwhile, the Mobrun polymetallic mine entered into commercial production at the beginning of the year, on time and on budget, and will be an excellent source of earnings and cash flow.&quot;<P>

The Omai mill expansion, which began in the first quarter of 1995, is progressing on schedule.  Foundation work is underway for the generators and the new ore reclaim tunnel and the erection of the CIP (carbon in pulp) and leaching tanks is 50% complete.<P>

The development of the Grevet zinc project is also on schedule, and commercial production should begin in early 1996. The preliminary environmental impact study for the Carlota copper project was filed for public review in February, and we expect to receive the final permits in the second half of 1995, following which construction work will begin.<P>

Investments for the year to date total $52&nbsp;million, including $9&nbsp;million on advanced exploration projects. We expect to finalize prefeasibility studies for the Metates (gold), Gross Rosebel (gold), La Granja (copper) and El Pach&oacute;n (copper) projects by the end of 1995.<P>

Cambior's cash assets of $142.7&nbsp;million as at <NOBR>March 31, 1995</NOBR> provide the Company with an excellent base from which to vigorously pursue its growth strategy in the Americas.  &quot;With the progress achieved at the Omai Mine and a greater contribution from the Doyon Mine, we are confident that we can achieve our 1995 production target,&quot; concluded Mr.&nbsp;Gignac.<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in Canada, the United States, Guyana and various other countries of the Americas. Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges and on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in the United States, under the symbols CBJ, CBJ.WT and CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montreal, May 10, 1995
<CENTER><H2>Gold Reserves at the Omai Mine Increase by 446,000&nbsp;Ounces</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Inc. and Golden Star Resources Ltd. are pleased to announce an increase in proven and probable mining reserves of 9&nbsp;million tonnes grading <NOBR>1.6 g Au/t,</NOBR> representing 446,000&nbsp;ounces of gold <I>in situ.</I> This gain is exclusively the result of the definition drilling program carried out in the eastern part of the Wenot pit. The new reserve estimate is based on nearly 13,000&nbsp;meters of drilling, including 8,300&nbsp;meters completed during the first quarter of&nbsp;1995.<P>

As the table below shows, mining reserves at <NOBR>March 31, 1995</NOBR> are 13% higher than those dated <NOBR>December 31, 1994,</NOBR> and 62% higher than the feasibility study figures. Including gold produced by the mill since commercial production began in January 1993, the Omai deposit contains nearly 3.6&nbsp;million ounces of gold, representing a substantial increase since&nbsp;1990.<P>

Montreal, February 16, 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior Announces Record Gold Production and Revenues for&nbsp;1994</H2></CENTER>

Total revenue rose to $306&nbsp;million in 1994, up 9% relative to 1993. Gold production also reached a record level at 522,000&nbsp;ounces. Gold production has steadily increased since the Company was created in&nbsp;1986.<P>

Cash flow from operations amounted to $73&nbsp;million, comparable to 1993 figures. Cash flow per share was $1.49 compared to $1.76 in 1993. The per share dilution resulted from an increase in the number of shares outstanding following share offerings completed in&nbsp;1993.<P>

Net earnings were $2.5&nbsp;million or $0.05 per share in 1994 compared to $15&nbsp;million or $0.36 per share in 1993. The drop in earnings resulted from the $16.7&nbsp;million writedown of mining assets at the Valdez Creek Placer in the third quarter of 1994. Earnings before writedown were $19.2&nbsp;million ($0.39 per share), a 28% increase over 1993. Net earnings for the fourth quarter more than tripled relative to same quarter in 1993 to $7.1&nbsp;million or $0.15 per share.

<H3>Comments</H3>

The growth in revenue is attributable to higher gold production from the Omai Mine in Guyana, improved gold prices and the favorable impact of a weak Canadian dollar.<P>

According to Louis P. Gignac, President and Chief Executive Officer, &quot;the fourth quarter results reflect the better performance of our Doyon and Omai mines. The temporary ground control problems encountered in the West Zone of the Doyon Mine in the third quarter have been addressed, and production at the mine has returned to normal. The Company expects 1995 to be another record year for gold production, generating over 550,000&nbsp;ounces. The Omai Mine should produce 250,000&nbsp;ounces of gold, while our share of production from the Canadian mines will account for another 250,000&nbsp;ounces. The Valdez Creek Placer should produce 50,000&nbsp;ounces in 1995 and the mining activities at the placer will cease as planned during the year.&quot;<P>

As at December 31, 1994, gold reserves had been completely renewed relative to 1993, totalling 3.9&nbsp;million ounces <I>in situ.</I> If we were to add the gold contained in the Mobrun mining reserves and in Cambior's share of the possible mining reserves at the Doyon Mine, gold reserves would total 5&nbsp;million ounces, representing a 13% increase over 1993 figures.<P>

For the seventh consecutive year, the Company received an average gold selling price that was higher than the market price, thanks to its revenue protection policy. In 1994, Cambior realized an average price of Cdn&nbsp;$539 per ounce, Cdn&nbsp;$15 per ounce higher that the average market price for the year. Through its existing commitments on the futures markets, Cambior will obtain a minimum price of US&nbsp;$407 per ounce for half its 1995 gold production.<P>

In 1995, Cambior expects to invest $300&nbsp;million in properties in the construction phase, currently producing assets and advanced exploration projects, in order to maintain its rate of growth. These investments will consist mainly of the expansion of the Omai mill ($69&nbsp;million), preproduction development and construction of the Grevet ($65&nbsp;million) and Carlota ($87&nbsp;million) projects, and exploration and development of advanced projects ($39&nbsp;million), with the remaining $40&nbsp;million going to extend the shafts at the Doyon, Mouska and Sleeping Giant mines and other investments required at our producing mines.<P>

Finally, just this week, Cambior finalized a <NOBR>US $225 million</NOBR> credit facility with a banking syndicate. &quot;This credit facility has arrived at an opportune moment, and reflects Cambior's growth and borrowing capacity. Combined with our cash assets, which totalled $134&nbsp;million at <NOBR>December 31, 1994,</NOBR> this credit facility enables us to meet all our financing needs for 1995 and provides an excellent financial basis for the development of our future projects in the Americas,&quot; states <NOBR>Louis P. Gignac.</NOBR><P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in Canada, the United States, Guyana and various other countries in the Americas. Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges and on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in the United States, under the symbols CBJ, CBJ.WT and CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montreal, February 9, 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior Announces its 1994 Production Results</H2></CENTER>

Cambior is pleased to announce that gold production for 1994 totalled 522,077&nbsp;ounces compared to 518,083&nbsp;ounces the previous year. The increase was due mainly to higher contributions from the Omai and Sleeping Giant mines as well as the Valdez Creek Placer, and was achieved despite the closure of the Beauchemin and B&eacute;liveau mines in 1993 due to the depletion of mining reserves.<P>

A breakdown of gold production by division and Cambior's share of niobium pentoxide production for 1994 and 1993 is as follows:<P>

<P>


Having now completed one full year of production at a steady milling rate of 12,800&nbsp;tonnes per day, the Omai Mine saw production increase 21% to 250,642&nbsp;ounces. Gold production from our 50% interest in the Doyon Mine declined slightly to 116,931&nbsp;ounces in 1994 compared to 126,514&nbsp;ounces in 1993, due to temporary ground control problems encountered in the Main Zone during the third quarter of 1994. These problems were controlled in the fourth quarter of the year, and production at the Doyon Mine has returned to normal.<P>

<H3>Outlook for 1995</H3>

Cambior expects to produce more than 550,000&nbsp;ounces of gold in 1995. The increase in production is mainly attributable to a higher contribution from the Chimo Mine, which will see a full year of production this year. The Company also began commercial production at the Mobrun Mine in January&nbsp;1995. The scheduled 1995 production of metals in concentrate from the Mobrun Mine is 25,800&nbsp;tonnes of zinc, 4,600&nbsp;tonnes of copper, 20,800&nbsp;ounces of gold and 336,900&nbsp;ounces of silver.<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in Canada, the United States, Guyana and various other countries in the Americas. Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges and on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in the United States, under the symbols CBJ, CBJ.WT and CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montreal and Denver, February 6, 1995

<CENTER><H2>Golden Star and Cambior Announce Encouraging Results of the 1994 Program at Gross Rosebel Gold Prospect</H2></CENTER>

Golden Star and Cambior have completed an encouraging exploration program in 1994 at the Gross Rosebel Right of Exploration in Suriname, South America. The Gross Rosebel prospect covers 17,000&nbsp;hectares and is located 80&nbsp;km south of the capital, Paramaribo. Golden Star has granted Cambior an option to earn a 50% interest in Golden Star's interests in the property, subject to Cambior, amongst other things, funding <NOBR>US $6 million</NOBR> on the project by <NOBR>June 30, 1996.</NOBR><P>

The joint venture partners are most pleased with the results of the 1994 exploration work and plan a <NOBR>US $3.7 million</NOBR> program for 1995. The objective is to pursue definition and exploration drilling to finalize mining reserves for Gross Rosebel in&nbsp;1995.<P>

Gross Rosebel is regarded as two contiguous areas known as the northern and southern blocks. Results from the 1994 work are as follows:<P>

Northern Block - Gold mineralization occurs within three quartz carbonate vein sets related to folding and shearing. Significant gold concentrations occur along the contact of metasediments and metavolcanics.<P>

In 1994, trenching over the Pay Caro, East Pay Caro, Koolhoven and &quot;J&quot; zones returned broad anomalous gold values. Koolhoven trench assays include 19.4&nbsp;meters at 1.5&nbsp;g/t, 26.2&nbsp;meters at 1.8&nbsp;g/t, 12.1&nbsp;meters at 2.4&nbsp;g/t and 10.8&nbsp;meters at 1.3&nbsp;g/t. A similar but separate zone of mineralization was identified from a trench about 300&nbsp;meters north, which included 20.2&nbsp;meters at 1.6&nbsp;g/t and 27.6&nbsp;meters at 1.2&nbsp;g/t. A narrower zone of gold mineralization was encountered in a trench in the &quot;J&quot; zone exposing 11&nbsp;meters at 18.5&nbsp;g/t.<P>

The drilling program in 1994 focused on two of the five identified gold zones, the Pay Caro and East Pay Caro zones.<P>

<B>Pay Caro.</B> At Pay Caro, fifty drill holes tested an 800&nbsp;meter part of the 1,200 x 110&nbsp;meter gold anomaly. The holes were collared on 100&nbsp;meter cross sections at approximately 25&nbsp;meter spacing. Four sections included the following intersections:<P>

Montreal, January 23, 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior's Board of Directors Approves the Final Investment Required to Put the Grevet Project into Production</H2></CENTER>

The Board of Directors of Cambior Inc. has approved an investment of $62&nbsp;million to complete the Grevet preproduction program, which started last June. Cambior is the sole owner of the Grevet polymetallic project, located near the town of Lebel-sur-Qu&eacute;villon in northwestern Quebec.<P>

In June&nbsp;1994, the Board of Directors approved the feasibility study on the Grevet Project involving an investment of $80&nbsp;million, based on the results of the underground exploration program. At that time, the Board approved an initial $18&nbsp;million portion of the investment to complete the work required during the second half of 1994. This work consisted of completing shaft sinking and continuing to develop the underground and surface infrastructures. Approval of the remaining $62&nbsp;million was subject to the receipt of environmental permits, trends in the zinc price and government financial assistance.<P>

Since then, the Company has received the environmental permits and is currently in discussion with the federal and provincial governments regarding possible subsidies for the public infrastructures related to the project. The Company is also pleased to note that the zinc market has improved since the third quarter of 1994, as have copper prices since the beginning of&nbsp;1994.<P>

The work required to complete the preproduction program consists of developing the underground infrastructures, preparing stopes, building surface facilities including a 2,500&nbsp;tonne per day concentrator, and purchasing mining equipment. The work will be completed in December&nbsp;1995 and commercial production should begin in the first quarter of 1996.<P>

Annual production is expected to average 134,000&nbsp;tonnes of zinc concentrate grading 54% and 12,700&nbsp;tonnes of copper concentrate grading 26%. Recoveries are estimated at 95% for the zinc and 81% for the copper.<P>

Probable and possible mineable reserves are estimated at 10,965,000&nbsp;tonnes at a grade of 8.5%&nbsp;Zn, 0.45%&nbsp;Cu, <NOBR>35 g Ag/t</NOBR> and <NOBR>0.09 g Au/t,</NOBR> for a 12-year mine life. Cambior plans to employ about 300&nbsp;people during the construction period and 200&nbsp;people once the mine enters into commercial production.<P>

Cambior is a major gold producer with operating and exploration activities in Canada, the United States, Guyana and various other countries in the Americas. Cambior's shares and warrants are listed on the Montreal and Toronto stock exchanges and on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX) in the United States, under the symbols CBJ, CBJ.WT and CBJ.WTA.<P>

REPORT OF THE PROCESS REVIEW COMMITTEE<P>
Acting on behalf of the Government of Guyana, the Guyana Geology & Mines Commission (GGMC) selected a Process Review Committee to review the gold processing and effluent management systems of Omai Gold Mines Limited (OGML), and to report back to GGMC.  The report of the Committee will form part of the Government's submission to a Commission of Inquiry looking into an unplanned discharge of cyanide-bearing slurry from the OGML tailing dam.<P>
Terms of reference for the Committee as established by GGMC are to assess the gold processing and effluent management systems at OGML, and among other things to:<p>
<DL><DD>1) examine the feasibility of utilizing alternatives to the continued use of cyanide for processing the gold ores at Omai,<p>
<DD>2) evaluate the on-line destruction of cyanide in the waste stream of the processing plant before it is fed to a disposal area,<p>
<DD>3) explore the utilization of a system to result in zero discharge of cyanide from the operations,<P>
<DD>4) pronounce on the effective storage of waste and return of solids to the environment, and<p>
<DD>5) examine the planned expansion program and its implications for the processing of the ore, management of the effluent and effects on the environment.</DL><p>
          To accomplish these tasks, GGMC chose the following Committee:<P>

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<P>
          The Process Review Committee met in Georgetown, Guyana and at the Omai mine site during the week of October 23, 1995.  No oral or written submissions were made to the Committee during that time.<P>
          The Committee found that the Omai mine and plant can be reopened as soon as the No. 2 tailing pond is completed and the hydrogen peroxide system is available for use.  The Committee also found that technical requirements for tailing impoundment and effluent can be met, but that true zero discharge cannot be attained because of the natural imbalance between precipitation and evaporation.  Further, the Committee found that the gravity/CIP system in use at Omai is appropriate, and that no leaching agent other than cyanide can be recommended.  The expansion program in progress at Omai was found to be workable and consistent with safe, environmentally sound operation.  Finally, the Committee recognized that, although Omai's impoundment and disposal plans are technically sound, public concerns about storage of cyanide-bearing wastes in an impoundment justify further study of slurry-based cyanide destruction systems.<P>
          To implement its findings, the Committee made four recommendations:<P>
<DL><DD>1)That Omai be permitted to resume production without undue delay,<P>
<DD>2)That cyanide destruction systems capable of treating tailings slurry be evaluated for technical efficacy, site capability, and capital and operating costs,<P>
<DD>3)That the Government and OGML jointly review their protocols for environmental monitoring and reporting, and<P>
<DD>4)That the Government and OGML consult and cooperate on public education and means to build public understanding.</DL><BR>
          The Committee is now contacting potential consultants and engineers qualified to undertake the work recommended in (2) above, and will make recommendations on this subject to GGMC at a later date.<P>

VIII.   RECOMMENDATIONS<P>
          To implement its findings, the Committee makes the following recommendations:<P>
<DL><DD>1) THAT OMAI BE PERMITTED TO RESUME PRODUCTION WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY - - The Committee is aware that there are conditions precedent to Omai's resumption of operations; several of these are cited in this Report.  The Committee recognizes that the work of the Dam Committee may delay work on the No. 2 tailing dam, and that is as it should be.  Recommendation (1) is being made, however, in the hope that in the time available before restart, only substantive matters be considered as reasons for additional delay.<P>
<DD>2) THAT CYANIDE DESTRUCTION SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF TREATING TAILINGS SLURRY BE EVALUATED FOR TECHNICAL EFFICACY, SITE CAPABILITY, AND CAPITAL AND OPERATING COSTS - - In the view of the Committee, a properly designed, built and operated impoundment, coupled with positive
cyanide destruction by means of hydrogen peroxide and diffusion of effluent into the Essequibo River constitutes an adequately safe system.  The Committee recognizes, however, that the recent accident raises concern about storage of tailings and water which, if released, would not meet the standards for disposal.  To implement this recommendation, the Committee favors a two-step approach.  As the first step, a consultant unaffiliated with any vendor would be asked to rank the available technologies (including INCO, AVR and the FMC Caro's acid process) according to technical efficacy.  The consultant would also be asked to review Omai's operating parameters, including ore and water chemistry and discharge requirements, and then to modify his technical ranking according to Omai's specific conditions and requirements.  In the second step, an engineering company would be asked to make a preliminary capital and operating cost estimate for installation of the best choice at Omai.  The Committee is <b>not</b> suggesting here
that any such installation be made mandatory, but only that it be considered in any future discussions between the Government and OGML.  Please note that the Committee is now looking into possible consultants and engineers, and will convey any information obtained to GGMC.<P>
<DD>3) THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND OGML JOINTLY REVIEW THEIR PROTOCOLS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND REPORTING - - The Committee did not observe any serious instances of inadequacy in this respect, but in light of the recent accident and the obvious need to gain and maintain public support, such an effort could be quite helpful.  In the experience of certain Committee members, the establishment of formal "document trails" is especially important in avoiding mistakes, misunderstandings and confusion.<P>
<DD>4) THAT THE GOVERNMENT AND OGML CONSULT AND COOPERATE ON PUBLIC EDUCATION AND MEANS TO BUILD PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING - -  This probably should go without saying, but experience teaches that the best of intentions can sometimes be frustrated through lack of close coordination.  The Committee, being technical in nature, is not expert in matters of public education <I>per se</I>.<P></DL><BR>

<B>2.0 CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FAILURE</B><BR>
<I><B>2.1 Internal dam configuration</B></I><BR>
     A simplified explanation of the internal features of the dam is necessary for a proper understanding of the discussions that follow.  The attached Figure 1 illustrates the internal zones of fill material as indicated on design drawings.  These include:<p>
<UL>
<LI>a sloping core constructed of low-permeability, clayey <I>saprolite</I> soils.  The purpose of the core is to limit and control seepage through the dam.<p>
<LI>a thin zone of coarse-rock "riprap" along the <I>upstream</I> side of the core to protect it from wave and rainfall erosion.<p>
<LI>a primary zone of compacted rockfill that comprises the main structural body of the dam.<p>
<LI>a thin zone of filter sand whose intent is to prevent fine soil particles in the core fill from migrating into and through the voids between the coarse rockfill fragments under the influence of dam seepage.<p>
</UL>
Uncompacted mine waste is contiguous with the compacted rockfill zone on its <I>downstream</I> side.  This zone is of secondary structural importance to the dam itself, serving primarily as a convenient waste dump area for overburden materials excavated from the pit.<p>
     The dam was raised in stages, a common tailings dam construction practice, with fill placement beginning in early 1992 and proceeding intermittently thereafter.  No core fill was placed during the last 3 months prior to the failure.  The initial Stage 1A, or <I>starter dyke</I>, was constructed of clayey saprolite soils, with subsequent stages also incorporating rockfill, and filter sand zones as shown on Figure 1.<p>
     Prior to construction of the starter dyke it was necessary to confine the flow of Captain Mann Creek through the foundation area within a corrugated steel diversion conduit to allow the initial fill to be placed in dry conditions.  The conduit was incorporatd into the starter dyke fill, and after serving its temporary purpose the portion indicated on Figure 1 was filled with a cement grout "plug".  Except for this grouted section, the conduit was left open over its remaining length.
<I><B><P>

2.2 Impoundment operation</B></I><BR>
     Tailings are the barren particles of finely ground ore that remain after extraction of the valuable minerals in the mill process.  During operation, tailings slurry was discharged from a pipeline at the rear of the <I>impoundment</I>, with the settled tailings forming a delta sloping gently toward the dam and with the overlying (supematant) water accumulating directly against it.  Within much of the impoundment basin, the finest fraction of the tailings, or <I>slimes</I>, settled from suspension to form a near-horizontal submerged surface about 15m below the water level at the time of failure.  Some of  this water was pumped to the mill for recycle by a floating-barge decant system located adjacent to the dam at the southwest corner of the impoundment.<p>
     As shown on Figure 1, the dam crest was at el. 534m and the water level at el. 529.6m at the time of failure.  The current water level is about el. 517m, with the slimes surface about 1-2m below the water level at approximately el. 515m.  Thus, virtually all of the impounded water was lost in the failure.  In November, 1994 the slimes surface was at el. 511m, and this level would have increased during tailings deposition over the ensuing 9 months.  This indicates that a comparatively small volume of tailings solids was released.<P>
<B><I>2.3 Failure events</I></B><BR>
     Failure of a dam is usually understood to mean breach of the dam embankment, but this did not happen at Omai.  Rather, failure in this case resulted from complete loss of dam core integrity, where here we define "failure" as uncontrolled release of the reservoir.<p>
     The crest of the dam was observed on the afternoon of Saturday, August 19, and at that time no distress was apparent.  Routine water quality monitoring of the Omai River on August 15 had detected no elevated cyanide levels.<p>
     At about midnight on August 19 substantial flows across a mine haul road were observed near the south end of the main dam.  About one hour later the dam crest was inspected by flashlight, and longitudinal cracking was observed with a few centimetres of horizontal width and vertical offset.  At the same time large flows issuing from the
north end of the dam were also noted.  The elevations of these discharges were later determined to be 512m at the south end and 509.5 at the north, suggesting that discharge may have initiated at the north end of the dam.<p>
     The combined outflows were substantial, with peak discharge reported to have been on the order of 30 m3/s.  By noon of August 22, the impoundment water level had dropped 12m to el. 518, resulting in an average drawdown of 15cm/hr over an 84-hr period and with reported maximum drawdown at about twice this rate.<P>
<I><B>2.4 Emergency response</B></I><BR>
     By August 20, OGML had evacuated personnel and equipment from the Fennell Pit and completed a diversion ditch to intercept flow from the south end of the dam and direct it into the pit for containment.  At this time discharge from the north end of the dam into the Omai River remained uncontrolled.  By August 24 a "cofferdam" structure to contain this discharge was completed near the north end of the dam by dumping rockfill and saprolite materials across the discharge channel.  Water rose behind this structure to el. 514m, impounding water internally within the rockfill zone of the main dam, where it was discharged at the south end of the dam into the diversion ditch, and from there to the Fennell pit.<p>
     These conditions remain in effect as of the date of this report.  Water is currently impounded behind the cofferdam to about el. 512m, which implies that the rockfill zone within the main dam is saturated to this elevation, a level about 5m lower than the current water surface within the tailings impoundment itself.<P>
<B>3.0 FAILURE MECHANISM</B><BR>
<I><B>3.1 Failure mode screening</B></I><BR>
     We have adopted a systematic approach to evaluation of failure causation hypotheses in an attempt to avoid overlooking any plausible mechanisms.  This has consisted of first compiling potentially applicable failure modes from known causes of other tailings dam failures.  These candidate failure modes have then been screened to eliminate those that are either unsupported or precluded by available evidence
and/or analyses.  Those causes considered as possible initiators of the failure and currently ruled out on this basis include:<p>
<UL>
<LI>hydrologic (flood) overtopping<p>
<LI>seismic activity, including mine blasting<p>
<LI>upstream sliding due to insufficient shear strength of foundation and/or fill materials<p>
<LI> <I>.internal erosion</I> within the dam foundation or at the fill/foundation contact<p>
<LI>mine subsidence or pit slope instability<p>
</UL>
These failure modes will be revisited if further information indicates the need to do so.<P>
<I><B>3.2 Proximate cause of failure</B></I><BR>
     It is our current judgement that failure of the dam was caused by massive loss of core integrity resulting from internal erosion of the dam fill, a process also known as <I>piping</I>.  Internal erosion in this context means simply that finer particles from one soil moved freely under the influence of seepage forces into and through the interstitial voids of adjacent coarser soil due to excessive disparity between particle sizes of the two soils.<p>
     We believe this process began at the interface shown on Figure 1 between the filter sand and the compacted rockfill.  Loss of filter sand into the rockfill left the overlying saprolite core material unsupported and subject to the development of cavities, softened zones, and cracks as its particles too moved into the rockfill.  Cavity development in the core fill is likely to have propagated undetected for some period of time until reaching the reservoir at and above the slimes level.  The final breakthrough of these cavities formed "pipes," or tunnels, in the core fill at multiple locations that allowed uncontrolled flow of water into and then longitudinally through the rockfill zone of the dam.  These features are now manifested by sinkholes on the upstream slope of the dam, as core fill and riprap have subsided into the open voids.<p>
     Longitudinal core cracking now evident on the crest of the dam is interpreted as an effect, not a cause, of this process.  Core tension cracks observed on the crest during the first hours of the failure appear to have been produced by loss of filter sand
related to elevated internal water levels within the rockfill zone, and resulting core deformations.  Additional widening and vertical downdrop of up to 1.5m across these cracks at some locations developed during the days and weeks subsequent to the failure in a manner consistent with continuing subsidence of highly disturbed and softened areas or cavities within the fill.<p>
     There are believed to be two primary physical defects in the dam that allowed this process to occur, one related to <I>filter incompatibility</I> between the sand and rockfill zones, and another involving the diversion conduit.  Both were produced by known or suspected deficiencies in design, construction, or construction inspection, either singularly or in combination.  Moreover, defects related to filter incompatibility and the diversion conduit may not be mutually exclusive, and may have interacted in complementary ways not yet fully understood.<P>
<I><B>3.3 Filter incompatibility</B></I><BR>
     Internal erosion between zones of adjacent soils is prevented by controlling their particle size distributions (or <I>gradations</I>) according to filter design criteria developed over 50 years ago and little changed since then.  These filter criteria were applied in the dam design, which limited the gradation of the rockfill directly adjacent to the filter sand.  No dimensions or nomenclature for this finer rockfill zone were provided, and it is designated here as the "rockfill transition zone".<p>
     Figure 2 shows the specified particle size distributions (or <I>gradation</I>) for the sand and rockfill, along with the coarse limit restriction for the transition rockfill.  The transition rockfill gradation is indicated to have been determined from filter criteria using a media d85 particle size for the sand of 0.85mm.  However, the specified gradation envelope for the sand on Figure 2 allows for d85 as low as 0.5mm, material finer than median value, and filter criteria would not be satisfied for sand at the fine limit of its specification.<p>
     Current design practice also recognizes that coarse material is prone to particle-size segregation during construction that has often allowed internal erosion to occur even when other filter design criteria have been satisfied.  According to supplemental
criteria that address this problem, the transition zone rockfill should not have exceeded a maximum specified particle size of about 25-50mm, whereas Figure 2 allows for fragments as large as 600mm.  Therefore, the transition zone rockfill as specified would have been highly susceptible to particle size segregation and consequent filter incompatibility.<p>
     These design deficiencies notwithstanding, it is apparent that the transition zone rockfill was never included in the dam during construction in any complete or systematic way.  Even if properly designed, meticulous adherence to transition rockfill gradation specifications at each and every location within the dam would have been mandatory to ensure its safety against internal erosion.  By contrast, construction documentation and existing conditions on the dam crest indicate that pit-run rockfill of essentially unrestricted gradation was placed directly against the filter sand, without adequate construction control of this critical feature.<p>
     Rockfill placement was supervised during construction of the initial stages of the dam and is believed to have been inspected or observed by several geotechnical engineers on various occasions.  Such gross disparity of particle sizes between the filter sand and adjacent rockfill as can be currently seen on the dam crest should have been visually evident to any experienced geotechnical engineer, along with equally clear implications for filter incompatibility between the two materials.  However, we have been provided with no information to indicate that any such supervision, inspection, or observation sufficiently recognized the severity of this condition, adequately warned of its potential consequences, or undertook measures necessary to correct it.<p>
     In basic terms then, the rockfill adjacent to the filter sand was simply too coarse to prevent the sand from washing into and through it, and both potential and actual problems this produced appear to have gone unrecognized or uncorrected throughout the sequence of design and construction until the failure occurred.<P>
<I><B>3.4 Diversion conduit</B></I><BR>
     The pattern, nature, and distribution of surficial damage provides circumstantial evidence to suggest that the corrugated steel diversion conduit was associated with
internal erosion processes.  Furthermore, problems related to conduits in general have been responsible for a significant proportion of earth dam and tailings dam failures, and in particular the use of unencased corrugated metal culverts through dam cores is considered bad practice.<p>
     Since the remaining slimes behind the dam and saturation levels within it are likely to preclude any excavation or direct inspection of the conduit, actual damage it may have experienced or produced may never be completely known.  Additionally, design details for the conduit were not only ambiguous from the start but also underwent continuing change from the feasibility design continuing on throughout construction, making it difficult for us to fully assess the intent of the design or the actual as-built conditions.  One largely unexplained aspect is that the evolution of conduit design and construction appears to have progressed in several important respects from more conservative to less conservative over time, resulting in a number of irregularities.  It is known that the corrugated steel culvert was crushed by heavy equipment and repaired at two separate locations and occasions during construction, suggesting the possibility that other latent damage might have gone unrecognized.<p>
     The nature of corrugated metal culverts is such that they must deform (from circular to slightly oval shape) in order to develop load-carrying capacity.  This raises the possibility that deformation incompatibility between the rigid grouted section and the deformable open section (see Figure 1) may have caused structural failure, or that the combined fill, slimes, and water loads may simply have exceeded the structural capacity of the culvert in the critical region beneath the Stage 1A starter dyke.  Any such structural failure would have produced a void or allowed soil to enter the conduit, providing a direct path for concentrated seepage and cavity formation within the fill.<p>
     Even so, structural failure of the conduit would not necessarily have been required for concentrated seepage and internal erosion to initiate and propagate along the outer surface of the conduit, a common occurrence without adequate safeguards.  The details of conduit backfilling and as-built construction are important in assessing this mechanism, and our ongoing investigation is continuing to evaluate it.<p>
     Finally, there is evidence to indicate that sand was used for culvert backfill
beneath some portion of the Stage 1A starter dyke.  Concentrated seepage within this sand may have produced internal erosion at its downstream terminus with the rockfill as a result of filter incompatibility issues previously discussed.<P>
<I><B>3.5 Continuing DRT investigations</B></I><BR>
     Compilation and synthesis of information obtained from field forensic studies is necessary to amplify and refine the causation theories advanced at this time.  However, initial evaluation of this information suggests nothing to date that would be likely to fundamentally alter the preliminary views expressed herein.  Continuing investigations will be required to finalize our conclusions and prepare our final report to GGMC on the failure, including but not limited to evaluation of seepage and deformation patterns within the dam, and analysis of structural capacity and deformation of the diversion conduit.<P>
<B>4.0 IMPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING AND PROPOSED STRUCTURES</B><BR>
     We view it as important that the mechanisms and processes that caused the tailings dam to fail not be allowed to recur in other structures at OGML.  The failure causation theories advanced here have two significant implications in this respect.<p>
     First, the "cofferdam" that now prevents contaminated flow from reaching the Omai River was intended to be a temporary emergency structure, not a permanent one, and hence contains no proper filter.  Although we have no indication of adverse performance at this time, the seepage integrity and stability of both this structure and the mine waste dump that confines water within the rockfill zone of the tailings dam need to be determined.  Additionally, we are aware of no flood routing studies performed to evaluate the security of the cofferdam during extreme precipitation events or seasons.  We would urge that a decommissioning plan for the tailings impoundment be prepared and implemented without delay, and that this plan take all necessary measures to ensure the security of the cofferdam and related features.<p>
     Second, OGML cannot physically resume operation until a new tailings impoundment is constructed, and lessons learned from the failure need to be
addressed in its design.  In this regard, our investigation to date provides no reason to believe that the failure was related to any concealed geologic conditions or features, or to any anomalous behaviour or engineering properties of the dam, foundation or fill soils, that would pertain to other structures at the minesite.  The failure was caused not by some "hidden flaw" but by inadequate application and execution of sound practices for design, construction, supervision, and inspection that are well understood in current embankment dam and tailings dam technology.  Inasmuch as the failure is attributable to defects related to filter incompatibility and/or the diversion conduit, it should be well within the ability of conservative dam engineering and construction practice to eliminate these failure modes altogether for any new tailings impoundment constructed at the mine.  An important factor in doing so will be to ensure that construction is controlled by qualified engineers with clearly-defined responsibility, direct lines of reporting, and full authority to stop the work if and when necessary to correct it.  This will also require documented plans for quality assurance and quality control to promptly detect and correct any construction deficiencies.<P>
<B>5.0 TAILINGS POND NO. 2</B><BR>
     OGML has put forward a design concept for dams confining the proposed Tailings Pond No. 2.  These dams contain neither diversion conduits nor rockfill within structural zones that would require filters.  Hence, it is not possible for the failure mechanisms described herein to be operative for the new structures.<p>
     This design concept is proven in practice, having been successfully applied for many dams constructed of and upon tropical residual soils in Brazil for over 30 years.  In addition, the design advanced by OGML contains multiple redundancies for safe control of internal seepage that enhance reliability.  The necessary dam construction techniques are not complex or new to OGML, requiring only equipment and procedures routinely used in its mining operations.<P>
     This design concept is still at an early stage, and many details remain to be developed.  However, we currently see no technical reason why approval of this concept in principle could not be granted that would allow the design process to continue during the initial stages of construction.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Cambior remporte un prix pour la r&eacute;habilitation de Valdez&nbsp;Creek</H2></CENTER>

Cambior Alaska inc., une filiale de Cambior inc., est fi&egrave;re d'avoir &eacute;t&eacute; choisie, &agrave; la recommandation du U.S. Bureau of Land Management, &agrave; titre de r&eacute;cipiendaire du prix 1995 du Gouverneur de l'&Eacute;tat de l'Alaska pour la r&eacute;habilitation environnementale.<P>
Une lettre re&ccedil;ue du D&eacute;partement des ressources naturelles, division des mines et de la gestion de l'eau (Department of Natural Resources, Division of Mining and Water Management "DMWM") citait "L'examen de votre plan minier et de votre plan de r&eacute;habilitation ainsi que des rapports et photos des travaux prises par le personnel de DMWM indique que vos activit&eacute;s mini&egrave;res et travaux de r&eacute;habilitation ont &eacute;t&eacute; bien organis&eacute;s et effectu&eacute;s de fa&ccedil;on responsable.  L'am&eacute;nagement final du terrain refl&egrave;te votre attention particuli&egrave;re pour minimiser les possibilit&eacute;s de d&eacute;gradation par l'&eacute;rosion tout en procurant un excellent milieu pour la recolonisation rapide par des esp&egrave;ces indig&egrave;nes.  De plus, une bonne planification, qui tient compte des r&eacute;utilisations possibles du terrain, a permis de cr&eacute;er un habitat propice aux poissons et &agrave; la faune".<P>
Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et Chef de la direction, est heureux de recevoir cette r&eacute;compense et f&eacute;licite tous les employ&eacute;s de Cambior Alaska, inc. pour leur excellent travail dans la r&eacute;habilitation du Placer de Valdez Creek.<P>
Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egrave;re avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.

<CENTER><H2>R&eacute;sultats de Cambior pour les neuf premiers mois et le troisi&egraveme trimestre de 1995</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui ses r&eacute;sultats pour les neuf premiers mois de 1995 avec des revenus de 284,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ comparativement &agrave; 226&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante de 1994. Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation ont atteint 57,9&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (1,16&nbsp;$ par action) comparativement &agrave; 56,4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (1,15&nbsp;$ par action) pour les neuf premiers mois de 1994. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net a atteint 1,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,03&nbsp;$ par action) par rapport &agrave; une perte nette de 4,7&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,10&nbsp;$ par action) pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante de 1994.<P>

Pour le troisi&egraveme trimestre, les revenus sont de 87,5&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ comparativement &agrave; 74,8&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ pour le trimestre correspondant de 1994. Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; 9,2&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,18&nbsp;$ par action) comparativement &agrave; 12,1&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,25&nbsp;$ par action) pour le troisi&egraveme trimestre de 1994. La perte nette a atteint 6,3&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,12&nbsp;$ par action) contre une perte de 15,4&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ (0,31&nbsp;$ par action).<P>

L'augmentation des revenus, en d&eacute;pit de l'interruption de l'exploitation de la mine Omai, est due &agrave; la mise en production commerciale de la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert en janvier dernier. De plus, pour les neuf premiers mois de 1995, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; gr&acirc;ce &agrave; son programme de couverture sur le march&eacute; de l'or, un prix moyen de 414&nbsp;$&nbsp;US l'once, soit une prime de 30&nbsp;$&nbsp;US l'once par rapport au prix moyen du march&eacute;. Pour le troisi&egraveme trimestre, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un prix moyen de 424&nbsp;$&nbsp;US l'once.<P>

La faible performance des r&eacute;sultats financiers du troisi&egraveme trimestre et de la p&eacute;riode des neuf premiers mois de l'ann&eacute;e est principalement due &agrave; l'interruption des activit&eacute;s mini&egraveres &agrave; la mine Omai, &agrave; une hausse des frais d'exploration de surface et &agrave; des co&ucirc;ts d'exploitation plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s du placer de Valdez Creek ainsi qu'&agrave; une production aurif&egravere moindre que pr&eacute;vue au placer. L'incident &agrave; la mine Omai a occasionn&eacute; au cours du trimestre des co&ucirc;ts nets de 2,2&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$. En excluant Valdez Creek, les co&ucirc;ts unitaires d'exploitation ont atteint 244&nbsp;$&nbsp;US l'once au troisi&egraveme trimestre et 237&nbsp;$&nbsp;US l'once depuis le d&eacute;but de l'ann&eacute;e.<P>

La production aurif&egravere totale de Cambior pour les neuf premiers mois a atteint 378&nbsp;672&nbsp;onces comparativement &agrave; 386&nbsp;820&nbsp;onces pour la p&eacute;riode correspondante de 1994. Pour le troisi&egraveme trimestre, la production aurif&egravere s'est chiffr&eacute;e &agrave; 111&nbsp;654&nbsp;onces comparativement &agrave; 126&nbsp;780&nbsp;onces pour le trimestre correspondant de 1994. Ces baisses sont reli&eacute;es principalement &agrave; l'arr&ecirc;t des activit&eacute;s mini&egraveres &agrave; la mine Omai survenue le 19&nbsp;ao&ucirc;t dernier.

<H3>Placer de Valdez Creek</H3>
Enfin tel que pr&eacute;vu, les activit&eacute;s d'exploitation du placer de Valdez Creek ont cess&eacute; le 30&nbsp;septembre dernier. Pour les neuf premiers mois de 1995, Valdez a produit 32&nbsp;750&nbsp;onces d'or, soit moins que l'objectif fix&eacute; au d&eacute;but de l'ann&eacute;e avec des co&ucirc;ts d'exploitation plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s. De plus, un montant de <NOBR>2,8 millions $ US,</NOBR> repr&eacute;sentant des frais de fermeture du placer et de r&eacute;habilitation du site a &eacute;t&eacute; comptabilis&eacute; aux r&eacute;sultats financiers. L'exploitation du placer de Valdez Creek aura ainsi g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; une perte de quelque <NOBR>10,5 millions $ US</NOBR> aux r&eacute;sultats de Cambior cette ann&eacute;e. &Agrave; la suite d'une provision pour la restauration du site de <NOBR>1,8 millions $ US</NOBR> au 30&nbsp;septembre&nbsp;1995, les r&eacute;sultats de la compagnie ne devraient plus &ecirc;tre affect&eacute;s par le placer de Valdez Creek.
<H3>Mine Omai</H3>
La mine Omai (Guyana) a connu une excellente performance de ses activit&eacute;s mini&egraveres avec une production aurif&egravere de 40&nbsp;640&nbsp;onces. Le rythme de production d'or indique une progression constante depuis le d&eacute;but de 1995 avec une bonne am&eacute;lioration des co&ucirc;ts unitaires d'exploitation. En effet, les frais unitaires d'exploitation pour le trosi&egraveme trimestre ont atteint 215&nbsp;$&nbsp;US l'once.<P>

Le 19&nbsp;ao&ucirc;t dernier, les activit&eacute;s mini&egraveres ont &eacute;t&eacute; interrompues &agrave; la suite du bris de la digue principale du parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus. Depuis cet incident, Omai Gold Mines a effectu&eacute; des travaux de r&eacute;habilitation du site et de nettoyage de la rivi&egravere Omai en plus d'entreprendre des travaux d'entretien sur les &eacute;quipements.<P>

Tous les efforts sont d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s par la compagnie afin de permettre la reprise des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation mini&egravere d'ici la fin de 1995. La Commission d'enqu&ecirc;te du Gouvernement de la Guyana sur les causes de la rupture de la digue a &eacute;t&eacute; officiellement constitu&eacute;e le 7&nbsp;octobre dernier avec un mandat de soumettre leur rapport dans un d&eacute;lai de deux mois. Les audiences publiques ont d&eacute;but&eacute; le 23&nbsp;octobre dernier et nous esp&eacute;rons obtenir prochainement les autorisations requises pour la construction du second parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus et la reprise de la production.<P>

La suspension des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation &agrave; la mine Omai occasionnera un manque &agrave; gagner d'environ <NOBR>2,5 millions $ US</NOBR> en flux mon&eacute;taires provenant de l'exploitation pour chaque mois entier au cours duquel l'exploitation mini&egravere est suspendue. De plus, les co&ucirc;ts &agrave; engager &agrave; la mine Omai au cours de cette p&eacute;riode d'attente sont &eacute;valu&eacute;s entre 1 et <NOBR>2 millions $ US</NOBR> par mois. Des d&eacute;penses en immobilisations suppl&eacute;mentaires reli&eacute;es &agrave; cet incident sont actuellement &eacute;valu&eacute;es &agrave; <NOBR>5 millions $ US.</NOBR><P>

D&ucirc; aux &eacute;v&eacute;nements survenus &agrave; la mine Omai, les travaux d'expansion de l'usine de traitement ont &eacute;t&eacute; ralentis d'environ deux mois. Nous pr&eacute;voyons compl&eacute;ter les travaux vers la fin du premier trimestre de 1996 afin d'augmenter la capacit&eacute; de traitement de 12&nbsp;000 &agrave; 18&nbsp;000&nbsp;tonnes par jour au deuxi&egraveme trimestre de 1996.

<H3>Projets en D&eacute;veloppement et Exploration</H3>
La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a annonc&eacute; au cours du troisi&egraveme trimestre des augmentations substantielles des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres au projet cuprif&egravere La&nbsp;Granja (P&eacute;rou) et de l'inventaire min&eacute;ral au projet aurif&egravere Metates (Mexique).<P>

Les r&eacute;sultats du programme d'exploration avanc&eacute; sur La Granja nous ont permis de plus que tripler les r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres depuis notre implication en 1994 pour atteindre 600&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de 0,73&nbsp;% cuivre repr&eacute;sentant ainsi 9.7&nbsp;milliards de livres de cuivre <I>in situ.</I> De plus, le d&eacute;veloppement de ce projet nous a permis d'&eacute;tablir une importante pr&eacute;sence au P&eacute;rou avec d'autres projets d'exploration int&eacute;ressants. L'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute;, pr&eacute;vue au premier trimestre de 1996, nous permettra de d&eacute;terminer la pleine valeur et tout le potentiel du projet.<P>

Sur le projet Metates, les r&eacute;sultats de la campagne de forage ont confirm&eacute; le potentiel de ce projet avec un inventaire min&eacute;ral de plus de 14&nbsp;millions d'onces d'or &eacute;quivalent <I>in situ.</I> En raison de la nature r&eacute;fractaire du minerai, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; poursuit intensivement les essais m&eacute;tallurgiques afin de trouver un proc&eacute;d&eacute; efficace pour r&eacute;cup&eacute;rer &eacute;conomiquement les m&eacute;taux pr&eacute;cieux et de d&eacute;finir la rentabilit&eacute; du projet. Une &eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; sera &eacute;galement compl&eacute;t&eacute;e au cours du premier trimestre de 1996.<P>

Les travaux de construction et de pr&eacute;production au projet Grevet (Qu&eacute;bec) se poursuivent selon l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ancier &eacute;tabli avec un d&eacute;marrage pr&eacute;vu au d&eacute;but de 1996.<P>

Nous pr&eacute;voyons &eacute;galement obtenir au cours du premier trimestre de 1996 les permis environnementaux pour la mise en construction du projet Carlota (Arizona) et effectuer le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t d'&eacute;tudes de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; sur le projet aurif&egravere Gross Rosebel (Suriname) et le projet cuprif&egravere El&nbsp;Pachon (Argentine).
<H3>Perspectives</H3>
Selon Louis&nbsp;P.&nbsp;Gignac, pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction, &#171;&nbsp;tous les efforts sont d&eacute;ploy&eacute;s par la compagnie afin de permettre la reprise des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation &agrave; la mine Omai d'ici la fin de 1995. Nous sommes &eacute;galement confiants d'am&eacute;liorer notre performance financi&egravere &agrave; la suite de la fermeture du placer de Valdez Creek, lequel a eu un impact n&eacute;gatif important sur les r&eacute;sultats de la compagnie au cours de 1995. &Agrave; court terme, l'expansion de l'usine de traitement &agrave; Omai, l'augmentation de la production &agrave; la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert et la mise en production du projet Grevet permettront d'accro&icirc;tre les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation. Les six prochains mois seront une p&eacute;riode tr&egraves active pour la compagnie avec le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de quatre &eacute;tudes de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute;. Selon les r&eacute;sultats des &eacute;tudes, nous d&eacute;terminerons la strat&eacute;gie qui sera la plus avantageuse afin de maximiser &agrave; long terme la cr&eacute;ation de valeur pour nos actionnaires. Enfin, &agrave; la suite de l'incident &agrave; la mine Omai, nous pr&eacute;voyons atteindre pour 1995 une production aurif&egravere globale de pr&egraves de 450&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces par rapport &agrave; notre objectif de 550&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces fix&eacute; au d&eacute;but de l'ann&eacute;e. Pour 1996, avec la reprise de la production &agrave; Omai, nous pr&eacute;voyons une production aurif&egravere de plus de 550&nbsp;000&nbsp;onces&nbsp;&#187;.<P>

B&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant d'une situation financi&egravere favorable avec une encaisse de 116&nbsp;millions&nbsp;$ au 30&nbsp;septembre&nbsp;1995, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; entend poursuivre agressivement sa strat&eacute;gie de croissance dans les Am&eacute;riques.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.

<CENTER><H2>Augmentation importante de l'inventaire min&eacute;ral &agrave; Metates</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. annonce une augmentation importante de l'inventaire min&eacute;ral au projet aurif&egravere Metates au Mexique. L'estim&eacute; de l'inventaire min&eacute;ral a augment&eacute; &agrave; plus de 430&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; <NOBR>1,0 g/t d'or</NOBR> &eacute;quivalent repr&eacute;sentant 14,1&nbsp;millions d'onces d'or &eacute;quivalent <I>in situ.</I> Depuis l'implication de Cambior dans ce projet en 1993, des travaux d'exploration intensifs ont &eacute;t&eacute; accomplis et le nouvel estim&eacute; est maintenant calcul&eacute; &agrave; partir d'un total de <NOBR>47 000 m&egravetres</NOBR> pour 137&nbsp;trous de forage au diamant sur une maille de 100&nbsp;m x 100&nbsp;m.

<H3>Impact strat&eacute;gique</H3>

Selon Monsieur Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction&nbsp;: &quot;Les r&eacute;sultats du programme d'exploration avanc&eacute; ont confirm&eacute; le potentiel immense de ce projet avec un inventaire min&eacute;ral de plus de 14&nbsp;millions d'onces d'or &eacute;quivalent. En raison de la nature r&eacute;fractaire du minerai, nous poursuivons intensivement les essais m&eacute;tallurgiques afin de trouver un proc&eacute;d&eacute; efficace pour r&eacute;cup&eacute;rer &eacute;conomiquement les m&eacute;taux pr&eacute;cieux et de d&eacute;finir la rentabilit&eacute; du projet. Nous pr&eacute;voyons compl&eacute;ter une &eacute;tude de pr&eacute;rentabilit&eacute; d'ici le d&eacute;but de 1996.&quot;<P>


<H3>G&eacute;ologie</H3>

Le projet Metates comprend une concession d'exploration et quatre concessions d'exploitation couvrant une superficie de plus de 47&nbsp;kilom&egravetres carr&eacute;s. Depuis l'implication de Cambior au d&eacute;but de 1993, un programme d'exploration intensif a &eacute;t&eacute; compl&eacute;t&eacute; et deux zones min&eacute;ralis&eacute;es ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;finies, soit la Zone Principale et la Zone Nord.<P>

La g&eacute;ologie du projet Metates consiste en une s&eacute;quence de s&eacute;diments pliss&eacute;s travers&eacute;e par un filon couche intrusif&nbsp;; les deux sont recouverts par des roches volcaniques plus jeunes. La majorit&eacute; de la min&eacute;ralisation en or et en argent se retrouve diss&eacute;min&eacute;e ou dans des veines &eacute;troites de sulfure. L'or, de dimension microscopique, est associ&eacute; &agrave; la pyrite, la sphal&eacute;rite, la gal&egravene et les autres sulfures contenus dans les roches intrusives ou s&eacute;dimentaires.<P>

<H3>Projet</H3>

Le projet Metates est situ&eacute; au nord-ouest de l'&eacute;tat de Durango au Mexique, soit approximativement 160&nbsp;kilom&egravetres au nord-ouest de la ville de Durango dans la municipalit&eacute; de Santiago Papaswuiro. La propri&eacute;t&eacute; est situ&eacute;e sur un terrain accident&eacute; &agrave; une altitude variant entre 600 et <NOBR>2 600 m&egravetres</NOBR> au-dessus du niveau de la mer. Le d&eacute;veloppement de ce projet exigera des investissements importants au niveau des infrastructures.<P>

Les modalit&eacute;s de l'entente en coparticipation actuellement en vigueur entre Cambior et Industrias Luismin S.A. de C.V. pr&eacute;voient que Cambior peut acqu&eacute;rir un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50&nbsp;% dans le projet Metates i)&nbsp;en investissant <NOBR>9 millions $ US</NOBR> et en r&eacute;alisant une &eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; d'ici avril 1997, ou ii)&nbsp;en investissant <NOBR>15 millions $ US</NOBR> et en r&eacute;alisant une &eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; d'ici avril 1998. Cambior peut augmenter son int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; 70&nbsp;% si Luismin lui demande de procurer le financement requis pour la mise en production du projet.<P>

Au 30 juin 1995, Cambior a investi sur ce projet avanc&eacute; un total de <NOBR>9,4 millions $ US</NOBR> et pr&eacute;voit des investissements suppl&eacute;mentaires de <NOBR>2,2 millions $ US</NOBR> d'ici la fin de 1995. Pour le deuxi&egraveme semestre de 1995, les travaux additionnels seront concentr&eacute;s sur la poursuite des &eacute;tudes portant sur divers proc&eacute;d&eacute;s m&eacute;tallurgiques pour extraire l'or et l'argent du minerai r&eacute;fractaire. Les proc&eacute;d&eacute;s &agrave; l'&eacute;tude comprennent la bio-oxydation, l'oxydation sous pression et la calcination (&quot;roasting&quot;) des concentr&eacute;s ainsi que divers proc&eacute;d&eacute;s chimiques de r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration des sulfures oxyd&eacute;s. L'objectif est de d&eacute;terminer un proc&eacute;d&eacute; m&eacute;tallurgique qui permettra de r&eacute;cup&eacute;rer de fa&ccedil;on &eacute;conomique l'or, l'argent et les autres m&eacute;taux.<P>

Une &eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; devrait &ecirc;tre compl&eacute;t&eacute;e pour le d&eacute;but de 1996 et sera suivie dans l'ann&eacute;e qui suit par le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t d'une &eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; compl&egravete.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration en Am&eacute;rique du Nord et en Am&eacute;rique du Sud.

Montr&eacute;al, le 21 septembre 1995
<CENTER><H2>Augmentation importante des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres &agrave; La&nbsp;Granja</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. annonce une augmentation importante des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres au projet cuprif&egravere La&nbsp;Granja au P&eacute;rou. Les r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres de cat&eacute;gories prouv&eacute;e et probable ont &eacute;t&eacute; augment&eacute;es &agrave; pr&egraves de 600&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de 0,73&nbsp;% cuivre repr&eacute;sentant 9,7&nbsp;milliards de livres de cuivre <I>in situ.</I><P>

Le tableau suivant repr&eacute;sente les variations des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres de mars&nbsp;1994 &agrave; septembre&nbsp;1995&nbsp;:<P>

</TABLE><P>

Cette mise &agrave; jour des r&eacute;serves est bas&eacute;e sur un total de 100&nbsp;trous de forage additionnels <NOBR>(36 000 m&egravetres)</NOBR> qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; for&eacute;s sur le projet La&nbsp;Granja depuis l'implication de Cambior en 1994.<P>

<H3>Impact strat&eacute;gique</H3>

Selon <NOBR>Louis P. Gignac,</NOBR> pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction, &quot;Nous sommes tr&egraves satisfaits des r&eacute;sultats de ce programme d'exploration avanc&eacute; qui nous a permis de plus que tripler les r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres depuis notre implication en 1994. L'investissement &agrave; ce jour de <NOBR>14 millions $ US</NOBR> a augment&eacute; la valeur du projet. De plus, le d&eacute;veloppement de ce projet nous a permis d'&eacute;tablir une importante pr&eacute;sence au P&eacute;rou avec d'autres projets d'exploration int&eacute;ressants. L'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute;, pr&eacute;vue d'ici le d&eacute;but de 1996, nous permettra de d&eacute;terminer la pleine valeur et le potentiel du projet. Selon les r&eacute;sultats de cette &eacute;tude, Cambior d&eacute;terminera la strat&eacute;gie qui sera la plus avantageuse afin de maximiser &agrave; long terme la cr&eacute;ation de valeur pour nos actionnaires dans le cadre de ce projet.&quot;<P>

<H3>Historique</H3>

Le projet La&nbsp;Granja est situ&eacute; &agrave; environ 650&nbsp;kilom&egravetres au nord de Lima, P&eacute;rou. Par route, le projet est situ&eacute; &agrave; 271&nbsp;kilom&egravetres &agrave; l'est de Chiclayo sur le flanc est de la Cordill&egravere Nord-Ouest des Andes &agrave; une altitude de 2&nbsp;000 &agrave; <NOBR>2 700 m&egravetres</NOBR> au-dessus du niveau de la mer.<P>

Le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t La&nbsp;Granja consiste &agrave; une formation intrusive fortement alt&eacute;r&eacute;e de la fin de l'&acirc;ge tertiaire et comporte deux zones. La plus importante zone, la zone primaire comprend la chalcopyrite et la zone secondaire contient des sulfures de cuivre pouvant &ecirc;tre r&eacute;cup&eacute;r&eacute;s par lixiviation. Il semble que certains secteurs du gisement demeurent ouverts lat&eacute;ralement et en profondeur, ce qui laisse pr&eacute;sager d'autres augmentations des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres.<P>

En 1994, Cambior avait acquis de Minero Peru&nbsp;S.A., une soci&eacute;t&eacute; mini&egravere d'&Eacute;tat du P&eacute;rou, une option visant l'acquisition de 100&nbsp;% du projet en investissant <NOBR>25 millions $ US</NOBR> en travaux d'exploration et de d&eacute;veloppement sur une p&eacute;riode de cinq ans ainsi que la pr&eacute;paration d'une &eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute;. En mai&nbsp;1995, un montant de <NOBR>2 millions $ US</NOBR> a &eacute;t&eacute; vers&eacute; &agrave; Minero Peru en relation avec le deuxi&egraveme versement afin de maintenir l'option. Le troisi&egraveme versement &agrave; Minero Peru sera de <NOBR>4 millions $ US</NOBR> et sera d&ucirc; en mai&nbsp;1996. Au cours du premier semestre de 1995, les investissements au projet La&nbsp;Granja ont totalis&eacute; <NOBR>6 millions $ US.</NOBR> Au <NOBR>30 juin 1995,</NOBR> Cambior a investi dans le projet La&nbsp;Granja <NOBR>14 millions $ US.</NOBR><P>

<H3>Programme de d&eacute;veloppement</H3>

Le programme actuel pour le deuxi&egraveme semestre de 1995 comprend <NOBR>14 000 m&egravetres</NOBR> de forage (40&nbsp;sondages) afin de mieux d&eacute;finir le contour du d&eacute;p&ocirc;t. Ces trous de forage vont permettre de compl&eacute;ter le patron de forage de 200&nbsp;m x 200&nbsp;m et le forage de d&eacute;finition de certains secteurs sur un patron plus serr&eacute; de 100&nbsp;m x 100&nbsp;m. Les &eacute;tudes m&eacute;tallurgiques pr&eacute;sentement en cours confirment que les r&eacute;cup&eacute;rations du cuivre par flottation sont aux environs de 90&nbsp;% et que les concentr&eacute;s de cuivre seront de l'ordre de 30-32&nbsp;%. L'&eacute;tude de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; devrait &ecirc;tre d&eacute;pos&eacute;e d'ici le d&eacute;but de 1996 et l'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; devrait &ecirc;tre termin&eacute;e au cours de l'ann&eacute;e suivante. Subs&eacute;quemment &agrave; la confirmation de l'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; et de la mise en place du financement, la construction pourrait d&eacute;buter en 1997 avec une production commerciale anticip&eacute;e en&nbsp;1999.<P>

Selon la planification pr&eacute;liminaire de l'extraction mini&egravere, quelque 70&nbsp;millions de tonnes avec une teneur de 1&nbsp;% de cuivre pourraient &ecirc;tre extraites au cours des cinq premi&egraveres ann&eacute;es de la production commerciale avec un ratio st&eacute;rile/minerai de 1.31:1. Ces r&eacute;sultats pr&eacute;liminaires indiqueraient une production annuelle moyenne de 275&nbsp;millions de livres de cuivre.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 20 ao&ucirc;t 1995
<CENTER><H2>Omai Gold Mines Limited interrompt ses activit&eacute;s mini&egraveres &agrave; la mine Omai</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. et Golden Star Resources Ltd. ont annonc&eacute; aujourd'hui que les activit&eacute;s de la mine Omai sont interrompues pour une p&eacute;riode ind&eacute;termin&eacute;e en raison d'une importante infiltration &agrave; la digue principale du parc &agrave; r&eacute;sidus. Une &eacute;quipe de sp&eacute;cialistes de la conception technique et de l'environnement &eacute;value actuellement l'&eacute;tendue du d&eacute;versement et ses cons&eacute;quences sur l'environnement imm&eacute;diat et les activit&eacute;s mini&egraveres, en vue de ma&icirc;triser rapidement le d&eacute;versement et de trouver une solution &agrave; long terme.<P>

Omai Gold Mines Limited se soucie avant tout de l'impact du d&eacute;versement sur l'environnement.  De nombreux &eacute;chantillons sont pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s dans la rivi&egravere Omai, situ&eacute;e juste en aval de la mine, o&ugrave; l'on a observ&eacute; une certaine contamination.  On effectue &eacute;galement de nombreux &eacute;chantillonnages en vue de surveiller les niveaux de contamination de la rivi&egravere Essequibo situ&eacute;e &agrave; environ quatre kilom&egravetres du site; jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, aucune contamination n'a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;tect&eacute;e.<P>

Omai Gold Mines suit de pr&egraves la situation et, par mesure de pr&eacute;caution, les habitants de la r&eacute;gion ont &eacute;t&eacute; inform&eacute;s du d&eacute;versement. Le gouvernement de Guyane, qui a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; imm&eacute;diatement avis&eacute; de la situation, travaille actuellement en &eacute;troite collaboration avec Omai Gold Mines pour ma&icirc;triser le d&eacute;versement et minimiser l'impact sur l'environnement.<P>

Golden Star est une soci&eacute;t&eacute; oeuvrant dans le domaine de l'exploitation et de la prospection aurif&egravere qui d&eacute;tient une participation de <NOBR>30 %</NOBR> dans les actions ordinaires de la mine d'or Omai en Guyana, l'une des mines d'or les plus importantes en Am&eacute;rique du Sud.  Golden Star d&eacute;tient &eacute;galement d'importants int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts de prospection d'or et de diamant en Am&eacute;rique du Sud et en Afrique. La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; est inscrite &agrave; la bourse de Toronto (symbole GSC) et &agrave; l'American Stock Exchange (symbole GSR).<P>

Cambior assume la gestion de l'exploitation de la mine Omai et d&eacute;tient une participation de <NOBR>65 %</NOBR> dans les actions ordinaires de Omai Gold Mines Limited.  Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.

Montr&eacute;al, le 11 ao&ucirc;t 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior annonce ses r&eacute;sultats pour le premier semestre avec une hausse des revenus et des fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui ses r&eacute;sultats du premier semestre de 1995 avec des revenus de <NOBR>197,0 millions $</NOBR> comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>151,2 millions $</NOBR> au premier semestre de 1994, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une augmentation de <NOBR>30 %.</NOBR> Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation ont atteint <NOBR>48,7 millions $</NOBR> <NOBR>(0,99 $</NOBR> par action) comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>44,3 millions $</NOBR> <NOBR>(0,90 $</NOBR> par action) au premier semestre de 1994, soit une hausse de <NOBR>10 %.</NOBR> Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net a atteint <NOBR>7,8 millions $</NOBR> <NOBR>(0,16 $</NOBR> par action) par rapport &agrave; <NOBR>10,7 millions $</NOBR> <NOBR>(0,22 $</NOBR> par action) au semestre correspondant de 1994.<P>

Pour le deuxi&egraveme trimestre, les revenus sont de <NOBR>104,2 millions $</NOBR> comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>77,0 millions $</NOBR> pour le trimestre correspondant de 1994, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une hausse de <NOBR>35 %.</NOBR> Les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; <NOBR>27,4 millions $</NOBR> <NOBR>(0,56 $</NOBR> par action) comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>19,6 millions $</NOBR> <NOBR>(0,40 $</NOBR> par action) pour le deuxi&egraveme trimestre de 1994, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une hausse de <NOBR>40 %.</NOBR> Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net a atteint <NOBR>2,6 millions $</NOBR> <NOBR>(0,05 $</NOBR> par action) contre <NOBR>3,8 millions $</NOBR> <NOBR>(0,08 $</NOBR> par action).<P>

La forte augmentation des revenus est principalement attribuable &agrave; la mise en production de la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert (anciennement connue sous le nom de la mine Mobrun) en janvier dernier et par l'excellente performance de la mine Omai au cours du deuxi&egraveme trimestre. De plus, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute;, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; son programme de couverture sur le march&eacute; de l'or, un prix moyen de <NOBR>410 $ US</NOBR> l'once, soit une prime de <NOBR>27 $ US</NOBR> l'once par rapport au prix moyen du march&eacute;. Pour le deuxi&egraveme trimestre, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un prix moyen de <NOBR>417 $ US</NOBR> l'once.<P>

La baisse du b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net est principalement attribuable &agrave; une hausse des frais d'exploration de <NOBR>4,3 millions $</NOBR> reli&eacute;e &agrave; l'abandon de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Santa Rosa au P&eacute;rou. La compagnie avait ant&eacute;rieurement capitalis&eacute; les d&eacute;penses d'exploration effectu&eacute;es sur cette propri&eacute;t&eacute;. Le virement des charges aux d&eacute;penses d'exploration de surface n'a eu toutefois aucun impact sur les fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation du trimestre.<P>

Les co&ucirc;ts unitaires d'exploitation, en excluant Valdez Creek, continuent de s'am&eacute;liorer depuis le d&eacute;but de l'ann&eacute;e passant ainsi de <NOBR>241 $ US</NOBR> l'once au premier trimestre &agrave; <NOBR>228 $ US</NOBR> l'once au deuxi&egraveme trimestre de 1995.<P>

La production aurif&egravere totale de Cambior du premier semestre a atteint <NOBR>267 018 onces</NOBR> comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>260 040 onces</NOBR> pour le premier semestre de 1994. Pour le deuxi&egraveme trimestre, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'excellente performance de la mine Omai, la production aurif&egravere s'est chiffr&eacute;e &agrave; <NOBR>140 565 onces,</NOBR> en hausse de <NOBR>8 %</NOBR> par rapport au trimestre correspondant de 1994. La mine G&eacute;ant Dormant a connu un record de production aurif&egravere au cours du trimestre et un tr&egraves bas co&ucirc;t de production <NOBR>(145 $ US/once)</NOBR> en raison d'une teneur usin&eacute;e beaucoup plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e.<P>

Selon <NOBR>Louis P. Gignac,</NOBR> pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction, &quot;Les am&eacute;liorations de productivit&eacute; mini&egravere aux mines Omai et Doyon ont eu un excellent impact sur les profits d'op&eacute;ration. La mine Omai a connu un record de production au deuxi&egraveme trimestre avec le plus bas co&ucirc;t unitaire de production <NOBR>(220 $ US/once)</NOBR> depuis le d&eacute;but des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation en 1993 d&ucirc; &agrave; un tonnage et une teneur usin&eacute;s plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s. La s&eacute;quence d'extraction du minerai de la Zone Principale de la mine Doyon est revenue &agrave; la normale et les co&ucirc;ts d'exploitation ont atteint <NOBR>196 $ US l'once</NOBR> pour le deuxi&egraveme trimestre d&ucirc; &agrave; de meilleures teneurs usin&eacute;es et &agrave; un taux de r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration plus &eacute;lev&eacute;. Avec les excellents r&eacute;sultats d'exploitation du premier semestre, nous sommes confiants de r&eacute;aliser les objectifs &eacute;tablis au d&eacute;but de l'ann&eacute;e. En d&eacute;pit de l'abandon de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Santa Rosa et cons&eacute;quemment &agrave; la hausse des frais d'exploration au deuxi&egraveme trimestre, nous maintenons notre budget d'exploration de <NOBR>16 millions $</NOBR> pour 1995. Enfin, la fin des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation du placer de Valdez Creek, au cours des prochains mois, aura un impact positif sur les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute;.&quot;<P>

<H2>Perspectives</H2>
Les travaux d'expansion de l'usine de traitement de la mine Omai (Guyana) ainsi que les travaux de construction et de pr&eacute;production du projet Grevet (Qu&eacute;bec) se poursuivent selon les &eacute;ch&eacute;anciers pr&eacute;vus avec un d&eacute;marrage au premier trimestre de 1996. Nous pr&eacute;voyons &eacute;galement d&eacute;poser d'ici le d&eacute;but de 1996 des &eacute;tudes de pr&eacute;-rentabilit&eacute; sur les projets aurif&egraveres Metates (Mexique) et Gross Rosebel (Suriname) et cuprif&egraveres La Granja (P&eacute;rou) et El Pach&oacute;n (Argentine). Les travaux de forage au projet Metates sont maintenant termin&eacute;s et nous proc&eacute;dons actuellement &agrave; la compilation de donn&eacute;es. L'exercice des bons de souscription (CBJ.WT) qui prenait fin le <NOBR>30 juin</NOBR> dernier, a permis d'encaisser <NOBR>40 millions $</NOBR> et de renforcir notre situation financi&egravere afin de poursuivre agressivement nos objectifs de croissance dans les Am&eacute;riques.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration en Am&eacute;rique du Nord et en Am&eacute;rique du Sud. Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles respectifs de CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 4 ao&ucirc;t 1995<P>

Cambior inc. (&quot;Cambior&quot;) est heureuse d'annoncer l'&eacute;v&eacute;nement suivant&nbsp;:

<CENTER><H2>Offre visant l'acquisition de la totalit&eacute; des actions ordinaires en circulation de Ressources Audrey inc. (&quot;Audrey&quot;)</H2></CENTER>

Cambior lancera au plus tard le <NOBR>1er septembre 1995</NOBR> une offre (l'&quot;Offre&quot;) visant l'acquisition de la totalit&eacute; des actions ordinaires en circulation de Audrey (&agrave; l'exclusion des actions ordinaires de Audrey d&eacute;tenues par Cambior &agrave; cette date) &agrave; un prix de <NOBR>1,40$ Can.</NOBR> l'action payable, au gr&eacute; du d&eacute;tenteur, (i)&nbsp;en esp&egraveces ou (ii)&nbsp;en actions ordinaires de Cambior selon un ratio d'&eacute;change qui sera fix&eacute; par Cambior au moment du lancement de l'Offre.  Cambior d&eacute;tient pr&eacute;sentement <NOBR>34 121 998 actions</NOBR> ordinaires de Audrey, soit 75,03&nbsp;% de toutes les actions ordinaires de Audrey pr&eacute;sentement en circulation.  Aucune fraction d'action de Cambior ne sera &eacute;mise.<P>

Une copie de l'Offre et de la circulaire d'information seront exp&eacute;di&eacute;es &agrave; tous les porteurs inscrits des actions vis&eacute;es, au plus tard le <NOBR>1er septembre 1995.</NOBR><P>

L'Offre est conditionnelle, entre autres, &agrave; ce qu'au moins 90&nbsp;% des actions ordinaires de Audrey en circulation (incluant toutes les actions ordinaires de Audrey &eacute;mises pr&eacute;alablement &agrave; l'expiration de l'Offre r&eacute;sultant de l'exercice d'options d'achat d'actions ordinaires de Audrey en circulation mais &agrave; l'exclusion des actions ordinaires d&eacute;tenues &agrave; cette date par Cambior) aient &eacute;t&eacute; validement d&eacute;pos&eacute;es et non retir&eacute;es avant l'expiration de l'Offre.<P>

Le <A HREF="PressFr95-08-04b.html">texte int&eacute;gral des conditions de l'Offre</A> est joint au pr&eacute;sent communiqu&eacute; de presse.<P>

Le but de l'Offre consiste &agrave; permettre &agrave; Cambior d'acqu&eacute;rir toutes les actions ordinaires de Audrey qu'elle ne d&eacute;tient pas pr&eacute;sentement afin d'assurer l'int&eacute;gration parfaite des activit&eacute;s de Audrey &agrave; celles de Cambior.<P>

Cette transaction permettra aux actionnaires minoritaires de Audrey de se d&eacute;partir d'un titre peu transig&eacute; tout en b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant d'une prime par rapport au cours actuel du march&eacute;.<P>

Si l'Offre est compl&eacute;t&eacute;e, Cambior entend poursuivre l'exploitation commerciale de la mine Bouchard-H&eacute;bert de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; r&eacute;aliser sa pleine valeur. Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere nord-am&eacute;ricaine ayant des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques. Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'Am&eacute;rican Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles respectifs de CBJ et CBJ.WTA.<P>

Dans le cadre de l'Offre, les services de Coopers & Lybrand/Lalibert&eacute; Lanct&ocirc;t ont &eacute;t&eacute; retenus par Cambior pour pr&eacute;parer une &eacute;valuation ind&eacute;pendante des actions ordinaires de Audrey.<P>

Il est pr&eacute;vu que le conseil d'administration de Audrey se r&eacute;unira le <NOBR>9 ao&ucirc;t 1995</NOBR> pour amorcer son examen de l'Offre.<P>

L'Offre est assujettie aux approbations d'usage des autorit&eacute;s r&egraveglementaires et sera pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e uniquement par voie d'une circulaire d'offre publique d'achat.<P>


<H3>Situation financi&egravere</H3>

Pour la p&eacute;riode de trois (3)&nbsp;mois termin&eacute;e le <NOBR>31 mars 1995,</NOBR> Audrey a encouru un b&eacute;n&eacute;fice de <NOBR>1,4 million $,</NOBR> soit 0,03&nbsp;$ par action.  Les r&eacute;sultats du trimestre termin&eacute; le <NOBR>30 juin 1995</NOBR> seront annonc&eacute;s suite &agrave; la r&eacute;union du conseil d'administration de Audrey le <NOBR>9 ao&ucirc;t 1995.</NOBR><P>

<CENTER><H2>Cambior inc. per&ccedil;oit 39,9&nbsp;millions de dollars &agrave; la suite de l'exercice des bons de souscription</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. (&quot;Cambior&quot;) confirme aujourd'hui qu'un total de <NOBR>4 946 605 bons</NOBR> de souscription ont &eacute;t&eacute; exerc&eacute;s avant leur date d'expiration du <NOBR>30 juin 1995</NOBR> &agrave; un prix d'exercice de <NOBR>15,50 $ Can.</NOBR> Ceci repr&eacute;sente 99&nbsp;% des bons de souscription &eacute;mis lors d'un appel public &agrave; l'&eacute;pargne de Cambior en mai&nbsp;1993.<P>

L'exercice des bons de souscription a r&eacute;sult&eacute; en l'&eacute;mission de <NOBR>2 572 235 actions</NOBR> ordinaires du tr&eacute;sor de Cambior pour un montant total de 39,9&nbsp;millions de dollars. Les autres <NOBR>2 374 370 actions</NOBR> ordinaires de Cambior livr&eacute;es &agrave; la suite de l'exercice des bons de souscription, l'ont &eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; m&ecirc;me les actions ordinaires de Cambior d&eacute;tenues par la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; qu&eacute;b&eacute;coise d'exploration mini&egravere (&quot;Soquem&quot;). $Agrave; la suite de l'exercice des bons de souscription, Soquem s'est d&eacute;partie de la quasi-totalit&eacute; des actions ordinaires de Cambior qu'elle d&eacute;tenait.<P>

Selon Monsieur <NOBR>Louis P. Gignac,</NOBR> pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction de Cambior, &quot;l'exercice des bons de souscription augmente les liquidit&eacute;s de la compagnie de 40&nbsp;millions de dollars et permettra &agrave; Cambior de poursuivre agressivement ses objectifs de croissance&quot;.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 11 mai 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior annonce ses r&eacute;sultats pour le premier trimestre</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. annonce aujourd'hui ses r&eacute;sultats du premier trimestre avec des revenus de <NOBR>92,7 millions $</NOBR> comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>74,2 millions $</NOBR> au premier trimestre de 1994, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une augmentation de 25&nbsp;%. Cette augmentation s'explique principalement par la mise en production commerciale de la mine Mobrun en janvier qui a g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute; des revenus bruts de <NOBR>16,2 millions $.</NOBR> De plus, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute;, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; sa politique de protection des revenus, un prix moyen de <NOBR>402 $ US l'once,</NOBR> soit une prime de <NOBR>23 $ US l'once</NOBR> par rapport au prix moyen de l'once d'or au march&eacute; pour le premier trimestre de 1995.<P>

Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net du trimestre a atteint <NOBR>5,2 millions $</NOBR> (0,11&nbsp;$ par action) par rapport &agrave; <NOBR>6,9 millions $</NOBR> (0,14&nbsp;$ par action) au trimestre correspondant de 1994. La baisse du b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net est attribuable &agrave; des frais unitaires d'exploitation plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; la mine Doyon, aux autres mines canadiennes ainsi qu'au placer de Valdez Creek et &agrave; des frais d'exploration accrus. Les fonds provenant de l'exploitation se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; <NOBR>21,3 millions $</NOBR> (0,44&nbsp;$ par action) comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>24,6 millions $</NOBR> (0,50&nbsp;$ par action) pour le premier trimestre de 1994.<P>

La production aurif&egravere a l&eacute;g&egraverement fl&eacute;chi pour atteindre <NOBR>126 452 onces</NOBR> comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>130 369 onces</NOBR> pour le premier trimestre de 1994. Cet &eacute;cart est principalement reli&eacute; &agrave; l'arr&ecirc;t des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation mini&egravere &agrave; la mine Mouska en raison des travaux pour l'approfondissement du puits et &agrave; une baisse de la teneur usin&eacute;e &agrave; la mine Doyon due &agrave; la s&eacute;quence d'extraction.<P>

Selon <NOBR>Louis P. Gignac,</NOBR> pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction, &quot;Nous sommes satisfaits des r&eacute;sultats du premier trimestre et plus sp&eacute;cifiquement des progr&egraves &agrave; la mine Omai avec une r&eacute;duction de 5&nbsp;% des frais d'exploitation qui ont atteint <NOBR>234 $ US</NOBR> l'once au premier trimestre comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>244 $ US</NOBR> pour l'ann&eacute;e 1994. Une teneur et un tonnage usin&eacute; plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s ainsi qu'une meilleure r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration &agrave; l'usine de traitement expliquent cette r&eacute;duction de co&ucirc;t. Les r&eacute;sultats du programme de forage effectu&eacute; au cours du trimestre dans la fosse Wenot &agrave; Omai ont permis d'identifier des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres suppl&eacute;mentaires de 9&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de <NOBR>1,6 g Au/t</NOBR> contenant <NOBR>446 000 onces</NOBR> d'or <I>in situ</I> par rapport &agrave; celles calcul&eacute;es au <NOBR>31 d&eacute;cembre 1994.</NOBR> Le gisement de la fosse Wenot demeure ouvert lat&eacute;ralement et les partenaires sont tr&egraves positifs quant au potentiel de d&eacute;couvrir des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres additionnelles sur l'ensemble de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Omai. De plus, la mise en production commerciale de la mine polym&eacute;tallique Mobrun a d&eacute;but&eacute; en d&eacute;but d'ann&eacute;e selon le budget et l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ancier pr&eacute;vus. Cette derni&egravere constitue une excellente source de b&eacute;n&eacute;fices et de fonds g&eacute;n&eacute;r&eacute;s par l'exploitation.&quot;<P>

Les travaux d'expansion de l'usine de traitement d'Omai, qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; amorc&eacute;s au premier trimestre de 1995, se poursuivent selon l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ancier pr&eacute;vu. Les travaux de fondations pour les g&eacute;n&eacute;ratrices et le nouveau tunnel d'alimentation du minerai sont en cours et l'&eacute;rection des r&eacute;servoirs CEP (charbon en pulpe) et de lixiviation est compl&eacute;t&eacute;e &agrave; 50&nbsp;%.<P>

Le d&eacute;veloppement du projet zincif&egravere Grevet se d&eacute;roule selon les &eacute;ch&eacute;ances avec une mise en production commerciale pr&eacute;vue au d&eacute;but de 1996. L'&eacute;tude pr&eacute;liminaire d'impact environnemental du projet cuprif&egravere Carlota a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;pos&eacute;e pour audience publique en f&eacute;vrier dernier et nous pr&eacute;voyons recevoir les permis d&eacute;finitifs au deuxi&egraveme semestre de 1995 et ainsi d&eacute;buter les travaux de construction.<P>

Les investissements effectu&eacute;s depuis le d&eacute;but de l'ann&eacute;e se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; <NOBR>52 millions $</NOBR> dont <NOBR>9 millions $</NOBR> sur des projets avanc&eacute;s d'exploration. Nous pr&eacute;voyons d&eacute;poser des &eacute;tudes de pr&eacute;faisabilit&eacute; sur les projets Metates (Or), Gross Rosebel (Or), La Granja (cuivre) et El Pach&oacute;n (cuivre) vers la fin de l'ann&eacute;e 1995.<P>

L'encaisse de <NOBR>142,7 millions $</NOBR> au <NOBR>31 mars 1995</NOBR> procure une excellente base pour poursuivre agressivement la strat&eacute;gie de croissance de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; dans les Am&eacute;riques. &quot;Avec les progr&egraves accomplis &agrave; la mine Omai et une contribution accrue de la mine Doyon pour les prochains trimestres, nous sommes confiants de r&eacute;aliser notre objectif de production pour 1995&quot;, de conclure <NOBR>Louis P. Gignac.</NOBR><P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques. Ses actions et bons de souscription sont inscrits &agrave; la cote des bourses de Montr&eacute;al, Toronto et de l'American Stock Exchange (AMEX) sous les symboles respectifs de CBJ, CBJ.WT et CBJ.WTA.<P>

<CENTER><H2>Augmentation des r&eacute;serves aurif&egraveres de 446&nbsp;000 onces &agrave; la mine&nbsp;Omai</H2></CENTER>

Cambior inc. et Golden Star Resources Ltd. sont heureuses d'annoncer une augmentation des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres de cat&eacute;gories prouv&eacute;e et probable de 9&nbsp;millions de tonnes &agrave; une teneur de <NOBR>1,6 g Au/t,</NOBR> repr&eacute;sentant ainsi <NOBR>446 000 onces</NOBR> d'or <I>in situ.</I> Cette addition provient uniquement des r&eacute;sultats de la campagne de forage de d&eacute;finition effectu&eacute;e dans la partie est de la fosse Wenot. La compilation pour le nouveau calcul des r&eacute;serves a &eacute;t&eacute; bas&eacute;e sur pr&egraves de <NOBR>13 000 m&egravetres</NOBR> de forage, dont <NOBR>8 300 m&egravetres</NOBR> effectu&eacute;s au cours du premier trimestre de 1995.<P>

Tel qu'illustr&eacute; au tableau ci-dessous, les r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres au <NOBR>31 mars 1995</NOBR> ont augment&eacute; de 13&nbsp;% par rapport &agrave; celles de d&eacute;cembre&nbsp;1994 et de 62&nbsp;% par rapport &agrave; celles &eacute;tablies lors de l'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; en 1990. En incluant la production aurif&egravere &agrave; l'usine depuis le d&eacute;but de la production commerciale en janvier&nbsp;1993, le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t de Omai contient pr&egraves de 3,6&nbsp;millions d'onces d'or, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une forte augmentation depuis 1990.<P>

La fosse Wenot demeure ouverte lat&eacute;ralement et l'ensemble de la propri&eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; l'ext&eacute;rieur des fosses Fennell et Wenot n'a pas fait l'objet de programme de forage d'exploration, laissant ainsi pr&eacute;sager un excellent potentiel d'ajout aux r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres. Des forages sont actuellement en cours dans la partie ouest de la fosse Wenot ainsi que pour v&eacute;rifier une anomalie g&eacute;ochimique s'&eacute;tirant sur plus de 1,2&nbsp;kilom&egravetre &agrave; l'est de cette derni&egravere.<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 16 f&eacute;vrier 1995

<CENTER><H2>Cambior annonce un record de production aurif&egravere et de ses revenus en&nbsp;1994</H2></CENTER>

Le revenu total pour l'ann&eacute;e 1994 s'est &eacute;lev&eacute; &agrave; <NOBR>306 millions $,</NOBR> en hausse de 9&nbsp;% par rapport &agrave; 1993. La production aurif&egravere a atteint &eacute;galement un nouveau sommet pour atteindre <NOBR>522 000 onces.</NOBR> La production aurif&egravere a constamment augment&eacute; depuis la cr&eacute;ation de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; en&nbsp;1986.<P>

Les fonds provenant de l'exploitation se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; <NOBR>73 millions $,</NOBR> soit au m&ecirc;me niveau qu'en 1993. Par action, ils ont atteint 1,49&nbsp;$ comparativement &agrave; 1,76&nbsp;$ en 1993. L'augmentation du nombre d'actions &agrave; la suite des &eacute;missions publiques de 1993 explique la dilution par action.<P>

Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net de 1994 a atteint <NOBR>2,5 millions $</NOBR> ou 0,05&nbsp;$ par action par rapport &agrave; <NOBR>15 millions $</NOBR> ou 0,36&nbsp;$ par action en 1993. La baisse du b&eacute;n&eacute;fice r&eacute;sulte de la d&eacute;valuation de <NOBR>16,7 millions $</NOBR> des actifs miniers du placer de Valdez Creek prise au troisi&egraveme trimestre de 1994. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice avant radiation est de <NOBR>19,2 millions $</NOBR> (0,39&nbsp;$ par action), soit une augmentation de 28&nbsp;% par rapport au b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net de 1993. Pour le quatri&egraveme trimestre, le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net a plus que tripl&eacute; par rapport au trimestre correspondant de 1993 pour atteindre <NOBR>7,1 millions $</NOBR> ou 0,15&nbsp;$ par action.

<H3>Commentaires</H3>

La croissance des revenus est due &agrave; une production aurif&egravere accrue de la mine Omai en Guyana, l'appr&eacute;ciation du prix de l'or ainsi que l'impact favorable de la faiblesse du dollar canadien.<P>

Selon Louis P. Gignac, Pr&eacute;sident et chef de la direction, &quot;Les r&eacute;sultats du quatri&egraveme trimestre d&eacute;montrent une meilleure performance de nos activit&eacute;s d'exploitation aux mines Doyon et Omai. Les probl&egravemes temporaires de stabilit&eacute; dans la Zone Principale de la mine Doyon encourus au troisi&egraveme trimestre ont &eacute;t&eacute; contr&ocirc;l&eacute;s et la production de la mine est revenue &agrave; la normale. La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;voit une autre ann&eacute;e record en 1995 pour sa production aurif&egravere avec plus de <NOBR>550 000 onces</NOBR> d'or. La mine Omai devrait g&eacute;n&eacute;rer <NOBR>250 000 onces</NOBR> d'or et notre quote-part de production dans nos mines canadiennes totalisera <NOBR>250 000 onces.</NOBR> La production aurif&egravere du placer de Valdez Creek sera de l'ordre de <NOBR>50 000 onces</NOBR> en 1995 et les activit&eacute;s d'exploitation du placer cesseront tel que pr&eacute;vu au cours de l'ann&eacute;e&quot;.<P>

Au 31 d&eacute;cembre 1994, les r&eacute;serves aurif&egraveres ont &eacute;t&eacute; compl&egravetement renouvel&eacute;es par rapport &agrave; 1993 pour atteindre 3,9&nbsp;millions d'onces d'or <I>in situ.</I> En ajoutant les onces d'or contenues dans les r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres de la mine Mobrun et dans notre quote-part des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres possibles de la mine Doyon, les r&eacute;serves aurif&egraveres totalisent 5&nbsp;millions d'onces, repr&eacute;sentant ainsi une augmentation de 13&nbsp;% par rapport &agrave; 1993.<P>

Pour la septi&egraveme ann&eacute;e cons&eacute;cutive, la compagnie a per&ccedil;u, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; sa politique de protection des revenus, un prix moyen de vente de l'once d'or sup&eacute;rieur au prix du march&eacute;. Pour 1994, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un prix de 539&nbsp;$ Can l'once, soit 15&nbsp;$ Can l'once au-dessus du prix moyen du march&eacute; en 1994. Cambior b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie d'engagements sur les march&eacute;s &agrave; terme lui permettant d'obtenir un prix minimal de <NOBR>407 $ US l'once</NOBR> pour plus de la moiti&eacute; de la production d'or en&nbsp;1995.<P>

Afin de maintenir son rythme de croissance, la compagnie pr&eacute;voit investir <NOBR>300 millions $</NOBR> en 1995 dans les propri&eacute;t&eacute;s au stade de construction et dans les actifs productifs actuels et les projets d'exploration avanc&eacute;s. Ces investissements consistent principalement &agrave; l'expansion de l'usine de traitement de Omai <NOBR>(69 millions $),</NOBR> la mise en construction des projets Grevet <NOBR>(65 millions $)</NOBR> et Carlota <NOBR>(87 millions $),</NOBR> aux travaux d'exploration et de mise en valeur sur les projets avanc&eacute;s <NOBR>(39 millions $)</NOBR> et le solde <NOBR>(40 millions $)</NOBR> aux approfondissements des puits des mines Doyon, Mouska et G&eacute;ant Dormant et aux investissements requis pour nos mines en production.<P>

Enfin, Cambior vient de finaliser cette semaine une facilit&eacute; de cr&eacute;dit de <NOBR>225 millions $ US</NOBR> avec un syndicat de banques. &quot;Cette facilit&eacute; de cr&eacute;dit arrive au moment opportun et reconna&icirc;t la croissance de la capacit&eacute; d'emprunt de Cambior. Une telle facilit&eacute; de cr&eacute;dit, jumel&eacute;e &agrave; l'encaisse qui s'&eacute;l&egraveve &agrave; <NOBR>134 millions $</NOBR> au <NOBR>31 d&eacute;cembre 1994,</NOBR> rencontre tous nos besoins de financement requis pour 1995 et procure une excellente base financi&egravere pour le d&eacute;veloppement de nos futurs projets dans les Am&eacute;riques&quot;, de dire <NOBR>Louis P. Gignac.</NOBR><P>

<CENTER><H2>Cambior annonce ses r&eacute;sultats de production aurif&egravere en&nbsp;1994</H2></CENTER>

Cambior annonce aujourd'hui ses r&eacute;sultats de production aurif&egravere pour l'ann&eacute;e 1994. Quelque <NOBR>522 077 onces</NOBR> d'or ont &eacute;t&eacute; produites en 1994 comparativement &agrave; <NOBR>518 083 onces</NOBR> pour l'ann&eacute;e pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente. Cette hausse s'explique principalement par une augmentation des contributions des mines Omai et G&eacute;ant Dormant ainsi que du placer de Valdez Creek, en d&eacute;pit des fermetures des mines Beauchemin et B&eacute;liveau en 1993 dues &agrave; l'&eacute;puisement des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres.<P>

La ventilation par division de la production aurif&egravere et la quote-part de la production de pentoxyde de niobium pour les ann&eacute;es 1994 et 1993 se pr&eacute;sentent comme suit&nbsp;:<P>

Ayant compl&eacute;t&eacute; une ann&eacute;e enti&egravere de production &agrave; une cadence r&eacute;guli&egravere de traitement de <NOBR>12 800 tonnes</NOBR> par jour, la mine Omai a connu une hausse de 21&nbsp;% pour atteindre <NOBR>250 642 onces.</NOBR> La production aurif&egravere provenant de notre int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de 50&nbsp;% dans la mine Doyon a l&eacute;g&egraverement fl&eacute;chi pour atteindre <NOBR>116 931 onces</NOBR> en 1994 par rapport &agrave; <NOBR>126 514 onces</NOBR> en 1993, en raison de probl&egravemes temporaires de stabilit&eacute; dans la Zone Principale au troisi&egraveme trimestre de 1994. Ces probl&egravemes ont &eacute;t&eacute; contr&ocirc;l&eacute;s au cours du quatri&egraveme trimestre de 1994 et la production de la mine Doyon est revenue &agrave; la normale.<P>


<H3>Perspectives pour 1995</H3>

Cambior pr&eacute;voit produire plus de <NOBR>550 000 onces</NOBR> d'or en 1995. Cette hausse est principalement attribuable &agrave; une contribution accrue de la mine Chimo qui conna&icirc;tra une pleine ann&eacute;e de production. La Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a d&eacute;but&eacute; la production commerciale de la mine Mobrun en janvier&nbsp;1995. La production pr&eacute;vue des m&eacute;taux dans les concentr&eacute;s de Mobrun en 1995 est de <NOBR>25 800 tonnes</NOBR> de zinc, de <NOBR>4 600 tonnes</NOBR> de cuivre, de <NOBR>20 800 onces</NOBR> d'or ainsi que de <NOBR>336 900 onces</NOBR> d'argent.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.

Montr&eacute;al et Denver, le 6 f&eacute;vrier 1995

<CENTER><H2>Le projet aurif&egravere Gross Rosebel affiche de bons r&eacute;sultats de forage en&nbsp;1994</H2></CENTER>

Golden Star Resources Ltd. (&quot;Golden Star&quot;) et Cambior&nbsp;inc. (&quot;Cambior&quot;) sont heureuses d'annoncer les r&eacute;sultats des travaux d'exploration effectu&eacute;s au cours de 1994 sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Gross Rosebel au Suriname. Gross Rosebel couvre une superficie de <NOBR>17 000 hectares</NOBR> et est situ&eacute;e 80&nbsp;kilom&egravetres au sud de la capitale, Paramaribo. Cambior d&eacute;tient une option lui permettant d'acqu&eacute;rir une participation de 50&nbsp;% dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t d&eacute;tenu par Golden Star dans la propri&eacute;t&eacute;. Cambior peut lever son option en injectant <NOBR>6 millions $ US</NOBR> en frais d'exploration et de d&eacute;veloppement d'ici le <NOBR>30 juin 1996.</NOBR><P>

Les partenaires sont heureux des r&eacute;sultats des travaux d'exploration effectu&eacute;s en 1994. Les d&eacute;penses d'exploration pr&eacute;vues en 1995 seront de <NOBR>3,7 millions $ US.</NOBR> L'objectif est de poursuivre les forages d'exploration et de d&eacute;finition afin d'&eacute;tablir, en 1995, des r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute; Gross Rosebel.<P>

Les travaux d'exploration ex&eacute;cut&eacute;s en 1994 ont &eacute;t&eacute; effectu&eacute;s dans deux zones contigu&euml;s, soit le bloc nord et le bloc sud.<P>


<H4>R&eacute;sultats du bloc nord</H4>

La min&eacute;ralisation aurif&egravere du bloc nord est localis&eacute;e dans trois filons de quartz carbonat&eacute;s situ&eacute;s dans des zones cisaill&eacute;es et pliss&eacute;es. D'importantes concentrations aurif&egraveres ont &eacute;t&eacute; retrac&eacute;es pr&egraves des m&eacute;tasediments et des roches volcaniques m&eacute;tamorphis&eacute;es.<P>

En 1994, des tranch&eacute;es creus&eacute;es dans les zones Pay Caro, East Pay Caro, Koolhoven et &quot;J&quot; ont report&eacute; des valeurs aurif&egraveres de fa&ccedil;on sporadique. Les analyses des tranch&eacute;es de Koolhoven portaient sur 19,4&nbsp;m&egravetres d'une moyenne de <NOBR>1,5 g Au/t,</NOBR> 26,2&nbsp;m&egravetres &agrave; <NOBR>1,8 g Au/t,</NOBR> 12,1&nbsp;m&egravetres &agrave; <NOBR>2,4 g Au/t</NOBR> et 10,8&nbsp;m&egravetres &agrave; <NOBR>1,3 g Au/t.</NOBR> Une zone de min&eacute;ralisation semblable, mais distincte, a &eacute;t&eacute; identifi&eacute;e dans une tranch&eacute;e d'environ 300&nbsp;m&egravetres au nord, qui incluait 20,2&nbsp;m&egravetres &agrave; <NOBR>1,6 g Au/t</NOBR> et 27,6&nbsp;m&egravetres &agrave; <NOBR>1,2 g Au/t.</NOBR> Une zone plus &eacute;troite de min&eacute;ralisation aurif&egravere a &eacute;t&eacute; trouv&eacute;e dans une tranch&eacute;e situ&eacute;e dans la zone &quot;J&quot;, qui exposait 11&nbsp;m&egravetres &agrave; <NOBR>18,5 g Au/t.</NOBR><P>

Deux des cinq zones aurif&egraveres identifi&eacute;es, les zones Pay Caro et East Pay Caro ont fait l'objet de forage en 1994. $Agrave; Pay Caro, cinquante trous de forage ont v&eacute;rifi&eacute; sur 800&nbsp;m&egravetres une anomalie aurif&egravere d'une dimension de 1&nbsp;200 sur 110&nbsp;m&egravetres. Les trous ont &eacute;t&eacute; for&eacute;s dans des sections de 100&nbsp;m&egravetres &agrave; environ 25&nbsp;m&egravetres d'espacement. Les quatre sections comprenaient les intersections suivantes&nbsp;:<P>

Montr&eacute;al, le 23 janvier 1995

<CENTER><H2>Le conseil d'administration de Cambior approuve l'investissement final requis pour compl&eacute;ter la mise en pr&eacute;-production du projet Grevet</H2></CENTER>

Le Conseil d'administration de Cambior&nbsp;inc. a approuv&eacute; un investissement de <NOBR>62 millions $</NOBR> afin de compl&eacute;ter le programme de pr&eacute;-production du projet Grevet qui a d&eacute;but&eacute; en juin dernier. Cambior est l'unique propri&eacute;taire de ce projet polym&eacute;tallique situ&eacute; &agrave; proximit&eacute; de la ville de Lebel-sur-Qu&eacute;villon dans le nord-ouest du Qu&eacute;bec.<P>

Rappelons que le Conseil d'administration avait approuv&eacute; en juin dernier, &agrave; la suite des r&eacute;sultats du programme souterrain d'exploration, l'&eacute;tude de rentabilit&eacute; pour la mise en production du projet Grevet pour un investissement de <NOBR>80 millions $.</NOBR> Le Conseil d'administration avait alors autoris&eacute; une premi&egravere tranche de l'investissement pour un montant de <NOBR>18 millions $</NOBR> afin de compl&eacute;ter les travaux requis au second semestre de 1994. Ces travaux consistaient &agrave; compl&eacute;ter le fon&ccedil;age du puits et &agrave; poursuivre les travaux d'infrastructures souterraines et de surface. L'approbation de la derni&egravere tranche d'investissement de <NOBR>62 millions $,</NOBR> &eacute;tait conditionnelle &agrave; l'obtention des permis environnementaux, &agrave; l'&eacute;volution du prix du march&eacute; du zinc de m&ecirc;me qu'&agrave; l'obtention d'assistance financi&egravere gouvernementale.<P>

Depuis, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; a obtenu les permis environnementaux et est actuellement en discussion avec les gouvernements f&eacute;d&eacute;ral et provincial concernant les aides financi&egraveres qu'elle pourrait obtenir pour les infrastructures &agrave; caract&egravere public du projet. De plus, la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; se r&eacute;jouit de l'&eacute;volution positive du march&eacute; du zinc depuis le troisi&egraveme trimestre de 1994 de m&ecirc;me que du prix du cuivre depuis le d&eacute;but de&nbsp;1994.<P>

Les travaux pour compl&eacute;ter le programme de pr&eacute;-production consisteront au d&eacute;veloppement des infrastructures souterraines, &agrave; la pr&eacute;paration des chantiers, &agrave; l'achat d'&eacute;quipements miniers et aux infrastructures de surface dont notamment la construction d'un concentrateur d'une capacit&eacute; de <NOBR>2 500 tonnes</NOBR> m&eacute;triques par jour. Les travaux se termineront en d&eacute;cembre&nbsp;1995 et la production commerciale est pr&eacute;vue pour le premier trimestre de 1996.<P>

La production annuelle moyenne est estim&eacute;e &agrave; <NOBR>134 000 tonnes</NOBR> m&eacute;triques de concentr&eacute; de zinc d'une teneur de 54&nbsp;% et de <NOBR>12 700 tonnes</NOBR> m&eacute;triques de cuivre d'une teneur de 26&nbsp;%. Les taux de r&eacute;cup&eacute;ration sont &eacute;valu&eacute;s &agrave; 95&nbsp;% pour le zinc et &agrave; 81&nbsp;% pour le cuivre.<P>

Les r&eacute;serves mini&egraveres de cat&eacute;gories probable et possible sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es &agrave; <NOBR>10 965 000 tonnes</NOBR> m&eacute;triques &agrave; une teneur de <NOBR>8,5 % Zn,</NOBR> <NOBR>0,45 % Cu,</NOBR> <NOBR>35 g Ag/t</NOBR> et <NOBR>0,09 g Au/t</NOBR> assurant ainsi une long&eacute;vit&eacute; de 12&nbsp;ans &agrave; la mine. Cambior pr&eacute;voit employer environ 300&nbsp;personnes durant la p&eacute;riode de construction et 200&nbsp;personnes lorsque la mine aura atteint le stade de production commerciale.<P>

Cambior est une importante soci&eacute;t&eacute; aurif&egravere avec des activit&eacute;s d'exploitation et d'exploration au Canada, aux &Eacute;tats-Unis, en Guyana et certains autres pays des Am&eacute;riques.

        <hr width="98%">
        <p>With winter approaching and the outdoor work winding
        down, you can start to plan for next season. This lawn
        grass selector from our 3D Landscape CD-ROM will help you
        choose the right grass for your lawn. Some things to
        consider: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Climate</b> - In southern states, most people
                plant &quot;warm-season&quot; grasses, such as
                Bermuda grass. These grasses thrive in hot
                summers and go dormant and brown in winter. In
                the North, most people plant
                &quot;cool-season&quot; grasses, such as Kentucky
                bluegrass. These grow best in spring and fall but
                stay green when given summer watering. </li>
            <li><b>Growth speed</b> - Some grasses fill in more
                quickly than others, spreading rapidly by
                rhizomes (underground horizontal stems) or
                stolons (above-ground horizontal stems). If you
                want a lawn instantly, lay sod instead of sowing
                seeds. </li>
            <li><b>Watering</b> - In areas with little or no
                summer rainfall, look for drought-tolerant
                grasses. </li>
            <li><b>Maintenance</b> - If you don't have much time,
                avoid grasses that need heavy fertilizing, must
                be mowed closely (and therefore frequently), or
                are susceptible to diseases. Newer dwarf
                varieties need less mowing and fertilizing than
                traditional grasses. </li>
            <li><b>Shade/sun</b> - Some grasses tolerate shade
                better than others. If your lawn area is shady,
                plant a shade-tolerant grass or a mixture or
                blend that includes one. </li>
            <li><b>Foot traffic</b> - You'll need a more wear
                resistant grass for a lawn where children play or
                people walk frequently. </li>
        </ul>

                kitchen's walls and floor space to determine how
                much cabinetry your kitchen can hold. If your
                current cabinets already provide enough storage,
                could they be more efficient with a different
                layout? Think about the kitchen tasks you do and
                where you do them, and then list the kitchenware
                and ingredients you'd like to store nearby. A
                tall mixer may call for an appliance garage; an
                oversized platter may need a tall cabinet with
                dividers. </font><p><font face="Arial">If your
                current cabinets don't provide enough storage,

                The most effective way to ease crowding is to
                discard little-used items and move non-essentials
                -- such as fine china -- outside the immediate

        <blockquote>
            <p>Books That Work, founded in 1992, is a pioneering
            and award-winning developer of compelling and
            easy-to-use interactive software for home consumers.
            The company develops, publishes, and markets a
            branded line of software titles that guide customers
            through the design, visualization, and building
            processes of home-related projects including decks,
            landscapes, gardens, kitchens, and whole houses. </p>
            <p>The company's products provide a new and unique
            experience - more engaging than print or video - to
            individuals who enjoy using home computers for
            activities besides work. High quality 3D
            visualization is the central element of this
            experience. Our approach results in products that are
            useful and entertaining primarily because they
            encourage experimentation and learning about home
            environments. </p>

        <h3>Company Mission</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Books That Work is a leading provider of software
            products and technology to the consumer
            &quot;shelter&quot; publishing market. The company
            develops and publishes a branded line of software
            titles and Web Sites that guide home owners through
            the design, visualization, and building processes of
            major remodeling projects, including decks,
            landscapes, gardens, kitchens and whole houses. </p>
            <p>The company's products and Web Sites provide a
            unique and valuable &quot;new media&quot; experience
            - more engaging than print or video. Photorealistic
            visualization based on 3D graphics technology is the
            central element of this experience. We believe that
            the design and visualization experience is engaging
            and entertaining to customers because it encourages
            experimentation and learning. </p>

            <h3>Product Development</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Our development philosophy combines a consumer
                orientation (i.e., intuitive and easy to use)
                with the best possible technologies - and an
                editorial voice. Books That Work assembles
                leading edge technologies - including 3D solid
                modeling, graphics rendering, custom database
                design and networking software - to provide
                dramatically new capabilities to home computer
                users.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Market Direction</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>We are the leading developer in a new consumer
                software market category. While the broader
                market divides mostly into games and education,
                we are pioneering an emerging segment that is
                focused on lifestyles and hobbies. Gardening, for
                example, is the most popular leisure activity in
                the United States. Consumer home remodeling
                expenditures presently top $80 billion per year,
                and are increasing by more than 10 percent
                annually. Home computer ownership now exceeds 35
                percent of American housholds. </p>
                <p>To take advantage of these trends, we are
                expanding and redefining the use of 3D design and
                visualization software in the home market. </p>
                <p>Customers can use our products to design for
                practical purposes, such as actually building (or
                contracting with a professional to build) designs
                that they have created on their home computers.
                Books That Work's design tools are just as
                compelling to individuals who are interested in
                having fun with new ways of learning and being
                creative. </p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Distribution</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Books That Work currently sells its products
                through software distributors, major computer and
                software retailers, consumer electronic stores,
                discount warehouse stores, bookstores, mail order
                companies, and the home improvement retail
                channel. </p>

Welcome to the Land of the Squishy, a gallery of pictures created
by me just for fun.
Feel free to steal these pictures for your own use - just make
sure to take a look at the Redistribution Info page.
For all of you budding computer artists, take a look at the
Technical Information page.
<p>
The above pictures are selected at random whenever I get the urge to change them
throughout the day.  This process will once again be automated someday soon.
<HR>
Each of the following is a gallery of 9 (or so) thumbnails, each linked to
a larger version of the image:

<H2>Welcome to the Land of the Rock</H2>
<HR>
This is a set of simple, yet very interesting, pictures of a rock
in an ocean, and a kind of weird rock blimp next to an island.
These were some of my first experiments in Bryce 2.

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>David Elliott's Squishnical Information</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<H2>How in the heck did I do it?</H2>
<HR>
There are 3 basic environments I work in for these pictures: PhotoShop,
KPT Bryce, and Ray Dream Designer.
<HR>
At the top of the Land of the Squishy home page, there are 3 small
images, which have all been created by Alien Skin TextureShop, which
is a really neat PhotoShop plug-in from Virtus.
These change every hour, and are picked randomly from a small but
growing set of textures.
<HR>
<a href="pix/pinkb.jpg"> <img src=tn/tnpinkb.gif>67K  </a>
This picture was done in KPT Bryce, and is an example of what you
can do in Bryce that doesn't look like a landscape.
It's really as simple as it looks - a reflective sphere on a
crusty black ground - but I think the effect is pretty striking.
<HR>
<a href="pix/nstep.jpg"> <img src=tn/tnnstep.gif>83K  </a>
The tubes were created by selecting rectangles, feathering them,
running KPT Gradients on Paths, and then playing with inverting
the colors.
I think I may have used KPT Video Cyclone somewhere
in there, as well.
The background is a KPT Texture Explorer texture painted with
Paint Alchemy.
<HR>
<a href="pix/csp.jpg"> <img src=tn/tncsp.gif>139K  </a>
Another KPT Bryce picture, this one is a real favorite of a lot
of people.
The mountain is the island stretched and moved a few hundred
miles away.
The sea and sky are pretty standard fare for Bryce.
The balls are reflective, but they also have their own clouds inside
of them.
<HR>
<a href="pix/m1.jpg"> <img src=tn/tnm1.gif>197K  </a>
The idea is based on Mondrian's work, but with textures instead
of solid colors.
I flipped several coins to decide how large each rectangle
would be, and then used Alien Skin TextureShop to generate
the textures.
While this one is not particularly popular, I'm going to give
this another try soon.
<HR>
<p>
This is the end for now.
Stay tuned for more tech pages.

All of the pictures here are Copyright 1994, 1995, David C. Elliott.
<p>
If you want to use them in your Web site, in your product,
on your living room wall, on your next album cover, or whatever
comes to mind, you have my permission.
<p>
You don't even need to ask, though I enjoy getting email as much as
anyone.
However, if you sell something that contains my pictures, I would like
a free copy.
Don't try to sell me a discount copy or advertising space - this is
my hobby, and I pay enough for it already!  ;-)  (<- Too lazy to put in a
smiley face image.)
<p>
If you use a picture on your Web site, I'd appreciate a link back
to my home page.
<p>
If you need to contact me, my email addresses are dce@btw.com and
dce@netcom.com.
I have also been known as unc!dce, tektronix!tekecs!dce, dce@mips.com,
dce@solbourne.com, and dce@smsc.sony.com, and my family and some friends
call me Tiger.
<p>
Otherwise, I am not the David Elliott you know.  If he is on the net,
he's one of the other 20 or so David Elliotts, and he would be glad
to hear from you.

<p>To download the 3D Home Explorer and 3D Kitchen sample
designs, you will need a 486 or Pentium PC running Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95. Then just follow these directions: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Click on the button below to download the file, <b>3DHE.EXE</b>
        that will install <b>just</b> 3D Home Explorer. This file
        is 606 KB in size. <p>If you are using Microsoft's
        Internet Explorer, you will be asked if you wish to <b>Open</b>
        the file. Choose to do so. The 3D Home Explorer setup
        program will be automatically started. </p>
        <p align="left">Other web browsers will ask you where to
        save the file. Choose a convenient location on your hard
        disk. After the file is downloaded, use the File Manager,
        or Windows 95 Explorer to run it by double clicking on <b>3DHE.EXE</b>
        in the directory where you saved it. </p>

        border="0" width="150" height="56"></a> </p>
    </li>
    <li>Next you need to download the kitchen design files you
        wish to explore. Click on the name of the kitchen below
        to download the design file for that kitchen. <p>Note
        these files are self-extracting ZIP files. You will need
        to save them to your hard disk, then execute them to
        extract the kitchen design file. </p>

<p>Position the spray sprinklers in smaller lawn or shrub areas
such as the front yard. Spray sprinklers are also available in
two versions. One pops up when in use and back down when not in
use. The pop-up version is recommended for areas where foot
traffic or mowing is likely to occur. The other version is
mounted on a cut-off or pipe riser high enough to throw water
over shrubs or ground cover areas. Spray sprinklers are available
in full, half and quarter circle patterns as well as end strip,
sidestrip and centerstrip patterns. They are adjustable for
distance of throw. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="gifs/sssp.gif" width="152"
height="128"> </p>

<p>Full, half and quarter circle spray sprinklers give full
coverage with no water wasted on sidewalks or other areas not to
be watered. </p>

<h2 align="center">CLOSED CASE SPRINKLERS (ROTORS)</h2>

<p>Closed Case Sprinklers are available in pop-up models only.
These sprinklers provide the best coverage when each head throws
all the way to the next head (100% overlap) in all directions.
They are recommended for any open lawn or ground cover area
measuring 25'x 25' or larger. They are excellent in grit, sand
and heavy grass environments. Model TDR-2 features a 3/4&quot;
inlet and 2 easy-to-change nozzles. </p>

<p>Closed Case Sprinklers are adjustable for part circle and full
circle patterns. They are also adjustable for distance of throw. </p>

<p>NOTE: Corner Sprinklers should be adjusted to cover a
quartercircle; sprinklers along the sides shouldbe adjusted to
cover a half circle,and center sprinklers should be adjusted to
cover a full circle pattern. </p>

</p>

<p>Use the table below to determine maximum spacing. If the area
does not divide evenly, spacethe sprinklers closer together. Be
sure not to exceed the maximum spacing. Since Closed Case
Sprinklers provide the best coverage when spaced for 100%
overlap, use a modification of the <a href="choose.htm#60percent">60%
Rule</a>. </p>

<p><a name="mod60percent"><b>Modified 60% Percent Rule</b>: When
100% overlap is not possible, position sprinklers so there is
100% overlap in at least one direction. When spacing in all other
directions, follow the </a><a href="choose.htm#60percent">60%
Rule</a>. </p>

<p>Impulse Sprinklers are available in two versions: </p>

<ul>
    <li>The Pop-Up version is recommended for any open lawn area
        where foot traffic and mowing are likely to occur. </li>
    <li>The other version of Impulse Sprinklers is mounted on a
        cutoff or pipe riser high enough to throw water over
        shrubs or ground cover areas. These are usually installed
        next to fences or among bushes. </li>
</ul>

<p>Impulse Sprinklers are adjustable for part circle and full
circle patterns. They are also adjustable for distance of throw. </p>

<p>NOTE: Corner sprinklers should be adjusted to cover a quarter
circle; sprinklers along the sides should be adjusted to cover a
half circle, and center sprinklers should be adjusted to cover a
full circle pattern. </p>

        companies ever achieve. </p>
        <p>While we expect both parties win from such an effort,

        Affiliate and Books That Work. </p>
        <p>We'll deliver to you a professional sales force,
        seasoned in the business of selling computer software to
        a variety of resellers and channels. We'll provide
        regular data on sell through, on hand inventories,
        marketing trends and industry developments. We can even

        New Internet-Enhanced Home Design Product:<br>
        <i>Visual Home</i></h3>
        <h4 align="center"><em>Company Partners with Major
        Manufacturers to<br>
        Deliver 3D Models on the Internet</em></h4>
        <p>PALO ALTO, Calif., August 1, 1996 -- Books That Work,
        the leading publisher of home and garden software, today
        announced <i>Visual Home</i>, the first Internet-enhanced
        3D home and interior design CD-ROM for consumers. With
        Visual Home you can experiment with your remodeling and
        redecorating ideas, create your own floorplan, and
        visualize your dream home. Visual Home provides the
        largest - and only expandable - collection of 3D models,
        and floor, wall, and fabric coverings of any product in
        its class. </p>
        <p>The CD contains more than 2,000 3D models of
        furnishings and appliances and 1,000 material textures.
        Plus, the new Visual Home Web site (<a
        href="http://visualhome.com">http://visualhome.com</a>)
        offers free model and material collections from leading
        home furnishing manufacturers. Visual Home users can
        download these models and materials onto their own PCs.
        Visual Home makes it possible to see how a new appliance,
        or cabinet will fit into your existing home before it
        arrives on the delivery truck. </p>
        <p><b>A Fast, New Approach</b> </p>
        <p>Visual Home features a revolutionary new way to input
        designs into a computer. QuickDesign Wizard makes it
        possible to create a room layout in just four simple
        steps. This feature takes you through the process of
        determining your rooms, arranging a floorplan, and adding
        doors and windows so that you can quickly get to the
        creative stage of refining your layout, adding
        furnishings, and decorating. Visual Home also includes
        Netscape Navigator 2.01 and will be available in August
        on CD-ROM for Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 at retail
        stores nationwide for around $60. </p>
        <p><b>The Only Internet-Enhanced Home Design Software</b>

        <p>Visual Home is the only home design product that
        integrates on-line product information from the Internet
        with a software design tool at the desktop. Most
        importantly, Visual Home users can download additional
        new 3D models, materials, sample files, and background
        scenes directly off the Net. &quot;We're partnering with
        leading home product manufacturers such as General
        Electric Appliances, Delta Faucet, and Merillat Cabinets
        to develop 3D model collections of their
        products,&quot;said Dan Levin, co-founder and President
        of Books That Work. &quot;As these manufacturers release
        new products, you'll be able to update Visual Home with
        their latest models.&quot; To download new models off the
        Internet, you simply click on a button which launches
        Netscape Navigator software (bundled free with Visual
        Home) and brings up Books That Work's dedicated Web site
        at <a href="http://visualhome.com">http://visualhome.com</a>.
        &quot;We see this as a great opportunity for consumers to
        try out our products within the virtual world of their
        present or future home,&quot; said Stuart Scott, Director
        of Marketing Information Technology at General Electric
        Appliances. </p>
        <p>A second Internet-related feature addresses the
        hundreds of home product manufacturers and service
        providers who do maintain corporate Web sites. Concise
        descriptions and hot links are provided to these sites
        from virtually every 3D model within Visual Home. With a
        mouse-click, Visual Home becomes your specialized browser
        to home remodeling information, worldwide. </p>
        <p><b>Realistic 3D Views</b> </p>
        <p>Utilizing full-color 3D rendering, combined with the
        2,000 3D models and 1,000 materials that are included
        with the product, Visual Home provides an easy way to
        transform a picture in your mind to an on-screen design. </p>
        <p><b>System Requirements</b> </p>
        <p>Visual Home requires a 486DX/66 or higher IBM PC or
        compatible, Windows 95 with 8 MB RAM or Windows 3.1
        with 16 MB RAM, 3 MB free hard disk space, and a VGA
        monitor capable of displaying 256 color or more, and a
        CD-ROM drive. A 14.4k bps modem for optional Internet
        connection and a sound card are recommended. </p>

        <p><font size="3">PALO ALTO, Calif., October 17, 1995 --
        Books That Work today released <i>3D Kitchen,</i> the
        most advanced 3D design and visualization consumer
        software package available. <i>3D Kitchen</i> lets you

        shading in a dream kitchen that you design. With its
        ability to provide near photo realistic rendering of 3D
        scenes, <i>3D Kitchen</i> lets you 'walk around' your
        design and see how it looks from any angle. Before <i>3D
        Kitchen</i>, such visualization capabilities were
        available only to professionals designers who use
        commercial computer workstations. </font></p>
        <p><font size="3"><i>3D Kitchen</i> will inspire the
        creative imagination of both novices and experienced
        professionals. Developed in collaboration with designers
        certified by the National Kitchen &amp; Bath Association,

        CD-ROM for Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 at retail
        computer and software stores nationwide for around
        $50.00. </font></p>
        <h4><font size="3">Design and Visualize in 3D Then
        WalkAbout(TM)</font></h4>
        <p><font size="3"><i>3D Kitchen</i> represents the next

        computers. With <i>3D Kitchen</i> you create and enjoy
        your own 3D world in a completely new way by using
        WalkAbout(TM) technology from Books That Work.

        your kitchen you can instantly track your budget using
        the <i>3D Kitchen's</i> Budget Thermometer. <i>3D Kitchen</i>
        also generates a Shopping List - complete with built-in
        pricing - for your design. </font></p>
        <h4><font size="3">Multimedia Design Guide Offers
        Professional Guidance</font></h4>
        <p><font size="3"><i>3D Kitchen </i>features a multimedia
        Design Guide. This electronic book helps you make the
        most important decisions for your kitchen, including key
        design concepts like the 'kitchen triangle', determining
        the right countertop height, and lighting placement. The
        Design Guide also provides expert advice on materials
        selection, styles and colors, and working with
        contractors. It is filled with useful short videos and
        animations. For example, one animated sequence transforms
        an ordinary kitchen into a French country chef's delight
        with just a few touches. </font></p>

        Improvement Encyclopedia: </h3>
        <h4 align="center"><em>CD-ROM Now Provides Instant Access
        to the World Wide Web </em></h4>
        <p>PALO ALTO, Calif., March 11, 1996  Books That
        Work, the leading multimedia publisher of home and garden
        software, today released <i>Home Improvement Encyclopedia</i>.
        Home Improvement Encyclopedia contains multimedia
        demonstrations on hundreds of home improvement projects.
        Expert advice is presented with clear and concise
        explanations using videos, animations and photos that
        give you step-by-step guidance to get the job done right
        the first time. </p>
        <p>Home Improvement Encyclopedia also includes Netscape
        Navigator 2.0 software for one-button access to the
        Internet. By linking to the Internet, you can explore
        Books That Work's Home Improvement Connection, part of
        our ever-expanding on-line home and garden information
        service. <i>Home Improvement Encyclopedia</i> is
        available on CD-ROM for Windows<sup></sup> 3.1 and
        Windows<sup></sup> 95 at retail computer and software
        stores, home centers and bookstores nationwide for around
        $30.00. </p>
        <p><b>A New CD-ROM/Internet Hybrid</b> </p>
        <p>Home Improvement Encyclopedia represents an innovative
        use of Netscape Navigator software. Once Navigator is
        installed on your PC you can use it to browse the
        hundreds of home improvement topics that are stored on
        the CD-ROM. It is not necessary to go on line to access
        the information on the CD-ROM. If you have Internet
        access, however, you can log on and jump directly from a
        particular topic on the CD-ROM to a related site on the
        World Wide Web. If you don't already have Internet access
        you can register with Concentric Network Corporation, a
        national Internet service provider, that offers a range
        of low-cost network access plans. </p>
        <p>Home Improvement Encyclopedia is the successor to
        Books That Work's award-winning Home Repair Encyclopedia.
        Significant enhancements to this new CD-ROM include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Netscape Navigator 2.0 installs with CD. </li>
            <li>Access to Books That Work Home Improvement
                Connection directory of home-related Web sites. </li>
            <li>New home improvement content, including major
                outdoor projects such as decks, yard structures
                and landscapes. </li>
            <li>The Home Inspector. This new software feature
                interviews you about your style and attitude
                toward getting the job done. Then it builds a
                personal profile of you and your home's unique
                quirks and creates a custom to-do list for
                seasonal maintenance. </li>
            <li>Special purpose calculators for selecting and
                estimating materials like paint and adhesives so
                you'll buy the correct amount of the right
                materials every time. </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>A New Way to Browse the Internet</b> </p>
        <p>Web sites on home improvement related topics are at
        your fingertips with the click of a button. For example,
        if you are looking to replace a faucet on a sink, Home
        Improvement Encyclopedia will show you a full motion
        animation on how to do the job with details on using the
        correct tools and identify Internet Web sites where more
        information on faucets can be found. By clicking on one
        of the Web sites, like the Faucet Outlet (at
        http://www.faucet.com), you can immediately see and
        review information on all types of faucets available from
        various manufacturers. </p>
        <p><b>System Requirements</b> </p>
        <p><i>Home Repair Encyclopedia </i>requires a CD-ROM
        drive (double speed or higher), a 486 or higher IBM PC or
        100% compatible, 8MB RAM, 13MB free hard disk space, VGA
        monitor, and Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. A 14.4k bps modem
        for optional Internet connection, and a sound card are
        recommended. </p>

        Investment from Hearst New Media</h3>
        <p>PALO ALTO, Calif., July 10, 1995 -- Books That Work, a
        leading multimedia software publisher of home and garden
        titles, today announced that Hearst New Media increased
        its minority stake in the company on June 28, 1995. The
        investment comes at a time when Books That Work's 3D
        Landscape and Home Repair Encyclopedia CD-ROM titles are
        selling at record volumes in the software retail channel.
        Books That Work is working with Hearst New Media to
        co-publish a new version of the Popular Mechanics New Car
        Buyers Guide to be released later this year. This title
        is a leader in its category. Other joint opportunities
        with Hearst New Media's HomeArts group are under
        consideration. </p>
        <p>Books That Work will leverage the investment in two
        strategic areas. The company will continue to develop
        products using advanced 3D graphics technology for the
        adult consumer market. Books That Work will also continue
        its pioneering work with networking technology including
        both marketing and revenue opportunities on Hearst's
        HomeArts online service, the World Wide Web, and the
        Microsoft Network. </p>
        <p>Books That Work, Inc., based in Palo Alto, CA, is an
        award-winning developer and publisher of interactive
        software for home consumers. The titles focus on projects

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">ABOUT SOIL: </a></h2>

<p><i>Dirt</i> is what you track into the house. <i>Soil</i> is a
complex growing medium that holds moisture and nutrients for
plants. It is composed of organic and mineral particles, also
known as called mico-organisms, bacteria and ground stone, or as
living and non-living matter. It has structure and chemical
balance. Some soils are better than others for growing plants,
and some types are better than others for particular plants. You
can improve the soil in your garden, both in terms of chemical
makeup and in terms of structure, if need be, with <i>garden
soils, soilless mixes, &quot;pro-mixes,&quot; topsoil, soil</i> <i>amendments</i>,
<i>or conditioners,</i> all sold at garden centers. To better
understand what these products are and how to use them, it is
important to understand the three primary soil types, <i>sand,
clay, </i>and<i> loam, </i>each of which has differently sized
mineral particles and texture. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">TYPES OF SOIL: </a></h2>

<p><b>-</b><i>Clay soil</i>is composed of the smallest particles
found in soils. It is referred to as a <i>heavy</i>soil. When
wet, the particles in clay stick to each other, making it
impervious to water and, for that matter, plants. When dry, it
becomes hard and often cracks. Clay soil contains little air, and
water does not drain easily through it: it needs to be loosened
or opened up. Humus--fully decayed organic matter such as bark or
peat moss--or other organic matter, gypsum, or peat moss can be
added to clay soil to make it lighter, to prevent its tendency to
stick together and pack down, and to allow water to drain though.</p>

<p>-<i>Sandy soil</i>is composed of the largest particles found
in soil. It is referred to as a <i>light</i>soil. When wet, the
particles do not stick to each other and water flows easily
through sandy soils, along with fertilizers and other nutrients.
Because it has such good drainage, sandy soil may not retain
enough moisture for good plant growth. Sandy soil can also be
improved by adding humus (organic material) to help it retain
more moisture. The organic humus which is added to sandy soil to
improve its texture for plants needs to be replenished every few
years, as it has a tendency to wash away.</p>

<p><i>Silt soils</i>are composed of particles in sizes between
that of sand and clay, and are not considered a separate type. </p>

<p><b>-</b><i>Loam soils</i>are composed of a balanced mixture of
the particles found in clay and sand with organic matter. Loam is
good for plant growth because it is open and retains moisture
well. Loam soils are what every gardener wants, and surprisingly,
consist of about 50% open pore space that can be filled with air
and water. That's good <i>tilth</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">A Note About Soil Tests: </a></h2>

<p>A <i>soil test</i><u>,</u> in which a few tablespoons of soil
in solution are chemically analysed, determines the composition
of your soil in terms of the exact type of soil, the percentages
of various nutrients in the soil, and the pH of a soil. </p>

<p><i>pH</i> is a chemical term (potential hydrogen) for
relative acidity (low pH, or &quot;sour&quot;) or alkalinity
(high pH, or &quot;sweet&quot;) on a scale of 0 to 14, with 7
being neutral. It is probably the most important test for you.
The range for the average garden is 6.0 to 7.5, and experts
disagree as to what is the absoute best range, though most
nutrients are availble to the plants in a range between 6.0 to
6.8. Essentially, pH level affects the solubility of the
nutrients, which allows them to travel through the soil into the
plant roots. An extreme pH prevents the plants from getting the
nutrients they need.</p>

<p>Soil tests can be done with a variety of <b>meters</b> or <b>kits</b>
<b>(Chapter 8)</b>, for free or at a nominal fee by your local <b>Cooperative
Extension Service</b> <b>(Appendix B), </b>or at a private
laboratory (listed in the Yellow Pages under
&quot;Labs-Soil&quot;. Lab tests are more accurate than kit
tests, of course. If you have not had your soil tested, do so
before adding any fertilizer or additive to your garden. A soil
test is one of the few ways of determining the amount of
phosphorus, potash, and nitrogen in your soil, as well as the
acidity. This is important information when choosing a fertilizer
as they raise or lower the pH depending on their ingredients.
Consider tests a one-time effort, or at most something to be done
every three or four years as a search for problems, usually in
the autumn or spring.</p>

<p>If you know your soil pH and the level that is optimum for the
plants you are growing, you can then choose <b>fertilizers
(Chapter 3)</b> which will maintain a good pH level for your
plants. For example, for plants like azaleas, rhododendron,
heaths, and heathers prefer a more acidic soil (with a lower pH)
so you want to buy fertilizers which keep the pH lower. Without a
soil test, though you may be able to judge needs from the
appearance of your lawn or plants, you could be paying a lot for
special fertilizers that contain trace elements or nutrients that
are already present in your soil, or worse yet, not buying the
fertilizers that could provide the nutrients lacking in your
soil. However, the most typical choice for <u>raising</u> the pH
is to add <b>lime (below)</b>, and to <u>lower</u> it, to add
sulfur in various forms, like <b>aluminum sulfate (below).</b>
The amount you need to add is noted on the package of whatever
kind of product you are using. For example, to raise the pH of
sandy soil by 1, you need to add 7-1/2 oz of ground limestone per
square yard, but for clayey soil, you need to add 15 oz. To lower
it by 1pH, that is, to increase the acidity, approximately 2-3/4
oz of aluminum sulfate are needed per square yard (1 lb of sulfur
per 100 square feet), or 6 lbs of manure. There are many other
products and measures that you can use; this is provided just to
give some perspective, and all take different times to achieve
this effect, from a few days to a few months. Check your labels
and general gardening reference books. (Use only granular sulfur
for broadcast spreading). More or less has to be used depending
on the type of soil (sandy or clayey) that you have.</p>

<p>Each level of pH represents ten times the concentration,
either way: a pH of 5.0 is ten times as acid as a level of 6.0.
However, levels can be changed only very slowly, which is
nature's way of maintaining a normal level to begin with. Organic
matter in soil buffers the pH level and holds the nutrients.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT PACKAGED SOILS </a></h2>

<p>Few gardeners have soil in their gardens that is suitable for
houseplants or seed starting. Indoor gardening, with its
intensive watering, puts a strain on soil requirements that are
met by the specialized soils below. Some are mere refinements of
a suitable all-purpose blend, so it becomes a matter of personal
style if you must have a particular type or brand of soil for a
particular type of plant. Mixing your own can be fun and
sometimes better. Buy larger packages; smaller ones always cost
much more per pound.</p>

<p>Growing mediums are literally anything you can grow a plant
in, and are generally used to refer to those mediums that do not
contain soil.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">POTTING SOIL </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: House Plant Soil</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Ready-to-use soil that is a sterile mixture of
organic and inorganic ingredients such as peat moss, compost, and
vermiculite. Sold in packages that range in size from two to
twenty pounds. Some contain small amounts of slow-release
fertilizer and trace elements and are sold in bags that are meant
to be used as planters. Sterile potting soils have been heated
over 180<sup>o</sup> to kill bacteria and weed seed.</p>

<p>USE: Good for houseplants and for starting seeds. Gardens need
bacteria and microorganisms found in non-sterile soils.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Good potting soil re-wets better than plain soil. If
it dries out, it won't pull away so much from the sides of the
pot.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Soils intended for interior use should be
sterilized, but it is not necessary for general exterior use for
mature plants. Also, if you are using organic fertilizers, you
must NOT use sterilized soil, as it lacks the microrganisms that
are needed for the fertilizer to work. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">TOPSOIL</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Loam, garden loam, top soil</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A rich dark soil with a high quantity of organic
matter, usually from compost and peat moss that has been mixed
in. Topsoil is the rich top layer of soil created naturally when
leaves and organic matter weather and decompose completely. Can
be sold in natural form, with microorganisms, or <i>sterile</i>,
with none.</p>

<p>USE: Top soil is an excellent additive when building up the
quality of the soil in a garden. It can be used when creating
your own soil mixes, and as part of a soil mix for containers and
tubs. Often during the construction of new homes the top soil is
removed by bulldozers during the grading process. If this rich
soil is not replaced by the contractor, the new homeower has to
replace it in order to have a garden. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Sterile loam is preferable for potting soils used for
starting seeds and rooting cuttings, as there is less likelihood
of rot or damping-off disease, caused by a soil-borne fungus.
Once the seedlings have grown this is no longer necessary.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Good quality mixes contain enough peat moss to
build up humus rapidly. Look for soils with a lot of organic
matter.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">HUMUS</a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Peat humus</i></p>

<p><i>Pine bark humus</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Compost (incorrect), composted topsoil </p>

<p><i>Peat humus:</i> Organic peat</p>

<p><i>Pine bark humus: </i>Pine bark soil conditioner</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Humus is a general term for decomposed and
decayed organic matter, and is an ideal, stable, part of rich
soil with little nutrient content. It looks like soil and is sold
in bags just like <b>topsoil (above). </b>It takes 50 to 100
years to create humus naturally. Some gardeners consider compost
and <b>leaf mold (below)</b> forms of humus. </p>

<p><i>Peat humus</i> : Dried humus derived primarily from decayed<b>
reed- sedge peat (below) </b>and other decomposed organic matter<b>.
</b>Mined from bogs in New England and Pennsylvania. </p>

<p><i>Pine bark humus</i>: Humus derived from decayed pine bark,
i.e., mined from the forest floor. Consists of &quot;woods
matter&quot; and leaves. </p>

<p>USE: Building up soil in containers, lawns, or flower beds, or
replacing topsoil that has been removed in building construction.
Can also be used as a conditioner to enrich soils and improve
their drainage and friability, but it is essentially a growing
medium.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Doesn't hold water as well as topsoil. Mix with soils
or use straight; often used as a growing medium in potted plants
and in greenhouses.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">SOILLESS MIXES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Light potting mix, peat-lite mix, soil-less
mix, seed-starting mix (Chapter 9)</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Pro-Mix, Peat-Bark Mix</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Growing medium for potting mixes formulated from
all organic material which contain no grit soil (mineral
particles). These mixes are extremely water- and
nutrient-retentive. They have been sterilized so they contain no
bacteria or weed seed. Available in sizes that range from bags of
eight quarts to three cubic feet.</p>

<p>The most common types sold contain peat moss, perlite,
vermiculite, and gypsum along with nutrients and trace elements.
Some are specifically formulated for container gardening,
containing good quality sphagnum moss and composted softwood
bark.</p>

<p>USE: Seed-starting growing medium, both for potted plants
(indoors and out) or in gardens. They can also be mixed with
soil. Because they are sterilized, they prevent <i>damping off</i>,
a soil-borne fungal disease that kills seedlings. (See <b>seed-starting
products, Chapter 9</b>).</p>

<p>USE TIP: If soilless mixes are used in containers or tubs on
terrace gardens, mix in sand or soil the make the mix heavier.
This is particularly important if you are growing trees or shrubs
in the container as soiless mixes alone do not hold the heavier
plants up very well.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: This is a convenient packaged item to buy, but you
can mix your own very easily if you want, which might also be
less expensive. Typical mixes include peat moss, vermiculite,
perlite, and a small amount of ground limestone, all of which are
sold individually and all of which are described below. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">AFRICAN VIOLET SOIL </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A prepackaged soil mix composed of sterile
organic ingredients which holds moisture extremely well but still
has excellent drainage. Sold in sizes from two to eight quarts.
Typically contains <b>peat moss, ground limestone, vermiculite, </b>and<b>
perlite (below).</b></p>

<p>USE: Specifically prepared to be used for African Violets.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Though regular potting soil should be adequate for
African Violets, the special African Violet Soil mixes are
usually the same price and formulated to be better for the
plants, with slightly more perlite or vermiculite. African
Violets seem to attract a good number of specialized products,
which actually may have more to do with their popularity as
houseplants and the vast market that creates than with their
horticultural needs.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">CACTUS SOIL </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Porous blends of sterile sand, organic matter and
sometimes nutrients. These products may vary in color from white
to reddish brown, depending upon what types of sand are used.
Most often cactus soil is sold in four-quart sizes. Has more
perlite and less peat moss than other potting soils.</p>

<p>USE: For cactus and other succulent plants.</p>

<p>USE TIP:</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">TERRARIUM SOIL </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Special mixes of organic and inorganic
ingredients. Often these soil mixes contain some ground charcoal
to absorb salts and other chemicals that tend to build up in an
enclosed environment.</p>

<p>USE: Terrarium soils can be used as a medium for growing
plants in terrariums, jars, other enclosed containers and pots
with no drainage.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If you have a decorative pot without drainage that
you wish to grow plants in, this would be a good choice of
soil--though it is better to provide drainage.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">ORCHID BARK </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Chips of redwood bark or a mixture of chips of
redwood and pine barks. Despite its name, it is not made from
gigantic orchid plants.</p>

<p>USE: Growing medium for orchids.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">OSMUNDA FIBER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Ozmunda fiber</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A coarse, reddish brown fiber that is made from
the roots of the <i>Osmunda </i>fern. <i>Tree fern fiber</i> is
similar, but darker.</p>

<p>USE: As a growing medium for some epiphitic orchids and other
plants that get their moisture and nutrients from the air,
collectively known as<i> air plants.</i></p>

<p>USE TIP:</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">SHEET AND SPANISH MOSSES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Decorator moss</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Either of two types of long, fibrous moss in its
natural state: <i>Sheet moss</i>, which is harvested from South
Carolina forests in sheets and is very green, and <i>Spanish Moss</i>,
which is more bulky and is light gray.</p>

<p>USE: Sheet moss is used primarily for lining wire hanging
baskets, and both are used in a variety of decorative
arrangements and wreaths.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC15">ABOUT SOIL CONDITIONERS </a></h2>

<p>Most gardens are planted where the gardener likes them to be,
rather than because of a perfect soil. Gardeners usually find
that their soil is lacking in some character of structure, as
well as nutrients, either because of past conditions or because
of the type of plant you intend to grow. Fertilizers can add
nutrients, but soil conditioners, often called soil ammendments,
improve the ability of the soil to hold water and deliver
nutrients to the roots, as well as improve drainage and texture.
Some conditioners are more often found as components of
fertilizers, but are also sold separately as conditioners. Others
merely raise or lower the pH, depending on whether they are soil
sweeteners or soil acidifiers, respectively.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC16">ALUMINUM SULFATE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Aluminum sulphate, sulfate of aluminum</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Powdered bauxite that has been treated with
sulfuric acid, sold in bags from 5 to 100 lbs.</p>

<p>USE: Soil acidifier for acid-loving plants. Brings out color,
especially blue, in hydrangeas. Can also be used as a coagulant
for home swimming pools.</p>

<p>USE TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC17">COW MANURE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dried and ground up cow manure that has been aged
in such a way that it has rotted, losing its smell and increasing
its concentration of nutrients. More offten considered a <b>fertilizer</b>,
and listed as such in <b>Chapter 3</b>.</p>

<p>USE: Makes soil friable, adds organic elements, and generally
improves all soils. Contains nutrients, ranging from 1-1-1 to
5-5-5, depending on packager and degree of decomposition. Mixed
into any soil, but routinely mixed into soil that is being filled
into tree holes or new gardens.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC18">EARTHWORM CASTINGS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Coarse brown powder sold in small, convenient
bags (2 lb size is typical). Consists of ground up earthworm
castings, or spent &quot;skins&quot; that have been shed
naturally by worms. Odorless</p>

<p>USE: A general soil ammendment that increases the friability
of soil, acting as a soil builder which increases water
retention. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Ideal for potted plants. </p>

<p><a name="RTFToC1">GARDEN CHARCOAL </a></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Soil freshener</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Chunks of charcoal that range in size from
1/16&quot; to 1/2&quot; in size. It is usually sold in two-quart
bags.</p>

<p>USE: When added to soil mixes, charcoal helps absorb odors,
acids, salts, and other impurities. It also eliminates odors in
terrariums and containers which have no drainage and holds
moisture. Especially good to have at the bottom of a container.
Helpful as well in the water of vases of cut flowers.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When planting in a terrarium or in a container
without drainage, place a layer of gravel on the bottom followed
by a layer of charcoal and then the soil or growing medium.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If you cannot find garden charcoal in you garden
center, try pet stores, where it is sold as aquarium filter
material.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">GYPSUM</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Land Plaster, sulfate of lime</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Light-colored finely powdered rock or pellets
containing calcium sulfate. Similar products that are blends of
calcium and sulfur, are <i>gypsite</i> (crystaline form of
gypsum) and <i>lime sulfur </i>(which is sold as <i>calcium
polysulfide</i> ). The latter may have a wetting agent which
makes for deeper soil penetration.</p>

<p>USE: Improves soils for water penetration and aeration by
breaking up particles of clay and neutralizing the salt in salty
(high-sodium) soils, without raising the pH as <b>lime (below)</b>
does. Because it is a mild <i>soil acifidifier</i>, gypsum may be
used where the use of lime would pose a problem to acid-loving
plants. The process is a chemical one, whereby sodium ions are
exchanged for calcium ions, which separates the clay particles
enough to create &quot;pore space&quot; for air and water.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Supplies calcium and sulfur, both <b>secondary
nutrients (Chapter 3). </b>Can be used in great quantities if
warranted.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The pelleted form is easier to use than the powder
form.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">HORTICULTURAL SAND </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Pure sterilized sand often sold in two-quart
bags. May vary in color depending upon what type of sand is used.
Contains no salt, as beach sand might, and should contain no
other impurities that might bother plants.</p>

<p>USE: Mixed with potting soil to aerate and help with drainage.
It can be used for rooting succulents and cacti, as well as being
used as the primary base in a cactus soil mix.</p>

<p>USE TIP:</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Regular <i>builder's sand</i>, which can be
purchased at hardware stores or at construction sites, is cheaper
and works just as well as horticultural sand. Do not use ocean
beach sand for plants, as it contains salt.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">IRON SULFATE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Iron sulphate, Copperas, ferrous sulfate</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular product commonly sold in 5 lb bags.</p>

<p>USE: 20% iron and 11.5% sulfur. Corrects iron deficiencies
(yellowing, or chlorosis), provides iron as needed, and acidifies
the soil. Assists in the production of clorophyll. Restores green
color and blooming.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Make sure that your plant is definitely deficient in
iron before applying, and if you do, apply carefully and strictly
according to the directions. Too much iron can damage a plant.
Yellow leaves are the usual sign of an iron deficiency, but the
problem might lie elsewhere as well.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">LEAF MOLD </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Woods-soil, compost (when sold commercially)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Shredded flakes of partially decomposed leaves
and forest litter, usually an attractive dark brown. When a local
nursery sells its own leaf mold as compost, it is usually sold by
the cubic yard, or small truckload. Often considered a <b>mulch
(Chapter 2),</b> it also has fertilizing characteristics; some
gardeners consider it a form of <b>humus (above).</b></p>

<p>USE: A particularly good source of humus,and general organic
soil conditioner for vegetable gardens, as it opens up the soil,
making it &quot;friable.&quot; Encourages development of fibrous
roots. Also a good mulch for any area of the garden, because as
it breaks down and turns into compost, it becomes a soil
conditioner. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Enriches and fertilizes the soil where it is used. It
can be worked into soil to help build up the humus. Not effective
if it is powdery. Lightens clayey soils. Can be turned into the
soil after use as a one-season mulch to go to work as a soil
conditioner.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Leaf mold is a bargain at about $1.50 a cubic
foot, considering what it does for the garden. Very difficult to
find for sale, though.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">LIME </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Ground limestone, limestone, liming materials, </p>

<p>pulverized limestone, agricultural lime, garden lime</p>

<p>CHEMICAL NAME: Calcium carbonate (CaCo3) in a number of forms;
commonly mixed with magnesium carbonate (MgCO3)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A fine, white powder, pellets, or granules of
ground limestone. When mixed with magnesium (quite common), may
be called <i>dolomitic , dolomite, </i>or<i> magnesium limestone.
</i>Lime is often incorrectly considered a fertilizer, probably
because calcium is a <b>secondary nutrient (Chapter 3) </b>and
magnesium is a <b>micronutrient (Chapter 3)</b> that almost all
plants need. Any calcium/magnesium compound that neutralizes soil
acidity is called<i> agricultural limestone</i> or <i>agricultural
liming material, </i>as opposed to <i>builder's lime, </i>which
is for use in mortar and plaster.<i> Hydrated lime</i>, or <i>slaked
lime</i>, has been treated and water added, making it caustic and
difficult to handle. Some brands mix types of limestone together.
<i>Marl</i>, a natural mixture of weathered shells containing
clay and calcium carbonate is another source of lime.</p>

<p>USE: Primarily to raise the pH of soils--to make them more
alkaline, or &quot;sweeter,&quot; which means essentially to
neutralize soil acidity--so that microorganisms can help break
down organic matter into the all-important humus. However, it is
helpful in many other ways as well. Though it is not a
fertilizer, lime is a catalyst for the release of other nutrients
and improves the structure of clayey soils in terms of moisture
retention and drainage. Lime is also helpful in the control of
club root, a disease found in plants of the cabbage family <i>Crucifers.
</i>Also prevents moss growth, disinfects, and can be used for
both whitewashing and pickling vegetables.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Most lawns require annual liming, especially in
areas of the country with acid rain, such as in the northeast.
Fall or spring is the best time to do this, depending on where
you live, although fall is usually better. Be sure to water it in
well. In acid soils (those with a low pH), liming is necessary to
grow many perennials and vegetables. Do not apply at the same
time as manure, or else they will combine and release ammonia
gas, wasting valuable nitrogen. Refer to your soil test to
determine how much to apply (that is your <i>lime requirement</i>
), and be patient: trying to raise the pH of your soil by more
than one point a year can be harmful to your plants as it ties up
other nutrients. Hydrated lime acts faster, but it can burn the
plants--measure carefully and apply lightly.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Though there are several forms of lime sold, be
sure that you are buying a <i>dolomitic</i> or <i>ground</i>
limestone (dolomitic is better because of the magnesium it
contains); the general term used from time to time is <i>agricultural
lime.. </i>This type minimizes the risk of &quot;burning&quot;
the foliage of plants, particularly grass. Most soils can use the
magnesium and are not harmed by a slight excess. Hydrated lime is
a third choice, though it must be applied carefully, is dangerous
to handle, and leaches out quickly. Other types of lime, such as <i>builder's
lime, </i>are designed to be used in construction materials such
as mortar and plaster. They are much more concentrated and will
&quot;burn&quot; plants. Do not use <i>quicklime</i> in your
garden--it will damage the soil. Pelletized limestone has less
dust than fine ground limestone.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">OYSTER SHELLS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: White material consisting of coarsely ground
oyster shells, which are full of calcium carbonate (CaC03).</p>

<p>USE: As a liming material to raise the pH of soils (to make
them more alkaline), although sometimes used as a fertilizer to
add calcium, a <b>secondary nutrient (About Fertilizers, Chapter
3). </b></p>

<p>USE TIP: Better used as a way to raise the pH of soil than as
a fertilizer.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">PEAT </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Peat moss, peat muck, sphangnum peat moss,
sphangnum peat, sphangnum moss</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dried and partially decomposed roots, leaves,
stems, moss, and other plant debris that have been harvested from
wetlands. Compressed up to half normal volume and roughly ground
up for commericial packaging, peat is light, loose, and fluffy
when unpacked. Peat is much more commonly available than muck,
which contains more mineral matter and more decomposed plant
matter. </p>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Reed-sedge peat </i>is the product of partly decomposed
plant residues (reeds, cattails, and grasses, and the like) that
grew in a water- saturated environment. Also called <i>reed peat,
fibrous peat, </i>or<i> sedge peat.</i></p>

<p><i>Sphagnum Peat Moss </i>(milled and unmilled) is partially
decayed sphagnum moss and other bog plants that grow well in
parts of Michigan and Canada. Most packages from Canada are also
labeled in French, &quot;Tourbe de spaigne.&quot; It is the most
common type of peat moss available. <i>Michigan Peat Moss </i>is
just peat from Michigan, though it is a bit darker and richer
than the regular Canadian peat moss</p>

<p>-<i>Milled peat </i>is dark brown to red/brown in color and is
simply sphagnum peat ground into a coarse powder. May be sold as <i>organic
seed starter. </i>Sold in 2:1 compacted form, and usually not
labeled as unmilled. The most common form of peat, sold in large,
plastic packages of 1 to 6 cubic feet. Also available in
super-compressed plates that expand when wet. </p>

<p>-<i>Unmilled peat </i>is a greenish-light brown material that
looks more like you would expect dried moss to look like:
fibrous, with small branches and leaves visible. Usually sold in
small, plastic packages.</p>

<p>Note the difference between two confusing terms: Sphagnum <i>moss</i>
is gray and stringy, harvested before it has decomposed. Sphagnum
<i>peat moss</i> is brown, and is made of decomposed plants.</p>

<p>USE: As a soil additive, particularly when the pH needs to be
lowered (mix with lime if acidity is a problem and you don't want
to lower your pH). Its main characteristic is that of great
water-holding capcity: peat absorbs between five and fifteen
times its weight in water. Aids in opening up clay soil for
better aeration and supplies organic matter to poor soil. Besides
these special qualities, it improves all soils in terms of water
retention and porosity. Spaghnum peat is commonly used as a <b>mulch</b>,
as well <b>(Chapter 2) </b>for acid-loving plants, and breaks
down after about three years. Unmilled peat is used as a growing
medium for orchids and other epiphitic plants and bromeliads, or <i>air
layering</i>, as well as lining wire baskets to hold soil. Milled
peat is used not only as a conditioner but also as a
seed-starting medium, and mixes well with perlite and vermiculite
for container gardening.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Work the peat into the soil well; if it gets packed
down it might block water from reaching the plant (it makes bad
mulch). Remember that peat tends to lower the pH of soil as it
breaks down. If you insist on using it as a mulch, do not let it
dry out--it will block water like a thatched roof.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Peat moss is sold in cubic foot bales. Usually,
the larger the bale, the lower the cost per cubic foot (usually
around a dollar), so don't hesitate to buy more than you might
need right away. It keeps well. Try to buy name brands of peat
from reputable dealers, as good peat tends to contain more
organic matter. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">PEANUT HULL MEAL </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A tan to brown meal obtained from ground peanut
hulls.</p>

<p>USE: In the south, often used as a soil conditioner to help
open up packed soil. Also used as an additive or filler in
fertilizers. </p>

<p>USE TIPS:</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Generally less expensive and more commonly found
in areas where peanuts are grown.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">PERLITE</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Horticultural perlite</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: White, light, hard, porous, gritty material
similar to <b>Vermiculite (below)</b> in appearance. Formed when
lava (volcanic rock) is heated, which causes it to expand.
Non-toxic, sterile, and odorless. <i>Construction grade perlite </i>is
made of smaller, lighter particles.</p>

<p>USE: Increases drainage (loosens heavy soils), improves
aeration (gets oxygen to the plant roots), and decreases weight
of potting soils, an important consideration for planters on
decks. Helps retain water, which attaches to the particles'
surface, as well. Can be used as a rooting medium on its own.
Construction grade perlite is used as loose fill insulation and
as a light agregate with concrete where weight is a factor, such
as on roof decks.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Use the finest ground forms of perlite. If it is not
finely ground, it tends to go to the top of a mixture. Goes well
with peat moss for lightweight container mixtures.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">SOIL SULFUR </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular or powder form of basic garden chemical,
sold in 5 to 80lb bags.</p>

<p>USE: Acidifying and flocculating soil, that is, like <b>gypsum
(above),</b> it causes clay soil to form small particles which
allow air and water to accumulate in the soil--it makes soil
friable, or better for growing things. The sulfur actually breaks
down into sulfuric acid which reacts with the natural calcium
carbonate in the soil to make calcium sulfate, the basic stuff of
gypsum.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Use carefully--follow all precautions on label. Some
people are sensitive to sulfur. Fastest way to lower your pH, but
also toxic if overdone--apply no more than one pound per 100
square feet in any one application, and no more often than every
8 weeks. Work into soil and water in thoroughly to avoid burning
leaves in the sun. A typical indication of need is yellow plant
leaves. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">VERMICULITE</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Horticultural vermiculite</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A white, extremely light-weight granular
substance, with grains about 1/16&quot; in diameter (No. 3
grade). It is formed when mica chips are heated and expanded to
many times their original size. Contains some potassium,
magnesium, and calcium which are slowly released in soil.
Construction grade vermiculite is larger, and is used for loose
fill insulation.</p>

<p>USE: Used in soil mixes to increase the water and fertilizer
retention of the mixture, as well as to lighten and open it up.
Considered a <i>soil amendment</i> and a <i>rooting medium </i>as
well as a <b>mulch (Chapter 2).</b></p>

<p>USE TIP: It is a very light material, lighter than sand, which
can be an important additive to container soil mixes. Avoid
adding to clayey soils.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">WATER RETENTION CRYSTALS </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Agrosoke<sup>TM</sup>, Water Gels, P-4,
Water-Grabber, Aquagel</p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Water release crystals, root watering crystals,
water retention granules, water retaining soil additive, hydrogel
crystals, super absorbant</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Fine, white, transluscent, granules which absorb
many times their own weight of water (some brands claim 500X) in
about 30 minutes. They swell up to form moist, sticky beads of
gel which then release water evenly over a period of time, and
they release almost all of it. A non-toxic, non-biodegradable,
and pH-neutral polymer. Lasts about 5 years. Sold in packets as
small as 2oz.</p>

<p>USE: Reduces the frequency of plant watering. Mixed with soil,
in lawns but especially in containers, to maintain an even
distribution of moisture; sort of a moisture resevoir that acts
like a sponge. Plant roots actually attach themselves to the
water-swollen crystals, stimilating the production of feeder
roots. Increase in size of crystals aerates the soil, too.
Minimizes transplant shock. Reduces watering requirements by up
to 50%, according to some manufacturers--one good soaking may
last three weeks, for example. Can be mixed into small
containers, placed around specific plants, or spread over entire
gardens. Helpful if you find it hard to water regularly.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Add the crystals to the soil after they have aborbed
water (been &quot;hydrated&quot;) so you can mix in the right
about. A 6:1 ratio is typical. Most brands last several years or
more and are compatible with fertilizers, but check the label to
be sure. Helps prevent overwatering, the scourge of houseplants,
to a certain extent. Don't overload a container with this,
though, or you will end up holding so much water that you'll
create a swamp-like condition and rot your plant roots. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Amount of water that crystals soak up varies
tremendously by brand. Be sure to compare labels. Avoid
starch-based versions, which do not last long. Popular due to the
interest shown in container gardening by otherwise capable young
urban professionals who can't seem to take responsibility for
even the simplest domestic chores.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">ABOUT MULCHES: </a></h2>

<p>Mulches are organic and inorganic substances that are placed
in planting beds and around plants because they are not only
decorative (they are often called <i>decorative ground cover </i>),
but more importantly because they retain moisture in the bed by
shielding it from the drying effects of the sun, help cool the
bed during the warm seasons, attract earthworms, help insulate it
during winter (the general term is temperature fluctuation
protection), and above all, help keep down weeds. They also act
as an erosion control. Mulching is one of the essential gardening
practices in low-maintenance gardening. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT ORGANIC MULCHES: </a></h2>

<p>Organic are simply mulches derived from natural material,
meaning that they are able to break down and decompose. Many
gardeners find organic mulches more attractive and
natural-looking (naturally!) than <b>inorganic mulches (below)</b>.
They are not permanent, though a breakdown of several years is
certainly not hard to deal with. Their slow decomposition slowly
adds nitrogen to the soil. However, most organic mulches
initially deplete some of the nitrogen in the bed because as
organic matter breaks down, the micro-organisms that aid in
decomposition utilize nitrogen in the initial stages of the
process. It is therefore necessary to add extra nitrogen to beds
where you are using organic mulches that decompose rapidly, that
is, over a year or two. </p>

<p>Listed here are the most common ones that are sold nationally;
some very good mulches may not be listed here. By-products of
regional agricultural crops are often sources of unusual and
excellent mulches, such as various nut shells or rice hulls, and
may not be listed here. These are often available from local
food-processing plants. There are also some good homemade
mulches, such as shredded newspapers, which are not sold
commercially and of course are not listed either.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">BARK CHIPS and SHREDDED BARK </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: <i>Bark chips: </i>Bark nuggets</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Pieces of shredded or chipped tree bark. Both
items are a pleasant brown color, and texture varies from medium
to coarse. Generally three types are available: <i>hardwood bark,
cedar</i> or <i>cypress bark</i>, and <i>pine bark nuggets </i>or<i>
mulch. </i>Pine tree bark may comes from any kind of pine<i>. </i>In
either case there should be no more than 15% wood in the mix. <i>Shredded
bark</i> is made of thin, light pieces less than 1-1/2&quot;
long. <i>Nuggets</i> are larger and more decorative, as big as
3-1/2&quot; in diameter. <i>Mini Nuggets</i> are 1/4&quot; to
1-1/2&quot; in diameter. <i>Pine bark mulch</i> is made of
particles 1/8 to 1/4&quot;, though these terms and sizes vary
considerably from manufacturer to manufacturer. In the West,
these terms are replaced by <i>West Coast Large (</i>or<i>
Western) </i>and <i>West Coast Medium Nuggets</i>; the fine stuff
that is left over from the chopping and screening is called <i>West
Coast Pathway</i>, but in the rest of the country it is called <i>Fines</i>.
Western Red Cedar, Redwood, and Driftwood barks are also popular.
Oddly, <b>orchid bark (Chapter 1) </b>comes not from extremely
large orchids but is a mixture of pine and redwood barks, and is
used for growing orchids. Cedar bark is reddish-brown, has a
distinct cedar aroma. Cypress mulch has similar characteristics
and is light gray. A hard to find alernative is <i>root mulch</i>,
often made of shredded licorice root.</p>

<p>USE: Bark is an excellent natural-looking mulch which,
depending on the size of the chips, takes about three to four
years to break down, longer than most organic mulches (cedar and
cyprus take the longest). Can be used for flower beds, around
trees and shrubs and even in the vegetable garden. Shredded bark
is more efficient as a mulch, but nuggets are more decorative.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Use as you would any mulch. A depth of about 3
inches is sufficient to insure weed control and moisture
retention. Hardwood bark lasts longer and is usually heavier, so
it doesn't blow away, but pine bark nuggets might float away in a
heavy rain if the garden is on a slope. 13 bags of 2 cubic feet
cover about 100 square feet to a depth of 3&quot;. Barks are
often placed over a layer of plastic sheeting, called <i>bark
base mulch</i>, to keep it from decomposing into the soil.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Bark is usually easy to find at most garden
centers selling for around 2 dollars per cubic foot. Your local
parks department may also offer shredded bark (and <b>tree chips,
below</b>) as a public service, though you must check with them
as to whether any diseased trees of the same species as yours
were shredded into the mulch. Of course, you can get it directly
form sawmills if you live near a cooperative one. Cedar bark is
more expensive but lasts longer (it resists both insects and rot)
and is better for the garden, though it tends to acidify the
soil. <i>Shredded cypress bark</i> lasts the longest, as it is
basically inert. <i>Root mulch</i> is usually expensive.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">BUCKWHEAT HULLS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A fine-textured, dark brown mulch which comes
from the hulls of buckwheat. Resembles <b>cocoa hulls (above)</b>
in appearance, but much lighter.</p>

<p>USE: An attractive, natural-looking mulch well suited for any
area of the garden. They are particularly pleasing in a perennial
border.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Because they are so light, buckwheat hulls will blow
away if placed in exposed, windy areas. They will stay in place
after aging abit and if they are well wet down. Add new mulch
after 2 or 3 years, when it begins to break down. Try to keep it
about 2 inches deep.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Buckwheat hulls, like many organic mulches, are
cheaper where buckwheat grows. They are more expensive than cocoa
bean hulls and tend to blow away, but if you like the look, they
are well worth the extra cost. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">COCOA SHELL MEAL </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Fine brown meal made from the husks of cocoa
beans,</p>

<p>the seeds of which are used to make chocolate. When fresh, it
has a chocolate, fragrance, no less. Adds some nutrients as it
decomposes.</p>

<p>USE: General mulching jobs.</p>

<p>USE TIPS:</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">COCOA SHELLS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Cocoa-bean hulls, cocoa hulls, cocoa mulch,
cocoa shell mulch</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dark brown crushed hulls of the cocoa bean<b>. </b>They
have a pleasant texture composed of particles sized 1/4&quot; to
1/2&quot;. If they are fresh, they smell like chocolate when they
are first put down, but unfortunately they soon lose this
delightful fragrance.</p>

<p>USE: An attractive mulch for almost any area of the garden.
The dark brown color is a natural compliment to most plant
material. Breaks down after a couple years, adding nutrients at
the grade of about 2.5-1-3 (See Chapter 3 for explanation of <i>grade</i>).</p>

<p>USE TIPS: When first put down it may be necessary to add extra
nitrogen to the soil. Very good for rose beds. Don't expect it to
stay put in windy areas--it is too light. Rinse off any mold that
appears in the process of decomposition.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: In areas of the country where there are chocolate
factories cocoa hulls are readily available, sometimes for free
directly from a candy factory. In other areas they may be more
expensive, if available at all. Cocoa hulls sell for around $3.50
a cubic foot, which makes them one of the more expensive organic
mulches.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">STRAW</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Straw, a long, dry grass, is tan to yellow in
color and differs from hay in that it is composed of the stems of
grain crops, whereas hay contains both stems and leaves. Much of
the straw sold for mulches comes in rectangular cubic bails
weighing from 30 to 50 pounds a bail. </p>

<p>USE: Straw is an attractive mulch for most areas of the
garden. It can be used in the vegetable garden or even on garden
paths to keep down weeds. Most popular as a winter mulch for its
insulation quality.</p>

<p>USE TIP: As straw comes from the stems of grain crops, grain
seed is often present. These can germinate and become weeds; oat
straw is particularly notorious for its seed content. Tends to
blow around in windy areas. Very flammable when dry. Don't use it
or store it where a careless smoker might drop a cigarette or you
might see your garden go up in flames. Breaks down after one
season; because the potential for sowing weeds, straw is not a
highly recommended mulch for repeated use, but will do in a
pinch, or when price is the biggest problem.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Straw is one of the less expensive organic
mulches. It sells for under 50cents a cubic foot. Make sure it is
labeled &quot;weed free.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">SALT HAY </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dried salt marsh grasses, light brown or tan in
color and thin textured. Available in bail forms in the coastal
parts of the country, though it is sometimes sold in other areas
a higher cost. </p>

<p>USE: An all-purpose-organic mulch. Like <b>straw (above)</b>
popular as a winter mulch.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Salt hay is particularly good for vegetable and
flower gardening because unlike straw, it does not contain any
seed (that is, any that would germinate in your garden--they need
salt water to germinate). Salt hay breaks down during one growing
season and needs to be replaced each year. Put it down to a
thickness of about 4 inches for good weed control. Watch out for
wind and fire, both of which are enemies of this mulch.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Prices fluctuate from year to year, but it is
usually more expensive than plain straw. The fact that it is
seed-free makes it a good buy over straw.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">WOOD CHIPS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, odd-shaped pieces of wood created when
tree limbs are chipped and shredded. They form a coarse-textured
mulch that is white, yellow and brown, which darkens to gray and
brown as it ages. It may be placed in small bags and colored for
indoor use; it is bagged or sold in bulk for outdoor use.</p>

<p>USE: Wood chips are a good mulch for weed control on path
areas of a garden. They can be used around plants, but their
texture is often too coarse for the flower bed or the vegetable
garden. They are better suited for trees and shrubs than regular
plants. Wood chips break down after about 5 to 6 six years.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Be sure that you are getting wood chips that have
aged at least one year. Fresh wood chips may actually heat up as
they oxidize, damaging your plants. Additional chips can be added
every few years. One of the longest-lasting organic mulches. Try
to verify that no diseased trees were included in the chipping.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Wood chips can be purchased for as little as
50cents a cubic foot. They can also be purchased or had for free
from many municipal parks throughout the country who shred tree
limbs as part of a normal pruning and maintenance program. They
are often given free to community gardening programs and projects
in large cities. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">ABOUT INORGANIC MULCHES: </a></h2>

<p>Inorganic mulches are those which are not derived from living
things. Being inorganic, they do not break down or decompose.
This can be an advantage because they do not have to be replaced:
they are as permanent as any landscape accessory can be. They do
not, however, have the more natural appearance of organic
mulches, and they add no nitrogen to the soil as organic ones do.
They also get &quot;dirty&quot; over time, if that is a concern
from a decorative point of view.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">FIBERGLASS BATTING OR MATS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Weed control mat, erosion preventer, erosion
cloth</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Fiberglass matting the color of which varies from
manufacturer to manufacturer. Sold in sheets or rolls</p>

<p>USE: Placed in a bed or on a border. Holes for plants can be
cut in them.</p>

<p>USE TIP: It is easy to cover the fiberglass mat with an
attractive organic mulch like bark or straw. If it is not porous,
use a soaker hose to irrigate your plants.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Fiberglass is great for insulation and temperature
control, if that is an important concern to you. Fiberglass mats
sell for around $1.25 - $1.50 a square yard.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">LANDSCAPE FABRIC </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Typar</p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Weed-blocking fabric, weed mat</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A number of porous woven or non-woven,
spun-bonded polyester, or otherwise permeable sheet products made
from plastics, natural, and inorganic fibers which come in colors
including white, off-white, redwood, brown, and black, ranging
from 3 to 6 feet wide by 15 to 50 feet long. Some are made of
biodegradable peat paper.</p>

<p>USE: Landscape fabrics allow moisture and water to penetrate
through to the plants, but prevent weeds from growing. Not
considered suitable for landscaped gardens (unless covered with <b>decorative
stone mulches, below</b>) as they are very unnatural looking, but
quite useful in a vegetable garden, where they also warm up the
soil for early-season planting. Cut holes for plants to grow
through. Also for covering newly seeded lawns to keep the seed
from washing or blowing away, and encouraging germination. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Some fabric is made from fibers (such as peat moss
and recycled paper) which break down--a good product for annual
use in a vegetable garden, as it does not have to be removed but
can be plowed into the field at the end of the season.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: This is usually an expensive product: a roll 3' by
100' might sell for around 60 dollars. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">POLYETHYLENE SHEETING </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Black polyethylene, black plastic mulch, black
poly sheeting weed shield, weed barrier</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Rolls of black plastic, usually 3 or 6 feet wide
and 25 to100 feet long, although it can be found in sheets 40
feet wide by100 feet long; commercial growers use rolls 3 and 4
feet wide by 1000 feet long. Comes in thickness ranging from 1.5
mil to 6 mil; for comparison, a sturdy garbage bag is about 3 mil
thick (a mil is one thousandth of an inch), and 4 mil is
considered average strong sheeting, while 6 mil is used under
stone mulches. Some brands have millions of microscopic holes
which allow water to penetrate while still preventing weeds from
growing.</p>

<p>USE: A good mulch for vegetable gardens, but not suited for
landscape mulching, though it is often placed under sand and
brick patios to prevent weeds from growing. Because of its color,
black plastic helps warm up a vegetable bed and speeds up seed
germination. This is particularly useful for plants that need
warm soil when they begin growth. Also used under decks and
concrete. Cut holes in the plastic for the plants to grow
through.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If you are using solid plastic sheet, water cannot
penetrate, so you must get water underneath by using a soaker
hose (Chapter 8) or other means of irrigation. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Black plastic is a good vegetable crop mulch, and
is not very expensive at 29cents a square yard. </p>

<p><a name="RTFToC14">STONE MULCHES </a>Types:</p>

<p><i>Granite chips</i></p>

<p><i>Limestone chips </i></p>

<p><i>Marble chips </i></p>

<p><i>River Gravel</i></p>

<p><i>Volcanic Rock</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Landscape chips, decorative stone mulch</p>

<p><i>Volcanic Rock: </i>Lava rock, volcanic stone</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Pepples, chipped or crushed rock of varying
sizes, shapes, and colors. Pebles may be sorted into colors as
different as pink, yellow, and brown.</p>

<p><i>Granite chips: </i>Chips of granite, red or black in color.
As with all stone mulches, the texture varies according to
&quot;grind.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Limestone chips: </i>White stone chips of varying size and
texture.</p>

<p><i>Marble chips: </i>Usually white, sometimes red or black
chips varying in size from pea-sized to 3&quot; to 4&quot; in
diameter. Texture varies depending on how the stone is chipped.</p>

<p><i>River Gravel: </i>White or off-white, rounded pebbles
available in different textures. </p>

<p><i>Volcanic Rock: </i>A red or black rock mulch created when
volcanic rock is chipped into differently sized particles. One
third the weight of regular stone products.</p>

<p>USE: Low-maintenance mulch. Often seen in commercial
landscaping around fast-food places, industrial buildings, and
shopping malls, but generally not around homes where gardeners
are not willing to make the tradeoff of convenience vs
aesthetics. Some people find the starkness of white stone mulch
pleasing in contrast to the colors of their plants, but it is an
unnatural pairing.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Use as you would any mulch, applying to a depth of
about 3 inches. For extra weed control, chips can be placed over
a <b>plastic sheeting mulch (below).</b> Marble chip mulch raises
the pH slightly, and therefore should be avoided with
shallow-rooted, acid-loving plants such as azaleas.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Choice of texture is purely personal preference.</p>

<p><i>Granite Chips:</i> Like other stone mulches, this is more
available in areas of the country where the stone is found
naturally. Prices vary according to availability. Granite chips
are generally among the more expensive mulches, going for around
$4.00 per cubic foot.</p>

<p><i>Limestone</i>: Considerably cheaper than marble chips.
Selling for around $1.50 per cubic foot, it is one of the less
expensive inorganic mulches, especially in areas of the country
where it is mined.</p>

<p><i>Marble chips</i> : One of the most expensive of mulches,
retailing at around 7 dollars a cubic foot. </p>

<p><i>River gravel:</i> A moderately priced inorganic mulch
selling for around 2 dollars per cubic foot. </p>

<p><i>Volcanic rock:</i> Where it can be found, volcanic rock is
a moderately priced inorganic mulch, retailing for about 2
dollars per cubic foot. Easier to handle in quantity, due to its
lighter weight. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT GRASS SEED: </a></h2>

<p>Purchasing the right seed for your site is one of the most
important steps in seeding and reseeding lawns. To help you make
an informed decision about which grass seed to buy a number of
factors have to be considered, but they are not too complicated.
Typical among them are:</p>

<p>- How much time you have to spend maintaining the lawn. Some
grasses and combinations of grasses demand more care and
maintenance than others.</p>

<p>- How sunny or how shady your site is.</p>

<p>- How much traffic your lawn will take. Will children be
playing on it?</p>

<p>- How much water is available, and how often you will be able
to water the lawn.</p>

<p>- How much you need quick-growing cover.</p>

<p>- What climatic zone you are in--do you need a <i>Southern</i>
or <i>Northern </i>grass? (These terms are interchangeable with <i>warm-season</i>
and <i>cool-season</i>.)</p>

<p>There is a strong tradition in America of having a beautifully
maintained lawn, and that tradition is not about to die; a
&quot;perfect&quot; lawn remains a basic element of suburban
life. It is, however, likely to evolve somewhat as the high
costs--environmental, monetary, and labor--become unacceptable.
In some parts of the country, water alone is a major cost. Also,
more and more homeowners are choosing to conserve water by using
less water-intensive landscaping than lawns.</p>

<p>Most people cannot afford to be so picky about lawns
resembling perfectly manicured outdoor carpets as professional
&quot;turf managers&quot; who care for golf courses and the like.
After all, the model for perfect lawns is British, and few places
in this country have the ideal growing conditions that they do
(indeed, grass is native to few of our settled areas), let alone
the 200 years it took for them to get their lawns going right.
Just pouring chemicals and other products onto the ground every
weekend does not make a perfect lawn. A little thought and
planning can solve problems better than lots of money and
products, and a beautiful lawn can be had if the idea that it
must be absolutely &quot;perfect&quot; is put aside.</p>

<p>The sensible approach to lawns that many American gardeners
are taking today includes such notions as:</p>

<p>- A well-prepared and maintained site will produce a healthy
lawn more able to resist diseases, pests, and weeds without the
need for synthetic chemicals; </p>

<p>- Chemical herbicides are not the only way to a weed-free lawn
(and that the possible threat to the environment of herbicide
abuse make a few weeds seem quite tolerable); </p>

<p>-A semi-annual fertilizing is all that is necessary; </p>

<p>-The choice of the right grass seed and mixes to fit the site
has as much to do with how well the lawn will grow as anything
else;</p>

<p>- We should break the typical American habit of
over-dependence on chemicals, especially new,
&quot;convenience&quot; blends that may duplicate others or
include unnecessary products. Synthetic chemicals should be used
for what they do best: curing specific problems. Non-toxic
methods should be explored and adopted wherever possible.</p>

<p>The best time to reseed or seed a lawn of cool-season grasses
in the North is the fall. This allows the grass to establish a
good root system before winter. In the South, spring is best.
Look for the grass seeds and mixes long before you are ready to
plant to assure yourself that you will be able to get just what
you want. Settling for just what is available after the prime
planting season will result in a poorer lawn that needs much more
work.</p>

<p>You can't just throw the seed onto the ground and expect it to
grow well. Soil preparation involves a fair amount of work. The
soil should be tilled to a depth of at least 8.&quot; All rocks,
weed, and old grass clumps should be removed. Hard soil should be
opened up with milled peat moss. Finally, the area should be
leveled, rolled, and raked. After seeding, the lawn should be
kept moist for the first few weeks, and covered with a
biodegradable light lawn netting or a dust of peat moss or straw
to protect the seeds a bit from wind and rain.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">ABOUT SEED TYPES AND MIXES: </a></h2>

<p>In the North, many manufacturers offer pre-mixed seed
specifically developed for certain types of lawns, or the garden
center may have its own mix, and you can mix your own from the
single types available. It is always important to read the types
and amounts of seed in the mix to determine if you are really
getting what you need. To do this, you need to know a little
about the types of grass you can grow and what they are suited
for, which is what this chapter is about.</p>

<p>Usually the Northern, or Cool-Season, mixes contain the
ever-popular, hard-wearing Kentucky bluegrass, some turf-type
fast-germinating perennial ryegrasses (as opposed to the
&quot;common&quot; type) and some fine fescue. The actual mix
depends entirely on the part of the country where it is sold and
of course on your taste, budget, and needs. Southern, or
Warm-Season grasses are generally not mixes but rather one single
type of grass, most of which are sold as sod, plugs, or springs
(individual plants) instead of seed.</p>

<p>Some mixes are described in general terms, such as <i>Play</i>
(for high traffic), <i>Sun</i> (for more than four hours of sun
daily), <i>Shade</i> (for less sun), and <i>Sun/Shade </i>(for
typical mix of areas). The local garden center quality mix is
often a good bet, especially if the ingredients are listed so you
can judge for yourself. And of course, mixing your own can be a
source of great satisfaction. </p>

<p>Particularly in the North, when you use just one variety of
seed for your lawn you are only courting disaster when a pest or
disease hits it. Lawns of single varieties will be wiped out by
diseases that affect that variety, whereas lawns which contain a
mix of types of grasses are more likely to have only some
affected by the disease while the others survive. Nothing is
sadder than a completely browned-off and dead lawn of a single
type of grass, while surrounding lawns of mixed types survive! A
mixture of grasses also produces a lawn with more interesting
texture than the single-variety lawns. Pre-packaged pre-mixed
seed is convenient, as well, and there is no reason not to buy
it.</p>

<p>The label on a mix lists the types of <i>grass seed, crop
seed, inert matter, </i>and<i> weed seed. </i>You want the lowest
levels of the latter three items, of course, like less than 1%
(there should be no crop seed, or at most a few tenths of a
percent). Note the percentages of grass seed types and see if
that meshes with your needs and desires. This chapter should help
you decide what's best, or check with your local Cooperative
Extension Service for help (<b>Appendix B</b>). The percentage of
seed germination should be 80 to 90% and they should have been
tested <i>during the year of purchase. </i>The state of origin
should not affect its growth. </p>

<p>The listing of the types of grass seed can be a little
confusing, though the following pages should help explain this.
However, the world of grass types is a little like the world of
wine: if you are an expert, the labels reveal much pertinent
information that shows the differences from one bottle to
another; however, the differences are so subtle that often only
an expert can appreciate them. <i>Cultivars </i>(or<i>cultivated
varieties, </i>or <i>named varieties, </i>or<i> proprietary </i>types<i>
</i>) and <i>hybrids </i>(types that are the result of crossing,
or breeding plants of different species or varieties to respond
to a need ranging from pure aesthetics to better disease and
insect resistance) are specific types of grass that tend to
perform well; most are new and improved types, and new ones are
constantly being added to the market. Look for these when buying
grass seed. There are over 300 of them now, biologically
different (they are even patented or registered by the
developers--the symbol is &quot;PVP&quot;, for &quot;Plant
Variety Protection&quot;--but they are essentially similar to the
consumer. Only some of the more commonly found ones are listed in
this chapter. </p>

<p>Manufacturers may swear by one or another, but they are listed
by name only on the following pages because the difference is so
subtle (with a few exceptions)--and performance of all grass seed
is influenced by weather, fertilizer, watering, and soil to such
a great extent that you really cannot generalize. Likewise, no
miracles should be claimed by the manufacturers, either. Be leery
of any that do. Price generally reflects quality, and national
brands are dependable.</p>

<p>Most of the grass seed in a mix should be the
&quot;Fine-Textured&quot; type, and should be cultivars (see
above for alternative names) or hybrids, rather than the general
name (or &quot;unnamed&quot;, or &quot;common&quot; types). For
example, &quot;Adelphi Kentucky Bluegrass&quot; is better than
&quot;Kentucky Bluegrass.&quot; Much like wine, the generic types
are not as good nor as expensive as the ones with more specifics
on the labels--region, year, etc. The common, unnamed variety is
often listed as &quot;Variety Not Stated.&quot; This is the kind
of seed labeled like simple &quot;red table wine&quot;: &quot;red
fescue&quot; or &quot;annual ryegrass.&quot; Try to find named
seed for a more vigorous, disease-resistant, and longer-lasting
lawn. Unnamed varieties are better for a special use such as a
quick cover crop to prevent erosion or mud, to solve a particular
overwintering problem, or if you absolutely must pinch pennies.
The more named seed in the mix, the better the buy.</p>

<p>As to which specific cultivar is best for you, get all the
advice you can, experiment, and keep in mind that almost any of
the new ones is bound to do better (again, not much unlike
wine--though you can never be certain). The fact that they are
named is sufficient to set them a cut above the unnamed kind, and
to make them worth a little bit more in price. </p>

<p>State land grant universities and the U.S. Dept. of
Agriculture tests turfgrass types by characteristic and by
overall performance on a state-by-state basis, providing yet
another way to decide which type is best for you. Check with your
Cooperative Extension Service (Appendix B) for more information.
With gene transplants entering the picture, we may yet find the
&quot;perfect&quot; grass seed--but don't hold your breath.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">ABOUT NORTHERN GRASSES: </a></h2>

<p>The following grasses grow well in the northern climates and
at higher altitudes in the South. Wherever there is a winter
snow, they should thrive, growing especially vigorously in the
spring and fall. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">COLONIAL BENT GRASS </a></h2>

<p>BOTANICAL NAME: <i>Agrostis tenuis </i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Bent grasses are finer in texture than
bluegrasses and require more care; they are therefore more likely
to succumb to diseases. These grasses spread by <i>stolons</i> (a
ground-level spreading branch) above ground and have thin, erect
blades.</p>

<p>CULTIVARS: Exeter, Highland </p>

<p>USE: A grass that does well in shade and sun and in acid soils
that won't support other grasses; mixes well with fine fescues.
Present in mixes bent grass to help produce a thick rich lawn in
areas of the country that are seasonally moist, such as the
Northwest and Northeast coastal regions, and some areas around
the Great Lakes. Fares well in New England, too. Avoid using in
hotter, drier areas.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Colonial bent grass needs frequent mowing to a height
of 3/4&quot; to 1&quot;, which often means mowing twice a week in
areas where it grows well.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">CREEPING BENTGRASS </a></h2>

<p>BOTANICAL NAME: <i>Agrostis palustris</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Creeping bentgrass is a beautiful fine grass that
spreads naturally to produce a thick green carpet. <i>Creeping</i>
is a term used interchangeably with <i>spreading</i>.</p>

<p>CULTIVARS: Emerald, Prominent, Penncross </p>

<p>USE: This is the incredible stuff you find on putting and
bowling greens, mowed to as little as 1/4 inch.</p>

<p>USE TIP: These grasses need lots of moisture, fertile soils
and much attention. Not recommended for homeowners, unless your
home is a country club and you have (or are) a full-time
groundskeeper.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Avoid any mix containing this seed for the reasons
stated above, though this is unlikely to be found in a typical
blend.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">KENTUCKY BLUEGRASS </a></h2>

<p>Botanical name: <i>Poa pratensis</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A fine-textured perennial grass with attractive
dark green color. It is often in sod because it spreads from
rhizomes (underground stems) to form a thick carpet. Over 80
cultivars have been developed, making this one of the most common
and popular grass seeds. Some are listed here; researchers
continue to develop better ones constantly.</p>

<p>CULTIVARS: Adelphi, America, Arboretum, Bensum, Birks,
Bonnieblue, Classic, Delta, Eclipse, Enmundi, Glade, Gnome,
Majesti, Merion (from a single plant found on the course of the
Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pa.), Merit, Monopoly, Nugget, Park,
Plush, Ram, Sydsport, Touchdown </p>

<p>USE: Kentucky bluegrass seed produces a thick, good-looking
lawn. It is your basic Northern grass. In order for it to be able
to compete with weeds and withstand heavy traffic or play, and
because it takes a while for bluegrass to establish itself, it is
often mixed with <b>fine</b> <b>fescues</b> or <b>perennial
ryegrasses (below)</b>, which establish themselves much faster
and are a little hardier. Does best when mowed to about
1-1/2&quot; and needs a fair amount of feeding, moisture, and
light, though types vary in their needs. Glade, Bensum, and
Eclipse are excellent performers in shade, and Adlephi, Classic,
and Gnome respond well to close clipping. Adlephi is one of the
most popular types.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Do not over-water during the hotter months. Mow grass
often so that it does not grow more than an 1-1/2 inches in
height. Grows best in sun, but some varieties tolerate shade
better than others.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Select varieties and blends that include
disease-resistant cultivars. Specialized publications tell you
which diseases each grass resists. Avoid mixes of Bluegrass and
turf-type tall fescues.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">PERENNIAL RYEGRASS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Turf-type Perennial Ryegrass</p>

<p>Botanical name: <i>Lolium perenne</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A &quot;bunchgrass&quot; that does not spread. It
does, however, grow thicker by growing extra stems on a single
plant. </p>

<p>CULTIVARS: There are very few differences among the more
popular cultivars, but these are a few you will find in garden
centers--All*Star, Blazer, Citation, Derby, Diplomat, Fiesta,
Manhattan (from a single plant found in New York City's Central
Park), N K-200, Omega, Pennant, Pennfine, Regal, Yorktown II</p>

<p>USE: Quick cover and tough, clean-mowing during the summer
(they only cut well with a very sharp mower blade during the late
spring). However, it often does not come back or does not do well
the second year after it is planted in locations with severe
winter cold and little snow cover. Found in mixes because it
provides coverage while the slower growing spreading grasses fill
in.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Ryegrass needs the same care as <b>bluegrass</b> <b>(above)</b>
and should be mown as frequently. Grows best in full sun with
plenty of water.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: When mixing or buying in a mix with bluegrass and
fine fescue make sure there is no more than 20% ryegrass in the
mixture. In higher percentages in a mixture ryegrass crowds out
the slower growing grasses. Look for varieties that are new<i>turf-types.</i>
'Manhattan' and 'Pennfine' are good choices. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">FINE FESCUE </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p>red fescue (Botanical name: <i>Festuca rubra</i> )</p>

<p>Chewings fescue (Botanical name: <i>F. rubra 'commutata' </i>)</p>

<p>hard fescue (Botanical name: <i>F. ovina </i>)</p>

<p>sheep fescue (Botanical name: <i>F. ovina</i> )</p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>red fescue:<i> </i>spreading fescue, creeping red fescue </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Thin-leafed and dark green in color, thinner and
finer than that of bluegrass. Often found in mixes with bluegrass
because it is particularly suited to northern areas of the
country and faster to establish itself.</p>

<p><i>red , or spreading, or creeping red fescue </i>: Though it
spreads slowly (by rhizomes, a sort of swollen underground stem)
it establishes itself quickly in the first season and is
therefore often mixed with slow-to-establish bluegrass.</p>

<p><i>Chewings fescue:</i> Tends to form dense clumps; named
after the man who developed it, a Mr. Chewings.Can be cut shorter
than red.</p>

<p><i>hard fescue: </i>Developed for an increased tolerance to
heat and drought.</p>

<p><i>sheep fescue: </i>Very clumpy, and better as an ornamental
border plant than for turf. Usually very blue.</p>

<p>CULTIVARS:</p>

<p>Agram, Banner, Ensylva, Highland, Highlight, Jamestown, Koket,
Ruby</p>

<p>USE: Most often found in mixes with other grass seed. Grows
under drier and shadier conditions than many other
grasses--hardier in general than bluegrasses. Fine fescues are
tough grasses that wear well in traffic areas. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Give this grass sun or dry shade and it does well
even in poor soil. Does not require as much fertilizer as
bluegrass and can be mown to a height of 1-1/2&quot;.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Buy in a mix with other grasses rather than alone.
The varieties <i>Highlight, Jamestown </i>and<i> Koket</i> are
good Chewings types for thick lawns. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">REDTOP </a></h2>

<p>BOTANICAL NAME: <i>Agrostis alba</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A coarse grass that forms a thin turf.</p>

<p>USE: Primarily as an erosion control or cover grass along
highways and open lands. Not a permanent grass, and too thin and
unattractive for use as a lawn.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Redtop requires minimum care and maintenance, and
does well in wet, cool sites. Does not require much fertilizer
and grows in poorly drained soils. Moisture is its primary
requirement.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Avoid mixes with Redtop in them. It is not at all
suited to use as a lawn grass, though it was once found in grass
mixes. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">ROUGH BLUEGRASS </a></h2>

<p>BOTANICAL NAME: <i>Poa trivialis</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Light green prostrate grass (meaning it lies
down) similar to the bentgrasses. It spreads by surface stolons,
but is not a very hardy grass. </p>

<p>USE: Does well in moist and cool shade but is not as
drought-resistant as other grasses as it is shallow-rooted.
'Sabre' is<i> </i>a cultivar which grows well in the North and
the South, but is used as a wintergrass to overseed southern
lawns after bermudagrasses go dormant during the winter season.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Does not grow well in sun or under dry conditions.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Buy this grass seed in shade mixtures with
bluegrasses and other seed. It is excellent for sites with cool,
moist shade.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">TALL FESCUE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Kentucky 31 fescue</p>

<p>BOTANICAL NAME: <i>Festuca arundinacea</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A coarse-textured bunchgrass that does not
spread, but once established, its deep roots allow it to be
persistent. Relatively disease, wear, and drought-tolerant. Good
winter recovery and spring greenup. New cultivars, known as<i>
turf type tall fescues</i>, are much finer textured.</p>

<p>CULTIVARS: Clemfine, Falcon, Houndog, Rebel</p>

<p>USE: Particularly suited to difficult sites in the central
United States. It can be used in areas that get little attention,
as it does well in poor soils without needing maintenance, and
can be used wherever bluegrass or the fine fescues have failed.
Often considered a weed in northern areas where it is difficult
to remove from bluegrass lawns. It does, however, prove useful in
areas where nothing else grows well. If it is found in a mixture,
it should be the main component--over 90%. Developed for use in
the transition zones that fall between the Northern and Southern
areas of the U.S. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Tall fescue requires little care, though it keeps its
color better if fertilzed in the spring and fall. Mow 2&quot; to
3&quot; high.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: In a major exception to the rule, this is not good
to have in a seed mix, especially if appearance is important to
you. It doesn't spread, but it does persist. Use it alone. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">ABOUT SOUTHERN GRASSES: </a></h2>

<p>Most of the following will grow only in the South, though some
can be grown in the so-called &quot;transistion areas&quot; at
the lower altitudes. Therefore most will only be found for sale
in the South. Also, unlike the Northern grasses, these are used
alone and not in mixtures. Generally only the common types are
available as seed--all, except bahiagrass, are propagated
vegetatively, so they must be planted as sod, plugs (small clumps
of sod), or sprigs (individual grass plants).</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">BAHIAGRASS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Bahia grass</p>

<p>BOTANICAL NAME: <i>Paspalpum notatum </i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A coarse-textured grass that is easy to care for.
Considered a weed if mixed with other grasses. Has unattractive
seed heads. Available as seed.</p>

<p>CULTIVARS: Paraguay, Paraguayan 22, Pensacola, Tifhi,
Wilmington </p>

<p>USE: Bahiagrass is an inexpensive, coarse grass that grows
well in the South, especially along the Gulf Coast. A few
varieties can grow in cooler regions where the temperatures get
as low as 5 degrees F. Bahiagrass grows in poor conditions, such
as sandy soils, where little else will grow. Drought-tolerant.</p>

<p>USE TIP: This is a relatively low-maintenance grass. It
tolerates some neglect and poor conditions, but of coures looks
better if at least some care is given. Mow high, between 2&quot;
and 3.&quot; Needs frequent mowing.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Bahiagrass in a mix with fine fescue produces a
quick cover, but the fine fescue dies out as the Bahiagrass fills
in. Many Southern grass mixes contain Bahiagrass seed.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">BERMUDAGRASS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Common Bermudagrass</p>

<p>BOTANICAL NAME: <i>Cynodon dactylon</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Fine-textured grass with pleasant green color.
Some types are sterile hybrids which must be planted as sod,
plugs, or sprigs--they do not come as seeds. The first three
listed below are the newest, improved seeded types.</p>

<p>CULTIVARS: Cheyenne, Guymon, Sahara, Sunturf, Tifton,
Tifgreen' (Tifton 328), Tiflawn (Tifton 57), Tifway (Tifton 419),
U-3</p>

<p>USE: Easy-to-grow, wear-resistant grass that responds well to
good care in areas where the temperature remains high. Common,
seeded types are found in mixes for Southern or warmer areas of
the country, intended for lawns as well as golf courses.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Unlike <b>Bahia Grass (above)</b>, Bermuda grasses
demand much attention. They generally require much watering and
fertilizing to look well, though some varieties are hardier than
others. They only grow at temperatures above 50<sup>o</sup>F.
They turn brown at the first frost and remain so until the return
of summer. Lawns in areas with these temperatures must be
overseeded with cool season grasses to keep weeds from invading.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Often included in mixes sold in hospitable areas.
Because it is a high-maintenance grass, buy only mixes with a
lower percentage of Bermuda grass seed.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">SAINT AUGUSTINE GRASS </a></h2>

<p>BOTANICAL NAME: <i>Stenotaphrum secundatum</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Attractive, rapidly-spreading, shade-tolerant,
dark green grass with flat tipped leaves. The leaves are in
bunches and give the lawn a thick appearance. Not available in
seed form--it must be planted from sod, plugs, or sprigs.</p>

<p>CULTIVARS: Roselawn, Coarse, Bitter Blue, Floratine, Floratam </p>

<p>USE: One of the best southern grasses. Grows well in shade and
sun, and tolerates salty soils. It is often used in sod or sold
in small clumps (plugs) to be set out in a grid pattern to fill
in, as this grass spreads rapidly. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Though normally it should be relatively easy to care
for, St. Augustine grass has been affected by severe diseases and
pests in the last few years. Unfortunately, these problems
require high chemical maintenance, and if it were not for these
plagues, St. Augustine grass would be easier to grow. Also needs
lots of water. Does best in neutral to alkaline soils.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A very good grass for Southern lawns, but given
the problems recently with pests and diseases, try to buy more
resistant varieties. Check with your local Cooperative Extension
Agent (<b>Appendix B</b>) for advice.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">ZOYSIA GRASS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES (BOTANICAL NAMES): </p>

<p><i>Zoysia japonica </i></p>

<p><i>Zoysia matrella</i></p>

<p><i>Zoysia tenuifolia</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Japanese carpet grass</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The thickest and most attractive of the southern
turf grasses, but its most distinguishing characteristic is that
it turns brown during its long off-season. Certain varieties have
been developed which will grow in the Midwest and other areas of
the country. Similar in appearance to Bermuda grass. Very slow to
establish--it may take up to 4 years to form a lawn. Zoysia
japonica, also called Meyer zoysia, is the most common improved
variety, and has medium width leaves. Zoysia matrella has the
widest leaves and Z. tenuifolia has the finest. Common seed is
available in limited quanity; most is sold as sod, plugs, or
sprigs. </p>

<p>CULTIVARS: Belair, El Toro, Emerald, Flawn, Meyer, Midwestern</p>

<p>USE: Used in southern lawn mixes where a thick texture is
desired, mixed in with a good companion cover grass. It grows
well in sun but not as well in shade.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Though not as high-maintenance as Bermuda grass,
Zoysia is slow the germinate and mature. It does not recover as
well as Burmuda grass does to pests or damage by compaction. It
should be mixed with other grasses to provide a quick cover and
crowd out weeds.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Zoysia grass seed is good in a turf mix in areas
of the country where it will grow. It should, however, be mixed
with grasses which mature quicker.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">About Fertilizers: </a></h2>

<p>Fertilizers may very well be the most common product purchased
in garden centers as well as the one that causes the most
confusion. Here's an extended introduction to help orient the
average beginning gardener who wants to know the background for
the terms used on fertilizer labels and found in gardening
advice. </p>

<p>Fertilizers come from a wide variety of natural and
manufactured sources and are marketed in many forms and mixes.
What follows here should help you understand the almost
incredible array of choices that are available to you.</p>

<p>Though often referred to as <i>plant food,</i> fertilizers are
just part of a plant food creation process. Green plants actually
make their own food through <i>photosynthesis</i>, the process
whereby green plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to
produce carbohydrates that nourish the plant.<b> </b>Sixteen
elements, or <i>nutrients</i>, are essential in order for green
plants to do this. The first three elements needed are carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, and they come from water and air. Whenever
the 13 other nutrients are lacking in the soil (or just need to
be replenished as they are naturally leached out of the soil by
water) they can be provided by fertilizers. </p>

<p>The most important basic nutrients, commonly known as <i>primary
nutrients </i>(or <i>macronutrients</i> , or <i>essential</i>, or
<i>major</i> nutrients) are <i>nitrogen</i> (chemical symbol
&quot;N&quot;), <i>phosphorus </i> referred to also as <i>phosphate</i>,
<i>phosphoric acid</i>, or <i>phosphoric oxide </i> (chemical
symbol &quot;P&quot; or &quot;P205&quot;), and <i>potassium</i> <i>
</i>commonly referred to by its soluble name,<i> potash  </i>(chemical
symbol &quot;K&quot; or &quot;K20&quot;). </p>

<p>Each of these elements affects plant growth differently (and
each plant a bit differently) and must be chosen accordingly,
according to whatever you have determined that the plant needs.
In general, though, the primary nutrients work as follows:</p>

<p><i>Nitrogen</i>promotes the growth of green leaves and stems.
(Grass is a big consumer of nitrogen.)</p>

<p><i>Phosphorus</i>aids in the production of roots, flowers, and
fruit. (This is most desirable for ornamentals, vegetables, and
especialy bulbs.)</p>

<p><i>Potassium </i>aids in the flowering and fruiting as well as
the sturdiness of the plant in terms of disease and stress
resistance (like winter weather). (Grass usually needs plenty of
potash.)</p>

<p>All plants and soils require these nutrients in a particular
balance, and putting too much of one nutrient or another will
cause stress and problems for the plant. For example, plants
getting too much nitrogen will have plenty of green leaves, but
they will be soft, the root system will be underdeveloped, and
the blooms for flowers or fruit will be retarded. Read your
detailed gardening guides carefully to determine what your plants
really need.</p>

<p>The three primary nutrients described above work in
conjunction with three <i>secondary nutrients</i> and at least
seven <i>trace</i>, <i>minor</i> or<i>micronutrients</i>, which
ultimately just help the plant function, much as vitamins do with
us humans. Just as we can't live on food alone--we need vitamins
to turn our food into energy--neither can the plants process the
macronutrients without a proper amount of micronutrient minerals
in the soil. They also tend to balance out the pH of the soil, pH
being the term used to describe the relative acidity or
alkalinity of soil <b>(see Note, Chapter 1, About Soil Tests). </b></p>

<p>The <i>secondary nutrients</i> are <i>calcium</i>, <i>magnesium</i>,
and <i>sulfur</i>, and are sometimes lumped with the
macronutrients. Like vitamins for us, these usually occur in
sufficient quantity in a normal situation but need to be added
when a deficiency is noticed, or to cure a particular problem.
And too much can be a bad thing.</p>

<p><i>Calcium</i> is usually supplied by lime or other soil
conditioners, and is part of the cell-manufacturing process,
particularly important for early root growth.</p>

<p><i>Magnesium</i> is usually found with calcium, and is a prime
element of seed development and development of clorophyll.</p>

<p><i>Sulfur</i> is supplied by most fertilizers and nature
(including rain from polluted skies!), often in some form of
sulfate. <i>Sulphur</i> and <i>sulphate</i> are acceptable
alternative spellings. It is a primary element of plant proteins
and helps give plants a dark green color.</p>

<p><i>Micronutrients</i> include <i>iron</i>, <i>manganese,
copper, boron, zinc, chlorine,</i> and <i>molybdenum</i>. As
fertilizers, they are usually applied to specific plants to cure
specific conditions of deficiency, as opposed to the general-use
complete fertilizers mentioned above. They occur sufficiently in
normal, pH-balanced soils, although houseplants, being in an
unnatural environment, may need a boost sometimes via special
products which package them (see <b>Chelated Micronutrients,
below</b>). They should only be added when you know your soil
needs them[[Eth]][[Eth]]otherwise you may damage your plants,
just as when humans overdo it with vitamins. In most cases
though, it is easier to change the pH of your soil in order to
get your micronutrient levels where they should be. They are
needed in very small quantities, so small that the amount is
called a trace, giving them the name <i>trace elements, </i>although
iron is needed in larger quantities to promote clorophyll
production and green color. </p>

<p>One important thing to keep in mind when using fertilizers is
that only the right amount will do. It only helps when the
nutrients are needed; more is not better and may be quite harmful
(it is more harmful than under-fertilizing), so do not
over-apply. With many plants, such as fruit trees, you can reduce
or eliminate the need for fertilizer by pruning and mulching,
among other good gardening practices. Finally, no amount of
fertilizing can make up for serious environmental problems, such
as poor soil, rampant disease, extreme acidity or alkalinity,
lack of moisture or sunlight, or (and this is the hardest to
accept for so many of us) an inappropriate climate. Plants cannot
be forced to grow where they really don't want to just by pouring
on more fertilizer. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT FERTILIZER LABEL TERMS: </a></h2>

<p>Fertilizer packages are labeled with a host of confusing
terms, the most common of which are defined here. Note that some
of these items are mixed together to provide a balance of
characteristics; the most important thing to understand is that
certain ingredients make them fast- or slow-acting. The detail
you find on synthetic product labels is required by law that
varies from state to state. </p>

<p>- <i>Complete fertilizers: </i>Fertilizers intended for
general use which contain significant amounts of the three
primary nutrients (N, P, and K). Hundreds of formulations are
marketed for use as &quot;plant food,&quot; &quot;vegetable
food,&quot; or for specific plants, as explained later in this
chapter. The percentage of these three elements contained in any
mixture (and their sources) is found, by law, on the package
label and is stated with three numbers separated by dashes, such
as &quot;5-10-5,&quot; or &quot;8-6-4,&quot; or
&quot;22-3-3.&quot; This is the <i>grade, </i>or<i> guaranteed
analysis, </i>or<i> NPK number. </i>The first number is always
the percentage of nitrogen, the second number is always the
percentage of phosphorus, and the last is always the percentage
of potash. They are always stated in this order, and the
percentage tells you by default how much of each nutrient is in
the package, by weight, which is what you are ultimately
concerned with (fertilizer is applied at a rate of so many pounds
per 1000 square feet, usually). Obviously, these same numbers
tell you the ratio, or proportion, of one nutrient to another as
well. </p>

<p>Keep in mind when comparing prices that you pay for the
nutrient concentration, not the weight per se. Once you have
determined the square feet of the area you wish to fertilize
(most helpful if rounded off to the nearest 1,000 square feet)
and what your fertilizer needs are, purchase the fertilizer with
the appropriate grade for the amount of nutrients you want, while
taking into account the size of the bag. For example, a common
lawn fertilizer, Scott's Turf Builder, is rated at 22-3-3. A 12
lb bag contains 22% nitrogen, or 2.64 lbs. If you bought a
fertilizer rated 11-3-3 instead, you would need twice as much
fertilizer--24 lbs--to obtain the same amount of nitrogen. And
always note how much of it is going to be released quickly and
how much released slowly, according the information on the types
of nitrogen noted below.</p>

<p>- <i>Incomplete fertilizer: </i>If a fertilizer contains only
one or two of the primary nutrients, it is called <i>incomplete</i>.
This is not to say that it is of lower quality, but simply to
identify it as a fertilizer to be used in specific way to treat a
specific deficiency. An almost infinite variey of mixes are made
for specific applications, which is explained later in this
chapter. Keep in mind when shopping that the unit cost of each
nutrient increases as the package size decreases.</p>

<p><i>- Organic fertilizer</i><b><i>:</i></b><i> </i>Any
fertilizer produced by natural sources--animals or plants--is
&quot;organic,&quot; &quot;natural organic,&quot;
&quot;natural,&quot; &quot;bio-organic plant booster,&quot; or
&quot;naturally derived.&quot; These products all contain carbon
compounds. (The opposite of natural organic is <i>synthetic</i>,
or man-made fertilizer--manufactured items made from non-living
items, called &quot;inorganic,&quot; &quot;chemical&quot; or
&quot;petrochemical&quot;). If a natural product is mined and
then treated in some chemical process, it is no longer considered
organic. The nitrogen in organic fertilizers is the
water-insoluble, slow-release type, meaning it lasts longer in
the soil before leaching out and probably not &quot;burn&quot;
the plants. Some well-known organic fertilizers are manure, blood
meal, and fish tankage, all noted below. They nourish the plants
as they decay naturally with the help of microrganisms. </p>

<p>However, and this is terribly important, a fertilizer may be
labled &quot;organic&quot; even if part of it is from
manufactured sources, as long as a certain percentage of it is
from water-insoluble materials (synthetic, chemical products are
almost100% soluble, which is why they work and then wash out of
the soil so quickly). Fertilizer labeling as to whether something
is organic or not is determined by standards set by each state,
which can vary quite a bit. &quot;Natural organic&quot; is the
most precise term, and the one generally used in this book,
though it is used interchangeably with just plain
&quot;organic.&quot; The fact that a product may be labeled by
its manufacturer as &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;partly
organic&quot; when it contains man-made chemicals or is
chemically treated somehow is confusing at best and downright
misleading at worst, especially in this day when there is a
certain cachet attached to the word &quot;organic&quot; by many
consumers. <i>Caveat emptor.</i></p>

<p><i>- Water-Insoluble Nitrogen (WIN): </i>This is a
slow-release form of nitrogen. A certain amount is desirable,
especially when mixed with faster acting nitrogen sources likes
those noted below. A higher percentage of this kind of nitrogen
in relation to the fast-acting kind means that the plant does not
receive much nitrogen right away, but it does eventually; this is
usually desirable because the plant has time to get the nitrogen
in a useful way. Check your gardening guides to determine how
much to apply, as each percentage (say more than 50% or less than
15%) dictates the application of the fertilizer. Tends to make
fertilizer more expensive, but less likely to &quot;burn&quot;
the plant or to leach out, like the fast-acting nitrogen sources.
Organic fertilizers are high in this kind of nitrogen. Container
plants that are watered frequently need this kind of nitrogen. </p>

<p><i>- Ammoniacal, Urea, and Nitrate nitrogen:</i> Fast-acting
(&quot;quick-release&quot;), inexpensive, synthetic,
water-soluble sources of nitrogen, which may or may not raise the
pH of the soil depending on the type of nitrate compound used.
Various nitrates are usually mixed in complete fertilizers to
lessen their effect on acidity. It acts quickly (it can even
&quot;burn&quot; the plant) and is generally inexpensive, but it
also tends to leach quickly from the soil, which is no help.
Synthetic fertilizers are high in this kind of nitrogen, which is
the salt of an acid, and because it is caustic, it should be
handled very carefully. Too much too fast, and your plants may
weaken, making them susceptible to fungi.</p>

<p>Included in this group are<i> ammonium nitrate, ammonium
sulfate (sulfate of ammonia), calcium nitrate, </i>and<i> nitrate
of soda </i>(though one brand of nitrate of soda is organic:
Bulldog, from Chile). While these are usually components of
complete fertilizers, most are also available separately--they
have up to 46% nitrogen--if you want to mix your own fertilizer
(not a great idea, by the way) or cure a particular major
deficiency in extreme conditions, such as cool weather, when
nutrients move slowly. Their labels indicate whether they acidify
or alkalize the soil; most acidify the soil (lower the pH), as
indicated in the Potential Acidity Equivalent, explained below. </p>

<p><i>- Urea-Form</i>, <i>UF</i> , or <i>ureaform</i>, is urea
reacted with formaldehyde to make it largely water-insoluble and
therefore slowly available and non-burning, as opposed to plain
form described above. It contains 35 to 40% nitrogen. Urea is a
man-made form of nitrogen derived from natural gas products, and
even though it is synthethized, because it contains carbon it is
sometimes labeled &quot;organic&quot; or &quot;synthetic
organic.&quot; It is not organic, according to all but the
broadest definition of the term. </p>

<p><i>- Coated Slow-Release Urea Nitrogen:</i> This is the
above-mentioned quick- release nitrogen coated with sulfur to
delay its release, adding sulfur to the soil at the same time
(which reduces the pH, meaning it acidifies the soil) and
reducing the tendency of chemical &quot;burn.&quot; Sometimes
abbreviated SCU (sulfur coated urea). You must decide, though a
soil test or plant behavior, if your soil needs pH-reducing
sulfur or not. Each coated granule is called a <i>prill. </i>Another
form of synthetic, slow-release, treated nitrogen is IBDU, or
isobutylidene diurea, which has about 30% nitrogen that releases
at low temperatures over a long period of time. </p>

<p><i>- Potential Acidity Equivalent</i><b><i>:</i></b><b> </b>Thistells
the degree to which a synthetic fertilizer will change the pH of
a soil (organic fertilizers are not obliged to list this),
expressed in terms of pounds of calcium carbonate per ton, that
is, the amount of CaCO3 needed to neutralize the acidifying
effect of the fertilizer, and can range from none to over 2200
pounds, with anything over about 250 being considered acidic, and
a range up to about 1,000 being common. Most gardeners can ingore
this--it is only important if a soil test indicates a pH problem
or you are concerned about plants that are fussy about pH, such
as hydrangeas--because the actual degree of effect is not acute
and really depends on many other factors. It's really more a
question of building up acidity over time. Check your how-to
books to find out if your plants need an acid or alkaline soil,
and take soil tests to determine where you stand. Organic
fertilizers do not create this problem as much as synthetic
fertilizers, which tend to be acidic, especially the faster
acting, less expensive ones. </p>

<p>- <i>Chelates, or chelated secondary and micronutrients: </i>Water-soluble
compounds, a form of nutrient that is readily available to the
plants as a foliar spray (one that is sprayed directly onto the
leaves) or applied to the soil like any other fertilizer. These
nutrients would not be available to the plants unless they were
chelated. Micronutrients may be aided in their becoming rapidly
available by an unamed chemical catalyst called a<i>chelating
agent. </i>Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Copper, and Zinc are the
most common ones sold individually, although some products
include more. Many gardeners consider these to be professional
products only.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">ABOUT FORMS OF FERTILIZERS:</a></h2>

<p>-<i>Liquid . </i>These fertilizers are sold as concentrations
of either water-soluble powders or liquids that need to be
diluted with water. Liquid fertilizers, also called <i>nutritional
sprays</i>, may be used as a <i>foliar spray</i> (applied to the
leaves--also called a <i>nutrient leaf spray</i>) or applied to
the ground in a <i>ground spray</i> to be absorbed through the
roots. They are more easily applied (especially in small
quantities) and usually more readily available to the plant than
other forms. However, they are less practical for large areas and
easy to over-apply by mistake, which may burn the plant, and they
are also easily leached from the soil. Most are meant to be a
special boost to plants in difficulty, and usually have more
micronutriens than the other forms of fertilizer.</p>

<p><i>-Powders . </i>As the name suggests, these are plant
nutrients in powder form. They offer quick sources of nutrients
to plants, but are easily leached out of the soil. They may be
blown away by the wind and can cake in storage, but generally
cost less.</p>

<p><i>-Time-released </i>or<i> Controlled release. </i>These are
fertilizers that come in capsule form (sometimes called a <i>prill
</i>), covered with a resin membrane that disolves slowly when
the plant is watered and as the soil temperature is raised, thus
releasing the nutrients over a period of time. Often a sulfur
coating, it lets water in through osmosis or else just breaks
down slowly. Some brands may last in the ground up to 9 months,
releasing fertilizer as the plant needs it. <i>Osmocote</i> is a
well-known brand name of this sort.</p>

<p><i>-Pelletized</i> or <i>Pelleted</i>. These are powders that
have been compressed into pellets. As it takes longer for the
pellets to break down, the easily leached nutrients are released
slowly. They flow through <b>spreaders (Chapter 8)</b> easily,
aren't affected by wind like powders are, and resist caking. Very
large pellets may be called <i>tablets</i>, and are used mostly
by profesionals for planting shrubs and trees when they want the
fertilizer to last up to two years.</p>

<p><i>-Spikes . </i>2&quot;-3&quot; sticks or stakes made from a
compacted fiber impregnated with fertilizer. These are often used
for houseplants but are also available</p>

<p>in larger sizes for trees and outdoor shrubs. The fertilizer
is released slowly as the spike disintegrates in the soil. Some
spikes also contain pesticides. The most convenient form for
houseplants and small gardens.</p>

<p><b>- </b><i>Granular or Granulated. </i>Granules designed tobe
used with spreaders, consisting of larger particles than found in
dusts or powders but generally smaller than pellets. The granules
stick to the plant and break down over time with exposure to
moisture, releasing the chemical slowly. This is the most common
form for <i>top-</i> or <i>side-dressing </i>(putting fertilizer
on the soil surface).</p>

<p><b>- </b><i>Trionized</i>. Granules of vermiculite or other
lightweight material to which the three nutrients are bonded,
making for a very even distribution of nutrients. Each granule is
homogenous.</p>

<p>- <i>Simple-mix. </i>Variously-sized granules of nutrients
which may be unevenly distributed in the bag because of their
different weights and textures, and therefore may deliver
fertilizer unevenly to a lawn or plant.</p>

<p>- <i>Polyform. </i>The lightest, most concentrated form of
fertilizer. The nutrient granules have been screened, so they are
all the same size. </p>

<p>GENERAL BUYING TIPS: As with many products, fertilizer is
usually cheaper per pound in the larger packages, often
dramatically so. Keep in mind that the grade--the three numbers
on the label--indicate the percentage of the package by weight of
each major nutrient, and that therefore you need less of a
fertilizer with a higher grade than one with a lower grade in
order to obtain the same results.</p>

<p>As for specialized fertilizers, most gardeners can get by with
nothing more than the general mixes of the 5-10-5, 10-6-4 (for
lawns, evergreens, and trees), and10-10-10 varieties. The others
are for fine-tuning when you known precisely what kind of problem
you are addressing, and for personal preference in terms of
brands, forms, price, and the like. One thing is sure: gardening
is far from an exact science. It is quite amusing to hear people
(sellers and consumers alike) absolutely swear by one product or
another--with totally opposite conclusions.</p>

<p>An alarming aspect of fertilizer merchandising which takes
advantage of this manic search for the one, perfect product is
the common practice by manufacturers, particularly those among
the best-known and most widely distributed, to have the exact
same fertilizer sold under different labels. For example, <i>Flower
</i>as well as <i>Shrub, Tree, &amp; Ground Cover </i>fertilizer<i>,</i>
or <i>lawn food</i> and <i>garden food</i>. This may help the
gardener who needs to be told that a particular product is OK for
his or her garden or lawn or flowers, but it also might encourage
that same gardener to buy twice as much as needed, that is, two
containers when one would do. It is not difficult to read the
labels to see if they are any different from one another.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">NATURAL ORGANIC fertilizers </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC3">About NATURAL ORGANIC Fertilizers: </a></h2>

<p>Technically known as <i>naturally derived fertilizers</i>,
these are made from nutrients taken from plants or animals, and
are not manufactured or treated in any way (see <b>ABOUT
FERTILIZER TERMS</b>, <b>above</b>). Some manufacturers argue
that any carbon-based or mined material is organic, but in
gardening terms this is not narrow enough, and it would allow
inclusion of synthesized or treated materials. However, for the
sake of brevity here, the term &quot;organic&quot; is used to
mean &quot;natural organic.&quot; </p>

<p>Organic fertilizers help build up the soil, both in terms of
structure or texture and in terms of microganisms. Over time,
their use builds up the micronutrients and the earthworms in a
soil. In fact, after regular use of organic fertilizers you may
need to use less, a persuasive argument for their us; the
opposite is often true of synthetic fertilizers. All soils need
organic matter, if only to encourage earthworms and other
organisms to do their work, and synthetic fertilizers add none.
Organic fertilizers generaly do not harm the enivornment in
manufacture nor in use, and need only renewable sources of energy
for their &quot;manufacture.&quot; While the synthetic
fertilizers may cost less per bag in the short run, they require
huge factories and vast amounts of non-renewable energy sources
for their manufacture. The essential characteristic of organic
fertilizers is that they act as <b>soil conditioners (Chapter 1)</b>
as well as low-nutrient fertilizers. The basic idea of organic
fertilizers is to feed the soil, not the plant.</p>

<p>However, organic fertilizers have some drawbacks: they are
usually not &quot;complete&quot; fertilizers, in that they do not
contain a conveniently balanced mix of the primary nuturients (N,
P, and K) noted above in <b>About Fertilizers</b>. Typically each
type is a particularly good source of one or two of the primary
nutrients, and other types of fertilizers must be used to provide
a balance of primary nutrients, meaning more work for the
gardener. They also release their nutrients slowly, which may not
be fast enough to solve an acute fertilizing problem. They need
warm temperatures for the micro-organisms to work, while chemical
fertilizers need only water. And some are hard to store, due to
their bulk. You may have to apply more than you would of a
synthetic fertilizer in order to achieve the same effect, because
they are less concentrated. Synthetic fertilizers are usually
more convenient, precise (that is, developed for particular needs
and plants), and easy to store. </p>

<p>The end result of complete dependency on and overuse of
synthetic fertilizers is that you may need more chemicals to
counteract the first chemicals and their side effects, ulitmately
harming the environment through water pollution and soil
depletion, which is added to the environmental cost of industrial
manufacturing. On the other hand, you generally have to work
harder when using organic fertilizers, putting more on at any
given time, and waiting longer for them to take effect, often
with less spectacular results. Pound for pound, organic
fertilizers may be more expensive than synthetic ones, but over
time, you will probably need to put more synthetic fertilizer in
your garden than if you use organic fertilizer, and in any case
more often, because the very characteristic that makes synthetics
act so fast--water solubility--also makes them wash out of the
soil with the rain.</p>

<p>Much has been written and argued about the value of using
organic fertilizers instead of the synthetic fertilizers that are
found for sale everywhere. Ultimately, the argument might come
down to points that are not opposing ones (making this a good,
long argument, of course!) Like most arguments, this one can't
really be won, but it seems to be essentially a political or
personal choice, involving your perception of the merits of
short-term vs. long-term effects on the environment and your
attitude toward chemicals in general, although more commercial
growers are going 100% organic than ever before. A balanced
approach of mixed use is a typical solution, though promoters of
the strictly organic approach to gardening make good common
sense, especially for the home gardener. After all, gardening is
essentially a natural operation, and they suggest you keep it
that way. </p>

<p>And just when you thought you had this worked out, the same
argument must be considered for <b>pesticides (Chapter 4) </b>as
well. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">GENERAL USE ORGANIC FERTILIZERS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC5">COTTONSEED MEAL </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Ground or powdered cotton seeds made after the
oil has been extracted from them (the seeds are left over from
cotton production). <i>Soybean meal</i>, rated at 6-2-2, is a
similar product.</p>

<p>USE: Rated at 6-2-1 or 7-2-2, it also contains some trace
elements and micronutrients. Good for acid-loving plants and
shrubs. Nutrients more available to plants in warm soil.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Often used as cattle feed as well as a fertilizer.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: A good grade of meal is deep yellow; fermented
meal is red brown; ground meal containing the hull is dark brown.
</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">GUANO</a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Peruvian Guano</i></p>

<p><i>Phosphatic Guano</i></p>

<p><i>Bat Guano, or Desert Bat Guano</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Guano is the decomposed and aged manure of
seabirds and less commonly, of bats. (The word &quot;guano&quot;
is from the Quichua language of the Incas, and originally only
refered to the droppings of seabirds.)</p>

<p><i>Peruvian Guano </i>is the decomposed manure of cormorants
and other fish-eating birds found on extremely dry desert
islands, making it both concentrated and rare because of the lack
of rain.</p>

<p><i>Phosphatic Guano </i>is bird manure that is leached by
rain. It was popular in the United States before the 1960's, at
which time <b>phosphate rock</b> <b>(below) </b>started being
commercially processed in South Carolina and Florida, which
provided a less expensive source for phosphate.</p>

<p><i>Bat Guano </i>is dried and decomposed manure of bats, and a
complete fertilizer rated from 3-8-1 to 8-4-1 with both the
phosphorus and the potash immediately available to the plants;
also contains most micronutrients, including iron, calcium,
magnesium, boron, and sulfur. Odorless, fine, concentrated, brown
powder.</p>

<p>USE: As a good source of phosphate, but generally balanced and
complete fertilizer supplying both fast and slow-release
nutrients. Bat guano is one of the best organic fertilizers (and
soil conditioners) around, particularly suited for flowering
ornamental trees and shrubs. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Organic fertilizers such as these do not burn
plants, so the amount used does not have to be exact. Recommended
quantities should be used in any case.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Because the term <i>Guanos</i> has been loosely
used to describe animal manures, fish scrap, or tankage
containing feces, check to see that you are purchasing <i>bat
guano</i> or <i>Peruvian guano. </i>If it is hard to find bat
guano in garden centers near you, try a mail order source.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">MANURE</a></h2>

<p>TYPES: </p>

<p><i>Hot Manures</i></p>

<p><i>Cold Manures</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Hot manure: </i>Often used colloquially to mean fresh
manure that is decomposing.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A finely ground, dry powder with no or a very
slight manure odor. Sold in bags ranging from 5 lbs to l00 lbs,
and may be either of three types: <i>Composted</i> (aged with
compost) or<i>decomposed</i> , <i>rotted </i>, or <i>aged</i> ; <i>dehydrated</i>
or <i>dried; </i>or <i>fresh milled</i> (shredded, usualy with
straw or other &quot;bedding litter&quot;). <i>Composted </i>and<i>
dehydrated manure</i> s have been exposed to micro-organisims
over a period of time and have begun to break down (and are mixed
with compost), and are the most common kind available; dehydrated
is also ground into a fine, soil-like texture. Cow manure is the
most common kind available commericially. Dehydrated manure has
been heated up to 180<sup>o</sup> and reduced to about 17%
moisture, killing all the weed seeds and plant pathogens, and
removing superfluous water weight. Some companies do this
naturally, in a giant compost pile, without the use of fossil
fuels. All good quality manures contain sufficient macro and
micronutrients to maintain healthy soil, though they are a bit
more concentrated in dehydrated manure.</p>

<p>(<i>Green manures</i> are succulant crops such as Mustard,
Buckwheat, Annual Ryegrass, and Winter Rye that are grown
specifically to be plowed right back into the ground before they
ripen. <i>Fresh manure</i> comes straight from a local farmer, or
more accurately, from the horse, cow, or other animal. This is
usually not found for sale in garden centers; if you want to use
it, beware of weeds: you should heat it up and decompose it in
your compost heap first in order to kill the weed seeds, which is
what has been done to commercially available manures.)</p>

<p><i>Hot Manures</i> are high in nitrogen and come from
chickens, crickets (yes, crickets) horses, sheep, and rabbits,
ranging from 1% to 4% at the very most; chicken and cricket
manures have the most primary nutrients, up to 4-4-2. Some
manufacturers label mixtures of these manures as
&quot;supreme&quot; or &quot;super&quot; manure.</p>

<p><i>Cold Manures </i>are lower in nitrogen than the hot manures
and come </p>

<p>from cattle and hogs, usually having no more than 1 or 2%
nitrogen. Dehydrated and composted cow manures are rated as high
as 5-5-5 and as low as .2-.1-.2; pH tends to the balanced range;
dehyrdrated manures are more concentrated.</p>

<p>USE: A source of nitrogen in a form that is not as strong as
in chemical fertilizers and is less likely to &quot;burn&quot;
than chemical fertilizers. Cow manure is also a very effective <b>soil
conditioner (Chapter 1)</b>, and many gardeners think of it as
one instead of a fertilizer because it is so low in nutrients (it
may also be labled as such, though because it is really a
fertilizer, it has an NPK number). This makes it better for
mixing in with soil when planting rather than as top-dressing
fertilizer. Manures both add and stimulate essential
micro-organisms in the soil and build humus. Composted cow manure
is best for turning into the soil of an entire garden with the
use of a power tiller, while dehydrated is better suited to
mixing into bedding or container soil mixes with hand tools.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Cattle manures are often low in nutrients, but when
used in sufficient quantities do provide enough nutrients to make
a difference. They also improve soil condition by adding organic
material, which opens up the soil (improves the
&quot;tilth&quot;) to air and water. If too much manure is used,
or if it is insufficiently decomposed, even it may burn plants.
Fresh cow manure may burn your plants and introduce weeds from
the straw. Furthermore, bacteria which breaks down fresh manure
needs extra nitrogen to do so and competes with your plants for
it. And besides, it smells! Chicken manure should be used with
care and then only after it has been sufficiently rotted, or else
it will burn your plants. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Dehydrated cow manure is much more expensive than
composted cow manure, as it is more concentrated per pound--so
you use less. That lower price of composted manure includes a lot
of water. </p>

<p>Dehydrated cow manure is also easier to spread. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">SEWAGE SLUDGE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Activated sewage sludge</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Milorganite</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Created from municipal sewage that has been
treated with microorganisms, heat dried, and aerated in a special
process. Looks like a rich soil mix. Depending on the source, it
may vary from dark gray to black in color. Rated at about 5-2-5,
with iron. <u>Does not smell of sewage.</u></p>

<p>USE: As a soil conditioner and a fertilizer, usually on lawns
and in ornamental gardens. Particularly well-suited to
houseplants. It is a good substitute for <b>fish emulsion (above)</b>
as it smells less not only to humans, but to domestic cats.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Sewage sludge may contain pesticides and industrial
chemicals which may be harmful to you or the environment, so it
is not recommended to use this product in a vegetable garden.
Even when it is used on a lawn or ornamental garden (it is
commonly used on golf courses), you could possibly be adding
harmful chemicals to the water table. Experts are quite divided
on this question.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Avoid buying sludge which does not identify all
the chemicals contained within. With more and more municipal
sewage contaminated by the often unlawful disposal of industrial
chemicals, it is worth checking to see if any of these chemicals
are present in sewage sludge before purchasing or using it.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">TANKAGE</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The dried, ground, and rendered by-products of
slaughtered animals--what's left over after the meat has been
processed for commercial food consumption. Rated at 7-10-0. Some
specialized forms are <i>hoof and horn meal, </i>with a grade of
14-2-0, and <i>leather meal</i> or <i>leather dust</i>, rated at
5-0-0. </p>

<p>USE: Tankage is a common fertilizer ingredient and sometimes
available in pure form to be used as a fertilizer. It was more
available pure in the past, before it became popular as an
additive to animal food. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC18">SPECIALIZED ORGANIC FERTILIZERS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC19">ABOUT SPECIALIZED ORGANIC FERTILIZERS: </a></h2>

<p>Fertilizers can be blended, or simply naturally occur, in ways
that are particularly well-suited to specific purposes and
plants. Organic fertilizers tend to occur with concentrations of
one of the major nutrients, as you can see by the entries below. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC20">BONE MEAL </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Steamed bone meal</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: As the name suggests, this product is obtained
from the bones of animals left over from being processed for meat
(&quot;renderings&quot;); they are steamed and ground. It is sold
in powder form, has a mild smell, and is white in color. Slightly
alkaline, a typical grade is 4-12-0. <i>Raw bone meal</i> is
harder to find but is slower acting and longer lasting. </p>

<p>USE: A natural source of phosphorus, usually a minimum of12%.
Especially helpful when planting bulbs.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Commonly placed in the bottom of holes for bulbs,
shrubs, and trees.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The phosphorus level in bone meal today is lower
than in the past, due to more efficient slaughterhouses. Today,
bone meal contains less additional animal parts (meat, marrow, or
blood) than previously because they are being used for additives
to pet food. <b>Superphosphate (below) </b>might be a better
source of phosphorus, especially when it is used for the fall
planting of spring bulbs, or a commercial mix called something
like &quot;bulb booster.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC21">DRIED BLOOD </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Blood meal</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dried and ground blood from slaughtered animals,
containing on the average about 12% nitrogen, and no other
primary nutrient (12-0-0). May be red or black in color, and
kiln-dried or spray-dried. </p>

<p>USE: A good source of nitrogen sold as a powder, which may be
applied as a diluted liquid as well. The nitrogen in dried blood
is readily available to the plant.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Has a strong smell that sometimes attracts rodents
and some people find unpleasant. Capable of burning plants.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Spray-dried blood meal is finer and faster
acting. More expensive than many other organic fertilizers.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">FISH EMULSION </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Sold in a concentrated liquid form, fish emulsion
is a thick brown liquid with a decidedly fishy smell. It is sold
in plastic bottles ranging in size from a few ounces to a gallon.</p>

<p>USE: A popular organic form of nitrogen, as it is easy to use
and widely distributed<b>.</b> The nitrogen in fish emulsion is
released slowly to the plant roots. Can be used as a foliar
fertilizer (applied to and absorbed by the leaves) when diluted
and sprayed on. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Neighborhood cats may be attracted to the garden when
fish emulsion is used. Be sure to follow the dilution rates on
the bottle, as there is no standard rate.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The nitrogen level of fish emulsion is often not
listed on the label as it variesfrom manufacturer to
manufacturer. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">FISH SCRAP </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:<b> </b>Fish tankage,<i> </i>dry ground fish,
fertilizer grade fish meal </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dried and ground parts of rendered and unrendered
fish, crab meal and fish manure. (Rendered fish contains the
parts that are left after the primary commercial food products
have been processed). Typically made from such fish as menhaden
and dogfish and the leftovers from fish canneries. Usually
contains the primary nutrients in percentages of 9-7-0. </p>

<p>Fish scrap, especially the manure, is sometimes treated with
sulfuric or phosphoric acid (to break it down) and called <i>acid
fish</i> or <i>acidulated fish tankage; </i>its percentages of
primary nutrients are 6-6-0.</p>

<p>USE: As an organic source of nitrogen and phosphate.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Acidulated or plain fish scrap can be used
interchangably.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: An excellent, easily procurred source of
nitrogen.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">GREENSAND </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Glauconite</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Sandy clay material, a naturally occuring
iron-potassium silicate, that is a mined, <i>pulverized rock
powder</i> product with 6 to 7% potash (K) and up to 30 trace
minerals, magnesium and silica from natural marine deposits. It
is found near the New Jersey coast. <i>Granite dust</i>, or <i>granite
meal</i>, is a similar item--another natural mineral source
(crushed granite) of potash (3 to 5-1/2%) which is more of a soil
conditioner than a fertilizer. Its potash comes from the feldspar
and mica in the granite.</p>

<p>USE: Adding potash to vegetable garden soil as well as lawns
and orchards. Retards soil compaction and holds moisture--10
times as much as sand. Some people consider it a soil conditioner
because of thesen qualities.</p>

<p>USE TIP Highly recommended for roses and greenhouse potting
mixtures.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">LANGBEINITE</a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Sul-Po-Mag, K-Mag</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Mineral mined in the southwestern United States,
composed of 22% sulfur, 22% potassium oxide, and 18% magnesium
oxide. </p>

<p>USE: Potassium source rich in secondary nutrients.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">ROCK PHOSPHATE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Phosphate rock, rock powder, pulverized rock
powder</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Pure mined phosphate rock, most likely from South
Carolina or Florida, with 20 to 30% phosphoric acid. When treated
with sulfuric acid, becomes <b>superphosphate (below). </b><i>Colloidal
phosphate</i>, or <i>soft rock phosphate, </i>is a similar
product from Tennessee rated at about18 to 20% phosphate and
which contains calcium and trace minerals. Mined
hydraulically--quicker acting than rock phosphate.</p>

<p>USE: An organic source of water-insoluble, very slow-release
phosphorous, rated at about 30%, but also a general soil
conditioner. Good source of many trace elements.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Because it is a natural, mineral source it does not
leach away as fast as superphosphate. However, it may have no
effect at all on soils with a pH over 6.2, and is most effective
on pea family plants and compost, rather than on lawns. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Must be exceedingly fine ground to be of use; <b>superphosphate
(below)</b> is much more effective, but not an organic product.
Has largely replaced <b>bat guano (above).</b></p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">SEAWEED EXTRACT </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Kelp, kelp meal, liquid seaweed, liquified
seaweed</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Brown liquid in concentrate form made from ocean
kelp, rated around 1-0-1.2 with up to 33% trace minerals.</p>

<p>USE: Good but expensive source of micronutrients and potash
for root development and overall stress resistance, especially
for seedlings, for which nitrogen is not so important. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The amount of nitrogen is often not on the label
as it varies. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">ORGANIC PLANT CARE PRODUCTS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC9">ABOUT ORGANIC PLANT CARE PRODUCTS: </a></h2>

<p>There are many products sold in garden centers alongside the
fertilizers. These products promise to take care of your plants
in more direct ways, like maintaining a good moisture level.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">ANTI-TRANSPIRANT</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Anti-desiccant</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: WILT-PRUF, Vapor-Gard, ForEverGreen</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Most are made of a natural pine oil emulsion or
natural, latex-like, biodegradable polymer in ready-to-spray
liquid, concentrate, or aerosol form, sold in a wide range of
sizes. Non-toxic. Some contain chemicals that make the stomata
(tiny openings) in the leaves close. Dries to a clear, glossy
film and does not affect the natural breathing and growing
processes of a plant.</p>

<p>USE: Sprayed on ornamental plants, especially evergreens such
as Christmas trees, to prevent excessive moisture loss after
transplanting, during shipment, over winter, and during storage
of dormant tubers, bulbs, and bare root stock. Small plants may
be dipped in it. Also effective against windburn and drought
conditions, or any other condition that dries out plants. Lasts
for months. Also used as a fungal preventative on annuals. </p>

<p>USE TIP: These products should only be used during periods
when there is excessive evaporation of moisture--otherwise you
can harm the plant by preventing some needed trasnspiraton.
Because some plants may be sensitive to an anti-transpirant, test
some first on a small part of the plant. Be sure to dilute it
correctly if necessary.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Read the label on the product to see that it will
do what you wish it to. A good anti-transpirant should also be
easy to remove from the foliage if need be.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">LEAF POLISH </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Moonshine</p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Leaf gloss, leaf shine, shine and cleaner, leaf
shiner and cleaner, leaf cleaner</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Liquid chemical mixture sold in small hand-pump
spray containers or regular bottles. Normally does not contain
any fertilizer, but may be mixed with other products. Usually
organic, but not necessarily, so check the label. Most are made
with mineral oil, but some are made of a surfactant which
basically breaks up the dirt and does not need to be wiped off
(and which does not clog pores).</p>

<p>USE: Shining and cleaning leaves of hard surface houseplants
and decorative arrangements. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: The myth behind the desirability of polished foliage
may very well be similar to the one about a fat baby being a
healthy baby--hard to prove either way. Even if these products
claim no harm to plants, some brands may leave residues on the
foliage that clog pores and prevent or slow down the natural
processes of the leaves, as did the buttermilk your Grandma may
have used to clean her plants.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A <i>clean</i> leaf may be healthier than a <i>polished</i>
leaf. Stick to tepid water to wash the foliage of house plants as
harmful dust does build up, or try to find those cleaners that
really lift off the dirt or wash it away. You can use a lambswool
ball made for this purpose, or put your plants in the shower
(really!).</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">SYNTHETIC FERTILIZERS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">ABOUT SYNTHETIC FERTILIZERS: </a></h2>

<p>Please note that some manufactured brands of fertilizer
contain organic matter as well, and in fact may be labeled in a
way that leaves you confused as to whether this is a natural or
manufactured product. For example, a fertilizer labeled
&quot;rich in organic matter&quot; or the like means that it
contains both natural and artificial ingredients. There is
nothing wrong with this; on the contrary, it means that the
mixture takes advantage of qualities of both kinds of
ingredients. However, products which contain anything artificial
or are chemically treated are included in this section rather
than the preceding one. Most fertilizers label organic sources as
such, but not chemical sources; anything in a fertilizer not
noted as natural can be assumed to be synthetic.</p>

<p>The notation of the breakdown of sources and percentages of
types of nitrogen is required on the labels synthetic fertilizers
but not on those of natural organic ones. If you like to have a
well-balanced mixture of nitrogen sources, look for more <i>Water
Insoluble Nitrogen</i> than <i>Fast Acting </i>sources (see Note
on Labels at beginning of this chapter). </p>

<p>Chemical fertilizers are man-made. Most are combinations of
chemicals that form a complete fertilizer as defined in <b>ABOUT
FERTILIZERS (above)</b>, and are mixed to fit many needs,
including some quite specialized ones. Convenience and price are
their trademarks. However, there are definitely some tradeoffs
for that convenience. They tend to be more expensive in the long
run because you need more over time, they may &quot;burn&quot;
plants if applied incorrectly, and they are quick to leach out of
the soil. They add nothing to the soil permanently and may
actually harm the soil's micorganisms and valued earthworms.
Ultimately, if you depend exclusively on artificial products, you
might need more and more as your garden soil &quot;wears
out.&quot; (Natural organic materials tend to renew and build up
the soil instead.) Their manufacture is also heavily dependent on
non-renewable energy sources. Many gardeners choose to use
chemical fertilizers sparingly, in coordination with naturally
derived (organic) fertilizers. More and more, in fact, are
becoming strictly organic gardeners. And now even the National
Academy of Sciences has begun to recommend the use of biological
interactions instead of agricultural chemicals. This said, there
are more chemical products than organic ones on the market. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">GENERAL USE AND SPECIALIZED SYNTHETIC
FERTILIZERS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC15">ABOUT SPECIALIZED SYNTHETIC FERTILIZERS: </a></h2>

<p>To make life easier, special fertilizers are available which
are made to be used for specific plants or types of plants.
Fertilizers can be purchased for foliage<i> </i>(typical house
plants), flowering and fruiting plants, acid-loving plants,
container plants, specific plants such as African Violets, roses,
geraniums, tomatoes, or cacti, lawns, vegetables, and so on, as
opposed to the general-use fertilizers. Also, certain
formulations which have just about nothing other than one of the
primary nutrients are available, such as potash (0-0-60) and urea
(46-0-0). These latter items are for solving specific plant
problems, such as building up an aspect of disease resistance.
They are sometimes called <i>simples</i>.</p>

<p>Using these products does raise the problem, however, that you
may be giving the plant more than it needs of certain nutrients,
particularly micronutrients. This can result in either damage to
the plants or wasted money, or both. Just like human foods such
as &quot;enriched flour&quot; or &quot;fortified milk&quot; may
provide minerals that you don't need, so might fertilizers with
added micronutrients (which are, oddly, many of the same minerals
we need to eat). When in doubt, you can tell by reading labels if
the special fertilizers have just what you need or whether you
are paying more for extra, unwanted nutrients. Others have unique
formulations, such as a chemcial that enhances oxygen uptake by
the roots and thus helps prevent overwatering. </p>

<p>Some minor trace elements or micronutrients such as water
soluble salts (borates and sulfated forms of copper),iron,
manganese, and zinc are helpful to plant growth in small
quantities, while others, such as boron and molybdenum, can be
harmful -- even toxic -- in excess. A garden plan and a complete
soil test should indicate how much and which trace elements
and/or micronutrients are already present in your soil and which
you need.</p>

<p>Many brands make complete lines of fertilizers, creating for a
lot of duplication on the shelf. Some are specialized in liquid
fertilizers and others in granular, for example, so the choice is
more one of whichever form you find convenient than of product
performance. The plant doesn't care about the form of nutrients
as much as you do. The choice is large and encourages
experimentation--it is very much a question of personal
preference or &quot;feel&quot; for a particular line of products
that governs a final choice.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC16">LAWN FERTILIZER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Sold in all possible forms: pellets, granules,
liquids, powdered concentrates to be mixed with water, or powders
to be applied dry. Whether synthetic or organic, they come in two
general types: <i>slow-acting </i>and <i>fast-acting</i>.</p>

<p>Many specialized products are made for starting new lawns.
These may have a higher percentage of nitrogen than phosphorus or
potash becausethe leaf of the grass is the primary part of the
lawn, and fertilizers high in nitrogen help promote this leaf
growth. &quot;Greenup&quot; fertilizers heature extremely high
nitrogen content. However, others, made for application in the
fall and early spring to start patches and promote root
development, contain more phosphorus.</p>

<p>Popular brands and types:</p>

<p>Starter Lawn Food (10-18-12): Particularly good for building
roots during fall and winter. Added iron prevents yellowing.</p>

<p>Lawn and Tree Food (10-6-4): Good both spring and fall, for
both new and established lawns, and for any other leaf crops.</p>

<p>Lawn and Garden Food (10-10-10): Good general use fertilizer.</p>

<p>USE: Keeping lawns healthy and green. This is not just for
aesthetics or impressing the neighbors: a healthy lawn is more
able to compete with weeds and more resistant to pests and
diseases. Lawn fertilizers may be broadcast by hand, applied with
a <b>hose attachment (Chapter 8)</b> or applied with a <b>hopper
spreader (Chapter 8).</b></p>

<p>USE TIPS: Follow label directions carefully. Too much
fertilizer or too high a concentration of liquid fertilizer will
burn and brown-off a lawn. Almost all lawn fertilizers need to be
watered in well; failure to do so evenly will result in dead
areas where the fertilizers were not watered in and thus did not
enter the soil. </p>

<p><i>Slow-acting</i> lawn fertilizers are best applied only once
or twice a year. Organic forms are less likely to burn the lawn. <i>Fast-acting</i>
lawn fertilizers produce greener lawns within hours of
application, but do not continue to fertilize a lawn over a long
period of time, making it necessary to reapply them every month
or so during the growing season. This is a case of a choice
between instant and delayed gratification, but if you go for the
instant kind, you have to have the time and the money to repeat
the application every month or more. </p>

<p>Lawns should be fertilized either in the spring or in the
fall. Most experts recommend early fall fertilizing of lawns to
ensure good growth and root development, especially in areas of
the country where winters are below freezing. As a general rule,
fall is the best time for many other lawn care practices too,
such as seeding and sodding. </p>

<p>Remember that rain is going to leach out the chemicals you put
on your lawn, and therefore the repeated application of certain
chemicals is likely to pollute your water supply. Caution and
moderation are the way to go here.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Which form of fertilizer to buy is pretty much a
question of your own preference. Some people prefer to use a dry
fertilizer which they then water in well. Others enjoy the
practice of liquid feeding. Avoid a fertlizer in which all of the
nitrogen is supplied by ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, or
urea--the synthetic, water-soluble forms of nitrogen which act so
fast that they break down very soon after application.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC17">WEED AND FEED MIXTURES (Lawn
Fertilizer/Herbicide Mix) </a></h2>

<p>Sample brand names: </p>

<p><i>Twinlight Lawn Food Plus Balan </i>, <i>Rockland Feed and
Seed)</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Usually sold as bagged fertilizers that contain
both fertilizer and herbicides, and in some cases, pesticides. </p>

<p>USE: Promoted as a convenient, labor-saving one-time
application, allowing the user to promote and protect lawn growth
at the same time.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: This is one instance where convenience comes at a
high cost and risk. The government has even issued a warning. The
U.S.D.A. says, in part, &quot;CAUTION: Combinations of [such]
materials may be ineffective or even harmful. Their misuse can
kill desirable plants or make the soil unproductive. Apply
combinations of fertilizer and insecticides or herbicides only on
the recommendation of your state agricultural experiment
station...&quot;</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Mixes of fertilizers with weed killers or
pesticides are almost always more expensive than the products
sold separately. Furthermore, performance usually doesn't measure
up to the products' claims because the proper time to use
pesticides is often not the same as the proper time to fertilize,
thereby wasting at least one part of the mix. That makes it even
more expensive. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC18">VEGETABLE FERTILIZERS </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Miracle-Gro All-Purpose</p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Garden fertilizers, garden food, tomato food,
vegetable food, etc.</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Concentrated powders, pellets, liquids and
granules, with an equal or higher percentage of phosphorus than
nitrogen or potash. Perhaps the most common type of fertilizer
purchased. Typically 5-10-5 or 10-10-10. Often fortified with
micronutrients including chelated iron, too. Sold in bags from 5
to 20 lbs. </p>

<p>USE: To promote the early development of fruiting vegetables,
and to help with the bloom set (when the blooms appear). Slightly
different formulation than those for blooming ornamental
(non-food) plants.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Too much fertilizer is worse than too little: Excess
nitrogen promotes leaf and stem development at the expense of
blooms or fruit, for example. Vegetables benefit from fertilizer
at the young seedling stage and again just before bloom set. When
fertilizing at these times, follow label directions carefully.
More nitrogen may be beneficial prior to bloom set, but more
phosphorous is needed afterward for bloom and fruit development.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: A general purpose 5-10-5 or 10-10-10 is a good
garden fertilizer and cheaper than special vegetable foods with
their added micronutrients. In fact, some micronutrients, like
chelated iron, lower the pH of the soil, and that may be
unncessary in your case. Don't buy it if you don't need it.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">HOUSE PLANT FOOD</a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Liquid Miracle-Gro All-Purpose, Stern's
Therapy for House Plants, Schultz Instant Liquid Plant Food,
Granny's Bloomers, Granny's Jungle Juice, Jobe's Houseplant
spikes, Peter's, Ra.Pid.Gro</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Concentrated liquid applied directly to soil,
powdered concentrate mixed with water, or spike, specially
formulated for houseplants with chelated iron and other
micronutrients usually lacking in indoor growing media. Normally
should not lead to buildup of salts. Liquid sold in small bottles
ranging from 2 ounces upward. Grades tend to be 8-7-6, 10-8-7,
10-5-10, and the like. </p>

<p>USE: Fertilizing houseplants, especially counteracting the
effect of being in an unnnatural place. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Usually formulated to be quickly available to the
plant. Often very concentrated so that it can be sold in small
containers, it must be dilluted according to instructions or else
it might harm the plant.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: There is lots of competition for this market, so
experiment until you find a product that gives you the best
results. Each plant may react differently to the various
formulations available. Furthermore, this is an intimate process,
and your selection may have as much to do with the way you like
to care for your plants as does the actual effect of the
fertilizer. Ultimately, house plant food is not that different
from garden food except in the high degree of concentration and
the packaging or form.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">BULB FOOD </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A complete fertilizer that contains more
phosphorous than nitrogen or potassium, typically in a 4-12-5 or
similar grade. Often blended natural organic (bone meal, above)
and synthetic materials. Sold in small bags for the home
gardener.</p>

<p>USE: Encourages healthy root development so essential to
bulbs.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">ROSE FOOD </a></h2>

<p>SAMPLE BRAND NAMES: RA-PID-GRO, PETERS, MIRACLE-GRO for Roses,
BANDINI ROSE FOOD, OSMOCOTE Plant Food, VERDI-SOL, SEQUESTRENE
330 Fe, Rose-Tone</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Premixed liquids, liquid concentrates, powder
concentrates to be mixed with water, pellets, and all of the
other forms that fertilizers can come in. Sold as complete
fertilizers, rose foods usually have equal or higher percentages
of phosphorus, such as 20-20-20, 6-12-6, 6-6-4, or18-24-16,
although there are some exceptions, such as RA-PID-GRO at
23-19-17 and OSMOCOTE at 18-6-12. </p>

<p>USE: Promoting foliage growth, especially bloom set of roses.
Specialized formulations encourage brilliant color.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Read labels carefully, because many are concentrates
that if not diluted properly could easily damage the plants.
Others may contain unneeded micronutrients which could change the
pH of your soil in a damaging way. If you know your soil
conditions, you will be wise to avoid fertilizers that contain
additives you may not need.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: These products are usually reliable, but at a
price. Roses grow best in a soil with a pH around 6.5. To help
you maintain this pH level most rose fertilizers list the
potential acidity equivalent on the label. Liquid rose
fertilizers (concentrates and premixed) are readily available to
the plant roots and leaves, while pellet and granular fertilizers
are not as readily available to the plant but may have the
advantage of working over a longer period of time, eliminating
the need to fertilize more frequently. Make your choice based on
the time you have to spend fertilizing. Sometimes the convenience
of application (as with preformulated fertilizers) is worth the
extra cost.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ACID-LOVING PLANTS FERTILIZERS </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Holly-tone, Miracid</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular or liquid fertilizer, often with
chelated iron and other micronutrients and soil acidifiers. Other
ingredients that may be found include aluminum sulfate (bauxite
that usually has been treated with sulfuric acid), ammonium
sulfate, or sulfate of ammonia, which has 20-1/2% available
nitrogen, and iron sulfate, which helps correct iron
deficiencies. A grade of 4-6-4 is common, as is 5-10-10, 7-7-7,
and 4-12-12, depending on the plant it is intended for, but
30-10-10 is also available. <b>Aluminum sulfate (Soil
Conditioners, Chapter 1)</b> is packaged pure as well, as a soil
acidifier. Sold in bags from 5 to 20 lbs. </p>

<p>USE: Fertilizing hollies, azaleas, rhododendrons, evergreens,
tomatoes, and the like, all plants which crave acid soils, by
promoting growth and good color. Aluminum sulfate imparts a blue
color to hydrangeas.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Spring and fall feedings, depending on the
particular brand. Follow directions on the bag for each type of
plant.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Sulfate of ammonia is slow-acting but long
lasting.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">FLOWERING OR FRUITING PLANT FERTILIZERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Complete fertilizer heavily weighted to supply
nitrogen and potash or equal amounts of all three macronutrients;
however, large fruit trees generally do not need much phosphorus,
calcium, or micronutrients. </p>

<p>USE: Encouraging normal growth and fruiting. Slightly
different from fertilizer for vegetable crops.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Sprays are not useful on fruit trees except when a
superficial fix is desired; ground application in the fall or
early spring is the best. One good application to large trees
such as apple trees can last for years, especially when
accompanied by hay or straw mulching and heavy pruning. In fact,
these practices can eliminate the need for fertilizer.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">AMMONIUM NITRATE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular form of rapidly available nitrogen
usually in a 33-0-0 concentration.</p>

<p>USE: Fast-acting source of nitrogen for quick greening of turf
grasses such as fescue, bluegrass, and Bermuda grass, especially
during cool seasons.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Extremely concentrated; may burn. Most people are
better off with traditional sources of nitrogen.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Considered a professional product--not necessarily
available in small packages.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular source of fast-acting nitrogen and
phosphorous, usually rated at 16-20-0.</p>

<p>USE: For fast growth of lawns.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Reapply every 60 days--this goes fast. Not
recommended for dichondra.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">MAGNESIUM SULFATE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Epsom salts</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: White powder containing 9.6% magnesium and 14.5%
sulfur.</p>

<p>USE: Source of magnesium when need is indicated by a soil
test. Most concentrations are spread at 1/2lb per 100 square
feet.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Usually applied as a foliar spray to fruit trees with
foliage; mix with a <b>spreader-sticker (Chapter 4)</b>. <b>Dolomitic
limestone (Chapter 1), </b>a good source of magnesium, is more
often applied to the soil when you have time--this is a quicker
treatment.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">MURIATE OF POTASH </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular fertilizer that consists entirely of 60%
soluble potash (0-0-60 or 0-0-55). Made from potassium chloride,
a potash salt, which actually ranges from 48 to 62% soluble
potash. Another, similar source is <i>sulfate of potash</i>, or <i>potassium
sulfate</i>, which has no less than 48% soluble potash.</p>

<p>USE: Potassium supplement for accelerating root and tuber
growth; typical component of fast-acting, acidic, synthetic
complete fertilizers.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Add only when your soil test tells you that your soil
is quite deficient in potash. Also good for melting ice and snow
on driveways and sidewalks.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: <i>Fritted potassium</i> is the organic alernative
to muriate of potash in complete fertilizers.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">Nitrate of Soda </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Sodium Nitrate, Chile Saltpeter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: White, granular substance sold in bags. A salt
traditionally mined from natural deposits in Chile or more
recently produced synthetically by reacting nitric acid with
sodium carbonate. Pure nitrate of soda (NaNO3) contains 16%
nitrogen (16-0-0), but also 27% sodium (Na). One brand from
Chile--Bulldog--is considered natural organic.</p>

<p>USE: Concentrated, highly water soluble source of quickly
available nitrogen. Encourages rapid leaf and stem growth. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Use carefully, or you may burn your plants.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Old source of nitrogen that was more common before
the development of modern synthetic ammonia fertilizer plants.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">ROOTING HORMONE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Rooting powder</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Rootone, Hormo-Root, Dip' N Grow</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Powder containing growth regulators and
fungicides. </p>

<p>USE: Rooting cuttings (getting new roots to grow) faster and
without rotting or succumbing to disease.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Dip just the first inch or so of a cutting into the
powder and shake off the excess.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Because you only dip the end of a stem into the
container, even small amounts last a long time.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">SOIL INOCULANT </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTON: Powder containing live bacteria of the <i>Rhizobia</i>
family.</p>

<p>USE: Mixed with legume (bean family) seed prior to planting in
order to encourage the formation of nodules which in turn take in
extra nitrogen, even from the air. This process is known as <i>nitrogen
fixation.</i></p>

<p>USE TIPS: A little bit of vegetable oil mixed in with the seed
helps the inoculant adhere better. Make sure you are matching the
correct bacteria to your particular type of plant. Do not use on
seed that has been treated with fungicide: the bacteria you just
bought will be killed along with the bacteria that the fungicide
was intended for. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Especially helpful in soil never planted with
legumes before; not usally all that helpful in soils that have
already been treated.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">SULFATE OF AMMONIA </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Ammonium sulfate</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular, acidic fertilizer made from ammonia
treated with sulfuric acid, with 20.5% available nitrogen
(20-0-0). Generally sold in small, 5 lb bags. Sometimes
considered a soil conditioner, as an acidifier. </p>

<p>USE: Fertilizing acid-loving plants; often blended into
complete fertilizers as noted above in <b>Acid-Loving Plant
Fertilizers</b>. Longer lasting but not as quickly available as <b>Nitrate
of Soda (above)</b>, but still considered fast-acting<b>. </b>Acidifies
the soil (lowers the pH) and feeds sulfur to the plants,
immediately.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">SUPERPHOSPHATE</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Bagged white or gray granular fertilizer. During
the nineteenth century, superphosphate was made from bone black,
a product derived from charred bones<u>,</u>but since then has
almost exclusively come from phosphate rock. Superphosphate today
is created when rock phosphate, a subtropical mineral deposit
found in South Carolina in 1867 (mined in huge open pits there
and in Florida and Tennessee), is treated with either sulfuric
acid or phosphoric acid or a combination of the two, making this
a synthetic product. A very common kind of phosphorus fertilizer.
(Pure mined <b>rock phosphate</b> is an organic fertilizer noted <b>above</b>).
</p>

<p>TYPES: </p>

<p><i>Normal </i>superphosphate contains up to 22% phophorous.
Made from natural phosphatic material which has been exposed to
sulfuric acid. Formerly known as <i>regular</i>, <i>single</i>, <i>standard</i>,
<i>simple</i>, or <i>20% superphosphate. </i>Typical grade is
0-20-0.</p>

<p><i>Enriched </i>superphosphate contains from 22% to 40%
phosphorus and is also derived from natural phosphatic material
treated with sulfuric and phosphoric acids. </p>

<p><i>Concentrated , </i>Also Known As <i>double, treble, triple,
</i>or<i> multiple superphosphate </i>, is any grade that
contains 40% or more available phosphorus, which is the highest
percentage of available phosphorus sold. Commonly graded 0-46-0.</p>

<p>USE: Rapidly available source of phosphorus.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Superphosphate maybe a better buy than <b>bone
meal (above), </b>particularly when planting bulbs and seeding in
lawns.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC15">UREA</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Inexpensive source of synthetic organic nitrogen,
derived from natural gas products. Granular, with at least 35%
but commonly with 46% available nitrogen (46-0-0). Acid-forming,
non-staining and non-corrosive. Sold in bags of all sizes,
including 5 lbs. Another, similar product is <i>nitroform</i>, at
38% nitrogen. </p>

<p>USE: Foliar feeding and side-dressing of all plants. Also
melts snow and ice. Slow releasing, with some fast release.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC16">CHELATED MICRONUTRIENTS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Powdered, granular, or liquid form of water
soluble compounds of the metallic nutrients made with organic
chelating agents which make these micronutrients available to the
plants when they normally wouldn't be. Very similar to vitamin
pills for humans--in fact, some are sold mixed with vitamin B-1.
Micronutrients include iron, manganese, zinc, boron, copper,
chlorine, and molybdenum. (Macronutrients are available in a
variety of forms listed in this chapter, but are also available
in &quot;pure&quot; concentrations). </p>

<p>USE: Treating certain soil deficiencies of micronutrients.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Use only as directed, and only when you are quite
sure that you need them. Normally balanced and well-fertilized
soils should not be lacking in micronutrients, and a major
deficiency should be thorougly analysed. Iron is the most
commonly deficient micronutrient, causing yellowing (chlorosis).</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Professionals have more use for these items than
amateurs. If you must absolutely buy them and have trouble
finding them in a garden center, try to find a professional
source though a landscaper or botanic garden.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC17">SYNTHETIC PLANT CARE PRODUCTS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC18">ABOUT SYNTHETIC PLANT CARE PRODUCTS: </a></h2>

<p>There are many chemical products sold in garden centers other
than pesticides and fertilizers. These products promise to cover
tree wounds and help remove stumps, and other important tasks.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC19">TREE PAINT </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Tar, tree wound dressing, pruning seal, sealer,
tree wound spray, tree paint</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Black petroleum asphalt base liquid sold in
either aerosol form or as a liquid to be brushed on. Some brands
contain an antiseptic fungicide, such as copper napthenate, to
help prevent disease.</p>

<p>USE: Seals the stump of a limb or branch that has been pruned
against weathering, drying out, decay, pests, and infection. A
specialized version of tree paint is made for use as a <i>grafting
compound. </i>Also used after pruning rose bushes and other
shrubs and vines, and for propagating orchids.</p>

<p>USE TIP: We now know that it is unecessary to paint over the
stump of a normally, cleanly pruned limb, as the tree isolates
the area and seals it itself, providing a scar tissue that does
not allow decaying to advance into the tree. The U.S.D.A. Forest
Service finds that wound dressing does not prevent rot. However,
tree paint may be of value to help seal damaged bark or trees
which are wounded mechanically, preventing insects or diseases
from entering the tree through the wound. It also fills an
aesthetic function where large, prominent scars have been left.
Smaller cuts, such as made for grafting, should be covered with <i>grafting
wax</i> instead. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Can also be used to waterproof wooden tubs and
planters.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC20">STUMP REMOVER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Potassium salt of nitric acid (potassium nitrate)
usually in powder form.</p>

<p>USE: When poured onto tree stumps accelerates the natural
rotting process, making the stump and roots porous throughout.
Holes can be easily drilled into the rotted stump, filled with
kerosene, and set afire.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Generally not dangerous to other plants. Check label
to be sure.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">PEST AND DISEASE CONTROL PRODUCTS </a></h2>

<p>Synthetic chemical pesticides, which are so familar to us and
so prominently featured in garden centers, are only one set of
tools you can use to manage pest problems. Other tools include
regular weeding, crop rotation, mechanical control (traps,
barriers, and hand picking), biological controls (introducing
predator insects or diseases that infect only the pests), natural
organic products, and cultural controls such as companion
planting methods, planting resistant varieties of plants, proper
fertilization, and regular watering. In fact, there are so many
alternatives that there is a name for them, <b>Integrated Pest
Management, </b>abbreviated<b> IPM (below)</b>. Gardeners who
practice IPM have come to think of pesticides as one alternative
among many other gardening practices. </p>

<p>Pesticides cannot replace good gardening habits and techniques
mentioned above, despite the constant lull of advertising to the
contrary. Strong chemcials treat symptoms; good gardening
corrects the sources of of the problem. It's just not as simple
as the ads would have it. Synthetic products can help, but they
are no cure-all, by a long shot. In fact, while 224 insect
species were listed as resistant to pesticides in 1970, by 1984,
448 were. That's <u>double</u>. And now even the Dept. of
Agriculture is now reporting that we rely too much on
agricultural chemicals. They are good for solving specific, acute
problems, but many other products are listed here which are not
synthetic chemicals but are every bit as effective, if not
better. </p>

<p>Pesticides come in a wide array of types and forms, all of
which is explained in the pages that follow. Terms can be
confusing, so if you are unfamiliar with the labels of
pesticides, read the following pages first.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT DEFINING PESTICIDES: </a></h2>

<p>Garden Centers sell a variety of chemical products to rid the
garden of insects, fungi, disease, animals, or weeds that
threaten plants. These include chemical products that are either
naturally derived (&quot;organic&quot;) or synthetically
produced. These &quot;garden chemicals&quot; are collectively
referred to as pesticides, but they do more than control pests. </p>

<p>Several specific pesticides are designed for particular types
of pests, while others deal with problems that are not pests per
se. The former group includes chemicals to control insects <i>(insecticides)</i>,
chemicals to control spider-like mites <i>(miticides or
acaracides)</i>, chemicals to control mice, rats and rodents<i>
(rodenticides), </i>and even specific chemicals to control
microscopic worms called nematodes that attack the roots of
plants <i>(nematicides)</i> .<b><i> </i></b>All of these
specialized garden chemicals are sold under the collective term <i>pesticides</i>.
</p>

<p>In addition to this group of pesticides, a second group sold
as pesticides includes garden chemicals or similar products
specifically designed to deal with fungal problems (<i>fungicides)</i><b><i>,
</i></b>and other chemicals that help control weeds and unwanted
vegetation, (<i>herbicides)</i><b><i>.</i></b> So this is how the
term <i>pesticides</i> refers to both a family of chemicals as
well as specific ones that do specific jobs. </p>

<p>Many chemical products exist that are not commonly available
to consumers, and are therefore not listed here. In some cases
these products are not available because they are too dangerous
to use by non-certified pest control operators or professionals;
in other cases they are hard to find simply because they are
generally marketed only to professionals for commercial reasons.
Such items would include chemicals for anti-bacterial use (<i>bactericides),
</i>and also most items for controling slugs and snails (<i>molluscicides).
</i>Diseases and viruses are usually controlled through garden
management or IPM techniques. </p>

<p>Finally, this is one area where there are so many products
available that are new, or new formulations, or slightly
different mixtures of these ingredients, that it would make this
book unweildy to include them all. What are listed are the basic
building blocks of pest control. Undoubtedly, some useful items
may have been omitted. If you don't see what you want, check with
your local <b>Cooperative Extension Agent (see Appendix B)</b>,
your garden center manager, or call one of the major
manufacturers, whose number or address is easily found on similar
products. Your local garden center manager will surely be able to
assist you if only to contact the local representative.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">ABOUT USING PESTICIDES </a></h2>

<p>Over the last few decades, there has been an enormous increase
in the amount of chemicals, both pesticides and fertilizers, that
Americans put on their gardens and lawns. There is no doubt that
this has been costly to the environment, and that misuse can
cause harmful injury and death. Now there are civil and criminal
penalties for misuse of synthetic pesticides, too. Using
chemicals safely means taking time to read and understand the
labels and following the instructions for mixing, application,
and disposal absolutely rigorously. Much information exists on
alternatives to this chemical dependency, and the alternative
products can be found right in the same garden center where you
buy the chemicals. Garden chemicals are like prescription drugs:
they are very helpful in curing specific, unusual problems, but
may cause their own problems if relied upon on a regular, general
basis.</p>

<p>Remember, there is no such thing as a &quot;safe&quot;
pesticide, because by definition a pesticide is toxic to <i>something</i>.
</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) </a></h2>

<p>Rapidly emerging as the most sensible approach to pest
control, <i>Integrated Pest Management</i> , or <i>IPM</i>,
incorporates the use of chemicals or toxic pesticides into a
system designed to utilize natural and physical controls along
with the chemical controls. IPM is neither pro-organic nor
pro-chemical, though some may call it Ecological Pest Management:
it is instead an approach that seeks the best method of
controlling garden pests <u>using all available resources</u>,
though it does generally mean choosing chemicals only after all
other methods have been tried. Furthermore, emphasis is placed on
finding the <u>least toxic</u> method at every stage.</p>

<p>Using chemicals alone as a method of controlling pests is a
relatively recent approach to this perennial gardening and
farming problem, driven to a certain extent by the development of
our consumer- and advertising-oriented society. However, since
the advent of popularly available chemical products 40 or 50
years ago, we are more knowledgeable about the effects of
chemicals on our environment, on natural pest predators, and on
public and personal safety. In fact, safe, intelligent use of
pesticides and other chemicals need not pose a threat to the
environment, animals or people. </p>

<p>What we are learning about the effects of some toxic chemicals
has caused many people to take a new look at how we use them, how
we combine them with natural methods of pest control, and to seek
methods of pest management that take into consideration the
overall effect on the environment and people. The result is IPM.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">ABOUT Components of Integrated Pest
Management (IPM): </a></h2>

<p>Following are some of the basic building blocks of the IPM
system.</p>

<p><b>-Planting resistant plants: </b>It is possible to select
food crops such as tomatoes that are resistant to viral problems
as well as new types of trees and shrubs that are superior to
older varieties. For example, tomato plants labeled <i>VF</i> or <i>VFN
</i>are resistant to the common diseases, Vusanian and
Ferticillium wilts. Sometimes all that is needed is some variety.
</p>

<p><b>- Good gardening practices:</b> A healthy plant is less
affected by diseases and pests. Good gardening practices such as
regular soil tests, maintaining appropriate pH levels for each
plant, use of the right fertilizers, planting with sufficient sun
and moisture, weeding, choosing the right plant for the right
place, and paying attention to general habitat conditions like
humidity and air circulation produce plants that are more likely
to survive an occasional pest problem. </p>

<p>- <b>Physical controls and traps: </b>Physical measures can be
taken that include things like hand-picking (or even vacuuming!)
pests, installing barriers (ranging in form from plastic collars
made from coffee cups to elaborate fences and row covers), or
such simple practices as flushing pests off of foliage with
water, mulching well, and installing traps.</p>

<p><b>- Biological controls and beneficial insects: </b>Insects
such as the lady bug and the praying mantis are natural predators
of harmful insects, and can be introduced (you can purchase them
from mail order catalogs) or conserved. Unfortunately, these are
usually more sensitive than the pests to broad-spectrum
insecticides in common use.</p>

<p><b>- Oils and Soaps: </b>Oils are extremely low in toxic
chemicals and act by smothering the pest without the use of
poisons, while soaps both smother and destroy insects and weeds.</p>

<p><b>-Research and development: </b>This ranges from
scientists taking products designed to deal with one problem and
trying them for others. A recent example is anti-transpirants,
which were originally developed to prevent the loss of moisture
from evergreen leaves during winter, and which are now used to
help prevent fungal problems. Genetic engineering can be included
here, as well.</p>

<p><b>-Choosing Toxic Chemicals Carefully:</b> Selective use of
synthetic insecticides, fungicides and herbicides can be made in
Integrated Pest Management programs, but only if these chemicals
work together with the other components in the system, such as
beneficial insects. For example, you would want to avoid a
pesticide that kills lady bugs and praying mantis which are being
used to control aphids and other pests. The least toxic chemical
is sought out first and its re-use considered carefully; no
chemcial is used routinely.</p>

<p>- <b>Analysis of the Problems and the Solutions: </b>Much time
is given to positive identification of the pests, monitoring of
the pest population, level of plant injury, and evaluation of the
effect your strategy is having.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">ABOUT The most common PROBLEMS WITH
houseplants and gardens: </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">COMMON INSECT PESTS --- </a></h2>

<p>There are over 2,000 insects which are considered pests. Add
to that the fact that many pests exist in different forms at
different stages of development. Immature beetles, for example,
are known as <i>larva</i>, and leafhoppers at a stage just prior
to adulthood for other pests are called <i>nymphs</i>. Many books
are available which identify these pests; they should be
consulted thoroughly in order to figure out what plagues you.
Proper identification of the pest is the most important first
step.</p>

<p><b>- Aphids</b> are small sucking insects that are teardrop in
shape, winged or wingless (depending on their life stage) and may
be a range of colors including light green, gray to dark brown or
black. Aphids are often found on the tender growing tips of
plants and flower buds. They are of particular concern as they
often carry plant viruses.</p>

<p><b>- Spider Mites</b> are small, almost microscopic, sucking
insects that are black, orange/green or red in color. The red
spider mite is one of the more common ones. They live on the
underside of plants, thriving when the weather is hot and dry.
Often the mite is not visible to a casual observer, but in large
numbers their fine webs are evidence of their presence.</p>

<p><b>- Scale </b>are also small sucking insects which may be
hard or soft, oval or round in shape and slow moving in juvenile
stages (they are immobile in thier adult stage). Types include
Cottony Taxus, Oleander, Brown Soft, Oyster, and White Peach
Scale. Many resemble a small brown turtle shell attached to the
stems and veins of plant leaves. The presence of scale is often
indicated by a sticky syrupy substance on the plant. This is
actually the honeydew which the scale excretes. </p>

<p>-<b>Mealybugs </b>are common sucking insects which are oval
and soft-bodied. Their presence is indicated by cottony masses in
the axis of leaves, stems, and branches. These masses are
actually the nests or eggs masses of the reproducing pest.</p>

<p><b>- Nematodes</b> are soil-born microscipic sucking worms
that produce hard swellings on plants. Symptoms include slow
growth of plants and yellowing leaves. If nematodes are present
in container-grown plants or house plants, it is best to discard
the soil and the plant and replant it in sterile soil.</p>

<p><b>- White Flies </b>resemble small moths, and can be found on
the underside of the infested plants. When the leaves or plant
are shaken the white flies fly around the plant in numbers. White
flies are also sucking insects and are often a perennial problem
on many vegetable crops such as tomatos as well as begonias,
citrus, fuchias, and geraniums. </p>

<p><b>- Grubs </b>are little wormlike creatures which may
actually be any of a number of insects, especially Japanese
beetles, which spend part of their life cycle
(&quot;pupate&quot;) as wormlike grubs during their larval stage
in the soil. They can do extensive damage to roots and turf.
Fortunately, this is usually a vulnerable stage for them during
which controls are quite effective.</p>

<p>- <b>Beetles</b> are hard-shelled insects that damage leaves,
stems, and roots.</p>

<p>- <b>Caterpillars</b> are moths and butterflies in a worm-like
stage. They often do major damage to plants, especially the
leaves, during their short life stage. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">FUNGI --- </a></h2>

<p>Fungi are non-green plants without chlorophyll. Because they
cannot make their own food, they often live as parasites on
plants and animals. The most common garden fungi are <i>rusts,
mildews, molds, smuts</i> and a variety of <i>blights</i>
(athlete's foot and yeast infections are common fungal infections
which plague humans). </p>

<p>Fungi are sporborn with the spores germinating in the presence
of water and in the absence of light. A good garden practice to
reduce the spread of fungal problems is avoiding watering in the
evening or at night. There is no absolute cure for fungal
problems on plants, and at best fungicides only prevent the
spread of the fungus, though recent experiments with
anti-transpirants (Chapter 3)--substances that coat the leaves
and prevent spores from attaching or growing--promise hope. </p>

<p>Typical fungi found on flowers and ornamental shrubs (not
treated on vegetables) include:</p>

<p>-<b><i>Powdery mildew</i></b> , a fungal problem endemic to
many lilacs and garden phlox. It appears as a white film on the
leaves late in the season or after particularly wet spells. Since
it cannot be prevented and will not kill a healthy plant, it is
often wise to learn to live with the problem. </p>

<p>-<b><i>Black spot</i></b>, a very common fungal problem,
particularly on roses. It appears on leaves as yellow spots with
brown or black centers. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT TYPES OF GARDEN CHEMICALS: </a></h2>

<p>Pesticides are sold in many different forms which determine
the way in which the chemical is applied and how it works.</p>

<p><b><i>-SYSTEMICS</i></b><b> </b>are pesticides which are taken
into the system of a plant and are ingested by insects which suck
or eat the plant, so they work from within the plant. Available
in dry, liquid, powder, granular, and concentrated forms, they
are absorbed by plants and cannot be leached away by rain or
watering. The conscientious gardener should be aware that some
systemics can remain in the water table for long periods of time
before breaking down, becoming a serious threat to the
environment. </p>

<p>-<b><i>NON-SYSTEMIC</i></b><b> </b>pesticides are not absorbed
by the plants but instead are ingested by the pest, or else work
on direct contact with the insect.</p>

<p><b><i>-CONTACT</i></b><b> </b>pesticides are those that kill
the insect on contact with the exterior of the plant or insect.</p>

<p><b><i>-SELECTIVE</i></b><b> </b>chemicals are specifically
designed to kill or attack certain insects or weeds without
harming other creatures or plants. </p>

<p><b><i>-NON-SELECTIVE</i></b><b> </b>chemicals are not
particular in what they destroy--they kill whatever they touch,
and thus can destroy desirable plants (in the case of herbicides)
or beneficial insects (in the case of insecticides) when applied
incorrectly. Recent gardening wisdom encourages the specific
identification of the problem and the use of a more selective
method of control. The point is to avoid the indiscriminate use
of non-selective chemicals.</p>

<p><b><i>-BAITS</i></b> contain some type of pesticide and
usually also contain a pest attractant, while others are used as
lures with traps.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">ABOUT FORMS OF GARDEN CHEMICALS: </a></h2>

<p><b><i>- SPRAYS</i></b><b> </b>Some chemicals are sold to be
used as a non-aerosol spray, either prepackaged in a
&quot;pump&quot; or &quot;spray&quot; container or sold to be
used in a <b>garden sprayer (Chapter 8).</b> These chemicals
include: </p>

<p><b>-</b><i>Emulsifiable Concentrates</i> , solutions sold as
liquids that must be diluted with water (follow label directions
carefully). They are produced when the <i>toxicant</i> (the toxic
substance) and an <i>emulsifier</i> (a substance which keeps the
chemicals together) are dissolved in an organic solvent. The
amount of the toxicant and the emulsifier in relation to the rest
of the mixture is noted on the label as a percentage. The
strength of the product is described in terms of pounds of
toxicant per gallon of concentrate.</p>

<p><b>-</b><i>Wettable Powders </i>, very fine powders that are
applied after being mixed with water. They remain suspended in
the water, not dissolved, so you have to keep shaking the
solution as you use it. Wettable powders are made up of an active
ingredient (the actual pesticide), a wetting agent (the substance
that causes a solid to become more easily wettable), and some
inert ingredient. The amount of the pesticide and wetting agent
relative to the inert material is shown on the label as a
percenage. A higher percentage (note the figure on the label,
such as 50W or 50WP) means less shaking is necessary. They are
applied with a sprayer just as emulsifiable concentrates are.<b> </b>Be
sure to keep nozzles and filters clean, as they tend to clog up
quickly with this kind of material. Wettable powders are often
compatible with insecticides, fungcides, and nutritional
sprays--check the label. Abbreviated <i>WP</i> on labels.</p>

<p>-<i>Flowable Wettable Powders</i> (ALSO KNOWN AS: flowable
formulations, flowable liquid, or water-dispersible suspension),
creamy fluids whose active ingredients are suspended in a
flowable liquid or paste. They need to be diluted with water to
be used as a spray. Flowable wettable powders are fairly recent
forms of pesticides, similar to wettable powders in their
properties, but they form a more stable suspension when mixed
with water. They still eventually settle out in a sprayer, but
more slowly than wettable powders.</p>

<p>-<i>Horticultural oils</i> , also known as Sprayable or
Miscible oils, are oils that contain an emulsifier <b>(see
emulsifiable concentrates above)</b> and can therefore be mixed
with water before application. These are often sold with an
insecticide added, though not always. They are applied to the
plant and work by smothering the insects, such as aphids, mites
and scale. These oils have been particularly helpful in control
of scale on ornamental trees and shrubs. </p>

<p><b><i>-SPRAY CANS AND AEROSOLS</i></b> are ready-mixed
formulas that are sold in spray cans. There are two types
distinguished by the insects they are intended to control.</p>

<p><i>-Space sprays</i> produce a fine mist or fog and help
control flying</p>

<p>insects.</p>

<p><i>-Surface sprays</i> produce a spray in droplets larger than
the former</p>

<p>and fall from the air quickly. These are used to control
crawling insects.</p>

<p><b><i>-DUSTS</i></b><b> </b>are powders that are usually made
up of particles larger that those of wettable powders. They are
applied with shakers and dusters and are not wet when applied.
They stick to the surface of the leaves and stems.</p>

<p><b><i>-GRANULES</i></b><b> </b>are like dusts but are made up
of even larger particles. They are applied dry. Watering and rain
make them available in a slower form than other chemicals.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT ORGANIC PESTICIDES: </a></h2>

<p>Pesticides derived from organic materials, while often toxic,
are particularly useful in IPM programs. Most of them break down
with little residual toxicity, meaning that the toxic chemical
does not linger in the soil, water or atmosphere. Some are based
on soap, which may be the oldest pesticide around. Soaps are
salts made from fatty acids, and many of the &quot;natural&quot;
pesiticides are made the same way. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">ORGANIC INSECTICIDES </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC6">DIATOMACEOUS EARTH </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Diatom Flour</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A white powder composed of finely ground,
sharp-edged fossilized shells of diatoms, small-shelled,
water-dwelling creatures of the algae family. Can be used as a
spray when mixed with water, or used as a dust. </p>

<p>USE: The microscopic, prism-shaped particles' razor-sharp
edges easily penetrate many insects on contact, causing them to
dry up (desiccate), or as a slug control sprinkling a band of it
around plants which the slugs attack. Also used in swimming pool
filters and as the abrasive material in scouring cleansers as
well.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Use a mask when applying and avoid breathing the
dust.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: This is not an expensive product when you consider
what it can do relatively safely. Sold in 10-pound bags for
around $5.00.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">INSECTICIDAL SOAPS </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Safer's Insecticidal Soap, Cryptocidal
Soap</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Products that contain (or are) salts of fatty
acids mixed with water and alcohol. They are a direct alternative
to synthetic, chemical pesticides. Most are sold in liquid
concentrates to be mixed and sprayed on the plant, though some
are sold in pre-mixed solutions in sprayer bottles. Different
formulations of various fatty acids are available for different
plants and their pests, such as one for roses, flowers, and
houseplants, and another for fruits and vegetables. Gentle to
beneficial insects and animals (the birds and the bees);
compatible with many biological controls (beneficial predators
and the like) and a good number of chemical and organic
pesticides; it is incompatible with certain ones which are listed
by the manufacturer.</p>

<p>USE: Killing aphids, spider mites, mealybugs, rose slugs,
psyllids, earwigs, scale, and whitefly on both garden and house
plants, depending on the formulation, which is clearly indicated
on the label. This kind of product must be applied at the right
time in each particular pest's life cycle or it will not do any
good.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Insecticidal soaps are a contact spray; they kill the
insect when they come in contact with it. However, they only kill
insects in a certain stage in the life cycle (such as during some
juvenile stages before the insects have formed a hard shell).
Because of this, it is often necessary to repeat the application
at intervals of 7 to 10 days. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Insecticidal soaps are easy to use, especially
those which are pre-mixed and come in easy-to-use pump sprayer
bottles. Ivory soap, when mixed with water, often works as well,
but you should experiment.</p>

alkaline water or soap solution. Also sold as a smoke for
fumigation when combined with a combustible material, and as a
wettable powder.</p>

<p>USE: Contact spray, sometimes a fumigant, for a wide range of
insects. None are immune! Fumigant efficiency is increased by a
higher temperature. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Leaves little residue, but by the same token has a
short shelf life. Can be washed off plants. May harm flower
petals. Increase effictiveness by adding a few teaspoonfuls of
dormant oil spray per gallon.</p>

Ecuador (and now, as a test, in New Jersey). Sold in pressurized
cans or as an oil concentrate for sprays, though can be found in
dust form too. Sometimes mixed with liquid <b>Rotenone (below)</b>.
In use since the mid-19th century.</p>

<p>USE: In spray form for controlling flies, mosquitoes,
springtails, and whiteflies. Follow label directions carefully so
as not to harm plants. Often sold as a household spray for use on
insects directly, but not intended for use on indoor plants as it
is slightly toxic to most pets.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Pyrethrum has a low toxicity to people and animals
and leaves no harmful residues on food crops or vegetables
(&quot;low residual toxicity&quot;), but skin contact or contact
with water should still be avoided. Bury empty container in a
safe place away from water sources. Use as a last resort after
other natural controls have failed.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS:</p>

leaves no harmful residues on food or vegetable crops. Sometimes
mixed in liquid from with <b>Pyrethrum (above).</b></p>

<p>USE: For control of beetles, caterpillars and other chewing
insects. Some mixes may be used as a flea and tick spray for

<p>DESCRIPTION: Biodegradable spray made from naturally occurring
saturated fatty acids. Works on contact.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">ORGANIC FUNGICIDES </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC11">ABOUT ORGANIC FUNGICIDES </a></h2>

<p>A number of different products are considered organic
fungicides that are not necessarily labeled as such, nor listed
here. One prime example is anti-transpirants, or anti desiccants,
used for maintaining the moisture in evergreens and shining
houseplant leaves. This is especially effecitve on annuals.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">LIME-SULFUR SOLUTION </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Lime-sulphur solution</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Liquid compound of calcium polysulfide sold by
the quart, gallon, or 5 gallon container. May be mixed with
mineral oil.</p>

<p>USE: Controlling powdery mildew, cane blight, brown rot, and
the like on fruit and nut trees, ornamentals, and flowers. Can
also be used as an insecticide against scale and as a miticide.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Apply as a dormant oil as well as in the growing
season. Best if used as buds are just starting to swell, but
before they break. More caustic than sulfur.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">SULFUR FUNGICIDE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Wettable sulfur, wettable dusting sulphur,
garden sulfur</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Safer's Garden Fungicide, Flotox</p>

<p>SIGNAL WORD: CAUTION (in some formulations)</p>

rock, natural sulfur is available in either a wettable micronized
powder form (extremely small particles) for use as a dust or in
liquid both as a ready to use mixure in a spray bottle or as a
concentrate. Sulfur is one of the oldest known garden pesticides
(it has been used for thousands of years), and a relatively
benign one, though it does smell badly during application.</p>

<p>USE: Conrolling powdery mildew, black spot, scab, brown
canker, leaf spot, rust, and other diseases on fruits,
vegetables, flowering trees, roses, and ornamentals. Like most
sulfur products, this works as an <i>organic miticide</i> too,
and kills thrips. Can be combined with <b>acephate (below)</b> to
control other insects (see labels for details). Also used as a <b>soil
acidifier (Chapter 1)</b>.</p>

<p>USE TIP: No residue. Safe for use on food crops up to day of
harvest. Extra-fine size of granules makes for better adhesion. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: <i>Micronized sulfur</i> has the smallest possible
particle sizes which makes it cover better. Check the label to be
sure you are getting pure sulfur. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">BIOLOGICAL CONTROLS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC15">INSECT CONTROL PRODUCTS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC16">ABOUT ORGANIC INSECT CONTROL PRODUCTS </a></h2>

<p>Many <i>microbrial control agents</i>, or <i>microbiral
insecticides</i>--inherently organic--are on the market and are
very easy to use. Insects succomb to diseases just like plants
and people, and these increase the naturally-occuring disease
organisms. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC17">BACILLUS POPILLIAE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Milky disease spores, milky spore powder, milky
spore disease, milky spores</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Doom, Japidemic, Grub Attack </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A powder of spores applied directly to the soil,
usually on lawns, and watered in well. </p>

<p>USE: For the control of Japanese Beetles in a larvae stage
(&quot;grubs&quot;), although some brands claim to control
oriental beetles, Rose chafers, and some May and June beetles as
well. Allow one to three years for it to spread completely
through your soil.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Not known to be toxic to humans, nor does it produce
any health threats. Harmless to animals, birds, fish, plants and
beneficial insects. Remains active in the lawn only as long as
there are sufficient grubs in the lawn for it to feed on. Will
not work as a preventative--it only works if grubs are present. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Container should be kept in a cool, dark place.
Don't buy it if you think it has been stored improperly--the
spores may have become inactive.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC18">Bacillus thuringiensis </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Bt, B.t.</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Dipel, Thuricide, Bactur, Mosquito Attack<sup>TM</sup>,
Caterpillar Attack<sup>TM</sup>, Bacthane, Biotroe, SOK-Bt,
Biotrol, Vectobac (Some of these are for certain insects
only--read the labels).</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Microbial insecticide usually sold as a wettable
powder and sometimes as a liquid. It contains the spores and
toxins produced by the bacteria <i>Bacillus thuringiensis
Berliner, </i>variety <i>kurstaki. </i>Also sold as dust and
bait. <i>Bti</i> is a special type which attacks only mosquito
wrigglers and black fly larvae, in water; it is sprayed or made
in a ring which is thrown into the water.</p>

<p>USE: For control of some notorious leaf-eating caterpillars,
pupating larvae, cabbage loopers, armyworms, imported cabbage
worm, and gypsy moths. Bt is considered on of the most
significant biological controls of Japanese Beetle and other
pests because is harmless to humans, other animals, food crops,
and useful insects, and it stops caterpillars instantly. Used on
crops such as tobacco, cotton, alfalfa, soybeans, vegetables,
shade trees, forested areas, fruit trees and ornamentals. The
bacillus interrupts the digestive cycle of certain larva, making
it a <i>larvacide</i> as well as an insecticide. A new
variety,'San Diego,' is being tested to combat the Colorado
potato beetle, and another type, Var. israeliensis, attacks
mosquito larvae (not adults). </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Compatible with most insecticides, fungcides, and
nutritional sprays. Plants must be thoroughly covered, especially
the undersides of leaves. Can be mixed with a soap-based solution
so it sticks to both sides of leaves. Can be used up to the day
of harvest. Apply only when you see insects present--it has no
residual effect.</p>

<hr size="4">

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">NOSEMA LOCUSTAE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Grasshopper spore</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Nolo, Grasshopper Attack<sup>TM </sup></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Organic insecticide powder made of protozoa
spore.</p>

<p>USE: Controlling grasshoppers of the Malanoplus family. Even
eggs laid by the infected grasshoppers infect young nymphs. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Apply by hand or with a seeder. Takes about a year to
have maximum affect.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">BAT BOX </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Bat house</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Wooden box 17 inches high, 10 inches wide and 7
inches deep, with a slanted roof and an open bottom through which
bats enter and leave. The bat house is made of natural finished
western red cedar. A single house may hold as many as 30 bats. In
effect, any bird house can be considered an insect control
product, if you want.)</p>

<p>USE: Provides a shelter for bats, thus attracting them to your
garden. Bats prey on insects, consuming thousands each evening.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Place box high up, in a sheltered location. If there
are no bats in your area to begin with, it is unlikely the bat
house will attract any, but if you have seen bats flying around
at dusk or in the evening, you may want to coax them closer to
your garden with a bat box.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Bat houses have become extremely popular in the
last few years. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">BENEFICIAL NEMATODES </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Scanmask, BioSafe<sup>TM</sup>,
Bio-Logic, Grub-Eater</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Biologically active insecticide made of
microscopic worms called nematodes (principally the Nc type, <i>Neoaplectana
carpocapsae </i>) which feed on damaging insects in the soil. May
be shipped in a semi-dormant state, mixed into a gel on a screen
that you dissolve with an activator powder mix, or in topsoil or
peat moss-like mediums. Eventually the worms are mixed into a
water-based solution that is sprayed or watered onto lawns and
gardens.</p>

<p>USE: Controlling insects in lawns, gardens, and houseplants;
different nematicides are effective against different
pests--check the label.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Apply directly to the soil in the root zone, not on
the leaves of the plants. Follow storage and mixing directions
very carefully, as you are dealing with living organisms that are
easily affected by sunlight and moisture and soil structure. Keep
refrigerated before use, and be sure to use whatever you mix
right away. Moist soil is necessary for success.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">NEMATICIDES</a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: ClandoSan</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Ground and treated crab shells and shellfish
waste full of naturally occuring chitinproteins which naturally
stimulate the growth of beneficial soil micro-organisms, fungi,
and bacteria. </p>

<p>USE: Controlling unwanted nematodes by producing enzymes that
destroy them as well as their eggs. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">PHYSICAL AND MECHANICAL CONTROLS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC6">TRAPS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">ELECTRONIC INSECT KILLER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Bug zapper</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Fluorescent or incandescent light inside an
electrified metal grid. Some brands are shaped like a lantern.
Typical wattage of current in grid is 4,500-6,000. Lights are
either yellow or <i>black light,</i> a type of ultra-violet light
which appears to us as a dull blue. Fluorescent bulbs may be
normal ones covered with a <i>black light blue filter (BLB). </i>Higher
wattage models are self-cleaning, meaning that they actually burn
off the bugs that hit the grid. Another version uses the same
light to attract insects, but has a fan instead of an electrified
grid. The fan blows the insects into a container of water with
detergent on top of it, and the insects drown. All models come
with a variety of brackets and hangers for use indoors and out.</p>

<p>USE: Controlling flying insects in an area about 25 to 70'
square, although larger models are available. Operated 24 hours
per day, but most effective at night.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Keep grid clean.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: There is no doubt that the higher wattage units
are more effective, as are the black light fluorescent bulbs--not
the ones with the filters. Non-selective, this device tends to
kill many insects which are not pests.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">MOLE TRAP </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Victor, Out-of-Site</p>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p>Skewer Type</p>

<p>Scissor Type</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Metal device about a foot high with spring-loaded
blades that is set above a mole burrow and anchored by two spikes
stuck in the ground on both sides of a mole tunnel. When the mole
comes along, it sets off the sensitive device. and is skewered to
death by three sharp spikes, in the case of the Victor trap, or
squeezed to death by four blades with the Out-of-Site trap. </p>

<p>USE: Control of tunneling moles in the garden or lawn.</p>

<p>USE TIP: With the scissor type design it is easy to tell if a
trap has been triggered. When a trap has done its deed, just
remove the trap and pat the soil back down with your foot. It is
better not to look at what you have done to the mole, as this is
not a scene for the faint-hearted. On the other hand, it is
entirely non-toxic.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The choice between the two types pretty much
depends upon your personal taste: do you prefer your moles
skewered or squeezed? This kind of trap has been around for a
while, and is time-tested to be a non-toxic way of killing one
mole at a time, but if you have a real infestation you might want
to look into putting <i>castor bean seed</i> (the same as used
for making castor oil) into the tunnel. These beans are highly
toxic and will kill any mole that eats them. The one drawback is
that if they are not eaten an unwanted castor bean plant may
grow.</p>

<p>Check your local game trap laws--they may dictate what you can
do about small animals.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">MOUSE AND RAT TRAPS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Spring-loaded</i></p>

<p><i>Box</i></p>

<p><i>Glue</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p><i>Spring-loaded: </i>Spring, snap</p>

<p><i>Box: </i>Live</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES:</p>

<p><i>Box: </i>Victor Smiling Cat Repeating Mouse Trap </p>

<p><i>Glue:</i> Tanglefoot (popular brand name)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Mouse and rat traps are the same, except that rat
traps are bigger.</p>

<p><i>Spring-loaded: </i>These are the classic mouse and rat
traps that have been around forever. A spring device is set when
a &quot;U&quot; shaped wire is pulled against the tension of the
spring and another, short wire is placed over it and onto a flat
tin trigger. Cheese or some other bait (including dental floss or
a small piece of cloth that a mouse might like for nesting
materal) is placed on the trigger, and when the mouse or rat goes
for it they are caught under the &quot;U&quot; shaped wire and
held there (and if the spring is strong enough, killed there) by
the pressure of the spring.</p>

<p><i>Box:</i> This is the better mouse trap we've been waiting
for! Consists of a metal box with small apertures on either end.
When the mouse enters the trap it cannot find its way out again.
It is reputed to capture as many as a dozen mice alive at one
time without resetting, and without killing them (they may kill
each other or die of loss of body heat, though).</p>

<p><i>Glue:</i> Non-toxic, 3&quot; by 3&quot; up to 7&quot; x
12&quot; plastic trays which contain a sticky bait substance.
They are placed where rats and mice travel, and the animal is
trapped when it walks on the glue, where it dies slowly.</p>

<p>USE: For the control of mice and rats. These are non-toxic and
time-tested ways of catching mice and rats. The box type is for
areas with an extreme problem.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Be careful that you don't set off a spring-type trap
when you try to set it. Many a finger has been hurt this way. It
is also a good idea to put the bait material on the trap before
trying to set it, because once the trap is set, you might catch
your finger if you press the bait trigger. The only problem with
the box type trap is the problem of what to do with a box full of
live mice, although this is a challenge that might appeal to some
of the more mischievous gardeners among us. Glue type traps must
be placed where mice travel, usually around the edge of rooms.
Both the spring and glue types can be dangerous to inquisitive
pets and small children. Disposition of the pest is simple with
these two types, as it is just a matter of throwing the trap in
the garbage along with the animal stuck to it.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: All these traps are a safe, non-toxic way of
trapping mice. The spring and glue type traps are especially
inexpensive and efficient; killing a mouse instantly may be more
humane than trapping for later dispatch.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">PHEROMONE TRAPS </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Bag-A-Bug, Japanese Beetle Attack<sup>TM</sup></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Sex traps, Japanese Beetle Trap, pheromone
lures</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic bag, metal or cardboard container
underneath a bug-attracting strip containing female Japanese
beetle sex pheromone and sometimes floral scents. Trapped bugs
fall into container. Strips are yellow. Overall height is about
15.&quot;</p>

<p>USE: To attract and capture Japanese beetles and other flying
insects.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Because the pheromone attracts more insects to the
garden than it can kill at once, be sure to place it away from
plants that can be eaten by the pest, such as roses and zinnias.
This problems makes pheromone traps particularly ill-suited to
small, urban gardens. In fact, some folks say that the best
location for a Japanese Beetle trap is in your neighbor's
garden--that way the bugs will leave you alone and head over
there. Lasts one season.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The yellow color of the trap itself is an
attractant, but models with both pheromones and floral lures (<i>double
lures</i>) are better--you just increase your chances.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">SLUG TRAP </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic cup with lip and a plastic, mushroom-like
roof. A <i>slug barrier</i> can be made from a strip of copper,
which somehow reacts with slug slime to produce an electric
shock.</p>

<p>USE: When trap is filled with beer or some other liquid,
slug-attracting bait, slugs climb into the cup and drown. A safe
alternative to placing highly toxic slug bait in your garden or
lawn, where it can be eaten by birds.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Stale beer is cheaper and works as well in the traps
as the more expensive slug baits. We recommend discount domestic
brands over the finer, imported beers. We are sorry to report
that no recent studies indicate which brand, in particular, slugs
prefer.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Cat food and tunafish cans can also be used as
slug traps, but at under $2.00, the slug trap is not that
expensive and is slightly more effectively designed, as the cover
keeps rain from washing away the beer.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">STICKY INSECT TRAP </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Flying insect trap</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small flat piece of yellow material coated with
sticky material that attracks certain insects, such as
whiteflies. Sticky material, the trap coating, is also sold
separately (Tanglefoot Tangle-Trap Paste) for making your own
traps in aersol spray, paintable, or spreadable formulations. The
color yellow attracts many types of flying insects, especially
whiteflies and aphids. May be sold as cards to be placed in
holders or hung from hooks.</p>

<p>USE: Not only does this kind of updated flypaper trap insects
to eradicate them, but it provides an opportunity to identify
whatever kind of pest is arriving on the scene, acting as an
early warning and identification system. Labels identify which
insects are attracted to each particular trap, such as flying
aphids, thrips, leafminers, gnats, fruit flies and leafhoppers.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Check out the type of insect each trap attracts.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">WIRE CAGE ANIMAL TRAP </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Havahart</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Galvanized wire mesh cage that comes in several
sizes, from 10&quot;x 3&quot;x 3&quot; for mice and shrews, to
42&quot;x 11&quot;x 11&quot; for raccoons. Standard trap for
rabbits and squirrels is 30&quot;x7&quot;x7&quot;.</p>

<p>USE: To capture small animals without harming them. They can
then be released elsewhere. Often used when populations of some
animals like rabbits and squirrels are particularly high. The
animals are released in areas where their populations are lower. </p>

<p>USE TIPS:</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Check your local game trap laws--they may dictate
what you can do about small animals.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">Barriers</a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">CATERPILLER TAPE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic silicone tape, 5&quot; by 40' long, with
sticky substance on the top part. When attached to the tree,
pleats are made every few inches, creating a &quot;skirt&quot;
effect. Another type is 3&quot; by 500' and is completely sticky.</p>

<p>USE: Prevents gypsy moth (&quot;tent&quot;) caterpillers from
climbing trees--they cannot climb over the smooth surface of the
tape. The sticky kind merely traps the caterpillars.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Install carefully. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Proven, non-toxic control of gypsy moths.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">TREE TANGLEFOOT </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Viscous goo sold in 6 oz. tubes, 1-25 lb cans and
pails, caulking cartridges, and aerosol cans. Sticky and
non-toxic, made from castor oil, gum resins, and vegetable waxes.
</p>

<p>USE: Banding trees and vines to protect against climbing pests
such as cankerworms, gypsy moth caterpillars, and ants. They get
stuck and suffocate.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Lasts three to four months. Apply band about 3 to 4
inches wide and 5 to 6 feet above the ground. Put Tanglefoot on
banding material for small, young trees. Though some people use
it, it is not recommended for sealing pruning wounds. If you
insist on painting tree wounds, Tanglefoot makes a specially
formulated tree paint.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">GALVANIZED STEEL FENCING </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Welded wire fabric</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Welded and woven galvanized steel fencing with
various types of mesh. <i>Rabbit guard</i> , <i>rabbit</i> <i>fencing,
</i>or <i>garden fencing </i>has 1 x4&quot; or 1 x 1&quot; mesh
on the bottom 12&quot;, then 2x4&quot; mesh on the next 4&quot;
and 4x4&quot; mesh on the top, whether 24&quot;, 28&quot;,
36&quot;, 40&quot;, or 50&quot; high. Sold in 50' rolls. Made of
16 gauge steel. Others have just the small mesh on the bottom and
2&quot; hexagonal mesh on the top, for economy. Standard <i>yard
fencing</i>, or <i>utility fencing</i>, is usually 14 gauge
(thicker than 16 gauge and thinner than 12-1/2 gauge) and has a
2x4&quot; mesh. <i>Hexagonal netting,</i> or <i>chicken wire</i>,
is sold in 24&quot;, 36&quot;, and 48&quot; heights and 75' rolls
and made of lightweight 20 gauge wire. 14 gauge steel <i>fence
posts</i> are sold separately (13 gauge for heavy duty), usually
with green baked enamel finish, 3 to 8 feet long. Made in either
a T shape or a U shapePacked 10 to a bundle.</p>

<p>USE: Barrier for rabbits, pets, and other small animals (and
sometimes people).</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Where there is a will in the animal world, there is
a way. These critters are persistant and will dig under or jump
over most any kind of fence if they possibly can. Try to extend
rabbit fences below ground level at least half a foot.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">Electric FencING </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Deer fencing</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Thick lengths of wire which conduct pulses of
low-voltage electricity; any animal that touches it recieves a
harmless but unpleasant shock. Wires are attached to fence posts
by <i>insulators</i>; lightweight custom <i>fence posts</i> are
available too, as are <i>insulated gate handles</i>. Electricity
is supplied by house current, storage battery, or a solar
battery, and conducted to the fencing by a variety of <i>fence
chargers </i>or<i> condensers,</i> the transformer which changes
regular electricity into pulsating, low-voltage surges of a
fraction of a second--and harmless--duration. Strands are
approximately 2' apart and usually 3 strands comprise the fence;
they are placed much closer together and to the ground when used
for protection against smaller animals. </p>

<p>USE: Keeping cattle or horses contained or to prohibit animals
such as deer from entering a garden area. Also effective against
rabbits, raccoons, and other smaller animals, but this requires
more strands of wire.</p>

<p>USE TIP:</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Deer can make considerable pests of themselves,
and electric fences are useful in keeping them at bay. However,
deer are also impressive jumpers, and may jump over a low
electric fence.</p>

<p><b>_____________________________________________________</b> </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">PROTECTIVE NETTING </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Anti-bird net, bird control net, bird netting</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Nets made from synthetic material such as
polypropylene in a range of sizes from 20 x 20 feet to 4-1/2 x 75
feet. A 3/4&quot; mesh is typical.</p>

<p>USE: Placed over fruit trees, fruit shrubs, or plants such as
strawberries to protect the crops from birds. Can also be used to
cover a lily pond or fish pool to catch falling leaves in autumn.
Lasts a few seasons. A heavier version is now available for
protecting crops from deer, although it can also be used to keep
leaves out of pools, as a snow barrier, and for transporting
large quantities of pruning debris. This latter model would have
a 1/2&quot; mesh, and can be referred to as a <i>garden utility
net </i>or as a <i>garden net. </i>A finer mesh is made for <i>insect
netting, </i>used primarily on fruit trees.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Be sure that the net is secured well at the bottom,
as birds can get in underneath it. When placing the net over
thorny plants like blackberries or raspberries, prop the net up
above the plants with a frame to prevent them from becoming stuck
on the thorns.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Buy a size that is a little larger than you think
you need. It is better to have too much than too little.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">REPELLANTS AND SCARECROWS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">ABOUT REPELLANTS AND SCARECROWS </a></h2>

<p>This is an area of products which contains more folklore than
most others. It is very hard to prove the effectiveness of
scarecrows and the like, and in fact, some government studies
have indicated that the more high-tech devices used to scare
animals, such as ultrasonic gopher repellants, are not
particularly effective out of doors. Some of these items seem to
work on personal faith more than scientific principle. And they
are nice to have around, out of tradition.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">ANIMAL REPELLANT </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: RO-PEL, Deer Guard , Hinder , Hot Sauce
Animal Repellent, Rabbit &amp; Dog Chaser , Dog and Cat Granular
Repellent , Scent-off Pellets , Scent-Off &quot;Twist-On&quot;
Buds , Repel Dog and Cat Repellent, Repel Liquid Animal
Repellent, Chaperone Squirrel &amp; Bat Repellent </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Extremely vile-tasting, bitter chemical, either
granular or aerosol or powders mixed with a solvent base for
spraying. Smells offensive to sensitive animals but not to
humans. Another form is wax buds that are hung from the lower
branches of trees and bushes.</p>

<p>USE: Discouraging specific pest animals (ranging from deer to
pet cats) from gnawing, nibbling, licking, or biting plants,
trees, fences, garbage cans, siding, and furniture. Works without
harming the animal--they merely find the odor offensive and move
away from it.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Some brands contain toxic chemicals which must be
handled exactly as the label instructs, both in terms of
application as well as storage and disposal. Test on plants or
furniture before application. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Check the label carfully. Some animal repellents
carry environmental hazard warnings on the labels. You may find
that the environmental condition you create by using the product
is worse than the pest you wish to repel. Furthermore, some
brands may repel generally beneficial animals, such as bats,
along with the pests.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">SCARECROWS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES: </p>

<p><i>Garden monster</i></p>

<p><i>Inflatable owl</i></p>

<p><i>Plastic owl</i></p>

<p><i>Inflatable snake</i></p>

<p><i>Inflatable scarecrow</i></p>

<p><i>Scarecat</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Bird repellants, decoys, natural enemy
scarecrows, bird scarers, pest scarers</p>

<p><i>Scarecat: </i>Le chat, cat's head bird scarer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Natural-looking decoys in the form of natural
predators of certain garden pests. The inflatable items are made
from heavy vinyl, others from molded plastic. All are painted or
printed with lifelike detail, with the exception of the scarecat
and the monster.</p>

<p><i>Garden monster: </i>An unclassifiable model, consists of 8
plastic film &quot;tennacles&quot; attached to a stake.
Monstrous-looking to pests only.</p>

<p><i>Inflatable and Plastic owl: </i>Great horned owl, 18 to
22&quot; tall; big orange eyes. Plastic molded type is amazingly
lifelike and beautiful.</p>

<p><i>Inflatable scarecrow:</i> More than 6' tall. Resembles a
straw man.</p>

<p><i>Inflatable snake:</i> 6 feet long, an inch or two in
diameter. </p>

<p><i>Scarecat: </i>Either a silhouette of an entire cat or a
silhouette of a cat's head. A French product made from flat,
black metal, with two clear marbles for eyes. It is hung on a
wire in the garden where it blows in the wind; the movement
causes sunlight to glance off the glass eyes. A similar, and
perhaps more effective version, is a mobile of highly-reflective
chrome-plated disks suspended from a hanger or a yard-high stake.</p>

<p>USE: The owl is supposed to scare rodents such as rats, mice,
and rabbits as well as some birds from the garden and around the
house. The snake and the cat are designed to scare birds,
squirrels, and other small animals away from berry patches and
vegetable gardens. And the scarecrow is for scaring birds from
grain crops.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Change the position of the snake every few days to
aid in effectiveness against your more cynical pests. Be sure to
warn any faint-hearted visitors about the snake's presence before
they discover it on their own. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: It is not entirely clear if these work well or
not, but they are generally fun, and certainly traditional, to
have in the garden. The solid plastic model owl is more realistic
looking to humans, and makes for a more decorative object. The
cat is probably the least effective and most expensive,
considering that a tin can lid performs the same function.
However, it is quite nice looking and very popular in France, so
maybe this doesn't matter so much.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC12">ABOUT SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES </a></h2>

<p>Much has been said about alternatives to the following
chemical products in the preceding part of this book. There is no
doubt that they provide an excellent service and convenience, but
nonetheless, they are very dangerous not only to the environment
but to the consumer. If you should ever have an accident or
misuse any of these toxic products, be sure to call your local
poison center with the information provided on the label,
especially the &quot;Note to Physicians&quot; If you go to see a
doctor, be sure to take the label or the container with you--the
prescribed treatment is on the label. Also note the code and EPA
numbers for positive identification with the authorities.</p>

<p>You can also call the NPTN, the National Pesticide
Telecommunications Network, at 1-800-858-7378, 24 hours a day,
365 days a year, for information on pesticides and help in
responding to pesticide poisoning. Ortho, one of the major
manufacturers of these products, requests that you call them
collect at 415-233-3737 24 hours a day if you ever have an
emergency or spill more than one container.</p>

<p>Please note that some garden centers unwittingly sell
professional products--that is, <i>restricted use</i> chemical
products for which the E.P.A requires that you obtain a pesticide
permit or applicator's license number. Be careful. There is a
reason for those licenses. These products are very strong, and
are hazardous to you and your environment. This is not to say
that the off-the-shelf chemicals are not dangerous: many were
approved for consumer use long ago, when our standards were less
demanding and our knowledge less comprehensive. Common products
disappear from the shelves from time to time as regulations
change and research grows in sophistication and the chemicals are
discovered to be much more dangerous than originally
thought--like DDT.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">ABOUT READING A PESTICIDE LABEL: </a></h2>

<p>Garden chemicals are often toxic and must, by law, state on
the label one of three <i>signal words, </i>or <i>indicators</i>,
of the level of toxicity. These levels of toxicity are determined
by the dosage required to kill 50% of test laboratory animals
(mice, rats and rabbits), which is known as an <i>LD 50 value</i>.
</p>

<p>The most toxic of the available chemicals are marked with the
signal word <b>DANGER/POISON</b> in red capital letters and with
the skull and crossbones. Few, if any, of these chemicals are
available to the home gardener, and can only be purchased and
used by licensed professionals. Those chemicals marked with the
signal word <b>danger </b>are extremely poisonous to humans and
animals. </p>

<p>Chemicals that are somewhat less toxic carry the signal word <b>WARNING</b>.
Theyare toxic, but killed fewer lab animals at higher dosages
than those marked <b>danger. </b>Some of these and the more toxic
chemicals can be fatal if swallowed.</p>

<p>The chemicals which are still less toxic have the signal word <b>CAUTION</b>
on the label. The warning <b>caution</b> does not mean that a
chemical is not toxic, it just means it will take more of it to
kill you, your family, or your pets than the more toxic
chemicals. Less toxic chemicals still carry the warning to
&quot;Keep Out of Reach of Children.&quot;</p>

<p>The chemicals that are offered to the general public, sort of
the over-the-counter garden center products, are referred to as <i>General
classification chemicals</i>. These chemicals carry on their
labels the product name (either brand name or generic), the
ingredients (both active and filler), precautionary statements
and directions for use.</p>

<p>When a chemical has an <i>official common name,</i>
regulations require that it be on the label. Some of the more
common chemical names that are also official and appear on garden
chemicals include malathion, ferbam and carbaryl, all items
described below.</p>

<p>The <i>chemical name</i> is a technical term that describes
the chemical composition of a substance. If there is no official
common name, the chemical name must appear on the label under
&quot;active ingredients.&quot; The chemical name is most
important in the event of an accidental poisoning, as that is
what the Poison Control Center or an attending doctor will need
to know in order to determine the best treatment for the
poisoning victim.</p>

<p><i>Trademarks and brand names</i> frequently appear on the
label. They do not appear in the active ingredient part of the
label. Examples of trade names would be Raid, Weedone, and
Roundup,<b> </b>Brand names are listed here with the various
chemicals that are their primary active ingredients. </p>

<p><i>Residue </i>or<i> residual rate</i> refers to the period of
time it takes for the toxicant to dissipate from the environment
or the plant, and directly affects</p>

<p>the amount of time you must wait after application before
harvesting fruit or vegetables.</p>

<p>EVERY LABEL HAS:</p>

<p>1. A brand name</p>

<p>2. Kind of formulation</p>

<p>3. A list of active ingredients</p>

<p>4. A statement of hazard to people and wildlife</p>

<p>5. The E.P.A. registration number (Do not use is it is
&quot;Restricted Use&quot;)</p>

<p>6. The name of the manufacturer or formulator</p>

<p>7. The type of pesticide (insecticide, fungicide, herbicide,
etc.) or its purpose</p>

<p>8. The amount contained in the package</p>

<p>9. General information and directions for use.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">GENERAL BUYING AND USE TIPS FOR GARDEN
CHEMICALS: </a></h2>

<p>Because pesticides are usually poisonous, they must be used
sparingly and correctly, both in terms of common sense and with
respect to the law. You should make every effort to do so, no
matter how small your problem. Should you decide to go with
pesticides, after trying alternative strategies, you should
always proceed cautiously.</p>

<p>- Use the least toxic method of pest management first. It is
easier to advance to a more toxic substance if the first does not
work than it is to eradicate the effects of a too-toxic solution.
If there is a safe, organic method, try that first. If it does
not work, go to the next least harmful method. Many books and
magazines offer information on this problem. </p>

<p>Here's how to do it with toxic chemicals. If at all possible,
use chemicals no stronger than those which contain CAUTION on the
label and avoid those labeled WARNING, DANGEROUS, and POISON. Few
home gardening problems are so threatening that you need to risk
using the more toxic and dangerous chemicals. Each of those words
denotes a jump to the next higher level of poison. Stick with
CAUTION level poisons.</p>

<p>- Identify the pest and determine how destructive it actually
is, before deciding what to do. Most Cooperative Extension
Services <b>(Appendix B) </b>are more than willing to help with
the identification of pests. Many insects, while a nuisance, may
not be at all harmful to you or your garden, and in fact the
chemicals introduced to deal with them are often more destructive
than the discomfort of living with nuisance pests. Try to avoid a
knee-jerk reaction to kill all pests.</p>

<p>- Know your chemical. If the specific pest or purpose for
using a chemical cannot be found in the directions on the label
of a produce <u>do not use that product.</u> Use only those
products that specifically treat the problem you have and nothing
else. Read and then re-read the instructions. Follow them
religiously, including dilution, application, and &quot;Days to
Harvest&quot; directions (minimum number of days needed prior to
harvesting for the residual pesticide level to go down to an
acceptable level). Pay attention to whatever other chemicals you
may be using, including fertilizers, and check with the
manufacturer or your Cooperative Extension Service agent to see
if they are compatible. Also check to see if it can be mixed with
other pesticides.</p>

<p>-Figure out exactly how much of a material is needed to
handle the problem, and buy only that amount. It is easier to buy
more if it is needed than it is to dispose of unused chemicals
that are not used. Furthermore, some chemicals lose their
effectiveness in storage. Over-application rarely kills more
pests but can harm you or your garden.</p>

<p>- Apply toxic chemicals wisely and safely. Do not eat, chew
gum, or smoke while using pesticides, as this can lead you to
ingest the chemical. Wear clothing that covers your whole body,
but avoid natural fiber clothing and shoes (cotton, wool, linen,
or leather) because it acts as a natural wick and carries the
chemical to your skin, especially if the chemical is labeled
WARNING, DANGEROUS or POISON. Some gardeners use only one set of
clothes for applying toxic chemicals and wash them separately
from other clothes. Never use or store pesticides near children,
nor ever use food utensils for measuring toxic chemicals.
Instead, designate one particular measuring cup for pesticides.</p>

<p>- Do not mix two or more chemicals, whether pesticides alone
or pesticides with fertilizers, unless you are absolutely sure
and certain that no harm will result. In most cases this should
not be done. You should really mix only when it is specifically
suggested on the label.</p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b></p>

<p>The popular brand names listed here are by no means the only
names under which these items are sold. Many excellent brand
names exist which might possibly be omitted, due to the
introduction of new products and the size of the market. Listing
here--or omission--is in no way an endorsement of or comment on
these products. Dilution rates are indicated as a guide, and are
by no means to be considered definitive. Only the directions on a
pesticide's label should be followed. This book is intended only
as a guide and not as the authority on how a chemical should be
used or the risks of using it. Neither the authors nor the
publishers are responsible for any consequences of using any of
the products noted here.</p>

<p>The items are listed by their common names wherever possible.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">GENERAL PESTICIDE PRODUCTS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">SPREADER-STICKER</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Sticking agent, wetting agent</p>

<p>DECRIPTION: Highly concentrated liquid petrolum product
typically sold in 4 and 8 oz. bottles. A sort of <i>wetting agent</i>

Another, similar product more oriented to the professional market
but available to the consumer is a <i>sticker-extender. </i></p>

<p>USE: Increases the efficiency of pesticides (or fertilizers)
by reducing the surface tension to make them more thoroughly
cover plant surfaces (<i>spreader</i>) and leaving a film that
encapsulates the pesticides, drying to form a shield against rain
(<i>sticker</i>). An <i>extender</i> protects the active
ingredients from degradation by the sun, like a sun block,
prolonging the effectiveness.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Use at least one hour before rainfall.</p>

<p>CHEMICAL NAME: O,O-diethyl
O-(2-isopropyl-6-methyl-4-pyrimidinyl) phosphorothiate </p>

<p>SIGNAL WORD: WARNING (spray form) or CAUTION (granular form)
-- varies with formulation</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Comes as an emulsifiable concentrate, a wettable
powder, granular mixture, or as a pre-diluted ready-to-use
household spray. A member of the organophosphate family.
Extremely toxic to birds. One of the most commonly used
insecticide ingredients since the early 1950's.</p>

<p>USE: Lawn and garden control of aphids, leafhoppers,
leafminers, sawflies, scales, cutworms, chinch bugs and other
soil insects. Household uses include cockroaches, ants,
firebrats, silverfish, sowbugs, springtails, spiders, crickets,
earwigs, carpet beetles, and brown dog ticks.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: This is a pretty toxic chemical which has not been
tested in every way it is used, because it is in so many consumer
products for which it is hard to develop reliable data. However,
the EPA recently banned its use on sod farms and golf courses due
the extreme number of deaths it caused in bird populations.
Watering it in thoroughly after application helps some, but then
that brings earthworms to the surface, which attracts birds. It
also persists in the insects that birds eat. You should consider
this before putting it on your lawn.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: This is such a toxic product that you may want to
find cultural or landscaping alternatives to whatever it is that
you think needs it. </p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: 90-Par, Volck, Scalecide</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A high-grade, light viscosity petroleum product
not unlike mineral oil that is sprayed on ornamentals, shrubs,
and trees in early spring (<i>dormant, </i>applied when they are
dormant) or late spring-early summer (<i>summer, </i>or<i>
growing season, </i>applied<i> </i>when they are actively
growing). New technical improvements allow it to be used on more
plants and at a wider range of seasons. Usually mixed with
water--contains an emulsifier for this purpose. May also be made
from fish oils or a mixture of Borax and kerosene (Ced-O-Flora).
The difference between dormant and summer oils is the
viscosity--dormant is thicker, summer is thinner--which may just
be the rate at which it is mixed with water. Some are sold just
as dormant oils, and may be called <i>superior oil.</i>
Considered an organic pesticide by many gardeners.</p>

<p>USE: Suffocates certain pests, such as mites, mealybugs, and
scale. Dormant oil sprays are applied in March, before new leaves
have appeared, for the control of scale, aphids, and spider mites
on the stem and trunk. As a summer oil, it is applied in late
spring or early summer for the control of aphids, mites, and
scale in their crawling stages. Often used as a contact herbicide
and, when greatly dilluted, as a leaf polish. Can be mixed with
compatible pesticides as a <i>spreader-sticker</i>, to enhance
the pesticide's performance. It works by coating and suffocating
the pest.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Dormant oil must be sprayed on shrubs and trees
before new leaves appear, when it is not windy, and when the
temperatures are above freezing and are expected to stay there
for a few days. Summer oil can be applied when there is little
wind or breeze during late spring. Toxic to fish. Flamable--do
not store near heat or flame--and harmful if swallowed. Wash your
hands thoroughly after use. This has been in use for many, many
years and no oil-resistant strain of insects has developed. A
weak, 2% mixture can be used on vegetable crops, but
overwintering insects need a strong dose: 3 to 5%. Do not try to
make your own with mineral or motor oil--they may damage the
plants. Do not use near open flame.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The better quality oils are light and highly
refined, as indicated by a high percentage of <i>sulfonation. </i>The
rate at which the oil can pass through a sprayer is noted in its <i>viscosity</i>,
stated in seconds. The more refined oils pass through sprayers
more easily, and are therefore easier to apply.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">SEVIN</a></h2>

<p>CHEMICAL NAME: carbaryl (1-naphthyl N-methylcarbamate)</p>

<p>SIGNAL WORD: CAUTION or WARNING--varies according to
formulation</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dust or spray, generally containing 5% to 10%
carbaryl, or a stronger liquid concentrate. One of the most toxic
chemicals sold over the counter.</p>

<p>USE: Very broad spectrum insecticide for combatting armyworms,
cutworms, squash bugs, tomato hornworms, fleas and ticks, certain
varieties of beetles, leafhoppers, and numerous other vegetable
pests.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Despite the commonness of this product, use it very
carefully, following the directions as with all pesticides and
taking precautions to keep it out of the home (when using it on
animals) and away from bees, to which it is very toxic.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">SYNTHETIC HERBICIDES </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC6">ABOUT SYNTHETIC HERBICIDES: </a></h2>

<p>Herbicides<i> </i>are products which kill plants or interrupt
their growth, and are used to control weeds, brush, or unwanted
grass. Most gardeners never need to use herbicides. If you have a
weed problem that does not respond to cultivation, hand picking,
or other methods of eradication, then you may want to consider
using an herbicide that has little or no residual toxicity. There
are not too many on the market, as the really effective ones are
far too toxic to be used safely. Remember Agent Orange?</p>

<p>TYPES: </p>

<p><i>Preplanting:</i> used after soil has been prepared for
planting, but before seed is sown.</p>

<p><i>Preemergent: </i>used after seeding but before germination,
to control weeds that might compete with the crop or planting,
such as crabgrass.</p>

<p><i>Postemergent:</i> Used after a crop or planting is
established.</p>

<p><i>Sterilant (nonselective):</i> Kills nonselectively all
plants that are treated with it, and is commonly used on walks
and patios.</p>

<p>SIGNAL WORD: CAUTION</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular white powder in solution. A selective
herbicide that is the most common home product in the U.S., but
may be re-evaluated for cancer risk by the EPA. Often mixed with
phenyl mercuric acetate (PMA).</p>

<p>USE: For the control of most broadleaf lawn weeds, such as
crabgrass. When mixed with PMA gains pre-emergence qualities, and
may also be a turf fungicide.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Dilute according to the label as concentrations may
vary. Do not allow this product to contaminate food, feed or
water, and be careful when applying it not to let the spray drift
over onto any other plants that maybe damaged by it, especially,
of course, food crops. (PMA contains mercury and there is
therefore a zero-tolerance limit of residue on food.) May not be
compatible with lime-sulfur or oils, and depending on the
formulation should not be used in hot weather, over 80<sup>o</sup>.

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">AMMATE</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: AMS</p>

<p>CHEMICAL NAME: Ammonium sulfamate</p>

<p>SIGNAL WORD: CAUTION</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Liquid usually sold in glass bottles, as it is
corrosive to some metals.</p>

<p>USE: Controlling woody plants, especially poison ivy and
poison oak. OK for use on poison ivy in apple and pear orchards.
Applied as a spray to the foliage of the offending plant;
translocates to the plant roots after killing the foliage.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Not hazardous to animals and people when used
according to directions. One of the few items on the market that
controls poison ivy.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">EPTAM</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Granular, pre-emergent herbicide sold in 1 and 5
lb containers.</p>

<p>USE: Control of Nutgrass, Bermudagrass, Quackgrass, Sandburs,
and other weeds in lawns and gardens.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">Glyphosate </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Grass killer, weed and grass killer</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Roundup, Glifonox, Glycel, Kleenup,
Rodeo, Rondo. </p>

<p>CHEMICAL NAME: isopropylamine salt of
N-(phosphono-methyl)glycine.</p>

<p>SIGNAL WORD: WARNING </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Sold most often as a concentrated aqueous
solution. Non-selective and postemergent, broad spectrum,
systemic, foliar spray. Also available in aerosol foam that
leaves a mark as to where it has been sprayed.</p>

<p>USE: Controlling over 50 types of grasses, brush, vines, and
broadleaf weeds after they are grown. Can also be used to control
some trees and woody brush. It is one of the safest herbicides on
the market because it has little residual toxicity, meaning that
it breaks down quickly after application, but it kills any plant
it touches in 2 to 10 days.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Because this product is non-selective, care should
be taken so as not to spray desirable plant material around the
weeds. Keep people and pets away for any treated area for at
least 6 hours, or overnight. It translocates, meaning that it
goes into the roots after killing the leaves. Mix only what you
need: the concentrate has a shelf life of many years, but once
mixed, it begins to degrade.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">SYNTHETIC FUNGICIDES </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT FUNGICIDES: </a></h2>

<p>Fungi are plants that actually feed on other plants. Contrary
to what one might think, fungicides cannot get rid of an
established fungus. They are used to prevent fungi from becoming
established or to control their spread. Fungi are quite common in
all kinds of gardens and especially with fruit trees, which need
to be sprayed routinely.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">BAYLETON</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dry flowable powder (may be abbreviated DF)
systemic fungicide.</p>

<p>USE: Fighting majority of diseases on turf and ornamental
plants, outdoors and in greenhouses, including flower blight,
leaf blight and spots, powdery mildew and rusts. Particularly
good on greenhouse plants such as African violets, carnations,
geraniums, and roses.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">Benomyl </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Benex, Benlate, Tersan 1991</p>

<p>CHEMICAL NAME: methyl 1
-(butylcarbarmoyl)-2-benzimidazolecarbamate. </p>

<p>SIGNAL WORD: CAUTION</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: General purpose systemic fungicide that is
absorbed by plants. Usually a white crystalline solid,
practically insoluble in water and oil. Sold in concentrated
formsin small plastic bottles for the home gardener. </p>

<p>USE: For the prevention of a variety of fungal problems in the
garden including black spot and powdery mildew on roses, phloxand
lilacs.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Be careful not to let spray drift into water or
water sources, as it is harmful to fish and other aquatic
animals. This is a relatively safe fungicide for the prevention
of fungal infection, but it requires intensive application
practices. It must be sprayed on the foliage before a fungal
problem is apparent and application must be repeated every 14
days or more frequently if there is rain. Store container in a
dry place with the cap securely tightened. Benomyl's
effectiveness is lessened if the stored product becomes wet. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">Captan </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Orthocide,Captanex, Captaf, Merpan,
Orthocide, Vondcaptan, Ortho Tomato and Vegetable Dust, Orthocide
Garden Fungicide, Bonide Rose Spray, Gro-Well Fruit Tree Spray,
Vancide 89</p>

<p>CHEMICAL NAME:
N-trichloromethylethio=4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboximide. </p>

<p>SIGNAL WORD: DANGER or CAUTION--varies with formulation</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A protectant-eradicant fungicide, that is, one
that prevents the fungus from attacking, sold as a wettable pure
chemical white solid concentrate that must be diluted<b>. </b>One
of the most popular broad-spectrum fungicides in use, and this
since 1951, on crops and seeds of all kinds.</p>

<p>USE: For the prevention of a variety of fungal problems in the
garden, including black spot and powdery mildew on roses,
phlox,and lilacs, damping off, on seedlings. Add a tiny bit a a
seed packet of untreated seeds and shake the packet.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: This is a relatively safe fungicide for the
prevention of fungal infection, but it requires intensive
application practices, similar to Benomyl (above). Avoid contact
with skin or clothing. Store in a cool dry place. Wear protective
clothing when using.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Not permitted for use on over 40 types of fruits
and vegetables (such as beens, broccoli, and cucumbers) because
it has caused cancer in laboratory animals. It permits treatment
of apples, green onions, lettuce, and tomatoes planted in beds.,
as well as most seeds. The EPA legislation on this chemical has
been changed a number of times over the years, and what goes for
commercial growers may not be as important for the home gardener.
However, check with the EPA or your local Cooperative Extension
Agent. </p>

plants--not directly on them, and around flower beds or lawn
edges.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Do not use around food crops or bodies of water.
Toxic to fish and wildlife, and of course pets and people. Some
labels carry the warning to &quot;keep children and pets out of
treated areas,&quot; which makes it an unlikely choice for a
family garden. Certain formulations are actually attractive to
dogs, and are marked as such in the label's fine print. Birds
which feed on a treated area may be killed. Safer to place in
small slug traps. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Alternative baits are yeast/water mixtures or
stale beer, which are non-toxic, to say the least.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">PART II - TOOLS, EQUIPMENT, AND ACCESSORIES
(Chapters 5-9) </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">GENERAL BUYING TIPS FOR TOOLS, EQUIPMENT,
AND ACCESSORIES </a></h2>

<p>There is no question that cheap tools and equipment are
terrible things to buy. &quot;Cheap&quot; means cheaply made--it
does not necessarily mean a bargain. If you can't afford the top
of the line, don't worry. Some of the top quality tools are
mirror-polished stainless steel, and that just can't be the
answer for everyone. Happily, all manufacturers make several
levels of quality, and you can aim for the middle-and upper-range
of products. Garden centers are competitive, so it pays to shop
around, too, because price and selection vary from place to
place. Whenever you do buy good tools or equipment, prepare to
own them forever. Now how many things can you say that about,
these days? <i>Get good tools.</i></p>

<p>It is not all that hard to differentiate a top-quality tool
from a poorly made one. The &quot;feel&quot; alone is usually
obvious: the finish is smooth, the handle feels comfortable, and
the whole tool is balanced. Polished steel is better than
unpolished; tempered or heat treated is better than stamped or
die-cut metal. Unpainted ash is better than painted generic
hardwood. And generally more expensive is better than less
expensive.</p>

<p>As for accessories, new ones are being developed almost daily,
it seems, and many disappear from the market place almost daily,
as well. Many are mere gadgets but some have become commonplace
solutions to old problems. An informed garden center sales clerk
should be able to help you choose among them. However,
advertising tends to make us think that there are many easy
solutions to gardening problems in the form of the latest
gadgets: in fact, gardening problems are hard to understand and
often need to be solved by a wide variety of actions, rather than
just one more gizmo. That is, in fact, the joy and challenge of
most gardeners.</p>

<p>For elderly or wheelchair-bound gardeners, look for
long-handled tools, of which there are plenty. Those with long
wooden handles are advantageous because a support handle can be
added part way up the handle. &quot;Ladies&quot; and children's
tools are more easily handled by the wheelchair gardener, too.
Bicycle handlebar grips, velcro, insulating pipe tape, and plain
foam rubber held in place by electrical tape are other ways to
adapt tool handles for those gardeners with a weakened grip. And
you can rent almost any of the full-sized tools at tool rental
stores, which in the case of rarely used power equipment is often
an excellent alternative to buying.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">DIGGING TOOLS AND WHEEL GOODS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT DIGGING TOOL DURABILITY: </a></h2>

<p>These tools are designed to be used for digging as well as
turning soil in the garden and include shovels, spades, trowels,
and forks. You find a wide range of digging tools in your garden
center with an even wider range of quality. How durable a digging
tool is depends primarily on how the &quot;business end&quot; is
attached to the handle, since this is the part of a digging tool
that is put under the most stress when the tool is being used.
There are three ways in which the tools listed here can be
attached to their handles:</p>

<p><b>-</b><i>Tang-and-Ferrule:</i> A <i>tang</i> is a projecting
shank or tongue, in this case, one that comes out the rear end of
a shovel or rake head; a <i>ferrule</i> is a metal ring or collar
which is fitted over the end of a wooden handle after a tang has
been inserted into it. Often a rivet or bolt is inserted through
the ferrule and the tang to insure a secure attachment. The
tang-and-ferrule method is common in garden tools, but is not as
secure a fit as the solid-socket method described below. It is,
however, easier and therefore cheaper to manufacture this type of
tool. The ferrule should be one long piece; those with a small
&quot;extra&quot; collar about 1&quot; wide at the end are
actually not as good, because the small collar is doing the work
that a foot long piece should do. This kind of tool may be called
a <i>tanged</i> or <i>shank</i> tool. </p>

<p><i>-Solid-Socket: </i>With this method, a handle is attached
to a tool blade via a solid collar which is actually part of the
tool blade, having been forged from the same piece of steel (not
welded). It is wrapped around the first foot or so of the handle,
or on the better models, the handle is actually driven into the
socket; they also have a pin driven through the shaft to hold the
socket on. This is sturdier than the tang-and-ferrule method and
less likely to bend or break where the handle meets the blade,
especially with very long collars. Long solid- sockets are a sign
of top quality. However, it is more costly to manufacture because
the entire tool must be forged from a larger piece of metal than
the tang-and-ferrule method described above, and it requires hand
labor to make them. It is still the best value, and recommended
for forks, shovels and spades. May also be called, confusingly, <i>solid-shank.
</i></p>

<p><i>-Solid-strap: </i>In the solid-strap method of attaching
the tool blade to the handle, a metal part called a <i>strap</i>
is extended from the socket up the tool handle. The blade,
socket, and strap are all forged from one piece of steel, making
this kind of tool the sturdiest and most durable. As you might
imagine, this is a rare form of manufacture but an excellent find
and a highly recommended purchase.</p>

<p>All metal tools should be wiped dry after use and coated with
a little oil to prevent rust. You can wipe them with a slightly
oily rag or spray them with an aerosol lubricant.</p>

<p>Many manufacturers make their most popular models in two
sizes, the smaller of which is often called a &quot;ladies&quot;
tool, such as a &quot;ladies spade,&quot; although their
&quot;floral&quot; models serve the same purpose. These
generally, but not always, are of the same quality and refer only
to a lighter weight and smaller head and handle (for working in
flower beds), ranging from 15% to 40% less. As any tool is an
extension of your body, it should fit properly, and these
so-called ladies' tools are the way to go to get your fit, if
need be. These and childrens' tools should be of the same quality
as the larger tools, but some manufacturers seem to think that
smaller tools can be of lesser quality. They are wrong, and
should be avoided. Some manufacturers are now making tools with
interchangeable handles, including both hand-and full-sized (one
popular brand is Twools<sup>TM</sup>, and another is Scotts. This
is certainly convenient and may be economical, but be sure to
check the balance and the feel of these tools--in some
combinations, they may not be as comfortable to use as those
which have been specifically designed with a handle of a certain
length in mind. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">ABOUT GRIPS AND HANDLES </a></h2>

<p>Digging tool handles, or &quot;hilts,&quot; for shovels,
spades, and forks come in three types: <i>straight</i>, <i>T-,</i>
or <i>D-grip</i>. Generally speaking, straight handles, just a
long rod, are useful in longer lengths where a lot of leverage is
used, like 40&quot; to 48,&quot; while D- and T-grips are found
in shorter lengths, like 26&quot; to 30,&quot; where control is
more important, or in tight quarters. Of course, the longer
straight handles make it easier to dig deeply and throw farther
(the soil, not the shovel!). T-handles are a bit slippery to use
as they are awkward to grip, and are not recommended. Ash is the
material of choice for wooden handles, with hickory almost as
common; only the cheaper tools use Douglas fir, which should
generally be avoided by the serious gardener. Wooden handles
should be free of knots and flaws, and the grain should run
lengthwise in even, continuous lines. The closer or tighter the
grain of the wood in the handle, the stronger it is. Tubular
steel handles are usually too heavy for the average consumer to
enjoy, but lighter alloys (plastic covered) are found on some
fancy models. Replacement handles are available with the end
either plain for solid-socket style (sometimes called<i>chucked </i>)
or ferrule style.</p>

<p>D-grips should be formed of wood and may be covered with metal
for extra protection; heavy-duty models have a reinforcement in
the V of the neck. If the handles are an all metal piece that is
attached to the blunt end of the handle, be sure to check the
quality, as this can loosen with time. The best ones are made
entirely of wood; the handle is split and formed into a Y, making
for a solid and beautiful handle, sometimes reinforced at the
narrow part. The <i>cob</i> (the crosspiece on the D-grip) should
be sturdy, and not turn at all when you grip the tool. Some
manufacturers call this a <i>Y-D grip</i>, and it is traditional
and good.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">TROWELS, SHOVELS, AND FORKS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC7">ABOUT TROWELS, SHOVELS, AND FORKS </a></h2>

<p>There is a wider variety in style and quality among these
products than almost any others. Your choice depends largely on
the type of gardening you do, and the type of soil you have.
Acquire slowly and look for quality wherever you can--it will pay
off in the long run in terms of comfort and utility for you, and
longevity for the tool. As with all metal tools, make an effort
to keep these clean, dry, and sharp. See the note at the
beginning of this chapter about shovel handle construction.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">TROWELS</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hand trowel, garden trowel</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, narrow, hand-held metal scoops, either
made from one piece of cast metal or a metal blade with plastic
or wooden handles of various colors. Some newer models have
specially curved and foam padded handles or <i>trigger grip
handles</i> with &quot;triggers&quot; on the bottom side which
make them easier to use by people with arthritic joints. The
die-cast aluminum trigger grip trowel (and its sisters, a hand
fork and cultivator) are in the design collection of the Museum
of Modern Art, New York. An ergonomic design for arthritis or
carpal tunnel syndrome sufferers, the Handform make, featuring an
sideways offset blade and &quot;bent&quot; handle, making it
easer to push or scrape without bending or forcing the wrist. A
curved handle is offered in a one-piece cast aluminum model as a
way to avoid blisters, called, unsurprisingly, the <i>No-blister
trowel.</i> Several makes now come with long handles that can be
attached as desired in place of the hand-sized handle, and some
manufacturers offer <i>long-handled trowels</i>, with 2' or 3'
long, lightweight handles for use by those gardeners who have
trouble bending over, or by children. <i>House plant tools,</i>
are made in an almost miniature style, with extremely small
blades for use in container gardening. </p>

<p>TYPES OF TROWELS:</p>

<p>-<i>Standard: </i>Two-piece hand tools with wooden, metal, or
plastic handles and metal blades, and a sharp edge.</p>

<p>-<i>One-Piece trowels:</i><b> </b>Cast lightweight aluminum or
other metal alloy or forged heavy gauge steel. Usually the handle
is covered with a colorful plastic grip. The blade on one-piece
steel trowels is often V- shaped rather than curved (adding
strength), and the edge is not sharp.</p>

<p>-<i>Planting or Bulb trowels:</i> Constructed like either of
the above two, but with a narrower blade, usually 2&quot; or no
more than 3&quot; wide at the top (tapered down to about 1&quot;
at the tip) but as much as 6&quot; long, although some are made
even narrower for delicate, indoor work with seedlings. The
smaller blade allows you to dig a small hole suitable for
planting bulbs, bedding plants, or seedlings. Most models have
measuring lines stamped into the blades for your convenience when
determining how deep to plant each bulb, leading some people to
call them <i>graduated trowels</i>. May also be called a <i>bulb
planter</i> (incorrect, see listing below) or <i>transplanter </i>or
<i>transplanting trowel.</i>. The narrowest can be known as <i>Rockery
trowels</i>, for use in rock gardens.</p>

<p>USE: Planting, transplanting, and moving soil into containers
or pots. They are essential tools, especially for gardening in
small spaces such as containers on terraces and roof gardens.
Narrow and V-shaped blades are best for digging out weeds and
planting bulbs; wider and flatter blades are better for general
use with loose soil. Long handles are convenient for gardeners
who have trouble bending over or kneeling.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When transplanting with a trowel it is not necessary
to actually <u>dig</u> a hole. Simply insert the trowel into the
soil and <u>open</u> a hole by moving it from side to side; the
curve of the blade forms the hole. Standard metal garden trowels
should be cleaned with an oily cloth after use and stored in a
dry place to avoid rusting.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: One-piece aluminum or steel trowels are more
durable than the standard garden trowels where the blades are
attached to a handle by the tang-and-ferrule method (see About
section, above). Aluminum trowels are light weight, a
consideration for people with arthritis or some other disability
affecting their ability to grip, but the edge of the blade is not
as sharp as on other trowels, and cannot be sharpened. Usually
the larger the grip, the easier the tool is to use. Colorful or
bright metal trowels are easier to find in the garden. You may
want to buy several sizes for different jobs. Standard trowels
with blades made from chrome-plated steel are better buys than
those with other metals. Among one-piece trowels, those made from
steel are among the strongest and most durable sold. V-shaped
blades are strong and less likely to bend. By all means, get a
trowel that won't bend, and of course one that feels real
comfortable to grip--after all, that's what you do with it. Try
all the various grip designs, because they fit individual hands
differently from one another. Interchangeable handles are
sometimes not well-balanced--try them out before you buy.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">WIDGER</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Nitpicker, Nit-picker, Everything tool,
potted-plant tool</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plain convex stainless steel strip, half an inch
wide, and 7&quot; long.</p>

<p>USE: Digging out small seedlings for transplanting and
removing small potted plants by pushing it down along the side of
the pot. Also good for seeding and applying small doses of
fertilizer.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">DIBBLE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Dibber, dibbler, planter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The original dibble was just a cow's horn. Now
they are made of metal, wood, or plastic and are about 8&quot;
long, pointed and round with with a curved or D handle just above
it, though one with a waist-high handle is also made. May be
solid plastic or cast iron, steel, or metal-covered wood or
plastic.</p>

<p>USE: Quick way of making holes for transplants and bulbs.</p>

<p>USE TIP: This is a handy tool if you are setting out numbers
of plants or bulbs, but if you are just doing just a few, a
trowel will suffice. This is really a tool for large gardens.
When planting bulbs, note that the bulb may not rest completely
in the deep indentation made by the point, thus leaving an air
pocket under the bulb. Push the bulb into gentle contact.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for a smooth, comfortable grip. Dibbles are
not indispensable tools for most gardeners. A couple of good
trowels generally do the job just as well. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">BULB PLANTER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Tapered metal cylinder from 6 to 10&quot; tall,
with a D-grip handle right above it or with a long handle
(approximately 30&quot;--abbreviated often as an <i>L.H. </i>bulb
planter) and a foot rest. The hand-held bulb planter is used in a
kneeling or stooping position, while the long-handled ones can be
used from a standing position. Long-handled bulb planters are
often made from a single piece of metal. They all should have
depth markings in inches on their sides. May be confused with a
narrow trowel made for this purpose, as they are often called by
the same name. A similar model is made for planting zoysia grass
plugs. Another version is made for planting sod plugs, called a <i>sod
planter</i>. It has a 2&quot; square cutter and extractor. </p>

<p>USE: Planting bulbs singularly in confined spaces or where
there are other plants close by.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The cylinder is pushed into the soil and removed,
removing a plug of soil with it as long as the soil is not
completely dry. The bulb is placed in the hole and the plug
replaced. Many of these tools have depth markings on the side to
help make the correct depth hole for each bulb.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Many gardeners prefer a trowel to the hand-held
bulb planter, but the long handled versions are extremely useful
for people who cannot kneel or stoop easily.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">BULB LIFTER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Wide, two pronged hand fork with a 6 inch steel
blade and a 12 inch wooden handle.</p>

<p>USE: Lifting bulbs out of the garden for overwintering, and
for transplanting jobs with flowers.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">SHOVELS</a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Round Point </i></p>

<p><i>Square Point </i></p>

<p><i>Scoop </i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p><i>Round Point: </i>Pointed,<i> </i>Dirt shovel, Round-Nose,
Round-point American pattern</p>

<p><i>Square point: </i>Square-Nose, square mouth</p>

<p><i>Scoop:</i> Coal shovel, coal and street shovel, barn &amp;
snow shovel</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Probably the gardener's most familiar tool,
shovels have a good deal of variety of detail and type (<b>Spades</b>
are a different item and are listed below). Blade tips may be
rounded, pointed or blunt, depending on the type. Handles vary in
length and shape, ending in either a D-grip (sometimes reinforced
in the V of the neck), a<i> </i>T-handle (or T-head) grip, or
just a slight taper (straight handles).<i> </i>(See<b> ABOUT
GRIPS AND HANDLES, above</b>). The degree of cant, or the angle
of the handle from the ground when the blade is flat, varies from
model to model.</p>

<p>Steel shovel blades are made one of two basic ways: <i>stamped</i>
or<i>forged</i>. Stamped shovels are made from stamping out the
shape of the shovel from a large sheet of metal, and contain a
crimp, or fold, called a <i>frog, </i>near the top of the blade
by the handle, to make the blade stronger. These shovels are
referred to as <i>hollow-backed</i> or <i>open back </i>if the
frog opening is left as formed<i>.</i> When a triangular piece of
metal is welded over the frog to close and refinforce it, the
shovel is referred to as a <i>closed-back </i>or <i>fast-back </i>shovel.
Forged shovels are rolled out and forged from a single thick
piece of steel. They are naturally strong, so there is no need
for the frog in the blade (they are stronger than stamped
shovels). Forged shovels, sometimes called <i>solid-shank</i>
shovels, may be either of solid-socket design or solid-strap
design (see <b>About Digging Tool Durability</b>, above). Top
quality models are epoxy-coated, heat-treated, high-carbon steel.
Most manufacturers also offer a chome-plated ceremonial shovel
for ground-breaking ceremonies.</p>

<p><i>Round point shovels:</i><b> </b>Pointed, curved blade with
an almost four-foot long wooden handle; a less pointed model is
called <i>medium point </i>and may be broader. The top of the
blade nearest the handle is often rolled over to form a footrest.
About 8-1/2&quot; wide by 11&quot; or 12&quot; long. A rare model
is the <i>narrow-blade</i> shovel, about half the normal size.
Some models have serrated front edges to assist in cutting though
roots and compacted soil.</p>

<p><i>Square Point shovels:</i><b> </b>Blunt-ended, flat blades
with upturned sides. These shovels may have long plain handles or
shorter handles with D- grips.<i> </i>About 9-1/2&quot; x
11&quot;.</p>

<p><i>Scoop or Coal shovels:</i><b> </b>Much like square-nose
shovels but larger and much lighter. May be made of aluminum or
plastic. Almost twice as big as the other types. <i>Eastern
scoops</i> are smaller than <i>Western scoops</i>, which usually
have reinforcing ribs in them. Some are more specialized, such as
<i>grain scoops.</i></p>

<p>USE: General purpose models for digging and moving loose soil
or other materials like sand, cement, and gravel from one place
to another. The round nose holds more--the wide, slightly curved
blade allows you to pick up a good sized load. Gardeners need at
least one of these for tasks such as digging up beds, planting
trees and shrubs, and working in compost. The narrow-blade model
can be used to dig small trenches or simply as a smaller shovel
for smaller gardeners. Square-nose shovels are excellent in
construction, where you have to lift material like sand off of a
sidewalk. Scoop shovels are not for digging but rather for moving
loose and light material like snow, sawdust, or trash.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Clean shovels with oiled cloth after using and store
in a dry place. Shovels are not really designed for lifting light
plant material such as straw or uncomposed compost--spades and
forks are more appropriate. Though a long-handled shovel has good
leverage for lifting, many a handle has been broken when a shovel
was used to lift a plant by prying it out. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The lightweight, stamped hollow-backed shovel is
a good purchase for most gardeners, and is the most popular and
least expensive. The closed-back models are a bit stronger and
generally more expensive. If you want to purchase a higher
quality tool that will really last, a forged shovel is worth the
investment--the top of line of any brand is forged. The gardener
with a small garden probably does not need a scoop shovel or
square-nose shovel, which are used primarily for moving material,
but the estate gardener would find these useful--the exception
being for snow removal, when either one is a help. In any shovel,
look for a good cant, or angle, of the handle to the ground, for
ease of use--with a large angle you won't have to bend over as
far. Sockets should be riveted to the handles. Seam-welded
sockets are typical of top-quality shovels. Don't buy a large
shovel if you have trouble lifting heavy loads--buy the size
that's comfortable for you to work with.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">SPADES</a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Border spade</i></p>

<p><i>Garden spade</i> </p>

<p><i>Irish Garden Spade </i></p>

<p><i>Tree-Planting Spade </i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Garden spade:</i> Digging spade</p>

<p><i>Irish Garden Spade:</i> Irish spade</p>

<p><i>Tree-Planting Spade: </i>Tree spade, sharpshooter,
trenching tool, transplanting spade</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Similar to <b>shovels (above)</b> but with almost
flat, rectangular blades (or &quot;heads&quot;), usually shorter
handles, and usually D-grips (See<b> ABOUT GRIPS AND HANDLES,
above</b>). The blades are straight or slightly tapered,
depending on the type, and may have a small section of the top of
the blade bent over to form a footrest, depending on the model.
Professional brands have models that are even further
differentiated, by purpose, such as <i>shrub pattern, drain, </i>or<i>
balling spades. </i>For example, drain spades can be as narrow as
5&quot;. Spades may have handles that are reinforced with <i>straps</i>
running from the blade 3/4 or all of the way up the handle, or
lightweight plastic-coated hollow steel handles. Made of regular,
high-carbon, or stainless steel; the top of the line stainless
models are polished to a mirror finish and the seams of the solid
socket are welded (&quot;seam welded&quot;). The plastic handles
of high-quality tools are usually epoxy bonded to the socket for
extra strength and to exclude moisture.</p>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Border spade:</i><b> </b>The smallest, easy-to-use spade
which gets its name from having been used in border gardening,
where narrow beds are common. A modified version is sometimes
called a <i>Poacher's Spade</i>, with a more curved blade and a
rounded tip; a <i>Dutch spade</i> is a bit shorter and has a
curve midway between flat and the Poacher's spade, and has a
T-grip. All are about 5-1/2&quot; wide by about 10&quot; long,
with an overall length of about 36,&quot; though the Dutch spade
is often longer. </p>

<p><i>Garden spade:</i><b> </b>Medium to large-sized, general
purpose spade. The flat or slightly curved blades are usually
8&quot; wide and 12&quot; long. The top edge of the blade near
the handle should be folded over to make two <i>footrests, </i>or<i>
treads, </i>or<i> step treads</i>. Overall lengths from about 3-
1/2 to over 5 feet (straight handle). A smaller, lighter model
(about 1-3 lbs less) is commonly offered, called a <i>Ladies
Spade, </i>as is a heavy-duty model, with a longer socket and
perhaps a more angled blade.<i> </i></p>

<p><i>Irish Garden Spade:</i><b> </b>Longer, more tapered blade
than border spades, with a T-grip handle. </p>

<p><i>Tree-Planting Spades:</i><b> </b>Longest, tapered blade
about 16&quot; long, with a very wide footrest at the top of the
blade. </p>

<p>USE: Digging, cutting, turning, and lifting soil, especially
heavy soil, and sod, often when making a lawn edge. Spades are
particularly well-suited for cutting through roots and compacted
soil when digging planting holes or turning beds. The flat blade
is helpful when edging or when digging a trench. <i>Border spades</i>
are popular with children or older gardeners who appreciate their
light weight, as well as for transplanting. <i>Irish Garden
spades </i>dig deep holes and are the choice of gardeners who
like to double-dig their gardens (digging up the soil to a depth
of two shovel blades).<i> Tree spades' </i>extra wide footrests
make it easier to dig deep holes for planting trees and shrubs. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep the cutting edges of spades sharp with an emery
wheel, file, or whet stone. Clean spades with oiled cloth and
store in a dry place. The T-grip on Irish spades may be awkward
to use, as it is hard to grip, but it is popular in Europe.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Many gardeners consider the spade to be a more
essential gardening tool than the <b>shovel (above)</b>, as it
can help with so many specific gardening tasks. The length of the
handle is important. For best leverage, the D-grip should be just
below waist level when the spade in inserted in the soil. Avoid
spades with T-grips, as they are awkward to use, unless you find
yourself using two hands for lots of edging, in which case a
T-grip has more room than a D-grip. Look for footrests on the top
edge of the blade. Some of the most amazing spades are made of
surgical-quality, mirror-polished stainless steel. They can cost
around $100 and are terrific gift items, plus a little easier to
use, but a heat-treated carbon steel spade (or even epoxy coated)
is just about as good and also should last for a few
generations--long enough for most of us.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">FORKS</a></h2>

<p>TYPES:<i>Garden </i></p>

<p><i>Manure</i></p>

<p><i>Pitch</i></p>

<p><i>Spading</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Garden: </i>Digging fork, English Garden Fork, English
pattern fork, English digging fork, English style fork</p>

<p><i>Manure: </i>Stable fork</p>

<p><i>Pitch: </i>Hay fork, Kansas Header fork</p>

<p><i>Spading:</i> Turning fork, border fork, digging fork
(erroneous) </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Simply a large steel fork, the size of a shovel,
with 3 to 10 tines (or more), depending on the type of fork. Most
are tang-and-ferrule construction, but top of the line models are
solid-socket type (see <b>About Digging Tool Durability</b>,
above). The shape of the tines also depends on the type of fork.
The four types actually fall into two broad categories, <i>garden</i>
and <i>pitch</i> (<i>spading</i> and <i>manure</i> forks are
respective sub-categories.) There is much confusion surrounding
the terms &quot;Garden,&quot; &quot;Digging,&quot; and
&quot;Spading.&quot; These forks are all used for digging soil,
but because of its job, the garden fork is the heavier type, with
strong, square tines, and the spading fork is lighter, with flat
or triangular tines. <i>Digging</i> is a general term that
applies to both kinds, but is only accurate as a name for the <i>garden</i>
fork. Many well-known and widely-distributed manufacturers lump
all their forks together under the category of
&quot;digging&quot; forks, an error which adds to the confusion.
A<i> Ladies' fork</i> is merely a smaller and lighter version
(about 1-3lbs) of any model, and some special smaller designs
with long handles, sometimes called a <i>cultifork</i>, are
designed for wheelchair gardeners. May have handles that are
reinforced with <i>straps</i> running from the blade 3/4 or all
of the way up the handle, or lightweight plastic handles. Made of
regular or stainless high-carbon steel; the top of the line
stainless models are highly polished and the seams of the solid
socket are welded (&quot;seam welded&quot;) but only in the
Garden and Spading models. The plastic handles of high-quality
tools are usually filled with a steel alloy and epoxy bonded for
extra strength and to exclude moisture.</p>

<p>Handles are usually D-grip or straight, depending on the type
(See<b> ABOUT GRIPS AND HANDLES, above</b>). </p>

<p><i>Garden fork: </i>7&quot; to 8&quot; wide head with four
thick, rectangular or square tines approximately 12&quot; long
and a 30&quot; handle ending in a D- grip, although available
with a 5 foot long straight handle. Most common model. Available
in heavy-duty versions which are slightly larger. Square tines
may be called <i>English tines</i>. </p>

<p><i>Manure fork: </i>4 to 10 12 inch long, curved, round, fine
tines spaced closely together. A similar design with longer tines
is a <i>mulch fork. </i>The term <i>stable fork</i> is usually
applied to lighter, almost rake-like models with even more tines,
like 16, and may at that point be called a<i> bedding fork.</i></p>

<p><i>Pitch fork: </i>Three to five round, tapered tines about
12&quot; long, with a long, straight handle attached by either a
solid-socket or a tang-and- ferrule. A <i>Scottish Composting
fork</i> is a lighter and smaller version.</p>

<p><i>Spading fork: </i>Four flat tines, sometimes with
&quot;diamond&quot; or traingular backs. Slightly lighter and
smaller than the Garden fork; sometimes the term <i>border fork </i>refers
to a lighter, narrower version with wider tines. Usually 42&quot;
overall.</p>

<p>USE: Two types of forks--garden and spading--are used for
turning over garden soil, and the other two types--pitch and
manure--for lifting and pitching light and loose material such as
found in the barn. Forks are often easier to use than shovels for
turning and cultivating because it is easier to insert the tines
of a fork into the ground than it is to shove in an entire shovel
blade, particularly if the soil is compacted. </p>

<p><i>Garden fork: </i>Best suited for turning the unbroken soil,
breaking up clods, and for heavy cultivation. Use a heavy-duty
model for rocky or clayey soils.</p>

<p><i>Manure fork:</i> Good for lifting manure and other fine
material without sifting. More suited to farm use than home
garden use.</p>

<p><i>Pitch fork:</i> Not used for digging, but for lifting hay,
straw and leaf mold. Essentially for farms or large gardens.</p>

<p><i>Spading fork: </i>Turning over already-broken, loose soil
for cultivation. Often used for lighter digging such as lifting
bulbs and perennials, and for harvesting vegetables that grow
under the soil surface, such as potatoes and beets.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When cultivating or turning the soil the fork should
be perpendicular to the ground and pushed in with your foot on
the footrest.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: As with all digging tools, it is important that
the length of the handle be comfortable. It should come up just
to your waist when inserted in the ground. The tool should have a
good balance and not be too heavy. Unfortunately, American
companies no longer manufacture solid-socket or solid-strap
garden forks, but many are imported from England. And watch your
weight, that is, get a fork that is not too heavy for you to use.</p>

<p>Generally, a spading fork is not as good a buy as a garden
fork, if you want only one fork. The flat tines on a spading fork
may bend if you hit a rock, and it is difficult, if not
impossible, to straighten them. The square tines of the garden
fork are less likely to bend, and the fork will do most of the
same work of the spading fork. It may not work as well when
trying to turn a fine-textured soil, but a spade can then be
substituted. Look for high carbon, tempered steel with a slight
&quot;spring&quot; to it. Smaller, hand-sized versions are made,
listed under <b>hand forks (Chapter 6).</b></p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">EDGERS AND SPECIALIZED DIGGERS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">EDGER</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Turf edger, half moon edger, semicircular
edger, edging knife, lawn edge trimmer </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Flat, semi-circular blade about 8&quot; across,
attached to a handle which may be long and straight or end in a
T- or D-grip. The straight top of the edger often has a rolled
footrest. Top of the line models have solid-socket construction,
and some are made of mirror-polished stainless steel.</p>

<p>USE: Cutting a sharp edge along garden or lawn walks, borders,
or driveways, buildings, and sidewalks.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Place the edger about 1 to 2&quot; from the walk or
area to be edged. Press down by stepping on the foot rest. A
sharp edge is cut when you pull the handle back toward yourself,
creating a slight angle.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Because of the amount of tension that is put on
the edger at the shank, it is wise to pay more for a solid-socket
type. Highly polished stainless steel slices more easily through
the soil.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">SOD LIFTER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The first cousin of the <b>edger</b> described
above. They look similar, but the sod lifter has a long solid
steel shank that is bent at an angle and has no footrest. The
handle of the sod lifter often ends in a D-grip.</p>

<p>USE: Lifting dead sod areas from a lawn prior to reseeding.
Also helpful when cutting a hole in a lawn to plant a tree or to
create a bed. When sod is lifted with a sod lifter, less damage
is done to it than when a spade or shovel is used, and the sod
can be used elsewhere in the lawn.</p>

<p>USE TIP: This tool, which relies on leverage to work, can be a
back breaker if used incorrectly. If working on a large area,
rhythm and a pattern of motion make using this tool less painful.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: This is not an essential garden tool, but for the
gardener who is putting in a border, flower bed or planting trees
in a sodded area it may be worth purchasing. An edger, however,
may do a small job just as well.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">POSTHOLE DIGGERS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:<i> Clamshell</i></p>

<p><i>Manual auger</i></p>

<p><i>Lever-Action Digger </i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Manual auger: </i>Earth auger (Note: may be confused with
smaller one, listed below, for making holes for bulbs), posthole
auger, posthole borer</p>

<p><i>Lever action: </i>Canadian Digger, Canadian style digger,
Universal digger</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hinged digging blades attached to long handles.</p>

<p><i>Clamshell digger:</i><b> </b>The most prevalent and easily
found, consisting of two wooden handles, each of which is
attached to a curved blade about 12&quot; long. A pivot joint is
placed between the two blades where they are attached to the
handles. The blades are plunged into the ground in an open
position (that is, when the handles are parallel). The handles
are then pulled apart, causing the blades to come together to
scoop up soil that can then be lifted from the hole. </p>

<p><i>Manual Auger:</i><b> </b>Has two stationary blades that are
bent at an angle. These are attached to a wooden handle that ends
in a cross bar about a yard long. Manual augers work by screwing
into the ground as the cross bar is turned in a clockwise
direction. When the blades are full, they are lifted from the
hole and emptied. Manual augers work well in loose soils but not
so well in hard clays or rocky soils. (Note: The term <b><i>earth
auger</i></b> also refers to a spiral drill bit that is only
about 1-1/4&quot; in diameter, and is used with an electric drill
for making small holes, described below, as well as much larger
powered models used by professionals for planting trees).</p>

<p><i>Lever-Action Digger: </i>One stationary blade attached to a
wooden handle with a moving blade attached to a lever about 3' up
on the handle. The blades of this digger are plunged into the
soil and the lever is pulled down, causing the two blades to
scoop up soil that it can be lifted from the hole and released
when the lever is pulled up. </p>

<p>USE: Digging narrow holes for fence posts and footing for
garden structures such as gazebos, arbors, shelters, porches, and
the like. Manual augers are effective only in soft soil, not for
hard or rocky soil.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Clean diggers after using with an oiled cloth. Be
sure to oil all moving parts before storing in a dry place.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A must for large estates and farms, but less
important in small gardens. If you are installing a fence or
garden structures that are supported by posts anchored in the
ground you may want to consider purchasing posthole diggers, as
these structures usually require some repair maintenance in the
future. However, posthole diggers can be rented or borrowed from
a neighbor. Lever-action style diggers are more efficient.</p>

<p>The clamshell digger is a durable reliable tool. With proper
care it can last a long time. If you are digging a hole more than
2 feet deep, this is probably the tool for you. Manual augers
work well only in loose soil. They work less well, or not at all,
in hard or rocky soils. The advantage of lever-type digger is
that it can dig a deep hole which is narrower than that dug by
the clamshell diggers, because they need a hole dug as wide as
the handle spread required to close the clamshell.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">EARTH AUGER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Landscape auger, bulb drill</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Earth Auger, Daffodrill<sup>TM</sup> </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Large steel spiral drill bit, 18&quot; to
24&quot; long and 1-1/2&quot; to 2-1/2&quot; in diameter,
designed to fit into a standard power drill (both 1/4&quot; and
3/8&quot; sizes). Professional models are made for 1/2&quot;
drills. Other models are made which are long, open-sided
cylinders rather than spirals.</p>

<p>USE: Drilling small holes in ground for direct access to roots
(to install a root feeder, take a soil sample, fertilize, or
apply a hose for soaking a newly planted tree or shrub), for
installing large stakes, or for planting bulbs and seedlings, in
which case the 2-1/2&quot; wide model is used.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: This is the occasion for a cordless drill to shine,
due to the dearth of electrical outlets in your typical garden.
Heavy clay or thick sod require larger, heavier models. Watch
your hole depth when planting bulbs.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Definitely a help when planting very large
quantities of bulbs or small seedlings.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">PICK</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Clay pick, railroad pick, pickaxe</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Heavy metal, slightly curved blade from 16 to
20&quot; long, with about a 30&quot; long wooden (hickory or ash)
or fiberglass handle attached in the middle. One end of the pick
blade is pointed while the other has a 1&quot; to 2&quot; chisel
head. When the chisel-end is a few inches wide, it may be called
a <i>pick-a-hoe (&quot;pick and hoe&quot;), </i>which is sold
with a short handle.</p>

<p>USE: Breaking up hard ground or working rocky or root-laden
areas. Once the area has been broken up by the pick, it is easier
to pick up with a shovel or work with a fork. Picks are also
helpful in reclaiming long-abandoned urban gardens, some of which
may even have solidified coal cinder piles. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Picks can be used by swinging the tool in a circular
motion at the side of the body, or in an over-the-head motion in
which the tool lines up with the center of the body on the down
stroke. Allow the weight of the tool to complete the motion. This
requires less of your energy and strength, because the weight of
the tool does most of the work.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Find a pick that is comfortable for you to lift
over your head. If the pick is too heavy, just lifting it can be
tiring. Picks are not indispensible gardening tools, but for
larger gardens and some urban gardens they can be worth the
investment.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">MATTOCK </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Pick mattock</i></p>

<p><i>Cutter mattock</i></p>

<p><i>Garden mattock</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Pick mattock: </i>Trencher pick </p>

<p><i>Cutter mattock: </i>Grubbing mattock, garden cutter mattock</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Sort of a combination serious <b>hoe (Chapter 6) </b>and
<b>ax (Chapter 7) </b>or <b>pick (above)</b>, but with wider,
thicker, duller blades perpendicular to one another, and heavier
wooden handles, larger at the tool end. The handle is fitted to
the blade through a round hole, or <i>eye</i>, in the center. To
further confuse things, a really wide-bladed <i>adze</i>,
normally used for shaping large wooden timbers, is sometimes
called an <i>adze hoe </i>or<i> grubbing mattock, </i>and
resembles a model which is rarely available: the <i>single-bladed
mattock.</i></p>

<p><i>Pick mattock: </i>Pick on one end, heavy-duty hoe on other.
About 5 lbs. A smaller, 2lb model is called a Pick-a-Hoe.</p>

<p><i>Cutter mattock: </i>Ax on one end, heavy-duty hoe on other.
About 3-1/2 to 5lbs.</p>

<p><i>Garden mattock: </i>Lightweight version of a cutter
mattock.</p>

<p>USE: Breaking up hard ground and grubbing out roots and rock.
Very helpful tool for digging trenches when laying electrical or
water lines in a garden, or for removing tree stumps. Mattocks
and <b>picks (above)</b> are used for many of the same jobs, but
the pick is more useful in initially breaking up very hard soils
while mattocks are more useful in lifting rocks and cutting
through roots. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Swing as you would a pick, described above. Mattocks
replace axes and hatchets on jobs which would quickly dull them,
such as cutting roots that are surrounded by soil.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If you are gardening in a long-neglected garden
where the soil is very hard or there is hardpan (a soil that is
so hard water can not drain through), a mattock is indispensible.
The lightweight garden mattock should suffice for normal use.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">CROWBAR</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Prybar, pinch bar, axel rod, curb-setter, bull
prick, bar</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Long, straight high carbon steel bar, about
3/4&quot; in diameter and about 4' or 5' long. Approximately
two-thirds of the bar is round with the working (lower) third
square and tipped with either a wedge point (triangular) or pinch
point (like that on a chisel). Crowbars weigh either 12 or 18
lbs.</p>

<p>NOTE: This name is often used incorrectly for a <i>gooseneck
wrecking bar</i>, which has a curved end and is from 18&quot; to
36&quot; long.</p>

<p>USE: Prying large rocks or root-balled trees out of holes, or
just manouvering large stones for fences or curbs (or removing
chunks of busted up sidewalks). It can also be driven into hard
soil to start a hole, whether for digging or for inserting a
tomoto stake or bean pole. Some people even use a crowbar to
measure the temperature of a compost pile (left in the center of
a large, &quot;ripe&quot; one, the tip will heat up to the point
where you can't hold onto it). </p>

<p>USE TIP: When using as a lever on the side of a hole, put a
large, sturdy piece of scrap wood at the edge of the hole to use
as a fulcrum; the bar will otherwise sink right into the soil.
Heavier models work best in hard soils and clay, with the weight
doing much of the work for you.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: These things don't age. They make for nice buys at
flea markets or auctions.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">WHEEL GOODS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">ABOUT WHEEL GOODS </a></h2>

<p>The choice between a cart and a wheelbarrow is largely one of
personal preference, or feel, though the cart is a bit less
manoeverable and needs more room than a wheelbarrow. On the other
hand, there are more innovative features to be found in a myriad
of makes and models of carts than with wheelbarrows, which remain
simple. Here is another tool category where it is quite
worthwhile to buy the better quality item, or else you will need
to replace it. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">GARDEN CART </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Yard cart, utility cart</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A cubish, deep-sided container
(&quot;bucket&quot;) on two wheels, around 20&quot; by 40&quot;
by a foot high, with a metal loop handle, making it larger and
deeper than a <b>wheelbarrow (below)</b>. Some wooden carts are
open on the handle end, and the front end is a board that can be
removed for dumping loads. Others can tilt on their axles for
easy dumping. Some are designed with an angled front which lies
on the ground when tilted down for easy loading. Capacity ranges
from 4 to over 13 cubic feet, taking over 300 lbs. with ease, and
carrying up to 450 lbs. A hybdrid version is available which
looks like a wheelbarrow with two wheels and a single handle,
called a <i>yard buggy</i>, and a folding model is available.</p>

<p>USE: Hauling heavier and larger loads than most wheelbarrows,
even 250lbs easily, but because of their double wheels they are
not quite as maneuverable as wheelbarrows. Tilting feature allows
for easier unloading and loading than with wheelbarrows, which
always remain above ground level.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Position loads in carts closer to the front of the
bucket, balancing them over the wheels to make hauling easier.
Keep carts clean and bearings oiled.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Metal carts and metal parts of wooden carts should
be made of heavy gauge steel that is well-protected from rust.
The hybrid wheelbarrow/cart dumps easily like a wheelbarrow but
is easier to balance a heavy load, like a cart. Look for large
(20&quot;), spoked wheels with pneumatic tires, a front panel for
unloading, top grade, exterior stained plywood, and a sturdy,
adjustable handle. And choose the size that is right for
you--there is a range.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">WHEELBARROW</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A shallow, scooped container (&quot;tray&quot;)
about 2' by 2-1/2' made of wood, metal (assembled or one piece,
seamless aluminum or 18 gauge steel), or heavy plastic
(high-desnsity polyethylene), attached to a single wheel. Two
long handles made either of metal or 2-inch square wood are used
for pushing the wheelbarrow around the garden. Wheels may be
either inflatable or solid rubber, or wooden with a steel
surface. A deep model with heavier, wider supports, a sturdier
wheel, and higher sides is called a <i>contractor's </i>or<i>
concrete wheelbarrow. </i>Sizes are measured in cubic feet
(helpful when you plan to use this for mixing cement); 3 or 4-1/2
cubic feet is a typical small size; the deep models hold as much
as 6-1/2 cubic feet. </p>

<p>USE: Moving heavy loads around the garden, though not as large
and heavy as can be moved with a <b>garden cart (above)</b>. The
single wheel makes for easier maneuvering and dumping. An
essential piece of equipment for any larger garden, and one that
should last for years. Deep models are used for mixing concrete
as well.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep wheelbarrows clean when not in use. Do not allow
water to stand in metal wheelbarrows, as this might cause them to
rust. Oil wheels for easier movement. The front brace that
connects the two handles immediately in front of the wheel can
catch on the ground as you move the barrow along, especially if
you hold the handles high and are moving over irregular
terrain--and if it does, you and it will come to an immediate and
painful stop. Be careful.</p>

<p>Watch out for overloading: if the load shifts, you might
injure yourself trying to save it. Better to let it go or just
set it down whenever it starts to become unwieldy.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The better wheelbarrows are made of one piece of
heavy steel with extra braces on the legs, which are set wide
apart for stability. They also have heavy wooden handles that are
attached with countersunk bolts. Check the wheelbarrow out for
feel and balance. Wide, inflatable tires give the smoothest ride
and are a bit easier to use, but can flatten out or puncture
under heavy use. Wooden barrows with wooden wheels are great
looking but may be a bit rough to use. Plastic models are
maintenance-free, of course. In all types, look for good bracing
on the legs.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">CULTIVATING, RAKING, AND WEEDING TOOLS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">About All Tools: </a></h2>

<p>As with <b>shovels (Chapter 5),</b> cultivating, raking, and
weeding tools are generally made either with a tang-and-ferrule
style or the solid-socket style, though smaller tools are also
made as one piece. The tang-and-ferrule style is not as strong as
the others, but while tools of this design which are intended for
light use may work fine, generally the better-quality tools which
are built to endure do not use it (see explanation and
illustration at the beginning of Chapter 5, <b>About Digging Tool
Durability</b>).</p>

<p>Metal shaft handles that end with a grip at a slght angle are
generally more comfortable to use. The British term for this is <i>cranked</i>
handle. Hand tools should be designed so that there is clearance
for your knuckles when working close to the soil, so check your
angles carefully. When investigating tools with interchangeable
short and long handles, be sure to check the balance and feel of
the tools with both handles. Some sacrifice balance for this
convenience.</p>

<p>Remember that metal tools should always be wiped dry after
use, and coated with oil from an oily rag or an aerosol spray,
and that their moving parts should be kept lubricated. Cutting
edges should be filed sharp from time to time.</p>

<p>Some individual power tools can be duplicated by attachments
to multiuse tools; these are not discussed here but are indeed
available.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">HOES, CULTIVATORS, AND TILLERS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT CULTIVATING TOOLS: </a></h2>

<p>Veteran vegetable gardeners hold cultivatingthe loosening of
soil around plantsto be one of the most important gardening
tasks. Regular cultivating opens up the soil to allow water to
reach the roots easily, destroys small weeds, or prevents weeds
from getting established in the first place. </p>

<p>There seems to be more tools sold in garden centers
specifically designed to help with this garden task than any
other. It is an ancient job that has provided much grist for the
mills of inventors and marketing folks, resulting in a wide array
of inventions with names that suggest cultivation which play on
the basic designs described here. Some are good, some will
disappear after one season, and all are touted as the absolute
best. What works for one gardener might not for the next. One
thing is sure: there is no one &quot;right&quot; cultivating
tool.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">GARDENING HOES </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Garden hoe (common, standard)</i></p>

<p><i>Eye hoe</i></p>

<p><i>Onion hoe</i></p>

<p><i>Warren hoe</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Garden hoe: </i>Common hoe, general gardening hoe, draw
hoe, mounding hoe, digging hoe, nursery hoe </p>

<p><i>Eye hoe: </i>Scovil hoe</p>

<p><i>Onion Hoe: </i>Square Top Onion Hoe, nursery hoe, colinear
hoe, beet hoe</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, flat metal blade attached at an angle70<sup>o</sup>
is considered idealto a long wooden handle, typically 50&quot;
to 70&quot; long. The blades of hoes may be square, rectangular,
or triangular in shape, depending upon the type of hoe. The edge
may be quite sharp, but not always; corners may be sharp or
rounded. The blade is attached to the handle via a long, curved
shank called a <i>gooseneck</i> or <i>swanneck</i>, and is held
either by the tang-and-ferrule or solid-socket method. <b>Grubbing
hoes, </b>or<b> mattocks (Chap. 5), </b>are sometimes considered
types of hoes, too. There are <b>wheeled hoes</b> that look like
small plows, but they are not commonly found.</p>

<p>There are many manufacturers and each may call a slightly
different-sized hoe by a different name (see above), and not with
much consistency. A typical grouping of specialized hoes that
resemble the homeowner type of garden hoe but are a bit larger
would include <i>Southern</i> (also a general category for all of
these), <i>Cotton, Light Cotton, Cotton Chopper, Barn, Field,
Southern Meadow, Blackland, </i>and<i> Planter hoes.</i></p>

<p>NOTE: Although these hoes can be used for a variety of jobs,
including heavy weeding, hoes especially designed for weeding are
listed below, under <b>Weeding Hoes. </b></p>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Garden hoe:</i><b> </b>Rectangular blade measuring about
6&quot; wide and 4-3/4&quot; high, often with a rounded or
scalloped top. Garden hoes are the most common ones sold in
garden centers and hardware stores. A slightly larger version,
about 7&quot; wide and not as high, and with an angular, tapered
top, is called a <i>nurseryman's </i>or <i>nursery</i>, or <i>beet
hoe.</i> There is also the <i>floral hoe</i>, a narrow,
lightweight model suitable for people who don't want the standard
weight, or for children. Some models have holes in the blade for
the soil to flow through to help pulverize it, or for mixing
cement (<i>mason's </i>or<i> mortar hoe</i>). An even larger
version, 12&quot; wide, is used as a <i>raised bed builder.</i></p>

<p><i>Eye hoe: </i>The heavy-duty hoe. Has a short, thick handle
inserted into an eye in the blade, sort of like a mattock or ax,
and is made in a number of similar but slightly different
patterns: two normal- looking models, the <i>American </i>(7-8&quot;
wide, 6-1/2 to 7&quot; deep, available in small, medium and large
models, all with curved shoulders)<i>, </i>and the<i>Scovil </i>(6-1/2&quot;
to 9&quot; wide, 5-1/2 to 7-1/2&quot; deep, with square shoulders
and either flat or slightly curved--<i>Scovil</i> is an old
Japanese brand name which may soon be a thing of the past);<i> </i>and
more specialized versions such as the larger <i>grape hoe </i>(7&quot;
wide, 10-1/2&quot; deep, with almost no shoulders, developed for
working in vineyards, and with an oval eye), the narrow<i>Grub
hoe</i> (4-1/2&quot; wide by 7-3/4&quot; deep, with square
shoulders, the heaviest, for compacted or stoney soil), and
others which vary from brand to brand, such as the lighter<i>
Southern Meadow hoe</i>. All are imported, mostly from Austria
and Japan. Handles are 54&quot; long, except for the grape hoe,
which is 41&quot; long.</p>

<p><i>Onion hoe:</i><b> </b>Has a wider and higher, narrower
blade than the common garden hoe, above, running about 7&quot;
wide and 2&quot; high. The blade is sharpened on the bottom and
the sides, allowing it to be used in two directions. Nursery and
beet hoes, according to some, are simply garden hoes with angular
sides, like large onion hoes. Available in a hand-sized version,
too.</p>

<p><i>Warren hoe:</i><b> </b>A pointed blade bent in the center
with two smaller points, or ears, near the handle. </p>

<p>Manufacturers are always trying to invent a better hoe, and
unusual and specialized variations on the old theme appear all
the time with names that may reflect their function or their
manufacturer, especially with the weeding hoes noted below. </p>

<p>USE: Basically moving small quantities of soil when planting
(hilling and tilling) and cultivating soil, but also chopping
small weeds just below the soil surface, and very light digging.
The broad head is good for moving or tamping down soil. This is
the gardener's most basic tool: break the earth and you can
garden. Everything else is extra. Used most often by drawing the
hoe toward you, hence the name, &quot;draw hoe.&quot; The various
types with specialized uses are noted as follows:</p>

<p><i>Floral hoe: </i>working around flowers in beds and other
confined spaces; general light weight use for gardeners who find
other models too heavy.</p>

<p><i>Eye hoe: </i>Serious chopping of roots or compacted soil,
agricultural and heavy-duty farming work. Subtle differences of
models due in large part to tradition--some by crop, others by
ethnic group.</p>

<p><i>Onion hoe: </i>Cultivating in confined spaces, such as
between closely planted vegetable crops. Can be used to disturb
the soil just under the surface, cutting small weeds, or for just
skimming the surface of the soil when control is very important.</p>

<p><i>Warren hoe:</i> Creating rows and furrows. The smaller ears
can be used for filling in furrows after the seeds have been laid
down. Also good for digging up weeds.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Only when digging is there a need to use a chopping
motion with a hoe; otherwise, just pull it toward you and under
the hardened, unworked soil. And keep the inside edge sharp.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: If you can find them, hoes with solid-socket
handles are better buys for the money than the comon
tang-and-ferrule method, although the heavy-duty <i>eye hoes</i>
are the strongest. Look for forged construction, not welded. The
onion hoe is one of the best all-purpose hoes available, and is a
wiser choice over the common garden hoe. As with other tools with
long handles<b> (see shovels, Chapter 5)</b> the grain of the
wood should be tight and run lengthwise. Longer handled tools are
more comfortable to use--they reduce the need to bend--than
shorter ones. The head should be the same piece as the tang
(forged) or else solidly welded; avoid spot-welded hoes.
Replaceble blades are available for some of the more unusual
designs. In hand-sized hoes, look for a comfortable shape in the
handle, such as an hour-glass design, and good balance. Some of
the heavier, more specialized hoes are difficult to find in
stores but are carried in the professional-oriented catalogs.
There seems to be a hoe designed for each hoeing task.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">Hand cultivators </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Three-prong cultivator</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Commonly three but sometimes more prongs attached
to a short wooden or plastic handle. Tines may be flat and
pointed, or round, or with angular <i>harrow-toothed tips</i>,
shaped like arrowheads. Head is attached to handle in either the
solid-socket or tang-and-ferrule method, although some tools are
made that can snap into long or short handles as you want. Same
variety as with long-handled models described below. Prongs may
be spring-tooth type, which means they are somewhat flexible.</p>

<p><i>Grubber</i> is used by some manufacturers to describe a
slightly narrower or lighter weight version with no special tips,
more like a simple <i>claw</i>; however, this is incorrect: <i>grubbers
</i>are used to dig out roots, and are either knife-like weeders
(sometimes called a <i>soil knife </i>or<i> Farmer's Weeder</i>)
or types of <b>mattocks (Chapter 5)</b>, called <i>grubber hoes</i>.
</p>

<p>USE: Hand cultivators are indispensable to gardening, just
like <b>hand-held trowels (Chapter 5)</b>. They are particularly
useful when gardening in raised beds, containers, and in terrace
gardens, especially when working a conditioner or fertilizer into
the soil or weeding next to established plants.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When weeding with a cultivator, be sure to get under
the roots of the weed. Clean with an oiled rag for storage.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Hand cultivators should have sharp tines to dig
into the soil, a comfortable grip, and a solid-socket
construction handle. Using handles that are too small for you may
cause blisters. Those that snap into long handles as well may not
be well-balanced, so check them out thoroughly. Tines should be
angled slightly back toward the handle and extend a bit below the
line of the handle, enabling you to cultivate the soil by just
pulling the tool toward you and be spared having to jam it down,
with your fingers hitting the ground each time it enters the
soil.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">HAND FORK </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hand-held fork, flower fork, weed fork, digging
fork (incorrect)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Head of 3 or 4 straight, flat metal tines
attached either to wooden or plastic handles, or a single piece
of cast or stamped metal such as light-weight aluminum.
Hand-sized to a maximum of 20&quot; long, though some
manufacturers offer <i>long-handled forks</i>, with 2' or 3'
long, lightweight handles for use by those gardeners who have
trouble bending over, or by children. </p>

<p>USE: Cultivating in confined spaces, such as small gardens or
in containers.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Use as you would a <b>garden fork (Chapter 5).</b></p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Though popular in other countries, hand forks are
not considered an indispensable garden tool in this country. This
is probably because there is little you can do with hand fork
that cannot be done as well with a good trowel. Though some
manufacturers make these of lesser quality than their full-sized
forks, there is no reason for this. Get something just as sturdy
and comfortable.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">Long-handled cultivator </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Tined hoe, garden cultivator</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Similar to the hand cultivator, above, and
usually with three, four or five curved tines and a handle 4 or 5
feet long. Heads are forged or welded, and the tines may have
wide, diamond-shaped, harrowtooth-type tips. The handle is
attached either by tang-and-ferrule or with a solid-socket. A <i>hook
</i>is a slightly larger and heavier version intended for
specialized farming uses, such as harvesting potatoes (called,
unsurprisingly, a<i> potato hook </i>or <i>potato hoe</i>),
spreading manure, removing stones and roots, refuse (called a <i>refuse
hook)</i>, and so on. Some models have a U-shaped blade, like an <b>oscillating
hoe (below) </b>attached, and are called a <i>culivator/weeder</i>.
Many brands are now made with handles that snap on and off, and
can be interchanged with short, hand-held handles as you want.</p>

<p>USE: Excellent general cultivating and weeding tool which can
be used without stooping.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Easier to use if you pull the tool toward yourself.
Because the tines of this tool are sharp, you may want to store
it with corks on the sharp points. Clean with an oiled cloth
before storing.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Among serious gardeners this is an indispensable
tool. Look for a tool with nice weight and balance; forged tools
are stronger but welded ones will do in lightly packed soil.
Handles attached with a solid-socket are more durable than
others. Hooks are often a better buy, because they are heavier
and bigger, and some gardeners prefer them for general garden
use. Those with snap-on handles may not be well-balanced, so try
them out before buying.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">Wheeled cultivator </a></h2>

<p>TYPES: </p>

<p><i>High wheel cultivator</i></p>

<p><i>Spiked wheel cultivator</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Spiked wheel cultivator: </i>Hand rotary cultivator (small
version), rotary cultivator, star harrow, spin tiller, soil
miller</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: </p>

<p><i>High wheel cultivator: </i>Sort of a miniature plow,
designed to be pushed by you rather than pulled by mules. The
larger models have wheels as big as 22&quot; in diameter and
wide, bicycle-like handles, while the smaller ones have a smaller
wheel (about 8&quot;) and a single shaft with one handle. Both
have culitvating tines, weeding knives, or plow blades attached
just behind the wheel. </p>

<p><i>Spiked wheel cultivator: </i>A popular design among major
manufactuers is a set of tined wheels with a long, straight
handle. Each brand is slightly different, but two of the more
popular brands are the Weasel<sup> </sup>and the CrumblerTM.,
which are about 6&quot; wide. Others are as wide as a rake
(10&quot;) with as many as 16 revolving, spiked disks. Some
models include an attachment that resembles the U-shaped blade on
an <b>oscillating hoe (above)</b> which is dragged through the
soil surface so it can be broken up by the tines. Others have
only two wheels with a foot-long handle, for use in containers.
These are all actually miniature <b>tillers (below).</b></p>

<p>Large models resemble an old rotary lawn mower, with a single
cross-bar handle. Instead of a leading wheel, there is a
barrel-like contraption with pointed blades attached. Cultivating
blades can be attached behind this spiked drum.</p>

<p>USE: Breaking up, aerating, and mixing soil in place when
preparing seed beds, or for mixing in fertilizer or peat.
Particularly useful for laying out long garden rows or breaking
ground for a new and large garden site. Functions somewhere
between a hand cultivator and a motorized tiller (below). Also
offers an alternative for those gardeners who find it physically
difficult to handle a regular cultivator, which (like a hoe) you
have to lift up and down in a hacking motion. These only require
a push-pull motion, or just a push or a pull motion in the case
of the larger models.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Wheeled cultivators are somewhat less work than hand
cultivators. Clean well after using with an oiled cloth.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: High-wheel cultivators can usually be purchased
for under $50.00. If you garden in long rows or hills, and you
soil is fairly loose, it might be worth looking into one. Try to
find one with a self-cleaning design.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">POWER TILLERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Rotary tiller, rototiller </p>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Front-tine </i>or <i>front-end tiller </i>(tines in front
of wheels)</p>

<p><i>Rear-tine, </i>or <i>rear-end tiller</i>(tines to rear of
wheels),</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A gas or electric motor attached to a tined wheel
or a series of tined wheels, with long, straight or plow-type
handles. Some lightweight models have reciprocating blades rather
than rotating tines. The smallest tillers have only one or two
blade wheels, and the larger tillers have four or more; small
electric models may be called <i>power cultivators, </i>or <i>tiller/cultivators.
</i>Some models come with special blades that can furrow, aerate,
de-thatch, or make raised planting rows, or with attachments for
snow removal. Electric tillers generally have a single shaft or
handle, and the tined wheels are below the motor, while
gas-powered models tend to be bigger and usually have two regular
rubber wheels. Power tillers come in a wide range of sizes up to
five horsepower, and dig at adjustable depths up to 8&quot;. </p>

<p><i>Front-tined tillers (gas powered):</i><b> </b>Gasoline
motor on top of tine wheels (the parts that do the cultivating)
with rubber stabilizing wheels behind, and plow-type handles.
Tined wheels propel the machine. Many are 6 to 9 inches
wide--smaller than rear-tine tillers.</p>

<p><i>Rear-tined tillers (gas powered):</i><b> </b>Largest power
tiller, with blade wheels located at the rear of the machine,
often propelled by the load-bearing front wheels. Motor is above
front wheels. </p>

<p>Tillers come with three basic kinds of tines or tined wheels: <i>Bolo</i>,
which are sort of a universal design for deep tilling; <i>Slasher</i>,
for thick vegetation and roots in soft ground; and <i>Pick and
Chisel</i>, or<i> Spring steel</i>, for general use on hard,
rocky ground.</p>

<p>USE: Tilling or cultivating medium or large gardens (breaking
up the soil) when the job is too hard to do by hand. Electric and
front-tine tillers are more suited to easier-to work soils, such
as in established beds, gardens and soils that have been
previously cultivated, and for regular cultivation prior to
seeding or for working in soil amendments. Electric tillers are
for the easiest jobs. Rear-tined tillers are for areas that may
never have been tilled; heavier machines of this type can
cultivate even hard-packed, rocky soils that the smaller
front-tined models cannot handle.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Be sure the ground is moist enough to work, but not
too moist to support the weight of the tiller. Always check the
oil before operating--many mechanical problems stem from not
doing this. Do not attempt to till soil with tall weeds on
itthey will only wrap themselves around the tiller tines. Cut
weeds before tilling. Remember that this is a powerful machine
which can be dangerous if not used carefully. Don't over-oil the
blades afer use. Use it several times a year, spring, summer, and
fall, turning in compost and and green manures (grass-like plants
grown only to be turned into the soil) as well as for planting
and cultivating. Don't expect a small machine to do heavy-duty
work.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Shop around and rent one or two (and try out your
neighbors' tillers), because this is one of the more expensive
garden tools you can buy. Rear-tined tillers can cost twice front
tined models. Determine if your space is large enough to justify
the expense of a tiller. In the past, front-tine tillers were for
smaller gardens and rear-tine for larger ones, but many of models
now overlap a bit. In the larger models, the rear-tine tillers
are still easier to control. Rear-tined tillers are regular
workhorses, doing more and generally remaining easier to use, and
their wheels do not pass over and compact freshly tilled soil.
Light, small tillers are great for churning up the top layer of
soil to combat weeds. On any model, see how easy it is to turn.
Buy the machine that can take all of the extra attachments you
might need. The capability of any tiller is determined largely by
the size of the engine and the weight of the machine. The engine
should be almost directly over the tines of a front-tine tiller
to aid the digging. Look for best quality, high-carbon steel
tines that are adjustable for width, and for chain drives,
easily-operated controls, a shielded muffler, adjustable handles
and tines, and try to see how much noise and vibration the motor
produces. Rear-tine tillers should have hinged tine covers for
safety. If you are using the machine only once a year, consider
renting one instead of buying. And if you send away for
information, beware: the manufacturers try to outdo each other
with volumes upon volumes of brochures. They almsot claim to have
replaced the hoe and the shovel.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">WEEDERS AND WEEDING HOES </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC5">ABOUT WEEDERS: </a></h2>

<p>Weeds are the plague of most gardens and gardeners. The
pervasiveness of weeds leads to the presence of an enormous
variety of weeders in garden centers throughout the country.
These products promise to rid the garden of weeds through
prodding, poking, digging, scraping, cutting, slicing, lifting,
and more. Probably as much energy and thought has been put into
designing a better weeder as that expended for a better mouse
trap. What follows are but a few of the weeding tools you will
find on the shelves of garden centers, as new ones come out each
season. </p>

<p>When using any of these tools, keep in mind that sharp blades
make for more effective weeding. Also, once an area has been
weeded, allow the disturbed weeds to dry in the sun before
removing and composting. Hand-held weeders are designed for small
or raised-bed gardens.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">Asparagus Knife </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Fishtail weeder, garden weeder (incorrect),
weeder (too vague), dandelion digger (incorrect-is larger model,
below) <b>[Please add many brand names]</b></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A metal shaft about 14&quot; long with a flat,
V-slotted fishtail head and a wooden or plasic handle, like a big
screwdriver, but the shaft is slightly bent and the head has
sharp cutting edges. As the name suggests, this was originally
used to cut the tender shoots of asparagus, but it has become a
popular weeding tool. A larger version, over 3' long, is the <b>dandelion
digger (below). </b>Another, rarer version has three V-slots,
instead of one, for pulling, rather than prying weeds out.</p>

<p>USE: Designed to reach into the soil and cut off or lift
deep-rooted weeds with little disturbance to the area where they
are growing, a particular concern with lawn weeds such as
dandelion and dock.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Insert the tool a few inches away from the weed you
wish to lift and at a slight angle. Keep the points and cutting
edges sharp for better cutting. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Buy a solid, well-constructed asparagus knife. A
colorful handle prevent loss when you put it down in the lawn.</p>

<hr size="4">

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">Cape Cod Weeder </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hand tool with a long necked, L-shaped metal
blade attached to a wooden handle. The short part has the cutting
edge, and is at an angle. Another, similar version is the <i>crack
weeder</i> or <i>joint scraper,</i> in which the cutting edge is
aligned with, not at an angle to, the neck. This is sometimes
called a <i>pin point weeder</i>, or confusingly referred to as a
<i>weeder knife.</i></p>

<p>USE: Weeding in confined areas, such as around seedlings and
perrenials. The angle of the blade makes it possible to reach
under a plant's top growth in order weed very close to the stems.
The crack weeder is just good for going after weeds or moss in
the space between bricks, stones, or slabs.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Pull the blade toward you just under the surface of
the soil. Keep blade sharp for easier weeding. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Because the blade of the Cape Cod weeder curves to
the left, this is primarily a tool for right-handed gardeners. It
would not appear difficult to manufacture this in a left-handed
version, but none seem to be on the market. Crack weeders are not
as efficient as you might want, because they can rarely get under
the larger weeds.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">HOT BED WEEDER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Ideal weeder</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Short-handled C-shaped, 3/4&quot; wide, flat
blade, with all three edges sharpened. </p>

<p>USE: Weeding in tight areas, such as greenhouses--hence the
name.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Because the hot bed version has cutting edges on
three sides and straight or curved parts, it can be used in three
positions, making it slightly more versatile than the <b>Cape Cod
weeder (above)</b>. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Versatile, but not great with large weeds.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">Dandelion Digger </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Lawn weeder</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Just a larger version of the <b>asparagus knife
(above)</b> with a fishtail tip, but including the handle it is
over a yard long. The handle is attached with a tang-and-ferrule
design. Another version is the <i>yard arm weeder</i>, a
yard-long handle with two long slightly curved, barbed hooks on
the tip, sold under a variety of trade names with a play on the
word <i>handy</i>, or under the brand name <i>Weedigger</i>.
Other brands use a small fork and fulcrum design.</p>

<p>USE: Removing deep-rooted weeds, especially dandelions, and
other garden debris without bending over or leaving your
wheelchair.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Same as for <b>asparagus knife, (above).</b></p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The length of the handle provides more leverage
than is possible with the asparagus knife, but the tool works the
same. If you have trouble with the leverage in the asparagus
knife, this is a good alternate.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">HEART HOE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Single-tine cultivator, finger hoe, 1-prong
cultivator</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hand tool, generally with an 12-18&quot; wooden
handle, with one large C-shaped, pointed claw with a small
heart-shaped blade tip. Not unlike a miniature double-edged
plowshare. Also available with a 5' long handle, usually with a
large C-shape with a diameter of about 9&quot;.</p>

<p>USE: Cultivating small gardens and widnow boxes where precise
control is needed. Extremely versatile tool. Narrow blade allows
for working in tight, difficult to reach spaces, and curved neck
lets you lift weeds out of the soil. Does not mix up levels of
the soil unless you intend for it do so, making it sort of an <i>aerator</i>.
</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Actually quite useful in a wide variety of
situations.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">The Original Weeder </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Magic weeder, spring-tooth weeder</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Resembles a<b> hand-held cultivator (above)</b>
with three round curved prongs or tines, but the middle tine has
a curl or spring in it. The tines fit directly into a wooden
handle either 5, 14, or 32&quot; long. Venerable design which has
been around for years.</p>

<p>USE: Hand weeding and cultivating. The spring in the middle
prong gives it an added flexibility and makes it more effective
than plain versions.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The plain wooden handle makes it easy to lose in the
garden, so paint it a vivid color.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Any tool that has remained popular over such a
long period of time as this one has got to be one of the best.
Versatile, easy to use, and effective.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">Uoo &amp; Vee Weeders </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: &quot;U&quot; &amp; &quot;V&quot; Weeders</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A short metal blade in the shape of a U or a V
with a plastic, hand-sized handle. Lightweight (4 oz!) and less
than a foot long. Made of spring steel.</p>

<p>USE: Hand cultivating or surface weeding around crops, and
thinning vegetables and plants. They work by cutting roots just
below the surface of the soil. </p>

<p>USE TIP: </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Inexpensive weeding tools which are easy to use on
young weeds. They are quite often used by commercial growers,
which is a good recommendation for the home gardener, but some
people find them a little difficult to handle.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">WEEDING HOES </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Cavex</i></p>

<p><i>Dutch</i></p>

<p><i>Oscillating stirrup </i></p>

<p><i>Rockery </i></p>

<p><i>Scuffle</i></p>

<p><i>Swoe</i></p>

<p><i>Weeding, </i>or<i> Triangular </i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p><i>Dutch: </i>Dutch scuffle hoe, push-pull weeder, push hoe,
thrust hoe</p>

<p><i>Weeding hoe:</i> Rabbit ears, planting hoe, 3-prong
cultivator</p>

<p><i>Oscillating stirrup: </i>Hula hoe, oscillating hoe, action
hoe, scuffle hoe, pendulum weeder, stirrup hoe</p>

<p><i>Scuffle:</i> Glide groom hoe, push-pull hoe, root-cutting
hoe, Dutch hoe (incorrect)</p>

<p><i>Swoe:</i> Shuffle hoe, scuffle hoe, cultivation hoe</p>

<p>NOTE: Almost all multi-edged weeding hoes which use a
push-pull motion to cut weeds just below the surface (at their
roots) might be called <i>scuffle hoes.</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Long-handled tool with metal blade of various
designs, with sharp edges on two, three, or four sides, or all
around in the case of a curved or round hoe. Designed to be
pushed, pulled, and moved from side to side, as opposed to merely
pulled, or drawn, through the soil, like the <b>gardening hoes,
above. </b>Many different brands make similar items under
slightly different names--this is an area of intense competition,
artisanal ingenuity, and nuanced designs--all of which is to say
that is hard to pin down all the various types and names here.
And most can cultivate as well as weed, too, just to add to the
confusion.</p>

<p><i>Cavex:</i><b> </b>Sharply curved or rounded blade. </p>

<p><i>Dutch: </i>Open triangular blade, with a cutting edge on
the inside.</p>

<p><i>Oscillating stirrup: </i>Four-edged blade that looks like a
stirrup, hinged so it moves back and forth when pushed and pulled
through the soil. This rocking motion gives it the name
&quot;hula hoe.&quot; A relatively new design introduced in 1958.</p>

<p><i>Rockery: </i>British hand tool with a forged, 4&quot; wide
semicircular blade attached to a 7&quot; handle by a curved metal
shank. Deisgned for use in small, tight areas, such as in rock
gardens, which the British insist on calling
&quot;rockeries&quot; for some reason.</p>

<p><i>Scuffle: </i>Comes in the widest variety of blade shapes.
Blades can be triangular, curved, diamond shaped, or rectangular,
with sharp edges on several sides. Some variations have special
names, such as <i>Floral</i> (smaller), <i>Garden</i> (large
rectangular), and<i> Orange Grove</i> (triangular). One brand's
version is simply called a <i>&quot;Crescent hoe.&quot;</i></p>

<p><i>Swoe: </i>Odd rectangular, almost triangular blade, sharp
on three sides in either a hand-weeding version with foot-long
handle, or a longer, stand-up version that looks like a golf
club. The blade of either model is at an angle to the handle,
attached by a long tang. True Temper calls their hand version the
<i>Swoe Jr.</i> and the stand-up version <i>Swoe Sr.</i>
Basically a modified Scuffle hoe.</p>

<p><i>Weeding: </i>Double-headed blade. One side resembles the
blade of a narrow garden hoe, while the other is made up of two
or three long prongs or points, or a triangular blade. The prongs
break up crusty soil and rip up weeds such as dicondra. Another
version is triangularly shaped, with no ears, called a <i>triangular
hoe, </i>and if it is on the end of a long, curved neck, it is
called a <i>Gooseneck hoe. </i>Still another version is the <i>Southern
Belle,</i> with a rectangular blade on one side and a triangular
blade on the other, sort of like a <b>mattock (Chapter 5). </b>In
fact, it might be called a <i>mattock hoe.</i> Hand-sized
versions are available, too. </p>

<p>USE: Cutting off and removing small weeds in frequently
cultivated beds before they become established, especially those
found just below the surface. The multi-edged design allows for
cutting in any direction; the large oscillating models work well
in heavy soil while the basic scuffle designs work best in light,
sandy soils and under mulches--in fact, they don't disturb mulch
as they work. Hand-held models are useful in cold frames and
greenhouses. Swoes (and some of the other models depending on the
gardener) can easily be used for tradtional hoeing chores such as
making furrows and general cultivation. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep all blade edges sharp. Dry off tool after use,
and do not leave it lying about--someone might step on the
business end and get clunked in the face with the handle.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A good &quot;second&quot; hoe to have, in addition
to a regular gardening hoe. As for which type, this is really a
case of personal preference, though of course the smaller blades
are handier in confined gardens. The variety of designs reflect
the industry-wide effort to develop the ideal weeder. Oscillating
hoes work just below the surface, and are a little bit less work
because less soil is being displaced. The swoe is available in
stainless steel, for truly serious weeding. Always look for
one-piece forged blades and necks instead of spot-welded ones.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">WEEDER/ROOTER</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Prong hoe</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A small hoe with two heads: one that resembles a
narrow garden hoe, and the other that has 2, 3, or 4 small
prongs. Made as a hand-sized tool as well as with a long handle. </p>

<p>USE: Particularly well-suited for weeding around transplants
and seedlings, but also a good general-purpose hoe.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: The prong side is for getting close to plants,
tipping to one side and using just one prong in tight places if
need be.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">Weed Slicer </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hand weeder</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: 6&quot; wide triangular blade attached at an
angle to a 5&quot; long wooden handle by a curved metal shank
(&quot;swan neck&quot;) about a foot long. Usually a sturdy,
forged steel item. Left and right-handed versions available.</p>

<p>USE: The razor-sharp blade slices through weeds just under the
soil surface. Especially good for hard-to-reach places in a small
garden, and &quot;intensive&quot; gardening. Design lends itself
to a variety of detail work.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep blades sharp for easier weeding. This is another
hand tool which is easy to lose in the garden, and because of the
sharp blade, it can dangerous with children around. Be sure to
paint the handle a bright color.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">RAKES</a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">Garden Rake </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Flathead</i></p>

<p><i>Bowhead</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Flathead: </i>Level head rake</p>

<p><i>Bowhead: </i>Bow rake, bow holder rake</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A row, over a foot long, of solid steel tines a
few inches long, perpendicular to a long, usually wooden, handle.
Most garden rakes are attached to the handle in the
tang-and-ferrule way, but a few can be found attached using the
solid-socket method. Small versions, as small as 6&quot; wide,
may be called <i>floral (or flower), childrens', </i>or<i>
ladies' rakes. </i></p>

<p><i>Flathead rake: </i>Made of forged, high carbon steel. A
long center tine is bent back to form the tang which is used to
attach the rake to the handle, causing the rake head to fit flush
with the handle to form a &quot;T&quot;. Hand-held,
&quot;miniature&quot; models are available, too.</p>

<p><i>Bowhead rake:</i><b> </b>Attached to the handle by way of
two steel rods or tangs that run from each end of the rake head,
bow out, and are inserted into the handle. Traditional design. </p>

<p>USE: Leveling out soil for lawn or garden seeding. The hard
teeth help break up soil and remove debris. Also useful for
spreading gravel, sand, or topsoil. An essential garden tool.
When pressed into a seed bed, makes small holes about 1&quot;
apart, for planting seeds.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When using the rake for leveling a bed, allow the
rake handle to slide freely through the forward hand while
pulling and pushing it with the hand nearest the far end of the
handle, gripping firmly. If you grip it firmly with both hands,
the rake head only follows the present contours of the bed and
will not level it. The straight back of the rake can be used for
final smoothing.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If you can find a garden rake with solid-socket
construction, definitely buy it. Some gardeners feel that the
slightly lighter bowhead rake adds a desirable spring to the
raking motion. If you want to buy one of the smaller versions,
make sure the handle is long enough for you to use comfortably.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">Leveling Rake </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Grading rake, lawn rake, hay rake</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A 2' to 2-1/2' long board with a series of holes
in it, through which sharpened 4&quot; dowels protrude to form
the tines. The handle is stuck into a hole in the rake head and
secured with metal braces. Resembles the old wooden <i>hay rakes.</i>
Those intended for raking grass or hay usually have more closely
spaced teeth. Also made in aluminum. Although the term <i>lawn
rake </i>is used correctly here, this more often refers to the
fan-shaped bamboo rake noted below. </p>

<p>USE: Particularly useful in creating a level surface on a seed
bed or lawns in preparation for seeding, just after spading has
left large clumps of soil. Lighter models are used to remove
grass clippings and leaves, and of course, previously cut hay.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Same as for<b> garden rake (above)</b>. This rake is
not as strong as the garden rake, and is intended for kinder,
gentler jobs.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Be sure that the handle and the wooden tines are
secure. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">Lawn RAKE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Broom rake, leaf rake, fan rake, sweep rake</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Long wood, flat steel, bamboo, rubber or plastic
tines fanned out from the handle of the rake in a way that it
resembles a wide broom, about 20&quot; or so wide. The tips of
the tines are bent slightly downward. The width of some metal
models can be adjusted for easier raking around shrubs and in
flower beds. Steel rakes may have a spring brace on their backs
for additional strength. Bamboo rakes are available in a large
range of sizes, including a small one with an 6 or 8&quot; fan
for raking in beds and around shrubs. The width on some brands is
adjustable form 7 to 24 inches. Recently a rake with wheels like
a <b>reel-type lawn mower (Chapter 8) </b>was introduced, for
people with back problems (it works on both the push and pull
strokes), although there has long been a model with a bend in the
handle called a <i>back-saver rake., </i>which is easy to use
without bending your back.<i> </i>Other versions have a
rectangular shape, often with rubber tines. <i>Floral </i>and<i>
shrub rakes</i> are simply narrower and of lighter construction.</p>

<p>USE: Raking leaves, twigs, grass clippings, and other light
debris. A basic, indispensible garden tool. Rubber tines are used
where their flexibility is desirable to prevent damaging
shallow-rooted plants. Back-saver rakes are designed to be used
without bending your back.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Store in a dry place. To make bamboo rakes pliable
before use (if they have dried out in storage) they should be
soaked briefly in soapy water. This should be done especially at
the beginning of a season. Don't use stiff wire-tined rakes on a
lawn, or you may rip up your grass.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Although any well-made model is a good buy, this
is one of the few cases where the cheaper productbamboo
rakesare as good a buy as others, because they can be so easily
and cheaply replaced, and some gardeners even prefer the feel of
the natural material of the bamboo rakes. They are also gentler
on the lawn than metal, though rubber tines are the most gentle
and flexible in regards to the terrain. Plastic rakes don't rust,
but check to see that the handle is securely attached to the head
with a screw. Steel rakes must be of top-quality only, or they
are likely to come apart.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">Thatching Rake </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A specialized design composed of about 20
crescent-shaped blades attached 1&quot; apart with the curved
side of the crescents pointed out. </p>

<p>The angle of the blade-like tines is adjustable to fit the
height of the grass. Some brands have a tilting head for
self-cleaning. A hand-sized model is available, called a <i>hand
mulcher</i>.</p>

<p>USE: Removing dead and matted grass (thatch) from a lawn,
permitting better growth. Also cultivates loose soil.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When removing that, adjust the head of the rake so
that the tines ride above the soil and do not cut into it. Clean
tines easily by pushing with the head down a bit. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Make sure that the rake is well-constructed and
the rake head is attached securely to the handle. This is a
specialty tool, and not every gardener is in need of it.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">PRUNING, TRIMMING, AND CUTTING TOOLS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT ALL PRUNING, TRIMMING, AND CUTTING
TOOLS: </a></h2>

<p>All cutting tools perform better if they are kept sharp. This
is not just a case of being professional or perfectionist; it
also makes them safer. Sharpen each one according to its size and
design: use a hand-held whet stone, a file, or take them to a
professional sharpener (look that up in the Yellow Pages under
&quot;Sharpening Services.&quot;) The best blades are
&quot;hollow ground&quot; and may be difficult to sharpen
yourself.</p>

<p>Be sure to wipe them dry after use, coat them with oil from
either an oily rag or an aerosol spray, lubricate the moving
parts or hinges, and store them in a dry place.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">PRUNERS AND SHEARS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT PRUNING AND HEDGE SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>This is the kind of tool where good quality is immediately
apparent to the user: good ones cut better. Ones made of
top-quality steel cut and last longer, too. Good gardeners know
when to use pruning shears instead of hedge shears--the former is
for removing whole branches, and the latter is for superficial
cutting. Each type of cut affects the plant differently. Keep
both kinds of shears clean and wiped with an oily rag or sprayed
with a penetrating lubricant aerosol such as WD-40. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">PRUNING SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES: </p>

<p><i>Anvil</i></p>

<p><i>Curved by-pass</i></p>

<p><i>Straight by-pass</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Pruners, hand pruners, secateurs, pruning snips</p>

<p><i>By-pass: </i>Blade-on-blade, double cutting, hook and blade</p>

<p><i>Straight by-pass:</i> Grape shears, thinning shears,
mini-shears or houseplant mini-shear (if small), all-purpose
snips, utility shears</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Resembling pliers or short, heavy-duty scissors,
pruning shears consist of hand-sized handles, a pivot point with
a spring, and one or two strong cutting blades. The spring causes
the cutting end to remain open when the handles are not squeezed
together. They usually have a lock for storage in a closed
position. Usually sized by the maximum thickness of the branches
they can cut, such as 1/2&quot;, 5/8&quot;, or 3/4&quot;. Some
smaller ones are made with short handles, sometimes called <i>pocket
pruners</i> , and are often recommended for ladies' smaller hands
(<i>Pocket pruner</i> also refers to a plain scissors design with
blunt ends that can be carried in your pocket). The more
exotic-looking designs are offset, for easier access to branches
and reduction of wrist fatigue (it is easier to get the right
cutting angle). The most refined design has one grip that rotates
to fit the angle of your hand as it moves through the squeezing
motion, reducing friction and the possibility of blisters as well
as fatigue. Better quality shears also have small shock aborbers,
sap grooves, wire-cutting notches, and ergonomically-shaped
handles, and replaceable blades or other parts (not riveted).
Left-handed versions available, as are <i>long-reach extentions </i>which
enable wheelchair-bound gardners to prune with ease. Pneumatic
shears, operated with one hand and powered by compressed air, are
also available from professional sources.</p>

<p><i>Anvil:</i><b> </b>One cutting blade and one solid,
flat-faced &quot;anvil&quot; that the cutting blade touches when
squeezed shut. The cutting blade is straight, made of cast or
stamped steel, and may be coated for longer life and less
sticking. The anvil is usually brass, which is softer than the
cutting blade, and may be replaceable. Some have a
&quot;swing&quot; anvil which is hinged in such a way as to give
the pruner a wider opening and also produces a slicing action to
the cut. Many models have a ratchet device for additional force.</p>

<p><i>Curved by-pass:</i><b> </b>Two slightly curved blades that
cut when their surfaces pass each other, just like a pair of
scissors. Cast, stamped, or forged steel, including stainless
steel. May be coated. May also have a convenient <i>wire-cutting
notch</i> near the hinge. Left-handed versions available, but not
from many manufacturers. Lightweight version may be called<i>
floral pruner.</i></p>

<p><i>Straight by-pass: </i>Cut like curved by-pass shears, but
the blade edges are straight, rather than curved, resembling
stubby kitchen scissors. Cast, stamped, or forged steel,
including stainless steel. A particularly pointed model may be
called <i>needle nose</i> pruners. Usually smaller than the other
shears.</p>

<p>USE: Cutting small branches up to approximately 3/4&quot;
thick (though generally for diameters less than 1/2&quot; thick)
and twigs from woody plants. Smaller pruning shears are designed
to be used on less woody plants and small green wood. An
essential tool for any gardener. Anvil types are generally used
for casual or light pruning and bypass types for serious pruning,
though <i>ratchet anvil pruners</i> have more force for thick or
tough woody plants, and there is less risk of
&quot;springing&quot; the blade than with bypass pruners.
Straight pruners are good for detail work on flowers.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep blades sharp. Pruning shears work best when the
spring and the pivot area are oiled before or after each use.
Don't twist them when you have difficulty cutting through
somethingyou'll bend the blades, and they can't be bent back.
Never try to cut a branch that is too thick for the shears, or
else you will bend the blade (anvil types can cut a bit thicker
branches with less danger of bending). If you can't squeeze
through with one hand, it is too thick--use your <b>loppers
(below)</b>. Cut at a diagonal to the grain for less resistance.
This and the trowel are the most &quot;lost&quot; tools: paint
the handles bright orange or yellow so they are easier to spot in
the garden, or use a holster (some brands, such as Felco, make
their own). Curved blades keep the branch from slipping out as
you squeeze them. Making good clean cuts is essential to
preventing disease.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: <i>Anvil type shears</i> smash the branch when
cutting, and are better suited to cutting up branches that have
already been pruned from the tree or shrub, and they leave a stub
when cutting off branches or sprouts. However, they are quite
common and usually the cheapest. Unfortunately, they are also
often cheap in quality as well as in price, though high-quality
ones can be had. Ratchet models require less squeezing effort, an
important consideration for arthritic gardeners. Look for the
kind that have offset pivots which cause the blade to slice along
the anvil, and for replaceable anvils. Try to find those with
hardened and tempered edges.</p>

<p><i>Curved by-pass</i> <i>shears</i> are the most efficient
type, as they give the cleanest and closest cut, right down to
the trunk or branch, leaving no stub. Wire cutting notches are
very convenient if you have lots of plant ties, and if you prune
for long periods of time, the rotating grip is helpful. Look for
a pivot adjustment that allows you to allign blades perfectly.
Felco of Switzerland makes ergonomically designed, red-handled
shears which are industry stardards; they are often referred to
as &quot;Felcos&quot; without any more description (Felco has
been making them for over forty years). They have hollow-ground,
replaceable blades, as a top-quality shear should have. Models 9
and 10 are left-handed. </p>

<p><i>Straight by-pass shears</i> are good for light work where
the space may be confined, such as with house plants and small
shrubs. </p>

<p>Many concerns for any type of pruning shear are similar.
Ratchet-style shears have more strength in their cut and require
less strength from the gardener, an important consideration for
arthritic gardeners. Small shock absorbers are also helpful.
Pruning shears are sold in a variety of grades determined by
weight, design, and the overall quality of the tool, and you can
generally bet on getting what you pay for. Left-handed shears are
manufactured and very advantageous if you need them. It is
unclear if Teflon-coated blades are an advantage, though they may
reduce sap buildup, but then so does a regular wiping or a
&quot;sap groove&quot; in the blade. Shears with thumb-operated
locks are easier to use, as they allow you to lock and holster or
pocket the tool between cuts. Make sure the lock is place where
it doesn't give you blisters, especially at the heel of your
hand; it is more convenient if you can operate it with one hand
while holding the shears. Shears that come apart for sharpening
or blade replacement are a good idea. The longer and wider the
blade, the thicker the limb the shears will cut. Look for
stainless or forged steel, as opposed to cast or stamped, which
are slightly rough. Cushioned, brightly colored grips are a
distinct advantage--you can find your shears on the ground.
Buying quality pruning shears means more than buying a tool that
is durable and will last; quality pruning shears produce a clean
cut that is better for the shrubs and trees you are pruning. Get
good ones.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">LOPPERS</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Lopping shears, two-handed pruning shears,
two-handed shears</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Long-handled pruning tools that look like <b>pruning
shears (above)</b> with arm-length handles (12 to 28&quot;), and
come with either a curved by-pass cutting head or an anvil-type
cutting head (see description above). Loppers may be made
entirely from one piece of steel or have wooden handles and
high-quality steel blades. Recently some constructed from other
materials such as fiberglass have appeared, and still other new
models have gears (<i>gear drive</i>) or <i>ratchet</i> devices,
looking like an offset hinge, for cutting thicker branches than
possible with standard models. These may be referred to as <i>multi-level</i>
or <i>compound action</i> loppers, vs the normal, <i>single-level
</i>type. <i>Vine pruners</i> are lightweight models, and
long-handled models are available. Better models have shock
absorbers.</p>

<p>USE: Pruning branches that are thicker or tougher than those
that pruning shears (above) can cut easily, that is, between
3/4&quot; and 1-1/2&quot; thick. Loppers' longer handles give
more leverage for heavier cutting than the short handles of
pruning shears, and compound action loppers can cut thicker
branches still. <i>Two-handed pruning shears</i> often refers to
loppers which have extraordinary cutting capacity.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Do not twist loppers when cutting as this will bend
the blades, preventing clean cuts in the future. If you are
having trouble cutting through a branch with loppers, don't force
them; go for the <b>pruning saw (below)</b>. Place the anvil
blade on top when cutting with anvil type loppers.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The choice wooden or metal-handled loppers depends
upon the feel of the tool and your own preference, but the anvil
type should be avoided in favor of the by-pass type with forged
blades. Bypass loppers make cleaner, closer cuts. Try them out
and see how they feel. Many gardeners like the balance of the
newer, all-metal loppers, but if you are cutting branches over
your head you may feel that they are too heavy for you, and many
find the fiberglass handles not quite as durable as wooden or
metal handles. As with pruning shears, the longer the blade, the
thicker the limb they can cut. Most loppers are graded by weight,
with the heavier ones capable of doing the harder jobs and being
usually of better quality. Ratchet models give you more force,
which is a consideration if you don't have the strength for heavy
pruning with regular models. Chrome alloy steel resists rust more
than other types. Hinges which are slightly offset keep the
branch being cut from slipping out of the blades, as does a
hooked end.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">FLOWER GATHERER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Cut and hold shears, flower shears (see also
below), flower gathering scissors</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Resembles very closely regular kitchen scissors,
except that only one blade is sharp, and the end is blunt. One is
a thick and serrated and the other is a small blade that slices
into it. Other types have a setback over the cutting blade which
holds the cut stem. Some brands are designed with a thorn remover
and stem crusher in the handles. Large handles should allow use
by both left- and right-handers. Made with a 28&quot; or 31&quot;
long, pistol grip handle, too.</p>

<p>USE: Picking flowers for display. Cuts and holds the bloom in
the same move. Long-handled models are excellent for gardeners
who have difficulting bending and reaching, such as wheelchair
gardeners. Handy also in rock gardens, for hanging plants,
climbing plants, or reaching over greenhouse benches.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Blunt ends mean you can drop these into your pocket.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">FLOWER SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Freehand snips, Japanese flower shears,
Japanese flower arranging shears</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Extra sharp and sturdy scissors, some models of
which have giant loops called <i>butterfly handles</i>, for your
hands. Other models, called <i>flat-end scissors</i>, have one
broad and blunt-ended blade and one slightly hooked one. Japanese
models, with the butterfly handles, are called <i>Ikebana shears </i>and
have a black, parkerized finish, and come in either the
short-bladed <i>Koryu </i>style or the thin, long bladed <i>Ashinaga
Bonsai Hasami </i>style.</p>

<p>USE: Trimming or cutting flowers and small plants. Models with
large loops are for cutting with gloves on, or more importantly,
if you have trouble gripping, due to arthritis or other
conditions.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Try not to cut too much woody or extra thick
material for which pruning shears would be better adapted. If the
rivet becomes loose, see if you can tighten it by hammering it
down on a metal surface.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Better than kitchen scissors because they make a
cleaner cut, helping the flower stem draw water in a vase.
Flat-end scissors can go in your pocket or tool kit without
danger. </p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">LONG REACH FRUIT AND FLOWER PICKER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A 5-foot long aluminum pole with a squeeze grip
handle on one end and scissor-like blades on the other (anvil
style, where one blade has a cutting edge while the other has a
flat surface against which the cutting blade works). Attached to
these blades are two metal strips which come together when the
blades meet in order to hold the stems of the fruit or flowers so
they can be lowered after cutting. Another, basic version of a
fruit picker is a simple wire basket with tines on one side, on a
15' long handle. Also known as a <i>fruit harvester </i>or<i>
fresh fruit picker</i>. Head sold separately.</p>

<p>USE: A helpful tool for cutting dead stems, spent rose blooms,
and general garden cutting in beds and places not easily reached
with pruning shears. Because the cut material does not drop into
the bed (it is held between the metal strips on the blade) it is
very helpful for people who have trouble bending over to pick
things up or for cutting from thorny plants. It is also useful in
water gardening, allowing you to reach into a pool to pick out
dead lily blooms or debris, for example. The basket style fruit
picker is used just for that: picking ripe fruit. The basket
holds the fruit as long as it is larger than the mesh openings.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Be sure that whatever is being cut is grabbed by the
clamping side of the blade, or else it will drop. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: At under $50, this is a good investment for most
gardeners. Even small gardens have areas that are difficult to
reach with hand pruners, and where using a ladder is not a good
solution.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">HEDGE SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hand hedge shears, hand shears</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Large scissors-like device 12 to 28&quot; in
length overall. The long, straight handles may be wooden or metal
with rubber grips, and the blades can be straight edged, curved,
serrated, or wavy<b>. </b>Most shears have a notch in one blade
close to the pivot that allows you to cut larger branches. (The
curves, serrations, or waves hold branches in place as the blades
are closed; without this design feature, branches tend to spring
out of the blades' grasp.) Forged, and occassionaly stainless
steel blades are available in your better models. Rubber bumpers
at the pivot point absorb the shock of the two handles coming
together. Light models are available, as are long-handled
versions. </p>

<p>USE: Trimming hedges and cutting branches up to 1/2&quot;
thick. A notch near the pivot point is for slightly larger
branches. They are not intended for general pruning, where
branches and limbs should be cut individually. Hand hedge shears
cut through thicker branches than power shears.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Hedges should be trimmed so that the top is narrower
than the bottom, and not squared off. Tapering allows the sun to
reach the entire surface of the hedge so it fills in evenly.
Longer blades are best for cutting evenly. You can hang shears
that have a hole in a blade on a nail.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Hedge shears are not for general pruning, so buy a
pair only if you have a hedge. Rubber bumpers, which should be
replaceable, make the shears less taxing to use, as does a
lighter weight. Shears with serrated or wavy blades hold the
limbs better and are easier to use. Handle shape and finish vary
from brand to brand and model to model, so pick them up and try
them out first. Look for those with an adjustable locknut at the
hinge, so you can adjust the tension of the cutting motion.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">BORDER SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Lawn shears, lawn trimmers, light edgers,
edging shears, long handled grass shears</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The nomenclature for this is confusing. There are
two basic types, both of which are long-bladed shears (7&quot; to
9&quot; blades are common), with blades about the same as <b>hedge
shears (above)</b>, with a yard-long set of metal or wooden
handles. Both types have an overall shape of an &quot;L&quot;,
but true<i> edging shears</i> have blades cut in line with the
handles (vertically) for edging; those with blades that cut
horizontally are true <i>lawn shears. </i>This model can be found
with small wheels at the pivot. Both can be considered <b>oversized
grass shears (above). </b></p>

<p>USE: Triming grass along borders from an erect position.
Particularly useful for gardeners who have trouble bending over
or kneeling. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Remember not to trim the grass too closely.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Quality shears are edge-hardened and
hollow-ground. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">SAWS</a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">BOW SAW </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Buck saw (usually in context of carpentry),
tubular saw, log saw</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Metal frame in the D-shape of a bow, with a thick
blade connecting the two ends. Available in a small range of
sizes, and in two D-shapes: tapered to a point at one end, and a
basic, even D-shape. Wooden-framed bow or buck saws, now known as
<i>frame saws</i>, were indispensable tools for cutting firewood
in the past. The variously-sized teeth are slightly offset to
accommodate green wood. Some blades are disposable, others are
longer-lasting and sharpenable hardened steel.</p>

<p>USE: Cutting firewood or branches 10&quot; to 20&quot; in
diameter. Each cut can only be as deep as the bow frame. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep blades sharp and well oiled. Because of their
thin blades, bow saws cut faster and easier than other hand saws.
When cutting heavy branches, make a cut from the bottom of the
branch about 2&quot; below where the final cut will be made. This
prevents the bark from skinning beyond this point when the branch
falls. If you intend to do a lot of light pruning, buy a tapered
bow saw rather than a basic D-shaped one. This prevents the end
from hitting other branches while cutting; but a tapered saw is
not good for cutting thick firewood. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Bow saws are good investments for those people
with large gardens and many trees, and especially for those who
cut their own firewood.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">CROSSCUT SAW </a></h2>

<p>TYPES: </p>

<p>Two-Person (or Two-Man) </p>

<p>One-Person (or One-Man) or Bull Saw</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The two-person crosscut saw has a 6' blade with a
combination of incredibly large pointed teeth and rectangular
&quot;rakers,&quot; and two ll&quot; wooden, removable handles
attached to the ends of the blade with nuts and bolts. One-person
model is similar, but only about 3' long, and has a verticle grip
attached to the top of the blade.</p>

<p>USE: For serious and quick tree-felling and log-cutting. A
very efficient tool with two people sharing the labor.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Never push on a two-person crosscut saw, as this will
bend the blade and cause it to bind in the log or tree. Wait
until your partner has finished his or her pull, then <u>pull</u>
the saw back towards yourself. When cutting a log on a
&quot;buck&quot; (an X-shaped log stand) it is better to start
the movement of the saw before the blade makes contact with the
log. This gets the mutual movement of the partners going and
gently lines up the cut. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Such a saw makes sense only if you have a
woodburning stove, lots of firewood to cut, and a partner to help
you saw. If you are doing some log construction as a one-time
activity only, then try to rent a two-man crosscut saw.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">HIGH LIMB CHAIN SAW </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Chain blade high-limb cutter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A linked chain (like a bicycle chain) with carbon
steel blades on each link, attached to long pieces of rope, one
of which has a weight on the end. The chain and one rope are
thrown over a limb with the chain positioned on the limb itself.
When the cords are pulled back and forth, the blades of the chain
cut through the limb.</p>

<p>USE: Cutting branches that are hard to get to by ladder or
beyond a <b>long-reach pruning saw (below).</b></p>

<p>USE TIP: Add your own rope for really high limbs (and good
luck throwing the saw up there). Do not stand directly under the
limb that is being cut. This may seem obvious but this is a
common mistake.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Though not something you would need often, if you
have many trees it may be worth purchasing for a rare use that
would otherwise mean calling in expensive professionals.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">LONG REACH POLE SAW AND LOPPER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Pole pruner, long-reach pruner, telescoping
tree pruner, pole tree trimmer, tree pruner, pole pruning saw,
telephone tree trimmer, tree trimmer, pole pruner/trimmer, pole
pruner/saw</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A long, sectional or telescoped pole made of
wood, metal, or fiberglass, with a 16&quot;or so pruning saw or a
pruning shear (may be called a <i>clipper</i> here), or a
combination of both, depending on the brand, on one end. Can be
as much as 20' long. The shear is operated by a large lever
attached to a long cord that is pulled by the operator at the
tail end of the tool. The leverage on this tool comes from the
cord being run through a pulley by the blade; it is spring-loaded
to return to the open position automatically. Other versions have
a<i> pump-style</i> mechanisim, with a round grip that is slid up
and down the handle. Older models of this tool had wooden handles
that were in sections, but today, most are telescoped poles made
of metal or fiberglass which are easily extended by twisting the
pole. (The above names are used differently by each manufacturer,
and some products with the same names may be quite different,
i.e. one may have only a pruning shear while another might have
only a saw, while a third has both.) </p>

<p>USE: Pruning limbs and branches that cannot be reached by
hand-held tools or are inconvenient to trim by standing on a
ladder. The pump-style pole pruner is excellent for the
wheelchair gardener.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Stand to the side of branches you are cutting or
sawing, not below them. If you try to prune a branch which is too
large for the blade to cut, the blade may become stuck in the
branch. Remember to look down and around from time to time, or
you'll get a crick in your neck. And wear goggles.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Fiberglass poles are often preferable to metal
ones, especially when pruning near electrical wires. If you have
trees or tall shrubs in your landscape, this is an indispensable
tool. Teflon-coated bladesa very good ideaare now available.
Double pulleys are a definite advantage with the shear. Tie a
handle to the end of the rope to make it a bit easier to grip.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">PRUNING SAW </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Tree saw, gardener's saw</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The most common pruning saws are curved steel
blade saws about 14&quot; long with amazingly large, sometimes
razor-sharp triangular teeth and straight, pistol grip, or D-grip
handles. Some steel blades are Teflon coated. One model, a <i>duplex
saw</i>, is straight, with tapered blades 18&quot; long that have
teeth on both sides: one side for coarse cutting and the other
side for fine cutting. Teeth are usually angled so that you cut
on the &quot;pull&quot; stroke, enabling them to be designed with
more agressive teeth than if they cut on the &quot;push&quot;
stroke. They also cut faster and don't get gummed up with green
wood. 4 to 8 teeth per inch is standard, with the lower number
better for green woods and the higher number better for hard or
dry woods. Available in either <i>fixed </i>, sometimes called <i>rigid</i>,
or <i>folding</i> models (in which the blade folds back into the
handle like a big pocket knife) sometimes called <i>collapsible
saws. </i>Rigid models are sometimes called <i>single- </i>or<i>
double-sided</i>, depending on their design.</p>

<p>USE: Cutting branches from 1-1/2&quot; to 10&quot; in
diameter.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When pruning large branches it is a good idea to make
an initial cut 1 to 2&quot; into the bottom side of the branch
above where the final cut will be. This prevents the branch from
ripping the bark beyond this point should it to fall before the
final cut is completed. Use the folding type if you are working
on ladders, so you can put the folded saw in your pocket or
holster when not in use. Folding saws are a bit safer and more
likely to hold their extreme sharpness because of the protective
nature of folding up.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Many gardeners have found pruning saws with the
double-sided blade a good investment because they need fine or
coarse cuts (more teeth per inch yields a finer cut; fewer teeth,
a coarser cut). The curved blade saws, however, are easier to use
as the curve allows for a smoother sawing rhythm. A medium tooth
gauge ofaround 8-10 teeth per inch does most of the work required
by home gardens. Tooth edges should be beveled for sharpness.
Check out the saw for balance and the feel of the grip before
purchasing. Look for saws with a small hang-up hole near their
tips.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">KNIVES AND OTHER HAND CUTTING TOOLS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC9">ABOUT KNIVES: </a></h2>

<p>Every gardener should have at least a good pocket knife for
jobs such as opening plastic bags, sharpening bamboo plant
stakes, cutting cords and string, and many similar small jobs
that pop up while gardening. However, garden centers often carry
specialized knives such as machetes, pruning knives, and grafting
knives that are quite helpful, even invaluable. </p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">AX </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Axe</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, wedge-shaped cutting tool made from
tempered steel with handles 20 to 36&quot; long, usually of
hickory or white ash, though available in fiberglass. The handle
is attached to the head through the eye (a hole or socket in the
butt end of the ax head). Some newer models, called <i>splitting
axes,</i> have spring fingers on the sides that help split wood
more easily.</p>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><b><i>Single-bit: </i></b>Only one cutting edge with a flat
butt end. The handle is curved and saddle-horn shaped at the end
for leverage and to prevent your hands from slipping off. Most
popular model is the <i>Michigan style</i>, with a head weighing
about 3-1/2 lbs that is about 7&quot; to 8&quot; high. Other
similar, popular patterns are Dayton and Jersey.</p>

<p><b><i>Double-bit: </i></b>Two curved cutting edges and a
straight handle. </p>

<p>USE: Cutting down trees, removing their limbs
(&quot;limbing&quot;), cutting roots, sharpening stakes and
poles, and for chopping and splitting logs. The blunt end of the
head can be used for driving wooden stakes.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Move your hands correctly to insure that the momentum
of the ax head does the work and not your back. Spread hands at
either end of the handle at the top of the swing, and slide the
forward hand back down the handle during the swing so that both
hands are at the base when you hit the wood. <i>Hammer wedges</i>
(small, triangular bits of metal) should be driven into the
head-end of handles if the head is loose. Do not use the
&quot;heel&quot; end of the head for driving metal objects.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Buy only axes with heads made of tempered steel,
as these hold an edge better than those which are not tempered.
Avoid axes with painted handles, because imperfections in the
wood or the grain of the wood may be covered up. The grain of the
handle should run lengthwise and be thin and close together.
Knots or swirls in the wood means the handle is weak, and you
should avoid tools with these imperfections in the handle. An axe
is an impact tool, so the handle, which takes the impact is as
important as the cutting head. Newer fiberglass handles do not
necessarily give the tool the proper balance between head and
handle. Finally, a double-bit ax is a loggers' tool and not
recommended for the home gardener--they are very dangerous to
use. </p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">HATCHET </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Camp ax or axe, kindling axe</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hammer-sized <b>single-bit ax (above)</b>,
usually with a wooden handle, or one solid piece of metal. Heads
are about 6&quot; high and 3 to 3-1/2&quot; wide.</p>

<p>USE: Many garden uses, such as cutting poles, trimming stakes
for flowers and vegetables, driving stakes into the ground for
row covers and cloches. The name &quot;camp ax&quot; comes from
its earlier, common use for setting up camp, chopping wood for
the camp fire, and for chopping and driving the tent stakes. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Leather holsters make the use of hatchets easier, and
has saved many a hatchet from being lost in the weeds where it
could be stepped on.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Similar to the regular <b>ax (above)</b>. Look at
the grain of the handle, and whether you buy a hatchet with a
wooden handle on one that is solid steel, check for weight and
balance. The head should be of tempered steel.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">MAUL</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Looks like a heavy-headed ax, and it is--almost
twice as heavy. The cutting edge is much more flared and curved
than an ax's, and the &quot;heel&quot; side is quite thick--just
like a slege hammer. 36&quot; long handle is typical; <i>Oregon
maul </i>is a common style. Weighs about 6 lbs. Some makes have a
straight triangle for a head, instead of the modified ax style.</p>

<p>USE: Splitting firewood and pounding stakes. It's extreme
wideness makes it excellent for splitting wood along the grain,
and the weight makes it easier to take advantage of its momentum
than with an ax. The wider the head, the faster it splits logs
(but the heavier it is to heft).</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Be careful when using to pound someting, as you can
cut yourself with the cutting edge on your backswing--this is a
very heavy tool. You don't always have to use a wedge--you can
use the maul's extra width to cut all the way through a log
lengthwise.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">MACHETE</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Huge knife, around 18&quot; to 27&quot; long and
3&quot; wide, with wooden or plastic riveted handle; weighs 2 to
2-1/2lbs. The blade is rounded at the tip and is tapered toward
the handle, making it tip-heavy and therefore giving momentum to
the swing. Blade should be high-quality carbon steel.</p>

<p>USE: Excellent for cutting tangled vegetation, thick grasses,
vines, bamboo, saplings, and thin, woody weeds, as well as for
harvesting sugar cane, one of its most common uses. It is perfect
for clearing an overgrown lot or garden, tropical or not. In a
jungle or other tropical setting, it is more common and useful
than shoes. Short, thick blades can be used for chopping almost
anything.</p>

<p>USE TIP: A machete with a dull blade is more dangerous to use
than a sharp one--it might bounce or glance off woody material
and inflict a serious cut on the user. Extra-sharp machetes don't
seem so heavy, either.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Heavy steel machetes found at army surplus stores
may be a better buy than those that have been manufactured to be
sold as garden tools. Wooden handles wear better and are often
more comfortable than plastic ones.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">FOLDING PRUNING KNIVES </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Usually a slightly curved, wooden or plastic
handle about 4 or 5&quot; long into which folds a curved blade
with a hawkbill hook in its tip.</p>

<p>USE: A well cared-for folding pruning knife is a valuable tool
for cutting twigs, small woody shoots, and any other cutting job
that requires a small knife. The curved tip of this knife holds
the limb and makes it easy to cut when the knife is pulled
towards you.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep the blade sharp and clean.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A folding pruning knife is not just a cheap pocket
knifea good one costs from 40 to 50 dollars. Quality here goes
up pretty much with cost. Wooden handles are preferable to
plastic. Check the tool out for feel and balance.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">GRAFTING KNIFE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Horticultural knife, gardener's knife</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Folding or stationary (non-folding) pocket knife
with an extremely sharp blade less than 3&quot; long. The plastic
or wooden handles are approximately 4&quot; in length, and the
blades generally have a straight cutting edge with a curved top
side, although curved blades are available. Some models have a
stubby brass blade called an <i>opener</i>, which is used to hold
the bark open for the insertion of a graft. A wide range of
similar types of horticultural knives are made for professionals,
such as <i>pruning</i> and <i>nursery knives. </i>A smaller
bladed knife with a blunt or stubby point is a <i>budding knife.</i></p>

<p>USE: Making cuttings from plants, called <i>scions</i>, which
are then grafted onto other plants or root stock, or for budding.
</p>

<p>USE TIP: Good clean cuts produce the most successful grafts,
so keep grafting knives particularly sharp.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Grafting is not done casually, and a sharp
grafting knife is definitely required. The criteria for buying a
grafting knife is the same as for buying any knifegood feel and
balance, a comfortable grip. A wooden handle is preferable to a
plastic one. This is probably not something needed by the
beginning gardener. Also, the highest quality steel is more
easily kept razor sharp. Look for a combination model with two
different blades and small brass opening blade, for spreading
bark apart at cuts.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">GRAFTING TOOL </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Heavy steel rod, from about one-half to a foot
long, in either of two versions: with a 2-1/4&quot; wide convex
blade on one end (whch may be called a <i>grafting chisel</i>),
or with a 4&quot; long concave blade in the middle (of the longer
version); both have hooked ends (two in the case of the larger
model).</p>

<p>USE: Splitting and holding open trees for grafting.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Make sure you know what you are doing before
attempting to graft trees, or you may easily damage them. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The smaller version may be included in a <i>grafting
kit</i>, which might also include a grafting knife, <i>grafting
wax, grafting tape, rubber budding strips </i>(for holding the
graft together), and instructions for making grafts..</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">BUSH HOOK </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Bush axe, bush knife, bush hog, brush knife,
brush hook, brush cutter, bank blade, slashing hook</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A heavy-duty tool consisting of a short, wide
blade with a hooked end. The blade may be <i>single edge</i>
(sharpened on only one side) or <i>double edge </i>(sharpened on
both sides). The blade is attached to the handle with a heavy
metal collar forged onto the blade, though one version, a <i>ditch
bank blade</i>, is usually bolted to the handle (it has the same
blade but with a cutting edge on its entire circumferance).
Handles are heavy and from 35&quot; to 40&quot; long. Sort of a
large, heavy alternative to the <b>machete (above). </b>A smaller
version, called a <i>bill hook</i>, is used to harvest sugar cane
or rough pruning of bushes, other versions are used to harvest
corn (they may be called <i>corn knives) </i>and still more
versions are called by whatever a manufacturer might invent,
which allows for a fair amount of imagination.</p>

<p>A smaller version is a <i>weed</i> or <i>brier hook</i>, which
is simply a hook with a sharp inside cutting edge and a long
handle; it cuts by pulling the hook toward you. Another variation
is a sort of hybrid of an ax and a bush hook, called a <i>clearing
axe.</i> It has a steel bow with a short, replaceable blade
instead of the solid blades noted here.</p>

<p>USE: Clearing heavy weed bushes and shrubs, as well as trees
up to 1-1/2&quot; thick. They are particularly useful in clearing
overgrown lots or wooded areas in preparation for a future
garden. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep the blades sharp, because like machetes, a dull
bush axe is more dangerous than a sharp one. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: This is an item to rent if you have an unusual
clearing job ahead of you.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">SCYTHE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: You may recognize this tool as the one carried by
Father Time. It has a long, slightly curved wooden or a aluminum
handle, known as a <i>snath</i> (<i>snaith</i>, in England, as
well as <i>snade, snead, sneathe, </i>and<i> batt)</i>, to which
are attached two short, straight wooden hand grips called
&quot;nibs.&quot; The blade is 24&quot; to 34&quot; long and just
barely curved, with the sharp cutting edge on the inside; a short
metal rod called a <i>grass nail </i>crosses the inside corner of
the blade and handle junction to prevent grass from catching
there. Handles (snaths) are available separately as replacements
or designed for specific jobs, such as lighter or heavier
cutting. Straight models are made, too, and are a matter of
personal preference. Blades are available in three weights:
Grass, Weed, and Bush (Grass blades are the longest and
heaviest). Many fine blades come from Germany and Austria. A
lighter model with a straight snath and only one nib is called a <i>scythe
hook</i>. A similar, lightweight English version is called <i>scythette,
</i>and its handle has no grips; it may also be called a <i>grass
hook</i>, which is actually a long-handled <b>sickle (below).</b></p>

<p>USE: These days, used to cut areas with tall grasses, weeds,
or light brush. The scythe is an old farm tool, used for
centuries to harvest hay and grain crops.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Swing the blade by rocking your entire body back and
forth. Using the arms alone to move a scythe will quickly tire
you; farmers who used the scythe for harvesting grain developed a
rhythm which made using this heavy tool easier.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: This beautifully shaped and balanced tool can also
be rented, which is a good thing to do because these days most
garderners do not have much use for one. However, you may enjoy
owning a cutting tool that looks like it came from a old farm or
a museum. A lighter, cheaper alternative is the <b>swing blade </b>or<b>
grass whip (below).</b></p>

<p>______________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">SICKLE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hand scythe, grass hook, reaping hook, bagging
hook</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A sharply curved blade, sharpened on the inside
(may be finely serrated), with a short, usually wooden handle. It
may be familiar to you, shown with a hammer, as the symbol of
U.S.S.R. Models with long, straight handles are available, but
rare, and have straighter blades. </p>

<p>USE: Excellent for cutting weeds or grass too high for a lawn
mower or in areas that a mower cannot reach. A<i> rice sickle </i>is
made for particularly heavy grasses.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The sickle is easy to use when moved in an elliptical
pattern with the pulling motion at the bottom of the movement
doing the cutting. Keep in mind that you have to bend over to use
this; if you have a lot of ground-level cutting to do, use a
similar tool with a long, vertical handle, called a <b>scythe
(above).</b></p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for a heavy steel blade and a comfortable
wooden handle.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">SWING BLADES &amp; GRASS WHIPS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>Swing Blade: Weed cutter </p>

<p>Grass Whip: Grass cutter, stand-up grass cutter, weed whip,
grass hook, grass trimmer, weed cutter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The blades on both of these tools are about
14&quot; to 18&quot; long, 2&quot; to 4&quot; wide, double-edged,
and usually slightly serrated. The blade of the <i>grass whip</i>
is attached at only one end to a metal handle with a plastic or
rubber grip, making it look like a giant golf club. A heavier
duty version is called a <i>brush cutter </i>(as are a few other,
but different, tools). The wooden handle of the <i>swing blade</i>
is attached with two metal strips, or brackets, to both ends of
the blade, forming a &quot;D.&quot; Both are modern, lightweight
versions of the <b>scythe (above). </b>Some manufacturers
consider a modified model with a short, hooked blade and a
45-inch handle in lieu of the 36-inch handle a <i>bean- </i>or<i>
soybean hook</i>; it is quite similar to the <i>weed </i>or<i>
brier hook</i> <b>(bush hook, above)</b>, or even the same thing.</p>

<p>USE: Both of these tools are used for cutting weeds and
grasses, but the swing blade is heavier and made for heavier
plants. The weed hook is for woody or hard to reach weeds, or
thorny bushes, and is helpful for the wheelchair-bound gardener,
or those who cannot bend and reach easily.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The grass whip is held in one hand and moved in a 75<sup>o</sup>
arc with the power of the down stroke doing the cutting. The
swing blade is used similarly with either one hand or two, though
many experienced gardeners prefer to use it with only one hand.
Keep blades clean. Watch out for surrounding bushes, furniture,
trees, lights, and of course, children: your swing is very, very
wide, and you're bound to cut things you don't mean to, even if
you are experienced. Take a good look at the distance of your
swing when you start, and by all means keep inquisitive children
away. They have a way of sneaking up on you when you are
concentrating on your work.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Grass whips can be found with smooth-edged blades,
but the serrated edges cut better as there is a greater cutting
surface. The swing blade is a standard farm tool, but may not be
as indispensable to most gardeners. This is a tool that can be
rented if needed only once. Consider it a lighter duty, less
expensive version of the <b>scythe (above),</b> easier to handle
and keep sharp. Look for high-carbon steel blades.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">GRASS AND WEED TRIMMERS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC10">ABOUT GRASS AND WEED TRIMMERS: </a></h2>

<p>Trimming has always been one of the more arduous garden chores
(second only to weeding), and grass and weed trimmers have proven
essential in this task. They allow you to cut where lawn mowers
can't go, such as up close to buildings, trees, or paths. The
manual trimmers are relatively easy to use for small gardens, but
for a garden with many areas to trim, the new power trimmers are
a blessing.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">SHEEP SHEAR TRIMMERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Grass shears, sheep shear pattern trimmers,
singing grass shears, English clipping shears, short-handled
grass shears</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Commonly made from a single piece of fine carbon
steel, sheep shears consist of two 5 1/2&quot; triangular blades
at the end of a bent metal loop, with straight handles. The bent
metal loop acts as a spring, holding the shears open when not
cutting. The simplicity of the design--one piece of metal, and
self-sharpening at that--is part of the charm of owning these
shears. These blades cut with scissor-like action when the
handles are squeezed. This design has been around at least since
the nineteenth century, and was originally designed to be used to
shear wool from sheep, of course. Available in a left-handed
version, too. Self-sharpening. Makes a pleasant ringing sound
when used.</p>

<p>USE: Trimming small areas. As there are no pivoting
partsonly bending onesmaking these are easy to maintain if
kept free from rust.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Extended use may cause blisters if you don't wear
gloves when trimming with these shears.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: This is a simple, straightforward tool, but people
with difficulty gripping may find these hard to use.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">SCISSOR-TYPE GRASS SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Resembles a pair of heavy-duty household
scissors, with the blade and handles being made from one piece of
metal. The handles are usually plastic-coated and spring-loaded
to force the shears open after each cut. Blades cut by crossing
over each other. </p>

<p>USE: Trimming small amounts of grass and weeds around trees or
structures. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Wear gloves, as these shears are prone to cause
blisters.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The horizontal squeeze action required to operate
these shears is a more difficult movement than the vertical
squeeze movement required by regular <b>grass shears (below)</b>.
But they are less expensive and good for use as stand-bys in
small areas.</p>
