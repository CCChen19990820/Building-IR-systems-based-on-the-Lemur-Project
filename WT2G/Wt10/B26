MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents insider information from those who attended the recent 1996 
National Education Summit.

<p>

Education affects the pro-family movement on many levels, and there is 
no shortage of controversy.  One recent example is the constant battling
over public school curriculum, which deletes key historical events
but somehow manages to teach children an amoral value system,
complete with bad advice on sex.  It seems clear that as a country
we can no longer ignore the fact that educational standards, measured
by students' knowledge and performance, have drastically plummeted.

<p>

The 1996 National Education Summit was supposed to address that
learning crisis.  The conference was organized by IBM CEO and
chairman Lou Gerstner, Jr., with the help of the governors and
other high-ranking businessmen.  But will their solutions for
a broken school system help your children?  Stay tuned to learn
more.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Cathy Cleaver, Family Research
Council's Director of Legal Policy.  Cathy has been involved heavily
in an issue that affects all families and all children, pornography.
Because of numerous court cases attacking the legal boundaries
around our children, the pornography industry has a lot of power
today, but there are some key legal battles in the works.  Stay
with us as Cathy fills us in on what the pornographers don't want
you to know about what goes on behind the headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Cathy, thank you so much for being with us today on Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is my pleasure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There has been a lot of news out recently from Los 
Angeles and New York and now Philadelphia on pornography and the 
telecommunications bill, pornography on the Internet, and reading 
the news reports, is it fair to say that it would be smashing blow 
to the First Amendment if we see restrictions on the Internet?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I love the way you put that, and that is really how 
to phrase this question.  The ACLU and others who are fighting to 
get this new computer pornography law restrained make just that point: 
If we don't have free-flowing pornography to every child in America, 
we have lost our valuable First Amendment freedoms.

<p>

That's ridiculous.  Most courts think that's ridiculous, and we are 
counting on that.  The Supreme Court, of course, has said we don't 
have to have that, that pornography is not a measure of our freedom; 
rather, it is a sort of low-level type of speech that we need to 
tolerate at some levels, but certainly we don't need to have our 
children tolerate it.

<p>

So I believe that the challenges that are going on across the country 
are just the same challenges we have always seen and that our side 
will be successful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Just yesterday, you were in Philadelphia at the court 
case there.  Tell us a little bit about what's going on there and 
how it will affect parents.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: In February, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was 
signed into law by President Clinton. Part of that act included the 
Communications Decency Act, which is simply a law that says adults 
have no right to knowingly give pornography to children over computer 
systems.  Makes sense.

<p>

Well, the ACLU and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit saying
that this is going to ruin our cherished freedom of free speech,
and we have this drama played out in a federal court in Philadelphia.
I have attended every day of the hearing, and it has been quite
a show, with sex experts saying that children should see pornography,
that it's not harmful; other people saying that the Internet will
just cease to be if this restriction is in place.

<p>

The Department of Justice is defending the law, and they are doing a 
good job. I was pleased to see that they are vigorous in their defense
of the law, and I believe they believe in its constitutionality.
Certainly Janet Reno and the policy makers at Justice had some
trouble in 1994 with child pornography and weakening the statute,
and we don't see a replay of that yet.  Frankly, I don't think
they have the political capital to waste on another debacle like
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of people may not remember what the
Clinton Administration did on that child porn case, where essentially
they tried to change the law to say that if a child who is being
molested appears to be participating in all of this, that somehow
they are at fault.  It is an astounding legal principle, isn't
it?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It was a terrible burden to put on the prosecution,
and I would say that it would really bring any child pornography
prosecution to a screeching halt.  It would never be prosecuted
under the types of burdens that the Justice Department at that
time was suggesting.  But that was turned around, public outrage,
and healthy public outrage and efforts from all groups, including
the Family Research Council.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We hear a lot from the American Civil Liberties Union 
that somehow, if we don't have pornography on the Internet, the 
Internet will cease to be, as though perhaps it were created, we must 
assume, for the purpose of transmitting hard core, obscene images. But 
what is the ACLU's history on pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is very radical. They lead the charge in trying to 
legalize child pornography, even hard core child pornography where a 
child is shown being raped. The ACLU believes that once a video or 
a magazine of this child's rape has been produced, it is a sacred 
text that must be protected by the First Amendment.

<p>

They are out of touch. We wouldn't want to live in an ACLU world. 
And, thankfully, our courts have not bought in to their arguments. 
But they keep trying, and they are trying again here, with the same 
sort of notion, that someone should be allowed to intentionally give 
a child pornography. And the ACLU, of course, also believes that 
children have a right to see pornography.

<p>

So they are leading the charge against the Communications Decency 
Act, along with People for the American Way, the American Library 
Association, and the cast of characters that we have seen time and 
time again who defend the pornographers and their right to make 
profits in selling this kind of material.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A typical comeback from the pornography industry
and the so-called First Amendment people is that it's the parents'
problem, it's the parents' responsibility.  How do you respond
to that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Well, I say time and again that no law
is designed to fill the role of a parent, and neither is this
law, nor has anyone suggested that this law is to substitute for
a parent.  Rather, parents are no match for an $8 billion to $10
billion a year pornography industry.

<p>

There is a role for government to play in protecting children or 
protecting anybody that is weaker in society from elements that are 
stronger in society. That's what our criminal laws are all about, 
and we have criminal laws that prevent an adult from exploiting a child 
through pornography. That is a consistent theme we have seen in 200 
years of laws. And that is the same theme we have with this law.

<p.

Parents certainly have a role, and there is no one taking that role away. 
But they need help.  They can't do it alone.  And the responsibility 
should always remain on the shoulders of that person who is dealing in
harmful material, just like in the instance of toxic waste or
something like that.  If you emit toxic waste in your business,
you have a responsibility to curb that.  Similarly, if you are
distributing pornography, you have a responsibility to keep it
from kids.

<p>

That is really a legal principle that we as a society
have embraced that has been fought by these civil liberty groups,
but we have embraced that, and the courts have upheld that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Let's say that a parent really does buy the ACLU line
and accepts the fact that they are supposed to be the sole defender
of their child.  Is it possible for a child to really block pornography
and obscenity from their home with the blocking technologies today?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Absolutely not.  We have seen many instances in
which parents have tried to employ this blocking technology, and
pornography has still reached their children.  Pornography that
is attached to an e-mail message, for instance, is not blocked
by the software.

<p>

During this hearing, very interesting testimony from SurfWatch, the 
leading software filtering company right now. I have nothing against 
SurfWatch or the filtering companies, and they will provide somewhat 
of a help to parents.  But they want to be a substitute for a law.

<p>

Yet, in the hearing, they admitted that they miss 800 pornographic sites 
per month. And they say, &quot;Well, that's not so bad.&quot;  Well, I 
think parents think that's bad. That's a lot of sites of material that
could just ruin a child's mental health, frankly.

<p.

So it is ridiculous to think that sort of technology can be a complete 
substitute for a law.  We are left with hoping that pornography 
distributors will, of their own, decide not to harm our children. 
History has not shown that that is a good assumption.

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A lot of people are not aware that, under American law, the 
way in which we have regulated communication is the way in which 
something is transmitted, so that you cannot send something threatening
through the mails, for example; you cannot sell pornography without
some kind of adult supervision; you have to have a restricted
access.  So we have really regulated transmission of information.

<p>

As we look at the Internet, a new way to transmit information,
are we seeing any new laws being made?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: With this new medium, all we're doing is importing laws 
that our country has embraced for decades.  There is no new legal theory 
at play here.  It's the same old principle that people who distribute
pornography cannot distribute it to children.

<p>

It is interesting, because every time a new technology develops, first 
of all, pornographers rush in and exploit that technology, sometimes 
drive it, I am sorry to say, drive its development.  And then, secondly, 
the porn defenders come in and say, &quot;Well, pornography law can't
apply in this technology.  Certainly videos are different than
magazines, and certainly pornography laws shouldn't apply to videos.&quot;
That's what we heard in the early 1980s, if you can believe it
or not.

<p>

Well, that argument failed, and we have seen that with
television, telephone, cable, and now we are seeing it with the
computer and with the Internet.  It's the same old song, and it's
really nothing new that this new computer porn law is doing. 
It's just relatively different because it's a different medium.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Taking a look at some of these different transmission
issues right now, there's a new law in California dealing with
a new way of distributing pornography, newsstands, magazine racks
right next to other newspaper boxes that actually sell hard core
pornography. What's your involvement in that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: I love this new law in California.  For all its troubles 
with pornography, California has come up with some good, innovative 
laws to protect communities and families.  One such new law is a law 
against pornographic news racks.  What we are seeing springing up in 
California are news racks right on the street, next to the regular news, 
with hard core pornography.  So any child with 25 cents can receive
that magazine.

<p>

Well, there's a new law now that says those news
racks that distribute hard core porn cannot exist unless they
are supervised 24 hours a day by an adult, or unless they are
accessible only by adult tokens.  That makes sense, because then
adults can get the material that they might have a right to get,
but certainly children cannot.

<p>

That is causing such a stir in California, and we are filing a brief 
in support of that law. We think that law is fully constitutional. And 
actually, the consequences of this lawsuit are really grave.  If we 
were to lose this one, then I would venture to say we will see 
pornographic news racks popping up all over the country.  So this is a 
crucial case for communities and families.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Cathy, so much for being with us today on 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: You're welcome.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
begins our inside scoop from those who attended the 1996 National 
Education Summit.  Are America's leaders serious about making positive 
changes in our children's education?  Stay tuned to find out.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Reading, writing, and arithmetic were once the core of 
education. Yet there are students across the United States today who 
actually graduate from high school lacking these basic skills.

<p>

Clinton's national education standards and Goals 2000 both promised to 
fill the gap and prepare students for life.  But questions among parents
and educators arose regarding these standards.  Were children
going to be better educated, well read, insightful, and intellectual?
Or will they merely be illiterate but politically correct?

<p>

Burdened with the cost of teaching basic skills to many entry-level 
workers, corporate America decided to get involved.  Lou Gerstner, Jr.,
CEO and chairman of IBM, spearheaded a movement to evaluate our
education system and began by organizing the 1996 National Education
Summit.  Governors, CEOs, and policy makers from across the country,
including President Clinton, attended the summit in an attempt
to agree on a newly improved standard.

<p>

This commitment to educational excellence, which was documented and 
signed by all the governors, seemed like a step in the right direction. 
But what about the voices of those who were visibly not in attendance, 
including conservative leaders with strong grass-roots appeal, private 
school representatives, and, most importantly, parents?

<p>

Developing a sound education policy may not seem controversial, but 
experts agree that parents, educators, and corporate America still have
a long way to go.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To tell us just how far we have to go to actually see 
improvement in our children's education, I am joined by Robert 
Morrison, Family Research Council's Special Assistant to the 
President, whose experience at the Department of Education well 
prepared him for his policy role today.

<p>

We also have Michelle Easton, president of the Virginia State Board 
of Education.  As a representative of Governor Allen, Michelle has
acted as a key pro-family advocate.

<p>

And also joining us is Carolee Adams, who attended the 1996 National 
Education Summit on <i>Straight Talk</i>'s behalf, our own special 
correspondent.

<p>

They are all here to talk to us today, and welcome to the show.

<p>

Michelle, let's start with you.  You were there with Governor Allen, 
and although IBM organized the event, was very powerful as a force, 
ostensibly, everybody said, well, this is really a governors' event. 
So you were there with the governor.  Why don't you tell us the good
news, if there was any.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, there was some good news. Every governor was allowed 
to bring along one staff person and asked to bring one business person, 
and I was his staff person.

<p>

Governor Allen went to the meeting with some 
serious concerns about the policy summit statement that had been drafted, 
and he was very successful in persuading the other governors to make
some changes to that document, to make it more acceptable to those
of us who feel the Federal Government has almost no role in education;
that is for the states and localities to make decisions, and preferably
localities to the greatest extent possible.

<p>

He was given credit in the press for that. The <i>Washington Times</i> here, 
I have an article, the day after the summit:  &quot;Summit Policy Position 
Altered.&quot; And it says, &quot;Led by Governor Allen, they rewrote the 
policy statement to better reflect conservative views and reaffirm that
the states and not the Federal Government play the major role
in education.&quot;  So that was a success of the summit, that
all the governors voted for a statement, and the CEOs voted, also,
affirming that it is not the Federal Government where decisions
should be made about education; it is states and at the local
level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, you are experienced in education.  A
long time back, I remember Ronald Reagan was going to get rid
of the Department of Education, very much affirming the position
that the states had a role by getting rid of the federal role.
Obviously, that did not happen.

<p>

Maybe you can tell us at the beginning of our conversation, in a 
nutshell, what the bad news was.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, unfortunately, the summit had an opportunity
to really make some gains.  They could have talked very seriously
about what we think is the most important reform in education:
letting parents choose safe and effective schools for their children.

<p>

Regrettably, those who led the summit pushed that pretty much
off the agenda and ruled it out of order.  We think they are incorrect
in that respect.  When parents can choose an excellent public,
private, religious, or home school, that in itself brings about
high achievement, high standards, and safe schools.

<p>

It is an irony, because business, including Lou Gerstner, Jr., the 
chairman of IBM, they continue to tell us what it is they seek from 
our education system, what they are hoping to get from our graduates. 
The schools that we champion, the schools that we highly respect and 
encourage, are the very schools that do the job that business says it 
wants done.

<p>

So we think as more corporate executives who weren't perhaps
at the summit or whose voices weren't heard at the summit, especially
as those who are small business and entrepreneurs, those who are
actually responsible for 90 percent of the new jobs and new goods
and services, when they find out how much bureaucracy is going
to be added on as a result of Goals 2000, as a result of certificates
of initial mastery, we think they are going to join into a national
movement to repeal Goals 2000, get rid of the Department of Education,
and not to impose national standards and a national curriculum
on America's communities.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, Carolee, we were blessed to have our own special 
correspondent in you there, and you are also a home schooler yourself, 
and you certainly represent a new wave.  And it is interesting. Family 
Research Council has done some polling that home schoolers are made up 
by a lot of interesting constituencies -- some Perot people, some 
independent-minded people, real popular with certain 1960s radicals 
and conservative pro-family Americans. Did you see your interest in 
other kinds of educational opportunities represented?

<p>

MS. ADAMS: No, unfortunately. I certainly am a proponent of children, 
students, being accountable for things that they learn in school. In 
my community we are spending $16,500 a year per child to educate 
children, so they should be accountable.

<p>

However, we have chosen to home school for a number of different reasons. 

<p>

In my interview with one of the governors, I said to him, I brought to 
him the situation, I said -- it was Governor Tommy Thompson -- and I 
said, &quot;I'll bring to you a situation of a little boy by the name of 
Tommy. And Tommy is a real wiggly Willie, and he doesn't want to sit
still in his seat, and he can't read, can't write.  He is incorrigible.
His teacher doesn't know what to do with him, so his momma pulls
him out of school.&quot;

<p>

Now, if his momma hadn't pulled him out of school, we wouldn't have 
had all the lights, the camera, and the action, because it's Tommy 
Edison that I'm talking about. And so I asked Governor Thompson, I 
said, &quot;What are you going to do with a little boy by the name of 
Tommy Edison?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, we'll give him a second 
test.&quot;

<p>

This is where I feel we have a sincere problem of understanding about
different learning styles, the necessity of parental involvement,
and that standards are important, technology is important, but
there is a lot more to it than that, and home schoolers would
be encouraged, from Governor Thompson's words, to participate
in the forum, and I know that they already are being tracked with
certain types of governmental programs, and that is regrettable.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Virginia has been very lucky to have Governor Allen
taking a real leadership.  There are all kinds of educational
reforms out there, charter schools.  From your perspective at
a state level, why is the state better able to have a role in
education, and how can the states better accommodate people like
Carolee?

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, the state is better that the Federal
Government simply, plainly, common sense, because it's closer
to the people.  But the local level is even better in terms of
making decisions and spending money.

<p>

In Virginia, our local school districts have a tremendous amount 
of autonomy.  Now, there is a fair amount of money that comes from 
the state level, and it varies by jurisdiction. The poorer 
jurisdictions get more state money than the more affluent ones. 

<p>

But in Virginia what we have been trying to do under the leadership 
of Governor Allen and how his State Board of Education -- he has 
appointed the majority of members of that now; it took a couple of 
years to get that - is to have the state's role be very limited but 
very useful.

<p>

The first thing we did is we decided we wanted to set up 
some academic standards in the core academic areas of English, science,
math, and history.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pragmatic core subjects, not how do you feel about 
math but whether you can do it.

<p>

MS. EASTON: That's right. It took over a year. These are the standards
of learning here, and I have an 800 number if your listeners might
want to get a copy of them.  They are not perfect.  They are not
perfect by any means.  But you won't find in here anywhere how
do you feel about something.  It's what do you know, what do you
know.

<p>

This was our first step in trying to have the state set
a framework.  Now, we don't tell schools how to teach this.  We
don't tell them what books to use.  We don't tell them what methods
to use on the local level.  Now, these are public schools only.
In Virginia, mercifully, we leave the private schools alone pretty
much.

<p>

We set out the standards, then devise a set of state tests.
Did you learn this stuff?  The tests that our kids currently
take, for the most part, in the public schools are called norm-referenced
tests where they are measured against some mass of children, and
the results come out, and they are very confusing.  We want to
test kids, did you learn your history?  This is straightforward
history, kindergarten to 12th grade, a series of tests, and then
we want to publicize the results of those tests.

<p>

Then what happens? We want to let localities decide what to do.  We want 
to create a dynamic so there are rigorous academic standards, there are
good tests on them, a lot of information -- are you learning this
stuff?  Do you know your history?  Do you know your English? 
Do you know your science? -- and then let localities do what has
to be done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to want to hear that 800 number really fast 
and come back.

<p>

MS. EASTON: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Give us that 800 number.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  It is 1-800-292-3820.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Grab a paper and pencil.  You can write that again after
the break.  Please join us after the commercial break as we continue
to discuss educational change with our group of insiders.  Stay
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined again by some experts who are actively involved 
in efforts to restructure education. We have again Robert Morrison, 
special assistant to Gary Bauer at the Family Research Council; Michelle 
Easton, president of the Virginia State Board of Education; and Carolee 
Adams, a home-school mother and long-time education activist and our own 
<i>Straight Talk</i> correspondent. Thank you again for being with us. 

<p>

When we left before, we were taking a look at the fact that Virginia -- 
you know, a lot of the reason why people are upset about standards
is the standards have not been very academic; they have been quite
philosophical:  you know, how do you feel, what do you think about?
Virginia has tried to do something different, and you have an
800 number where people can get a sample.  Give that again.

<p>

MS. EASTON: Yes. It is 1-800-292-3820, our new, rigorous, knowledge-based,
academic Virginia standards.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Bob, you are tracking what all 50 states are doing 
and were at the governors' convention, National Education Summit, 
looking at all 50 states.  How does what Virginia is doing, pragmatic 
work, compare to what is happening or what you fear might happen?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, we are very complimentary of Virginia. We 
definitely approve of what Governor Allen has done in resisting the 
idea of further federal encroachments in the education area. We 
applauded when Governor Allen stood up very tall and straight and 
said, &quot;No, we don't want to do this. We want to go back and bring 
authority back to where it belongs, to localities, to elected school 
boards, to parents.&quot; Governor Allen has been a champion in that 
regard.

<p>

In other states, we commended Governor Merrill in New Hampshire [who] 
has not applied for Goals 2000 funding; Governor Keating in Oklahoma; 
Governor Foster in Louisiana. Out in California, Governor Wilson is not
taking Goals 2000 funding.  So we think there should be a national
move to resist the kind of bureaucratization of education and
the dumbing down, frankly, that has come from Goals 2000.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But, Bob, I think one thing that is interesting is a
lot of people have this very false perception that the Federal
Government is paying for education; that if we get rid of the
Department of Education, we have just de-funded our schools.

<p>

But you have an interesting formula.  It is like a dollar's worth,
one dollar in every hundred?

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Yes, right. In Montana I think the figure came out 
to something like $1.50 per student that they would have gained if 
they took the Goals 2000 money. But the Goals 2000 money works in 
another way.  It's not very much and it doesn't help you a whole 
lot, but as it is often said, the worm doesn't have to be very big 
to conceal the hook.  So if you just bite, you're hooked.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How is that?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, because Goals 2000 is very, very directive in
terms of what you are going to do.  You are going to have to restructure
your schools.  You are going to have to have your programs approved
of by various people.  Right now they've got a new entity that
may be approving of your standards in history, math, science,
and English.

<p>

We have already seen the initial efforts nationally
out there for history standards.  The first two efforts have been
a disaster.  The first effort was so horrible for national history
standards that the U.S. Senate voted 99 to 1 to reject them.

<p>

So they went back to the drawing board, and they said, &quot;Okay,
we are, after all, historical revisionists.  We can revise.&quot;

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So they took 15 months, they revised, and the second
set comes out, and they tell kids that in national history standards
we have to think that Goals 2000 is a good idea because these
standards endorse Goals 2000; we have to think that redesigning
the family, redefining the family, is a good idea because they
define the family in the history standards as a group from which
we receive love and support.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Well, that's nice, but that's not all families do and 
it's not all they are.

<p>

They also make a bid for equalization of school
funding.  What has this got to do with U.S. history, we might
ask.  Nothing.  That's the whole point.  A lot of what is in there
has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So what we find is that the Federal Government throws 
in maybe one dollar per child and then demands control over how you 
spend all the rest of your money.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  When I served in the U.S. Department of Education,
some of the career civil servants there, good folks that they
were, said, &quot;We couldn't be doing all these bonehead things,
Bob.  You got us all wrong. We only provide 6 percent of the funding,
just 6 cents out of the dollar.&quot;

<p>

So finally, after two weeks of orientation, I asked one of these fine 
folks, I said, &quot;Have you ever been to India?  Have you ever seen 
the mahouts in India? They are very small guys.  They only weigh about 
100 pounds. They only weigh about 6 percent of what the elephant weighs.
But they've got this stick, and when they jab the stick behind
the elephant's ear, the elephant goes the way they want him to.&quot;

<p>

And that is the problem we face.  Even when you have good reforms,
the Federal Government can make it impossible.  I just have one
example.  Ohio attempted to have an eighth grade reading requirement
for high school graduation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: And you would think that President Clinton would say, 
&quot;Good for you.  You're at least raising standards.&quot;  His 
Education Department sued the state of Ohio not because eighth grade was
too low but because it was too high.

<p>

MS. EATON:  And yet President Clinton came to the summit and gave a 
speech that could have been written by George Allen or Ronald Reagan, 
saying, &quot;Oh, we need to have tests; we need to have accountability; 
we need to hold children back when they don't perform.&quot;  It almost 
makes you feel that he says one thing and does another.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, imagine that.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  You know, George Allen is one
of my favorite choices for Bob Dole's Vice President, so I'm on
your side.  However, I will say this.  Governor Allen said to
me that this was not a tops-down procedure; this is a bottoms-up
procedure.  But I have a great concern that that isn't going to
happen that way.

<p>

As an example, at the final press conference,
Lou Gerstner got up.  He is the chairman of IBM.  He said that
these transcripts and the certificates of mastery, everything
is going to be ready in one year's time.  Now, if a child doesn't
have that transcript or doesn't have that certificate, then they
can't get a job.

<p>

Also, I sensed that the child is also going to
be geared -- I mean, this is the third wave.  This is your new
industrial revolution becoming a technological revolution.

<p>

I was reading Alvin Toffler's book about the third wave, and he cited
that when we were moving from an agrarian society in the early
1800s over to an industrial society that covertly the children
were being trained to do things in a methodical way; that they
were able to get up on time, be at school on time, do this on
time, so that they could get a job and be there from 9 to 5.

<p>

So whatever we are going to be educating the children in school today
is going to have to fit.  This is what the CEOs want, particularly
those who are using modern technology to a large degree.  They
are going to have these kids come in well trained to use technological
equipment.

<p>

I heard one of the governors say or one of the CEOs
say, &quot;We have enough lawyers.  We have enough philosophers.&quot;
However, we can't overlook the fact that we still need lawyers
and we still need philosophers, and education is not to give them
a job.  Education is for the sake of education.

<p>

I am not a liberal thinker at all, but I think the entire summit lost out 
[in that] the systemic problems of education were not addressed, and I 
believe Governor Ridge wanted to.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of time left, but maybe in one 
minute, Michelle, you could sum this up, because one thing that has 
not been addressed, this was really set up by corporate America for 
corporate America's goals, which are not necessarily the goals of a 
parent, that their child be well-rounded and well-read. Quickly, what 
would you see corporate America's goals were?

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, I think one reason the scope of the summit was so 
limited, and we didn't get into things like school choice and 
school-to-work and other issues like that, is when you have 50 
governors -- liberals, conservatives, Republicans,
Democrats -- to get them all to agree on something is very difficult.
So they focused very narrowly on standards and on more technology
in schools, and that was clearly what the CEOs wanted at this
particular meeting.  It was something they thought they could
get through, get everybody to vote for, and I think with some
of the changes that Governor Allen and some of the other conservatives
got in, where we keep stressing that there is not a federal role
in those things, it was successful in that sense.

<p>

But it is certainly true that there are many, many other issues that need 
to be addressed and discussed, and there are some CEOs that are more 
interested in training students for jobs, while others, big and small 
business, really are more interested in what many of us want, which is 
children with good basic skills and knowledge to come into the workplace
and then they will train them for the specific jobs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to find out if that's a brave new world
or a new horizon, and in a moment, when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns,
we'll hear about how our country's educational system is still
in need of an overhaul, and we'll find out more after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once again my guests, 
Robert Morrison, Michelle Easton, and Carolee Adams, all of whom 
attended the 1996 National Education Summit.

<p>

Now, Carolee, you were talking before the break about corporate
America, something which you are quite experienced in.  You were
a vice president for Citibank, I think, for 15 years and a manager
of people, and so I think you can appreciate the fact that you
would like your workers to read and write and use the computer.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  Oh, absolutely.  There is no doubt.  I mean, a large
corporation like IBM, as an example, spends an exorbitant amount
of money on training, retraining, I mean teaching them how to
read and write, but also college-level students.  I know a friend
of mine who works for a major consumer goods -- it's food products
-- and he has his Ph.D. in food chemistry.  He said, &quot;We
assume that when they get out of college, they know nothing. 
We retrain them from the beginning.&quot;  So the corporations
have to cut back on their expenses.  They are very competitive.
The words that kept emanating out of the conference were, &quot;We
want to compete in a global marketplace.&quot;  So the children
have to come in well trained.

<p>

However, I am deeply concerned that this entire philosophy is not 
akin to the American spirit.  We have not heretofore before -- and I 
think Governor Hunt said this -- we have never done this before, and there 
is a book out called <i>The Coming Revolution in Education</i> by a Professor 
Boyce out of the University of Georgia, and he said that we haven't in 
the past created a school system to really fill jobs, and --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But is that the purpose of our school system?  I mean,
is that an appropriate purpose?  Schools make just workers?

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  No, that's not.  The purpose of the school is to educate
them.  A liberal education is supposed to give them an opportunity,
particularly your K-12 grades. They are there to experiment with
a lot of different things. Am I going to be a great mathematician,
a scientist, an artist, a wonderful mother?  I mean, that is something
that -- you know, they are dropping out home economics out of
a lot of courses in high school.  That's not required.  I have
a real problem with that, and so that is for colleges to do.

<p>

I was at a conference on the stock market on Wall Street, and there
was a gentleman, head of a major exchange, and he kept talking
about how the CEOs and the teachers were going to revamp the educational
system.  No, no, no.  It's parents and students [who] have to
be included, and I found that missing at the education summit.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Did you find that missing, as well, Bob, because
I know that is one of your primary concerns, that we are losing
the purpose of education.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, sure.  One of the things that -- we share this 
with business at all levels. Parents have a great stake in a quality 
education for their children. They also have a great economic stake in 
their children's education. You will find very few parents who are 
indifferent, don't care whether their children are able to get a job 
after they finish high school or college.

<p>

So there's a tremendous incentive for parents to get the best education 
for their kids. When parents can choose their children's schools, they 
routinely choose a school that will have high standards.  No parent wants 
[his child] to go to a school that does poorly and that kids are ill 
prepared, and the parents are very harsh when they find that that's what
the school has done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What is the statistic?  I mean, certainly in Washington, 
D.C., the President and the Vice President both send their children to 
faith-based private institutions. You were telling me the other day 
that the majority of public school teachers' children were also in 
private schools.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: In many major city school systems, you will find 30, 40 
percent, 50 percent in some.  One of the debates with Keith Geiger, the
president of the National Education Association, when Bill Bennett
charged him and said that 50 percent of Chicago teachers had their
kids in private schools, and Geiger said, &quot;No, it's only
40 percent.&quot;

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Well, four out of ten.  The other teachers had their kids in suburban 
school districts.

<p>

Our point is that there are excellent public schools, excellent private, 
religious, and home schools.  Parents choose the best school they can 
get.

<p>

As to the summit and the failure that we saw in the 
summit, it is [that] the difficulty is the old New Hampshire phrase, 
&quot;You can't get there from here.&quot;  By taking over more and more
power to a national entity, they are describing a new board, a
new agency, a new creation that they want to build which will
have power to bully states that are good --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us about that.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Many of the CEOs and many of the governors
were very supportive of a notion in the draft summit statement,
which we did manage to amend somewhat, which would have created
a new national organization -- just what we need -- to help states
share information about creating standards and reform, to compare
standards to each other, to European nations.

<p>

Governor Allen said, &quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute.  This makes me 
uncomfortable. It has the smell of a governmental thing.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Oh, no, no, no, it's not governmental, just all of us getting 
together.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;Why do we need it?  If you want Virginia's 
standards, get on the Internet, get to our web site.  There you've got 
them. Do you want to talk to us about how we did it?  Give us a 
call.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Oh, well, we need it to help us coordinate and do this more
effectively.&quot;

<p>

What he did manage to do was to give us all
respite on it, and they took the language out of the statement
that said this would happen instantly, and it was made into they'll
come back with a proposal in July to the governors.  But, I mean,
what a worrisome thing.  Just what we need, another national organization,
another bureaucracy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And what would it do?  I mean, what would it do that 
the Department of Education hasn't done badly?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Set the standards, set the tests, and decide
what happens to the kids or the schools or the administrators
if the kids don't pass the tests.

<p>

Now, some of the things that are going to happen if you don't get the 
certificate of initial mastery are you won't get a driver's license, 
you won't be able to get a job at 16 or at 18 or go to college.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So what would home schoolers do, for example?  Are they 
going to be --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  They will conform or else.

<p>

MS. ADAMS: That is what Governor Thompson said. &quot;They will be 
encouraged.&quot; And so I think that that is --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Government doesn't encourage.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  Those were kind words.  I found people
speaking differently throughout my interviews.  This was going
to be, you know, bottoms up not a tops down.  I think it's tops
down.  I think we have to be honest about this.  For the most
part, not all states perhaps, but if you're going to have an IBM
which gets people from every one of our states, then those 50
states are going to have to -- somebody in Idaho is going to say,
&quot;Well, I want my child to work for IBM.&quot;  &quot;Well,
you don't participate in the program.&quot;  And they are going
to be encouraged to participate, home schoolers, private schools.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Which is a Soviet system.  I mean, let's be honest.
The Soviet system preprograms your path and you get there --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  It is much more -- it is actually probably more
-- to be fair about it, they are talking openly.  Mark Tucker
of the National Center on Education and the Economy urged Hillary
and Bill Clinton to take a page from the German book. <i>Newsweek</i>
magazine says we're going to move toward a German system.

<p>

But <i>Newsweek</i>'s business section, in the same issue, April 8, 
talked about the German system and the &quot;German disease&quot; --
12 percent unemployment rate, higher than that youth unemployment
rate, great concern, skinhead phenomena, a little bit of the kind
of Pink Floyd record, just another brick in the wall.

<p>

MS. EATON: The problem with the European model is when you take a kid 
in tenth grade or ninth grade and you train him for one job and then
that company goes bust or he gets fired for some reason, and he
is not prepared to shift to another corporation, to another job.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think we have gone for a broad vision in America.

<p>

You get our last comment.

<p>
MS. ADAMS:  Oh.  I have encouraged the CEOs that I have met, if they're 
going to work hard to improve their bottom line, they do as much as they 
can to lobby congress to enable parents to parent once again, whether 
that be increased tax exemptions or some method of reducing the $484 
billion a year that we spend on education rather foolishly right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have been privileged to have you all with us, and I hope 
people will call for your standards, or you can call the Family Research
Council.

<p>

When you return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you a clip from
Gary Bauer's appearance on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>. We will hear what
Gary has to say about education.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>.

<p>

Gary Bauer made an appearance on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> following
a decision made by a Queens, New York, school superintendent who
advocated teaching first graders that the homosexual lifestyle
was the moral equivalent of marriage.  Gary met some hard and
fast opponents when discussing this issue with Bob Beckel(?) and
Deborah Haffner(?), executive director of the Sex Information
and Education Council.

<p>

Let's hear what Gary has to say as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

[Segment from CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, December 8, 1992, follows:]

<p>

MR. BECKEL: -- Gary, two pages out of 430 or so in a recommended
curriculum.  You guys take this thing and the yahoos in Queens
take this thing, and they blow it into a big deal.  We talk about
it on television.  Isn't this really what -- let's talk about
it for what it is.  It's fodder for you guys to put in your direct
mail pieces to raise a lot of money to fund your right-wing causes
under the guise of pro-family, when really what you are is a reactionary
crowd who are cutting out a whole segment of society.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Bob, you know, you are in your usual emotionalism.  Nobody 
sent any direct mail to the Hispanic and black parents in the Queens
School District who are vehemently objecting to the idea that
their children ought to be taught that homosexuality is normal
and on a par with the heterosexual family.

<p>

If Deborah wants to read <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> to her children 
at home, that's her business.  But when she and Fernandez and others try 
to take our tax money to teach first graders that these are acceptable 
lifestyles, they are crossing a line that has nothing to do with direct 
mail.

<p>

You don't have a right to overrule parents when they feel uncomfortable
about teaching their children something.  The parents of Queens
have been very clear about this.  They don't want their 6- and
7-year-olds being taught about strange lifestyles.  They want
their kids to be taught reading, writing, the history of this
country.  If the schools in New York would do that, they would
turn out successful students.

<p>

MS. HAFFNER: Gary, what about --

<p>

MR. BAUER: I would love to see parents have a chance to vote
on that.

<p>

MR. BECKEL: The parents just decide everything in the school?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  On controversial social matters, parents ought
to have a right to tell how their tax dollars are going to be
used, not to vote on what history is going to be taught, not to
vote about what math is going to be taught, but when you get into
areas of values, parents have a right to have input.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with 
us to hear how you can get more information regarding these issues 
affecting you and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to receive more 
information about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week we will be discussing an issue not often seen in secular 
news coverage:  religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world.  We will hear how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?  We'll find out 
next week as we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
delves into an issue which Americans seem immune to, Christian 
persecution. Within the last year, many eyes have been truly opened 
through the people with whom we will speak tonight to the plight of 
Christians around the globe.

<p>

Last week a front-page <i>Washington Times</i> article
told of the tragic life of Robert Hussein.  In 1977 he had a brief
encounter with Christianity while in the United States, and he
decided to learn more by persistent Bible reading.  After much
thought, he accepted Christ as his personal savior.  Two years
ago, he publicly called himself a Christian and began witnessing
in his Islamic-run homeland.  Since then, Mr. Hussein has been
rejected by his family, including his two small children, arrested,
and threatened with death.  But his story is not unique, and you
will hear more about these tragedies and what is being done to
save these lives later in the show.

<p>

But, first, those of you watching the show are going to witness 
some Family Research Council history in the making.  Still under 
construction, a bit of FRC's future was taped just yesterday so 
<i>Straight Talk</i> viewers could get the inside scoop from Doug 
Werk, Vice President for Administration.

<p>

Thanks to the generosity of two Michigan families, FRC will go
a new direction later this year.  To learn more, let's go Behind
the Headlines.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, a lot of people may wonder why we are standing here 
in front of the National Museum of American Art.  But this is a very
exciting location for Family Research Council's future, and you
as the Vice President for Administration have really been working
on a dream to make something happen.  Could you tell us why we
are here at G and Eighth Street?

<p>

MR. WERK: 801 G Street, Kristi, and you are absolutely right.  It really 
is a dream come true for us at Family Research Council, because we are 
in need of a new home, and this is where our new home is going to be. We 
are going to be the primary tenants of a building that I am going
to tell you about in just a few minutes.

<p>

But I want to point out why this particular place is so important, this 
particular area. Not only is this National Museum of Art a beautiful 
edifice, but over here you have the Martin Luther King Library, which is
important to the entire Washington, D.C., area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's a very big research library.

<p>

MR. WERK: Oh, it is, and a lot is accomplished there for this city.

<p>

On the opposite corner, cater-cornered in back of this new construction 
here, will be the home of the Secret Service, where we will have 2,900 
Secret Service agents patrolling this area.

<p>

You see that large building down at the end of the block there with the 
glass walkover. That's a large office complex, and there is also a huge 
shopping center there.

<p>

This is an historic church right there with that dome on
it.  This is the Baptist church of downtown Washington, D.C.,
Calvary Baptist Church, which happens to house the Young Life
for the District of Columbia.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of our viewers are involved in Young Life, and that's 
an exciting organization.

<p>

MR. WERK:  It really is.  Chinatown, of course, is on the back
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One block over and there you are.

<p>

MR. WERK: One block and there you are.

<p>

But I think, also, we should point out that these large cranes over 
here are preparing the hole for the new sports arena complex. And so, 
right around the corner and down the block will be the brand new sports 
arena.  And so it is an exciting area and an exciting time for us as we 
prepare for our new home.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Take us through that building. We've got six floors, Doug. 
Maybe you could just run through what is going to be located on each 
floor, more or less, and then we are going to get to go see the site a 
little bit closer up.

<p>

MR. WERK:  There are a couple of things that I want to point out.
First of all, we could only go up so high.  We could only build
a building as tall as the National Museum of Art.  And so that's
the reason for the six floors.

<p>

Also, we had to put a certain amount of space into a museum. So the 
bottom floor is going to be all public-access area. On the right-hand 
side as you enter the building from G Street, we will have a museum, we 
will have some history not only of our country but history of the Family 
Research Council. We will have a bookstore there where folks can come 
and pick up materials that we produce, as well as outside materials.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are some exciting things for kids to do there,
too, with computers.

<p>

MR. WERK:  Absolutely.  We'll have some interactive computers that 
the kids and all family members can use.

<p>

The second floor will be where the administrative group will have its 
offices. On the third floor we will have our resource development 
group. The fourth floor will be our executive wing, where Gary Bauer
will be housed, and also, we will be able to have our board of
directors' meetings in a very large conference room.

<p>

The fifth floor is policy group, and a lot of the research and analysis
work will be done on the fifth floor. And the sixth floor is kind
of an area where --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To be announced.

<p>

MR. WERK: To be announced.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are here on the actual site right now with Andy 
Busey(?), who is our project superintendent kind of managing the site, 
and I know Doug has said great things about you. How long does a 
six-floor building like this -- we've got one level of parking -- how 
long does something like this normally take?

<p>

MR. BUSEY: Generally about a year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: About a year. So our project -- how are we doing on our time
frame?

<p>

MR. BUSEY: Oh, we're doing pretty good.  We are going to
be right in there, a little bit less than that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, it's exciting.  Andy, thanks so much, and we're going 
to look forward to seeing the building.

<p>

MR. BUSEY: All right. Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So, Doug, we are on the fourth floor, which
is as high as they would like us to go and still be safe.

<p>

Well, Doug, we are standing in a building that has represented your
passion and your time and really a life's work, in a way.  What
are you most looking forward to?

<p>

MR. WERK: I think I am looking forward to the day when we can cut the 
ribbon and actually take possession and see what God has for us here in 
Washington to further the work that we do.  That's going to be exciting 
for me. It's going to be the culmination of a lot of earnest, hard 
effort, and I am excited to see the excitement of our people as we 
move over here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And for our friends and supporters from
across the country who are going to be seeing this segment, when
can they come to Washington and see this building that you have
been working on?

<p>

MR. WERK:  I am hopeful that we will move in sometime in the first 
two weeks of November, and shortly after that, we are going to have 
a ribbon-cutting for our staff and invited guests.  Then we are going to 
have an open house, and we are going to invite any and all that would 
want to see our home, not only in the District but from across the 
country. So that is going to be fun to do, probably before the end of 
the year and the winter sets in again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, when they do, I hope that our friends and supporters 
take the time to write to Doug Werk and let him know what a great job he 
has done. Thanks so much for being with us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

MR. WERK:  Thanks for having me, Kristi. Appreciate it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares with you a man who courageously raised his voice for those who 
have no voices of their own as they suffered persecution for their 
faith. Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Every week, millions of Americans put on their Sunday 
best and attend the church service of their choice, whether it be 
Catholic, Protestant, Episcopal, Baptist, or any other denomination. 
For the many Americans who walk up those church steps or sit in a 
synagogue pew or conduct weekly Bible studies in their homes, it can 
be easy to take for granted the freedom to worship that we share with 
our countrymen.

<p>

Only recently in cases such as school prayer have Americans even
questioned their religious liberty.  Yet, throughout the world,
millions of people daily risk their lives by taking a stand for
their belief in Jesus Christ.  Persecution, including torture,
slavery, exile, and death, tests the faith of those who refuse
to deny their savior, and their stories are told in headlines
from the <i>New York Times</i> to church bulletins.

<p>

In Sudan alone, 1.5 million people died at the hands of Islamic rulers, 
and at least 25,000 children, some as young as six years old, have 
been documented as being sold into slavery.  These outrageous acts of 
persecution sweep across the continents, from the Middle East to Thailand,
to Africa, to China.

<p>

Recently the Clinton Administration has been criticized for ignoring 
these atrocities while conducting business as usual with those who 
perform them.  In testimony before the House International Relations 
Subcommittee earlier this year, witnesses presented a cry for help 
for the lives of those suffering and for U.S. involvement in stopping 
the slaughter.

<p>

[Congressional testimony segment follows:]

<p>

WITNESS: So far, the U.S, Government has largely turned a deaf ear 
to this rising tide of terrorism and these human rights violations.

<p>

[End of congressional testimony segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yet, today, little has changed.  As government
officials mull over these proceedings and lives continue to be
lost, people of faith consider the words of the psalmist:  &quot;For
your sake, we face death all day long.  We are considered sheep
to be slaughtered.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As we just saw, and as shocking as it may seem, millions 
continue to lose their lives for their faith even today.  To share with 
us an expos&eacute; of these worldwide travesties is Michael Horowitz, a 
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and director of the Project for 
Civil Justice Reform.  Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Glad to be here. Where's your helmet, by the way?  You left 
it somewhere.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I left my helmet in the office.

<p>

Michael, I can't think of anyone better to talk to us about what is 
happening to people of faith around the world, and it is ironic that 
that job is distilled almost to one man.  How did you get involved 
with that?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, you have overstated it.  There's a
growing army of people.  It has in a way been easier for me to
do it, and really, to answer your question, I'm a Jew, and it
has been much easier for me, therefore, to blow the whistle, to
prod, to provoke, and to shame Christian leaders into taking the
kind of action they can.

<p>

You know, we have people, like the people
coming on your next segment, who have been the flickering candles
trying to keep this word alive.  My job has been to broadcast
the extraordinary work that they have done, and I have been one
of many in doing it.  But as a Jew, it has been easier in many
ways for me to do it, and for one particular reason.  Christians
around the world today have become the targets of choice for the
thug regimes around the world, the radical Muslim regimes, the
remnant Communist regimes.

<p>

What is going on with Christians, particularly
evangelicals and Catholics, is so similar to what happened with
Jews in Europe as Hitler came to power.  Three things.

<p>

<li>First, the bad guys could demonize them.  They're different. They 
provoke envy, and they're powerless.  And, also, they represent -- 
Christians do -- threats to these thug regimes.  Because of their 
faith, they're beyond the reach of bribes and threats, which is what
these regimes live on.

<p>

<li>Two, the elites -- governments -- don't care.  At our best, our 
government has been indifferent.  Typically, we have been hostile to 
the claims of Christians who have been persecuted.  You know, the
elites in Washington, when they think Christians, they think,
Oh, these are the persecutors.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is how they are described time and time 
again.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Sure. And in Bosnia, a terrible story, just fills all of 
their predispositions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  But the idea that Christians are the victims -- as 
indeed they are, more than any other group in the world, and by orders 
of magnitude, and reigns of terror against them are growing -- is so 
foreign to the way Washington insiders and elites and national media 
tend to think, that we have been hostile to them.

<p>

<li>And, finally, the Christian community has been silent, just as the 
Jewish community was as Hitler began to rise to power.  And I'm not 
going to let that happen as long as I have any voice within me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You said earlier that although the Christians are 
powerless, they are envied in these countries.  Why would they be 
envied?  If they're powerless, if they are merely trying to live 
moral, quiet lives, what provokes envy?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, of course, they are successful to the
extent they are given a chance to be.  They live lives of faith.
They are powerless against mob sentiment whipped up against them.
Within their communities, often you find charges of apostasy
being weighed in against good, popular, successful teachers, successful
businessmen.  It's easy to get your competitor out of business
if you wave and scream, call him a Christian, then get a bunch
of mobs to burn down his home.  And that's what is going on.

<p>

Governments around the world are spending millions to make tapes, 
scurrilous tapes, calling Christians evil, worse than that, and these 
tapes are circulating.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Not unlike the films the Nazi government
made.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Precisely, precisely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Have you been surprised, after what we witnessed in the 
Holocaust -- and it has got to be the most documented event in history, 
the demonization of a race and a faith to the point that they could
justify that kind of mass murder.  But then we see today Christians
in the Sudan being crucified, murdered, sold into slavery.  Are
you surprised that this could happen again, it seems to me very
quickly?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Nothing surprises me on this Earth. When
good men and women remain silent, anything is possible.

<p>

Now, again, we don't have that kind of holocaust that the Jews 
experienced except, as you point out, in Sudan.  It's getting there. 
As Nina will say, as Mr. Jacobson will say, we've got as many as 
30,000 Christian children yanked from their homes by a radical 
Muslim regime and sold into slavery.  That's going on.  And yet 
here's Farrakhan going to the head of Sudan and calling himself a 
great ally and no voice raised against it.

<p>

Well, we've got to raise our voices.  And when we do, as we are now 
beginning to do, as the Christian community is beginning to do, people 
are listening. The <i>Washington Post</i> the other day had an 
extraordinary column entitled &quot;Christians Have Rights, Too.&quot; 
The writer, who is the deputy editor of the editorial page, said that 
we in the <i>Post</i>, in the media, are responsible for not taking 
seriously these kinds of claims, and he said that this was an important
movement.  He called it the most interesting foreign policy issue
of 1996, and he said if the Christian community organizes, it
will make foreign policy harder with Saudi Arabia, with China,
but, he said, lives will be saved. And I think we're going to
save some lives here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a Jewish gentleman, you are correct, your voice rings 
even more resolutely when you speak on these things, and there has 
been a kind of quiet growth of a partnership of Jewish men and women 
of faith with Christian men and women of faith.  You look at the 
Judeo-Christian heritage. It's easy to understand why.  And yet that 
has not been common. Why do you think there has been that quiet 
gathering, and why you particularly?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I think, in the wake of
the Holocaust, the Christian community has understood the price
that always gets paid, ultimately, when there is a kind of religious
bias that goes on.  But there is something else that has happened
that has been so interesting in this case.

<p>

As I began to write about the persecution of Christians, I would be 
greeted with silence from the Christian community, and I would say to 
some of the leaders of the Christian community, &quot;You know, if I 
had written about anti-Semitism going on, you would be overwhelming me 
with phone calls saying, 'How can we help?'&quot;  Because the 
campaign against Soviet anti-Semitism, one of the most successful human 
rights campaigns in recent history, would not have been possible without
the active commitment of the Christian community.  And so I said,
&quot;How can you be so powerful, so caring, so moral, so strong
in your voice when Jews have been involved, as they were in the
Soviet Union, and so silent when your own are at stake?&quot;

<p>

That question cannot really be answered, and I think it has been
one of the things that has moved leaders of the Christian community
to the kind of action they have taken.  Now we have people like
Jim Dobson, Gary.  Chuck Colson has been an extraordinary leader.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A powerful voice.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Richard Land of the Southern Baptists; they have begun 
raising their voices. And the National Association of Evangelicals 
issued an extraordinary statement of conscience on this subject.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more about this in a second. 

<p>

Please join us after the commercial break as we share with you more 
courageous and tragic stories of those standing for their faith. Stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined by people who have witnessed the horrors of 
Christian persecution and are making efforts to save lives around the 
world. I welcome back Michael Horowitz, director of the Project for 
Civil Justice Reform; James Jacobson, president of Christian 
Solidarity International; and Nina Shea, director of Freedom House's 
Puebla Program on Religious Freedom.  Thank you for being with us, 
everyone.

<p>

We were just talking with Michael at the beginning about kind of the 
context in which we have found silence.  But you all certainly have not
been silent, and your voices are being heard more loudly.

<p>

Nina, let's start with you.  Your organization focuses on the kinds
of tangible persecution that occurs.  What have you all witnessed?

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is correct, Kristi.  We have been monitoring and
testifying in Congress, writing about persecution of Christians
in China, in Vietnam and Sudan.  We have sent missions to these
places.  China has one of the largest Christian movements in the
world today, rivaling our own, and they are the most persecuted
in the world in China. China has more Christians in prison than
any other country in the world, and we have cases, for example,
of one man who is an evangelical Protestant who is in prison now
for three years because he, quote, propagated the book of Genesis.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What does that mean?  Because you hear propagation
of the gospel and proselytizing.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  He was simply holding a Bible study session in his home. 
It's called the house church movement. They are underground. They are 
arrested and punished severely if they are caught.  So they are not 
allowed to have their churches.  They meet in their homes and read the 
Bible, they sign hymns.

<p>

Mike Horowitz is absolutely right in saying that
the West has been indifferent to the fate of these people.  Our
own Ambassador Sasser went to China this winter, in February.
I met with him a few days before he went, and he had never even
heard of the house church movement at the time that I met with
him.  That was a couple of days before he left.  Though he was
well briefed on other important human rights issues in China,
he had never heard of the house church movement and knew nothing;
he was totally ignorant about the fact that they are being persecuted.

<p>

We have another person in prison on our case list, in our database,
from China who was simply praying without authorization, was the
charge against him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So what? They have to apply for a permit to pray?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How can you pray with authorization?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  They have to register with a Communist, atheist-controlled 
organization in order to pray.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And then the penalty for that would be prison.
I prayed without the permit.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Prison.  Prison and hard labor. They are forced to work 
virtually as slaves in motorcycle factories, in brick factories, 
for 13 years, 20 years, indefinite sentences, because there is no 
due process in China.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to go to James and hear a little bit 
about the Sudan, but I wanted to touch first on -- it has to be 
frustrating, then, for you, with China, to have most favored nation 
status, to consistently get economic benefits while at the same time we
see huge human rights violations.

<p>

There was actually a cartoon -- I think it was in the <i>Washington 
Post</i> this week -- where it showed Bill Clinton straddling two boats. 
One said &quot;China's Economic Future&quot;; one said &quot;China's 
Human Rights Violations,&quot; and he was doing a little splits, 
trying to hold the two together.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  That's right.  Well, unless and until the Christian
churches raise their voices, human rights is always going to lose
out in the MFN debate, because the commercial interests are intense,
and they are lobbying, and the Christian voices are very weak
at this point.  We must start speaking out for our brethren who
are being persecuted in China and in Sudan and in Vietnam.  We
have a lot of influence in Vietnam, a lot of influence in Saudi
Arabia, where there is not a single Christian church allowed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MS. SHEA: Even our own -- and this is another example of insensitivity 
of the West -- even American citizens are not being defended by our 
government in their right to practice religious freedom.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Saudi Arabia is an interesting example where the 
embassy recently said that they were going to fight the government to 
be sure that pornography was distributed in Saudi Arabia, which was 
against their faith, but they went ahead and shut down the on-base, 
on-embassy church because that was offensive.  An interesting kind of 
decision to make.

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is right, yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sudan, though, I know has been chilling a lot of people 
because prison and torture, these things are real and terrible, and we 
are hearing about crucifixions from Sudan.  What has your organization, 
James, found to be true?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Yes.  Christians around the world need our help,
support, and prayers now more than ever.  We really welcome Mr.
Horowitz and his voice crying out in the wilderness, basically,
on this issue.

<p>

In Sudan, though, the horrors of radical Islam
are really magnified there like never before.  We have a situation
where the government of Sudan is controlled by this radical group
called the National Islamic Front, and anybody that doesn't convert
to their radical branch of Islam is basically -- they must convert
or die.  We have tremendous, incredible stories coming out of
Sudan.  My organization has spent a great deal of time there with
workers in the country doing everything we can to help alleviate
the situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have to think that those workers are in fear for their 
own lives while they are there.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: Absolutely.  They risk their own lives and livelihoods. 
A lot of our co-workers have families, and we have a lot of prayer 
before they go in.  We really emphasize that, prayer protection before
they go into these places.

<p>

But in Sudan we have a situation where, that we know of, about 1.5 
million people have been killed.  We have a situation where there 
are between 5 and 6 million refugees. My organization can confirm 
about 25,000 children that have been taken into slavery.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And when you say taken into slavery, there have been 
some recent articles about sex slaves, labor slaves.  What kind of 
slavery, if you could be, unfortunately, more graphic for our 
viewers?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Yes.  I don't know how graphic I should be for this, 
but you can just imagine.  It is true. The young ladies are taken 
and used as sex slaves, concubines. The young men, they are used as 
things such as human blood banks for the army of the National Islamic 
Front.  Slave branding goes on. Every type of just horrible job, these 
slaves are given.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Mike, you were talking earlier about a lot of people
hear what is happening in Sudan and see some of the Islamic countries
being so brutal and are fearful of some of what that means in
terms of the impact of the Islamic faith.  But you had a point
that you wanted to make on that.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I am so glad you raised it, because what is really 
going on here is an effort by crazy, radical thugs to hijack one of the 
great faiths of the world.  For much of its history, Islam was as 
welcoming of strangers as Judaism and Christianity; in some decades even
more so.  And so what you have are these radical guys using religion
to perpetrate murder and intolerance.  That is what is really
going on.

<p>

One of the most compelling things that has come out
of this effort that we have been making are the voices we have
heard from the moderate Muslims in these countries who are also
targets of death by these thugs, and they say to us, &quot;Thank
God you're raising it.  Create a constituency in America to protect
the weakest, to stand up to these thugs, and we will be protected.
Democracy will be preserved.&quot;

<p>

That is the case always. When thugs want to practice murder and 
death and kill democracy, what they do is pick a vulnerable 
religious community and make them scapegoats and torture them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is an interesting trend.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Stop that; you've stopped the thugs.  And
that is what the Muslims are telling us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nina, I know that you have seen these same kinds of things, 
this horrific abuse of faith to kill those who don't convert.  What are 
you seeing as you look worldwide?  What trends are moving your 
organization?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Well, what we are seeing is, in the aftermath of the
Cold War, Christian persecution coming to the fore, and it is
emerging in the remnant Communist countries.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why do you think that is?  Why the remnant Communist 
countries?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  They are terrified of Christian churches because they have
a transcendent truth.  They do not believe that the Communist
Party and the Communist ideology is their ultimate power.  And
they also resist corruption and bribery and uphold the dignity
of the individual, which is an anathema to Communist ideology.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So a democracy that might be based on faith -- you
know, &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident&quot; -- that
is threatening.

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to hear more about this in a 
second.  I want to come back to that point. When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about efforts to fight global Christian 
persecution and how you can become involved in helping save lives. 
Join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once again tonight's 
guests, who are battling for the lives of those standing for their 
religious faith around the world: Michael Horowitz, James Jacobson, 
and Nina Shea.  Welcome back to the show.

<p>

For people who are connoisseurs of news, which I
must say our viewers really are, when you are looking at the newspaper,
trouble spots come to mind.  I would say we would all agree that
Sudan would seem to be the most egregious example of what is going
on.  But what else?  Where else in the country should people be
watching?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Great swaths of the Middle East and Northern
Africa, in the Muslim world; for example, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan, even Egypt, Iraq, Iran.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Very powerful and in the news.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: I would only add here, it's not only the official 
government action.  Often you have, quote, friendly
governments like Pakistan, like Ethiopia, with which I am particularly
familiar, where the government is weak and appeases the radical
terrorists.  And when we are silent here, it means there is only
one squeaky wheel on that issue, and so the terrorists are given
rein.  So Egypt, Pakistan, and Ethiopia are three countries where
the presidents of the countries probably would abhor that kind
of thing and yet where the terror is phenomenal and growing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It has been interesting to see the Clinton Administration
commend the leaders of some of these very countries that seem
to be most appalling, and we are certainly seeing Bill Clinton
right now reach out particularly to China and Asia, and that seems --

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is right.  China and Vietnam are two big abusers
of religious freedom for Christians.

<p>

That brings up another point, which is the insensitivity of the 
administration in certain aspects regarding Christian persecution. 
For example, political asylum. Christians have a very difficult 
time getting political asylum in this country.  We know of a case 
of a Sudanese Christian whose employer was assassinated for his 
faith.  He was told by his bishop to leave the country to save his 
life.  He got here, and he has been in an immigration prison for the 
last three years awaiting deportation. His application was turned 
down because he could not define the doctrine of transubstantiation, 
a doctrine which Catholic priests study for a year in theology school, 
to the satisfaction of an immigration judge.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Think of this, Kristi.  This is a country founded as a 
haven for victims of religious persecution.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: And here we are turning, shutting the gates to Christian
victims of persecution.  You know, the administration has issued
guidelines saying that if somebody has, if a woman has a feminist
complaint, and they are often real, open the doors.  But I once
went to one of the leading immigration lawyers, told her about
a case of my Ethiopian friend whose has been hung upside down
for hours as pastor of the leading secret evangelical church,
had hot oil poured on his feet, had his feet lashed with steel
cables, was arrested after he returned to Ethiopia after years
of exile, told the immigration lawyer about it.  I said, &quot;Can
you get asylum for him?&quot;  She said, &quot;Can he pass through
the eye of a needle?&quot;  That is really what our government
is doing.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  In our organization, we are trying to
get the administration to do something even more basic than immigration
policy, and that is just to recognize that these things are going
on.  They ignore it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. To acknowledge it.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Just to acknowledge it.  We want them to recognize
it and condemn it.

<p>

One of the activities that we have launched into is a national 
petition drive on Sudan.  We just want President
Clinton to speak out on behalf of these persecuted Christians
in Sudan.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You can hear the President talk about
opening the doors for asylum for homosexuals and opening the doors
for asylum possibly for women who face female circumcision, but
not for Christians being crucified.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: That is correct.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  A perfect example of that was at the Beijing Women's
Conference that the United Nations held last summer.  That conference
produced a 127-page document on abuses against women around the
world, and they were all sorts of abuses, everything from environmental
to financial abuses, and so forth, spousal abuse.

<p>

There was not a single mention of chattel slavery in that document. To 
me that would be absolutely the first thing I would put in there, is the
fact that Christian women and girls are being sold into slavery
for as little as $15, the price of two chickens, in Sudan.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And you would think that would be offensive.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: And the First Lady is so outspoken on children's rights 
and children's issues.  Why is she ignoring 25,000 children being enslaved 
in Sudan?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: It is beyond imagination, really.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  But, you know, one of the things -- I am
not even looking for the administration to recognize the problem;
I want the President to live up to promises that his administration
made as our movement first began and then reneged on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And there was pivotal meeting on that.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. We had a great meeting that Nina hosted with 
Christian leaders from around the country. Jim was there.  Major 
Christian leaders of major churches with major ministries.  Gary Bauer 
was, of course, there.

<p>

After that movement, the President and the administration made 
two commitments:  one, that they would appoint an advisor to the 
President for religious persecution, with real power to
investigate and report; and, two, that he would make a speech
to the National Association of Evangelicals on the subject.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Two rather simple things.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. After the president of the National Association was 
called into the Oval Office to speak with the President, who said, 
&quot;I'd like to do it,&quot; two weeks later, the NAE got a phone call 
from the White House saying, &quot;You know, we don't think the President
can do it.  There's not enough money in his budget to fly to your
convention in Minneapolis,&quot; said a White House official to
the NAE.

<p>

We want to hold the feet of the President to the fire.
You know, he could have been such a hero, even in political terms,
to the Christian community.  And yet the lobbyists from the State
Department, from Saudi Arabia, from the business-as-usual crowd
in China got to him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Well, he would have been a hero if he had done it, and I 
would have happily participated in helping the President gain credit 
for doing the right thing. He is doing the wrong thing.  We need to
hold his feet to the fire.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes.  There was apparently money to fly to the sticks 
to throw a log in a ditch but not money to fly to talk about 
Christians being sold and murdered.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: To make matters worse, as Nina mentioned earlier, we have 
an ambassador to China who has never heard of the house church movement.
So not only do they not live up to promises, but they send an
ambassador there that has never heard of the house church movement
in China, which is amazing.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Richard Land, who is the director of the Christian 
Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Church, in congressional 
testimony, made a striking proposition which Chuck Colson has agreed 
to and many of us are thinking about, and that is, let's have a 
couple of million Christians write letters to the White House saying, 
&quot;Come home, Jim Sasser, to take a little seminar on the house 
church movement.&quot; There may be more evangelical Christians in 
China than there are in the United States today, all underground 
and persecuted.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems likely, doesn't it, Nina?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Yes.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: And let's keep him here until he passes a pop quiz and 
knows what is going on about it.  That would send such a neat signal
to all of the State Department wet-finger-in-the-air crowd.  Ignore
the fate of Christians at your peril, friend.

<p>

So I think we are going to look to do that.  I think we are also 
hoping to organize, and Nina is also going to host a meeting in May to 
see if we can organize a Christian persecution Sunday in this country --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Fascinating. Good idea.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: -- to have thousands of pulpits talking about this on 
some Sunday in September.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On some Sunday in September. You know, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> viewers will have to get an update on that.

<p>

What can people do? I think it is clear that, number one, they could 
write the President. And as we near the end of our segment, what else 
could people do?  They could call you all.  Give your phone number. 
You have this card to talk about this.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: Right. Just give us a call. We have a simple 800 number. 
It is 1-800-323-CARE. That is 1-800-323-2273.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And what will you ask of them?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Well, first of all, we'll put them on our
monthly newsletter mailing list.  They will get a free newsletter
every month that talks about religious oppression around the world,
what they can do about it.  We have a series of petition drives
each month that they can participate in.  We ask people to pray.
That is the most important thing, first of all, is to pray for
persecuted Christians around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nina, you have a phone number as well.  Give the phone 
number and tell us what will happen.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Yes.  Okay.  Our number is 202-296-5101,
and you can call collect, and we will put you on our mailing list
as well, and you will get an urgent action alert every time we
hear of a new case of a Christian either imprisoned or tortured
somewhere or someone who is dying in prison from pneumonia or
some disease, who is in a critical situation.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: I cannot begin to tell you what heroes these people are. 
They have been at it when nobody was listening.  That is the real test 
of a good person.  These are the people who go to heaven, the people
who do it without glory and keep it alive, and it is because of
their effort --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you hope will change, Mike?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I think we want to make this country sensitive
to the fact that there is this persecution going on, because,
you know, the great human rights issue as we enter the 21st century
is religious persecution.  The great hope for the 21st century
for my children, so that it not be as bloody a century as the
20th century was, is that free men and women can worship God.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  If God is alive in the 21st
century, my kids are going to safe.  We weren't so safe in a century
in which God was said to be dead.  So we are really talking about
the freedom of all people, not only Christians, in the effort
to protect these Christians around the world who have become the
targets and the symbols of what freedom is all about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank all my guests and note we had hoped 
to have a pastor on who had suffered persecution and, unfortunately,
could not because he might have been tracked down by the Immigration
Service here and deported, even though he is here saving his very
life by that.

<p>

Thank you, my fine guests.  I hope you will call
or write.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shows you how religious
liberty is being defended in the United States as we hear testimony
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Cathy Cleaver, FRC's Director of Legal Policy,
testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall, supporting
an amendment which would prohibit discrimination against religious
expression.  Let's hear what Cathy has to say as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> presents Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

[Segment from Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
October 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: On behalf of Gary Bauer and the Family Research 
Council, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the 
opportunity to address this distinguished committee on the critical 
issue of religious liberty.  I also want to appreciate, Mr. Chairman, 
your having these hearings. We think they are vital.

<p>

The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent. The Establishment 
Clause was designed to prevent the State from coercing a religious 
belief.  The Free Exercise Clause was designed to prevent the State 
from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.  Thus, the 
religion clauses were designed to work hand in hand to promote 
government neutrality with regard to religion.

<p>

In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly 
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The Court 
has created a false conflict between the religion clauses, which must 
be reconciled in each case, and the Establishment Clause prohibition 
has been the usual victor.

<p>

On October 20, this committee heard testimony from a distinguished
panel of experts who discussed the history of interpretation errors
in First Amendment religious clause jurisprudence and the efforts
to correct those errors by federal statutes.  I will not repeat
this testimony, nor will I refute the argument that nothing need
be done, for the acceptability of that position is increasing
waning.

<p>

I also won't discuss the issue of government-sponsored
or teacher-led prayer, and I think it doesn't serve this debate
to continue to debate that issue.  It is not the issue being promoted
or supported.  It is not being presented to this committee, and
it is not being supported by legal experts who favor an amendment
or a federal statute.  So I think it would do us all well to stop
arguing that; no one is arguing it in earnest.

<p>

I will attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional amendment 
rather than a federal statute and address certain specific concerns 
that have been raised in the public debate.

<p>

The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the Constitution 
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination against 
religious expression and against persons, groups, or organizations in 
access to government benefits or protections on account of the religious 
character or their speech or identity.

<p>

We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather, we 
support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's 
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.

<p>

For purposes of discussion this morning, I will center my comments
on the draft proposal garnering considerable support and presented
to this committee on October 20.  It is the proposal, the second
amendment that Senator Biden read earlier.

<p>

This language would, in effect, say to the government, do not 
discriminate against persons on account of their religious beliefs; 
and to the Supreme Court, do not construe this non-discriminatory 
treatment to be a government establishment of religion.

<p>

The fact that some civil liberty groups call this amendment extreme 
does not make it so. It is a negative mandate upon government: do 
not discriminate and do not misconstrue.  It bestows no new rights; 
it apportions no new responsibilities.

<p>

Some suggest that the Court is coming
around on its own, obviating the need for an amendment.  I would
say that the 5-4 decisions from the Supreme Court do nothing to
advance the notion that things are clear in this area; that we
have statements from Justice Souter saying that the government
need not be neutral toward religion; and other things that do
not suggest that we are through debating this issue.  The Religious
Liberty Amendment could be thought of as a religious amendment.

<p>

In closing, this principle of neutrality is not new; it is the
aim and result of our First Amendment's religion clauses, properly
understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment could restore this
saving principle so that our First Amendment would not be used
to promote the empty state religion of secularism but to promote
true freedom and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth,
to which every American is entitled.

<p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<p>

[Conclusion of Senate testimony segment.]

</ul><p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
confronts the drug problem in America and asks whether there is a problem 
at all.
<p>
The Clinton Administration significantly cut back the Office
on Drug Policy, saying it wasn't really a problem.  Many believe
we are actually winning the drug war.
<p>
Well, statistics on drug use show differently.  The number of drug 
abusers, especially among teens, has risen significantly in recent years. 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that annual marijuana use, for 
example, among eighth graders more than doubled, from 6.2 percent in 
1993 to 13 percent in 1994.
<p>
The steep rise in marijuana use also crosses over to hard drugs. Hospital 
emergency cocaine-related cases rose from 101,000 cases in 1991 to 120,000 
in 1992, and during the same period we had that problem with heroin. 
Heroin-related emergencies soared from 36,000 to 48,000 cases.
<p>
As this battle rages and more lives are lost, we must ask ourselves, 
what are we doing wrong?  Well, tonight we will talk to some people who
are working together to answer that question and battling for
solutions.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's
president, Gary Bauer.  Over the past years, we have heard a lot
from Amnesty International and other groups fighting for human
rights in Bosnia or China, for example.  But we rarely hear of
some other rights and lives that are being lost because of the
persecution of Christians throughout the world.
<p>
Gary recently has been studying this travesty, and in fact, FRC's Marty 
Dannenfelser recently spoke before a Senate committee to bring this 
persecution to light.
<p>
So let's hear what Gary has to say about a topic which has not seen much 
air time as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Recently, Gary, you attended a conference by the Freedom 
House that dealt with the issues of persecutions of people of faith
worldwide.  What did you learn there?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, this is a really scandalous situation.  We all know that 
militant Islam is on the march in a good bit of the world, certainly 
throughout the Middle East and in many countries in Africa.  Along with 
that militancy has come an increasing amount of Christian persecution.
<p>
At this day-long conference in Washington, we got reports from
countries like Iraq, Ethiopia, Pakistan, others, Saudi Arabia,
where the persecution of Christians has gone so far that in Ethiopia,
for example, they are actually crucifying again those citizens
that they can identify as being practicing Christians.
<p>
We obviously feel deeply about this problem, not only about the fact 
that such persecution is taking place, but we also feel outrage at the 
fact that our own government, the Clinton Administration, particularly,
has been very insensitive on this.  The State Department regularly
releases reports on these countries that basically whitewash the
human rights abuses.  The State Department has caved in a number
of times to pressure from these countries on religious matters.
<p>
And so we want to really highlight in the months ahead what is
happening around the globe in these countries, many of whom receive
taxpayer dollars through foreign aid, and we certainly want to
up the pressure on the President to get serious about this issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The events in Saudi Arabia were particularly interesting.
Ironically, the U.S. Government caved on issues relating to pornography
and a bar rather than dealing with the issues of people of faith.
Can you tell us about that?
<p>
MR. BAUER: That is really an incredible story.  Apparently, at the U.S. 
Embassy in Saudi Arabia, there was a tradition there of holding church 
services at the embassy for American citizens that would want to come by. 
There was a Catholic mass held and some other services.
<p>
The Saudi government demanded that those church services end and also 
demanded that the U.S. Embassy close an embassy-sponsored nightclub that 
American soldiers would frequent.  As you point out, the American 
Government, faced with these two demands, caved on the church services 
but insisted that the night club stay open.  I think it just shows
that when it comes to these kinds of issues, many in the State
Department really have a tin ear on these kinds of matters, and
that is particularly offensive to many American Christians.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that you talked about was that children
were being taken away from their families.  What did you learn
about that?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, it goes even beyond that.  There is widespread 
evidence of slavery again in many of these countries, only what is 
happening here is that Christian families are being broken up, and as 
part of this persecution, the children and the women are being taken away 
and literally sold into slavery in some African countries, again with almost 
no notice by the United Nations that usually is quick to point out human 
rights abuses, and certainly almost no attention being paid by the Clinton 
Administration on this issue.
<p>
We heard reports out of Iraq where Christians in Iraq that managed to 
escape that country into Turkey, they cannot get an interview with American 
State Department officials in Turkey. Instead, we insist that they be 
interviewed by the Turkish secret police.  The Turkish secret police are 
heavily influenced by radical Islam.  And so what happens is that these 
Christians that manage to get out of Iraq are sent back into that country to 
a fate that we can only guess.  At this point, the only thing we are 
exporting to Iraq are Christians, and that again is a tragedy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What would you recommend the U.S. Government to do about this?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, we need to be serious about human rights abuses
no matter who is involved, and certainly in these cases, which
is an area of growing abuse, we need to be very aggressive.
<p>
I think the State Department needs to start issuing regular reports
on this.  I think we need to make it clear that American foreign
aid will end unless religious persecution ends in these countries.
<p>
I would like to see the President appoint a special assistant
at the White House on this issue whose responsibility it would
be to brief him and the Congress on what it is we are picking
up through intelligence reports, and so forth.
<p>
And, last but not least, I certainly would like to see the Christian 
church arise from its sleepiness.  The church has really been behind 
the curve on this, and we quite frankly could take a page out of the book
of the Jewish community that has been very adept and very aggressive
any time a Jewish citizen anywhere in the world has been discriminated
against.  My hat goes off to the American Jewish community for
being aggressive on that kind of issue, and I think the American
Christian community needs to learn something from them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ironically, the person who is leading the fight for 
Christians being persecuted is a Jewish gentleman.  Isn't that a little 
odd to you, as well?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  That is right.  Michael Horowitz, whom I worked with in the 
Reagan Administration, has taken the lead on this issue and, quite 
frankly, has been frustrated because so many church organizations in the 
United States seem to show very little interest or seem to be fearful of 
actually confronting these countries who are engaging in this unacceptable 
persecution.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you see a parallel in the increase of persecution
of Christians worldwide and incredible support here in the United
States for a religious liberty or religious equality amendment?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think our founding fathers knew that persecution
is always just a day away, that liberties are very hard to maintain.
And I think that to the extent we turn a blind eye to persecution
in other countries, we set ourselves up eventually for not being
able to deal with persecution in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for being with us, Gary.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight
Talk</i> begins our discussion over ways to combat America's drug
problem.  As we look at stats, it is easy to see that we have
failed to win this tough fight.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Recently the Family Research Council hosted
a day-long seminar that brought together experts who have researched
and been personally involved in treating our Nation's drug problem.
Following the seminar, I had the opportunity to speak to some
of those experts.  In the upcoming discussion, you will meet Lt.
Col. Robert Maginnis, a policy expert now with the Family Research
Council, who has taken a look at some of the criminal efforts
involved in the drug arena; Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist specializing
in clinical and policy areas of addiction medicine -- right now
she works with the District of Columbia's drug court -- and Bob
Peterson, a former drug czar from the state of Michigan and now
a leading consultant in the field.
<p>
Join me as we take a look at what these experts had to say.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for joining us all today.  Bob, one of 
the things that the Clinton Administration told us as they gave some major 
slashes to the drug budget was that we didn't have the problem anymore so 
much; that drug use was down.  Is that your finding?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Not at all, Kristi.  As all the national surveys are 
indicating now, drug use, especially among young children, and especially
in regard to marijuana, has skyrocketed in the last four years.
And, really, we need to lay the blame to a certain degree on
the parents.  The parents of the sixties, who were experimenting
with drugs in a big way, are now raising children, and they are
giving them sort of a mixed message.  There is a value conflict.
They want to say, &quot;Well, don't use them,&quot; but at the
same time, the kids are starting to use them, and it is really
devastating this country and we don't even know it.
<p>
If you start looking at what is going on in the media, they are 
glamorizing drugs.  You start looking at what this is costing this 
country in a major way, billions and billions of dollars, far more it
is costing us than in reality what it is costing us to try to
suppress it, to reduce demand, to reduce the supply of drugs in
this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sally, you are taking a look at people
who are in a court situation.  They have a drug problem.  Are
your numbers going down, or are you finding more and more people
coming to you for whom drugs are an element of the crime that
they are involved in?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Well, I think the data shows very well that heavy drug use is 
not going down at all, and the individuals I see are people who have been 
given a choice by a judge to either go to jail or go to a treatment program, 
and for many of them, even though they are well into their thirties, they
have never been in treatment before, though they have started
using drugs in their teens.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Are we seeing that it is possible for someone to have a 
minor marijuana use habit and that it ends right there?  You know, a lot 
of times people, when they talk about drugs, think that that there is an 
entry, a safe place where we can have recreational drug use.  Is that 
possible?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Well, marijuana is considered a gateway drug.  I think
that one of the reasons it is a gateway to heavier drug use, to
harder drug use, is because of the criminal element that individuals
become associated with as they are obtaining the drug.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, you have done a lot with the prosecution, and you 
were at the Department of Justice and have been on the prosecutorial 
side. In your experience, is drug use and the prosecution of drug use,
do they go hand in hand?
<p>
MR. PETERSON:  Well, the two are certainly correlated, and that is what 
is important for parents to realize, is that even if your child doesn't 
use drugs, if drugs are being used, your child is at risk.  For instance, 
date rape is highly correlated with alcohol and drug use; accidents, 
with marijuana. When they decriminalized in California, the number of 
accidents or charges for driving under the influence or reckless driving
went up.
<p>
A recent study showed that, out of those who are tested,
who test negative for alcohol, who are driving recklessly and
dangerously, the vast majority have illegal drugs in their systems.
So your children are at risk from crime and from accidents regardless
of whether they are using or not.
<p>
The other thing with marijuana is that the potency has gone up.  It used 
to be -- &quot;It's not your father's Oldsmobile,&quot; they say.  Well, 
it's not your father's marijuana.  It used to be 2 to 3 percent THC, 
which is the psychoactive compound in marijuana.  Now some of it is
2 to 3 percent, but they have gotten it up to 30 percent through
hybrid breeding.
<p>
The other problem is that methamphetamine is back, which is another very 
dangerous drug, because people who take it who are unstable are a lot more 
likely to act out when they are under the influence of these drugs.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Are you finding that, as you look nationwide, if there is an 
area of the country where drugs are not dealt with strictly and quickly
-- you know, what is the word, &quot;swift and sure&quot; -- that
that does have an increase in users?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Yes. I just actually did a book on this, and what I found 
was that from 1960 to 1980, the odds of going to prison or jail for drugs 
dropped dramatically.  It went down like 374 percent.  From 1980 to 
1990, it went back up again.  Well, from 1960 to 1980, violent crime
went up something like 250 percent; murder reached its peak level
in 1980, when drug incarceration was at its lowest level.
<p>
In fact, we have this myth that we are tough on drugs.  Under the
federal system, the average amount of marijuana is 3.5 tons that
a trafficker has.  And for possession of marijuana and cocaine
and crack under the federal system, you are less likely to go
to prison for that than you are for a tax law violation, and you
will serve the same amount of time as a migratory bird offender.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The birds have it.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: That's right.  Drugs are for the birds.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, one of the things that we see at the Family Research 
Council when we try to track pathology is that people lie.  It is hard 
to get valid sex data because people don't want to be honest about their 
sexual habits.
<p>
The same problem exists in a way with drugs.  What are you seeing in 
terms of users?  How reliable is the data, and how many people are actually 
using drugs?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: It depends upon which survey you look at, obviously, and 
there are maybe 70 or 80 million Americans who are saying, &quot;Yeah, I 
have used it in a certain period of time, maybe, over my life.&quot;
The numbers are going to be elevated depending upon the cohort
of people you are talking about.  The number of kids, probably
13 percent at a fairly young age, and the numbers are going up.
Once again, it depends upon the sector, it depends upon the racial
breakdown.
<p>
I did want to say something following up what Bob said,
and I don't think a lot of our viewers may understand that when
you start looking at people that are incarcerated, the people
that are trying to say drugs are not a big problem will not acknowledge
that a lot of these felons that are in jail right now for violent
crimes were using or had used recently, prior to that crime, an
illicit drug.  And that may have had a role in their particular
lifestyle choice that led them to the felony which landed them
in jail.
<p>
Unfortunately, if we don't arrest the scourge of drugs
on our land, we are just to continue to see this, especially as
the young cohort of teenagers today grows older, or the young
kids that are being raised in some pretty dysfunctional settings
grow older and become the killers of the next decade, and we are
faced with a critical crisis that is going to be really promoted
by drug abuse.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Sally, right now we have a very strange situation 
where the government indicates that cigarette use is very, very bad, but 
maybe marijuana should be legal.
<p>
But as you look at the people involved in drugs, are cigarettes a gateway 
to marijuana, a gateway to harder drugs? Is it broken families? What are 
some of the risk factors for the people who actually end up being drug 
users?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Well, I think the first thing you mentioned was some sort of 
analogy between nicotine and other drugs, and I think that is a dangerous 
analogy to make. Certainly from a public health standpoint, tobacco is 
very dangerous -- lung cancer, heart disease, et cetera -- but in terms of 
erosion of family life, of moral values, of capacity to function in society
and to adhere to your responsibilities as a parent, employee,
a citizen, that is where drugs are trouble, and I don't see too
many people smoking cigarettes who cannot abide by the law.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is a fascinating point, because in the cigarette
discussion, one of the points that has been made occasionally
is that cigarettes are really just as bad as drugs.  But that
is not your experience.
<p>
DR. SATEL:  When they say that, they refer often, I think, to the addictive 
potential of cigarettes.  And, yes, it is hard to quit cigarettes.  On the 
other hand, the consequences for using cigarettes aren't as immediate and 
as dangerous as for using hard drugs.  So I think the analogy is strained.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to take a look 
at the controversy surrounding crack cocaine and powder cocaine incarceration
rates. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. As many of you may 
know, Rev. Jesse Jackson has made a lot of news lately talking about how 
the way in which we prosecute drugs is in fact racist; that crack cocaine 
offenders, generally black, are treated more harshly than those who use 
powder cocaine.
<p>
Bob, what is your perspective on that?  In our treatment of drug crime, 
do you see racist overtones?
<p>
MR. PETERSON:  I don't think it is racism.  What I have done in a study is 
I have looked at every crime -- violent crime, robbery, rape, murder -- 
and what I did is I measured the percentage of black and white victims
and then looked at the percentage of black and white imprisonments,
and what I found is that it always parallels the victim rate;
in other words, who is going to prison is based on who is being
victimized by these crimes.
<p>
Now, with the crack and the powder cocaine, they are identical chemically. 
They are identical substances. However, if you look at -- an analogy I would 
give is with an automatic machine gun and a hunting rifle and say, &quot;Gee,
they both shoot the same bullets, so they should carry the same
sentence.&quot;  One has a delivery mechanism that is a lot faster.
 The guy who is selling crack makes a lot more on an ounce of
cocaine than the one who is selling powder.  He is making more
profit and he is causing more immediate problems because of the
quickness that it goes to the brain, basically, and addiction
specialists say the quicker you get high, the quicker you drop
down, the quicker you get addicted.
<p.
The other thing is they use the federal crack laws as an example.  Under 
the federal crack laws, if you take the federal crack possession violators 
who are black and say what percent are they of the whole prison population,
it is six one-hundredths of 1 percent.  It is a very small population.
Eighty percent of those people were dealing, and the average
amount of crack they were dealing was 18,800 doses.
<p>
Now, does the difference have to be 100 to 1?  In other words, for 100 
grams of powder cocaine, should that equal 1 gram of crack?  I am not
saying that.  Maybe it should be 10 to 1.  You should look at
basically how much will an ounce of cocaine make of crack and
make it proportional.  So it does not have to be 100 to 1.  They
do have a point.  It might be a little too far.  But I do think
there is a definitely a difference, and the law has to recognize
that, and the reason there is a difference was because of the
devastation to the innocent victims in these communities where
crack ravaged their neighborhoods.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Have you seen drug crimes in general being weighted by race at 
all, or is it socioeconomic?  You said you took a look at the victims. 
What seems to mark the people who are most likely to be victims?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, for victims, of course, it is partly where you
live and who you are.  But young black males in this country are
victimized and murdered at a rate that is just appalling, and
people have to start paying attention to this.
<p>
Now, it was worse in the early 1970s when we had more lenient drug laws. 
The ratio was even worse.  But it is a very serious problem.  You know,
the number one likelihood of dying if you are a young black teenager
is murder.  And white America, all of America, has to start paying
attention to this.
<p>
But the answer is not to get weaker on drug crimes. Right now 70 percent 
of those who are even defendants for drugs are repeat offenders.  One 
in five have five or more prior felonies.  So we are not locking up a 
lot of first-timers, but if we concentrate on the first-timers with drug 
testing, fines, coordinated with treatment, we can avert the problem.
<p>
But the point is that it is based on victimization, and in fact for 
arrests, even though we incarcerate more blacks than whites for drugs,
we arrest more whites than blacks for drugs, even in the inner
city.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we look at treatment options, Bob, you have taken a 
look at a lot of different things that are being tried.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What is working?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, there are a few that seem to be working. Faith-based
organizations -- I can think of Johnny Garcia down in San Antonio,
who has a better than 80 percent success rate.  So faith-based
organizations -- and there is something about it that is just
turning people around completely, whereas a lot of traditional
programs don't have nearly that sort of success rate.
<p>
One comes to mind that we were talking about yesterday, and it has to do
with what happened in Vietnam.  You know, we would take the dopeheads,
the people on heroin, and they couldn't go back to the States.
They couldn't get on the Freedom Bird to fly out of Saigon until
they were clean and they were tested to be clean, and when they
were clean, then they could get on that Freedom Bird and come
home.  Bob mentioned yesterday to us in the conference we had
that 88 percent didn't return to using dope again.
<p>
And so that is a testimony to the fact, I believe, that self-will can 
govern to a certain degree this whole issue of treatment.  Now, of 
course, we are going to hear from Sally on treatment.  But I wanted 
to follow up just a second on what Bob said in that the politicians
in this country, I think, are listening to what the people are
saying, and the courts maybe aren't quite as sensitive, because
we have a clash over this crack-powder cocaine issue between what
the Sentencing Commission is telling federal judges to do and
what the politicians are passing mandatory minimums and saying
this is what you are going to do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: And that clash is really reflective of the differences
of opinion about how we should treat drugs.
<p>
And so, yes, we do have a crisis, and as Bob articulated very well, we 
have a crisis, unfortunately, with crack and young black drug dealers 
out there. But by legalizing it, that is no solution to this terrible 
scourge that is on our land.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Sally, some people don't think that treatment 
is a solution, either.  There is this sense that we have to legalize 
drugs, we have to treat crack cocaine more leniently, because there 
is nothing else that we can do. Is treatment a viable option when we 
are looking at people who are addicted to drugs?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Treatment is a viable option, and I always say, if you 
legalize it, I'll just have more business, because there will be 
more addicts.  I am sure of that.
<p.
But what I want to point out is that treatment is a very important 
component of any kind of drug strategy.  Right now there is a fair 
amount of relapse, especially among hard core users, when they come 
out of treatment.  But what is very important to remember is that
treatment may not work as well as we like, and I think it can
work a lot better -- and I can get to that in a minute -- but
it is very much a worthwhile investment.
<p>
The ratio of savings in costs averted of medical care, of criminal 
justice, property crime, employment time lost, the ratio of gain in 
those areas to money spent on treatment is in the neighborhood of 
one dollar for treatment to between four and seven dollars saved in 
those areas.  It is a very worthwhile social investment.
<p>
The second issue, though, is how to make treatment work better, and 
there are several things.  One very important principle in treatment
is retention.  The longer you stay, the better you do.  The problem
is, there is a high dropout rate.
<p>
One thing we should be thinking about very seriously is how to get 
people to stay longer.  Now, one obvious way to do that might be that we 
will make treatment more attractive.  Well, the point is, a lot of people 
don't want to come to treatment, and one solution is to compel them to 
come to treatment.
<p>
Now, we do that in the drug court where I work because the individuals 
are given a choice --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: They can go to jail, that's right.
<p>
DR. SATEL: Which some choose, which gives you an indication of the 
aversion some people have to treatment. Why? Because it separates them 
from their drug.  So we can use that sort of coercion through the legal 
system.
<p>
There is another strategy that I would like to see revived.  Laws are 
still on the books for this in most states, but they have not been 
used, and that is what is called the civil addict.  That is a commitment
procedure.  It is basically putting people in treatment against
their will.  These would be people who are so ravaged by drugs
that they can't even make decisions; they can't care for themselves.
They have subjugated all their other needs and responsibilities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Perhaps the homeless, some of the homeless that
are so drug addicted?
<p>
DR. SATEL: They would be a key population.
<p>
Another important point I want to make is that studies have shown
some very nice work by a researcher at UCLA that you don't have
to want to.  Everybody thinks that in order to get better with
treatment, you have to want to; it has to be voluntary.  And what
he has shown is that people who were coerced into treatment through
these legal means did as well in five-year follow-ups in terms
of their employment, in terms of their abstinence, and in terms
of their uninvolvment with the criminal justice system as those
who voluntarily finished.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But in terms of you have to want to, if they didn't want 
to, how did those people without the legal ability to make them go, 
how were they put in?
<p>
DR. SATEL: No, they were put in.  That's my point.  Many of the people 
who finished were put in.  And then others did enter on their own
volition, of course, because of pressure from family or employer.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: I would say, with the point you raise, though,
about if drugs were legal, you would have more business, I think
you might go out of business, because the number one referral
source for treatment is the criminal justice system, and people,
as you know, generally don't seek it out a lot of times unless
they are pushed either by family or by the criminal justice system.
So I wonder if your business would be damaged because people
wouldn't be in treatment if it wasn't for the criminal justice
system.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going
to take a closer look at the marriage of prosecution and treatment.
Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>, where we are 
taking a deep look at what is going on with the drug issue in America. 
Right now we are looking at the marriage of prosecution and treatment.
<p>
Bob, you were saying that if drugs were legal, we might not have any 
more treatment.  What is your experience telling you?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, that the studies that I have seen show that the 
number one referral source for treatment is the criminal justice 
system, and what we are doing is increasingly becoming more successful
at using the justice system to both get people into and out of
treatment, but really, the basic aim is to get people off drugs,
whether they go to formal treatment or not, whether they go to
AA or NA, which are volunteer groups that are really the most
successful, and any good treatment program sends people to AA
and NA, which are anonymous groups.
<p>
In Michigan, for example, we had a program where, if a felon had a drug 
problem, and when they are released in the community, they sign a 
contract with the court, and it says I will be drug tested three times 
a week, so if I'm using, I'm going to get caught, because the cocaine
stays in your system at least a couple of days.  I am going to
be drug tested three times a week -- if it is alcohol, it could
be every day of the week -- and if I test dirty, I go to jail
the first time for three days, the next time for seven days, the
next time for 30 days, the next time for 45 days.
<p>
What we found was 77 percent over five years being drug tested that 
frequently were drug free and rearrested, whether they went to formal 
treatment or not, and the key is that some people need formal treatment,
and some addicts will get off without that.  They will get off
with the AA and NA.  And so you save resources if the court says
my focus isn't on going to treatment; my focus is you have to
be drug free.
<p>
So if you come in to me, I say, &quot;Look, here's a number. If you 
need help to get free of drugs, you call them. They'll help you. 
They've got your name.  But I don't care if you go to treatment. If 
you're not drug-free on Monday, bring your toothbrush.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sally, what do you think about that?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Oh, I think Bob is right that the criminal
justice system can be an excellent way to identify patients and,
for those who have to go to treatment, a great way to provide
leverage.  But I think what you were describing -- it is also
called coerced abstinence -- can be extremely effective.
<p>
Another dimension of the problem that may be useful in getting people
to decide to come off drugs is the fact that our society actually
enables quite a bit of drug use because entitlements are available
to people who use drugs.  We have supplemental security income,
social security disability insurance, veterans' benefits, AFDC,
public housing.  These all go to people who actively use drugs.
<p>
I think, for example, that what New York City is doing in terms
of considering drug testing for welfare recipients and heavy screening
of people who are entering public housing programs are very important
interventions.  If you kick the government props out from under
addicts, the world is going to start closing in, and they have
two choices:  stop or go to treatment.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: I want to follow up on that in that in industry there 
are a lot of good programs today that we are not hearing about, and 
they are insisting upon testing, they are doing education programs, and 
they are putting the person's job on the line.  If they don't get clean
-- and they will provide help -- but if you don't get clean, you
don't have a job, and that is quite an incentive.
<p>
And parents who go through such a program, and they see their children 
begin to experiment with drugs, are beginning to communicate to them,
&quot;Look, you're going to ruin your life.  You need to get off
this stuff before it takes you down the primrose path.&quot;
<p>
Now, also, we need to consider what the message is that our kids are
seeing.  You know, they are out there listening to hundreds of
hours of bad music, some bad television, some bad movies, and
the media is really guilty of glamorizing drug use.  You know,
they think it makes them sexier, they think it makes them look
physically more powerful, that they are going to be smarter for
some reason, some pretty bad messages that are corrupting our
youth.  And somehow we have to turn that around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It was very interesting.  On an episode of <i>Friends</i>, 
the hottest sitcom out right now, they had Marlo Thomas on as the mother 
asking the daughters, &quot;Where do we get the best drugs these days?
What's hot?&quot;  It was a very unfortunate attitude.
<p>
But I wanted to ask you, too, Sally, and have you follow up with this,
Bob, is defining drug use as a disability or an illness, is that
part of the problem?  So now you are disabled.  So here's a federal
supplement.  Do you see that as the wrong message to send about
drug use?
<p>
DR. SATEL: I think there is a problem with over-medicalizing
addiction.  Certainly there are biological and health components
to using drugs.  Their effects obviously affect the body, and
when someone is severely addicted, their brain really is compromised.
I mean, it's the old egg on the frying pan -- this is your brain
-- and they can't make rational decisions.  So there is certainly
a biological component, but biology isn't necessarily destiny
here, and I think there is a tendency for people to then feel,
well, the locus of control here is outside of me.
<p>
One very unfortunate manifestation of that was a program under 
supplemental security income which considered drug addiction a disability, 
so that if you were disabled -- in order words, if you were too 
intoxicated to work -- you could get supplemental security income.
<p>
Now, that program was examined by Congress a few years ago, and while 
it is still on the books as a disability, at least a treatment component
was built in and the benefits were made contingent upon attending
treatment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So once again it's the carrot and the stick,
and it is a big stick.
<p>
DR. SATEL: Oh, very much.  It is called contingency management in this 
field, and it can be very, very powerful.  I would like to see, as 
someone who has worked in the Veterans Administration for a while, I 
would like to see veterans' benefits, which can be very generous, up to 
$1,800 a month, I would like to see them be contingent upon veterans who 
have drug problems and who are mentally ill and have drug problems, 
contingent upon their compliance with treatment, taking their 
medication when necessary, and providing clean urines when asked.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Bob, is the disability issue a problem?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Oh, clearly, and I endorse what she said on the veterans. 
You know, we have a lot of young and old veterans that, for a variety 
of reasons, some of which, you know, they will go back to their days in 
Vietnam, and they will say, &quot;Well, because of the psychological 
impact of the devastation that I saw, I am high today on heroin.&quot;
Well, we need to help them work through it, but somehow we have
to test them, we have to facilitate the process of leaving drugs
behind, and clearly, that is a good example.  But there are other
programs, and we should not be spending government -- taxpayer
-- money out there to endorse and promote drug addiction.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Bob, some people think we are coddling our
criminals by having treatment as the first round.  Do you think
that that is true, that a disability way of looking at it is a
problem?  Or do you think treatment is the first line of defense
before prison is the way to go?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: I think enforced abstinence is the first line of 
defense, and whether that means treatment or not, I think again we 
are assuming that to get off drugs, you have to go to treatment, 
and all the studies show that is not true for everybody. As I said, 
88 percent of the Vietnam vets got off heroin without going to 
formal treatment.  We are talking about they did just as well whether 
they went and saw a counselor or did not.
<p>
So some people need formal treatment, some don't, but the focus on 
the criminal justice system has to be abstinence from drugs, not 
treatment.  We are not there to fill treatment centers.  It's there 
to make sure, when that person is released in the community, they 
are drug-free.
<p>
Now, the other thing is, I would not go into prisons and take the 
dangerous that are there -- 95 percent of our prisoners are repeat or 
violent offenders; they are not first-time drug offenders -- I would 
not take them out and put them on these programs.  I would take people
getting what I call meaningless probation.  I talk to kids, and
I say, &quot;How many know somebody on probation?  Do you think
that's serious?&quot; and they all start laughing.  Well, make
probation drug testing with progressive sanctions.  Make these
disability and welfare payments -- don't cut off the welfare mother
the first time she tests dirty; say now you don't get your benefit
for two weeks.  Now you don't get your benefit for three weeks.
Use it for behavior modification, but make sure you are going
to catch the person as soon as they do it and that you are going
to take progressively tougher action each time.
<p>
And this applies to parents, and I think that is the most important 
thing, is that everything we are talking about goes back to the home. 
I had the alcohol industry -- they have a thing called Sensory Council
-- call me, and they said, &quot;What could we do?  What could
we do legitimately that you would support?&quot;  I said, &quot;Well,
go out of business would be good.&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But they weren't willing to shut down their doors and go out of business. 
So I said, &quot;Well, the one thing I think you ought to do is, there's
a test, a saliva test, a little cotton swab saliva test for alcohol.&quot;
I said, &quot;Every parent of people from 11 to 20 years old
should have a supply of these.&quot;
<p>
I told my sons -- I have six children, and I have four sons and two 
daughters -- and I said to my oldest, I said, &quot;We run the Ronald 
Reagan School of Parenting.&quot;  And he said, &quot;What's that?&quot; 
And I said, &quot;It's called trust but verify.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So once again, Bob, we find that verified accountability 
and self-discipline are keys to success.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: That is right. You know, one of the things with treatment, 
when you tell people they can't govern their behavior, they have an 
excuse not to.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to take
a look at some of the solutions that we as individuals and a society
can enact.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Recently there was a national drug strategy session here at 
the Family Research Council, and Bob, you directed this day-long event.
What was the goal for the meeting of the minds?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, we wanted to put together a straightforward, simple 
strategy that we could turn over to Presidential candidates and have them,
at the national conventions this summer, make part of their platforms.
We wanted to address the issues that we talked about today, and
we want to permeate the country with the message that drug abuse
is serious, it is not going to go away, we have to make it a national
priority, and we want those Presidential candidates to embrace
that and run with the ball.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And, Sally, you were saying that one of the things that 
we need to enact this program is some money. But it is who gets the 
money that is a problem. What were you indicating for us?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Money in terms of disability payments? Yes, my point was 
that as a clinician, the reason I got interested in these issues was 
because, when I worked at a hospital, all my patients were getting 
entitlement money, and they were turning around and using it to buy 
drugs.
<p>
Now, as a clinician, here I see that the monies they were 
getting to help them live better lives, basically to provide for their 
basic needs, were going to make their conditions worse; and when my 
patients had a concurrent mental illness -- if they had schizophrenia,
for example, it literally made their schizophrenia worse.  They
became more psychotic, more delusional, more agitated.  So what
we had was a situation where the money they were getting because
they were ill made them even more sick.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I would like each of you to go around.  You all participated 
in this discussion in last week's strategizing.  Bob, of the things that 
you all discussed, what do you think are some of the programs that are
really powerful from that law enforcement perspective?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, I think, first of all, it was very significant that 
the Family Research Council brought everybody together to do this,
because one of the big problems we have in this country, whether
it is law enforcement, treatment, or prevention, is that people
are not getting together to talk about this issue anymore, and
they are not pushing the issue forward, and they are not mentioning
it to the candidates, and whether it is President Clinton at all
his former State-of-the-Unions or whether it is the Contract with
America, the word &quot;drugs&quot; wasn't in either document.
So it is significant that we got together.
<p>
In the law enforcement area, one of the things we talked about was the 
drug testing of offenders with accountability.  Another thing was that 
the casual user -- we have to realize that that casual user is the one 
that is really fueling the drug problem.  We all like to focus on the
addict or on the people that don't have economic resources, but
it is that yuppie in Wall Street that is really fueling this trade
and getting away with it, and it is that Yuppie in Wall Street
that is more deterred by a minor jail sentence and sitting next
to some Bowery bums in the jail cell than the guy who is selling
drugs, let's say, in the inner city, because the guy in the inner
city, it's a badge of courage.  They have another notch.  I was
in prison again, you know, great job, well done.  But the guy
on Wall Street is deterred.  So those were two important things.
<p>
The other thing we talked about was the federal budget, that we
don't necessarily need more money, which I am sure Republican
candidates will be glad to hear.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Will be very glad to hear.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: The problem is reallocating the money we have. For 
instance, of the health care, the health care budget is, I don't 
know what, three to six times of any justice budget.
The total budget for state and local justice and for drug control
is 1.5 percent, okay?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, out of this health care budget, HHS -- our 
Department of Health and Human Services  -- allocates 1 percent of its 
budget, from what I read, to drugs.  The Department of Justice allocates 
50 percent.  So what does HHS say?  Well, if you want us to do treatment,
we have to take some of the Justice budget.  No.  If drugs are
driving 30 or 40 percent of your health care costs, Congress should
tell HHS, &quot;You shall allocate 30 percent of your budget to
drugs.  You find a way to do it.  Find the things that you are
over-allocating to, and you can have treatment on demand for everybody
in this country without raising a penny of tax money.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sally, from a treatment perspective, what were some
of the initiatives that came out of the meeting that you were
really excited about?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Well, one thing I would like to see and we talked about 
was having more capacity for long-term residential treatment. This 
is treatment that lasts between a year and two years.  Its goal is to 
really socially transform the individual.  We are talking now about hard 
core users.
<p>
While the drug problem, as you are saying, may be fueled in large part
by casual users, the economic burdens are extracted by the very
heavy users.  These are people who, when they go to a place, for
example, like Phoenix House, what Phoenix House addresses is not
the drug; they address the addict and the notion that the person
has turned to drugs because of a deeper personal disturbance,
and there is a lot of rebuilding of character, of capacity, that
those treatment programs do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Fantastic.
<p>
Bob, I have to commend you.  After a long career in the military and law 
enforcement angles, you were the one that said this drug problem is a 
problem; let's get together.  This was certainly your brain child.
<p>
From a public policy standpoint, Bob, what are you excited about in
terms of this drug issue?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, it permeates all aspects of society.  It is 
driving our economy in a way that most people don't recognize. It is 
killing a lot of our kids, and it is killing a lot of older people.
<p>
But I see this issue really comes down to one issue, and that is 
leadership. The leadership starts at the top.  The President of the 
United States, like Ronald Reagan and Nancy at his side, needs to stand 
in front of every person in America and say, &quot;Don't do drugs. 
Drugs are bad.  They're going to hurt you.&quot;  Now, you get that 
sort of example, you identify the problem, you give them solutions, 
and you set a good role model.
<p>
Now, that has to go all the way down to the kitchen
table where Mom and Dad sit down with their son, their daughter,
and they do the things that Bob talked about earlier.  &quot;I
love you, but I'm going to test you.  I'm going to check out your
school environment, your friends, because I love you, and I want
to keep you off this, because I know this could devastate your
life.&quot;
<p>
So if we could get our politicians, our leaders, our
parents, our community leaders involved in this issue, as we must,
because it is a national emergency, then we can turn this scourge
around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So as much as we are looking at treatment
and enforcement, for you it is a philosophical leadership issue
that is really causing some of the problems?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, if you have the leaders together, everything 
else is going to fall in line.  They are going to prioritize the 
funding, they are going to prioritize the law enforcement.  They are 
going to get the media whipped into shape to do the right sort of 
thing. You know, it is really leadership.  If we have good leadership
on this issue, we can defeat the enemy; we can win the drug war.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I would like to thank my guests for being with us
today, and I hope that you will call Family Research Council for
more information on any of these programs or some of the policy
related to drugs.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk</i>. 
If you would like to receive more information about the Family Research
Council, tonight's guests, or the topics we discussed, call us
at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will take a look at a sensitive, life-enhancing and 
life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. If adoption 
is viewed as the best alternative to unwed pregnancy by the majority 
of Americans, why is it so hard for couples to adopt children in our 
own country?  We'll find out next week as we talk to individuals who 
have been affected and involved in the adoption issue when we bring 
you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks 
for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
looks at an issue that seems to have been, in the past two decades of 
abortion discussion, swept under the carpet: adoption.
<p>
Although most Americans believe that adoption is the best response to 
an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, in 1991, 41 percent of out-of-wedlock 
pregnancies ended in abortion. Of the 44 percent carried to term, only 2 
percent of those children were placed for adoption.  Before 1973 when 
abortion was legalized, about one in five not-marital births to white 
women, for example, were placed for abortion.  But by the late 1980s, 
the number of children placed for adoption dropped drastically to one 
in 30.
<p>
This change has taken place at a time when rising infertility
rates show that one couple in four today cannot have children.
We'll delve into these issues and more in tonight's discussion.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Phil Olsen, the Family Research Council's
Vice President for Resource Development.  Phil and his staff are
in constant contact with the public, so they know what current
issues are resonating with American families today.
<p>
I had the chance to talk to Phil about some of those concerns, so 
let's hear his insights into what the media may not be telling you,
as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are very excited that Phil could join us today on 
Behind the Headlines.  What are people telling you today? You have 
been in the field.  It's hard to even see you sometimes in the office, 
Phil.  When you're out there in recent weeks, what are people saying, 
&quot;Look, this is the number one thing that I am worried about?&quot;
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Well, I think that today, I think the thing that we hear 
the most is that they are very concerned about the direction our country 
is headed. They are very concerned about the moral decline that they 
see. They are very concerned about the disintegration of our society,
the difficulties that families have today just trying to be a
family.  And these are some of the things that we hear repeatedly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Are the political things here in Washington making
the top ten list of family concerns?  Are you finding it's more
fear of the personal and the breakdown in the personal around
them?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, I think that one of the things that we
continue to hear is that people seem to be very skeptical of the
media.  They don't feel like the media is shooting straight. 
They feel like the media is running a public relations campaign
for this administration, and I think that they are very puzzled
by some of that.  They want the truth.  They would like the straight
scoop.
<p>
I think that, given the truth, they have the ability to
make up their mind where they want to come down on the issues.
But I think that there is a general consensus that they are not
receiving the truth all the time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that explains in part the growth of groups 
like the Family Research Council?  You know, where are people going to 
go for that kind of information they are looking for?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I think that is absolutely the case.  I think that people are 
realizing that they need to look to organizations who can provide them 
with information that is reliable.  I think that that is something that 
has set the Family Research Council apart.  People have come to realize
that they can depend on the research that is produced by the Family
Research Council.  They can rely on the work that we are doing
here on their behalf.  I think, to be honest with you, that is
probably the primary thing that has led to the growth that we
have seen in the Family Research Council in just the last few
years.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that as you are meeting a lot
of people who are turning toward their family issues, is there
a thought that it is more the personal that is impacting or the
government?  Where are people concerned about in terms of the
impacts negatively on their family?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, again, I think that there is a range out there in 
terms of people's understanding of the political process.  I think 
there is a great frustration that exists, because they don't really 
understand a lot of what is happening in this country.  There has been 
for many, many years a sense that when you elect a representative and 
send them to Washington, D.C., they are going to do what is in the best 
interest of the family, or so you think.  And, unfortunately, in too 
many cases, the reverse has actually come to pass, where these elected
officials are not doing what is in the best interest of their
constituents.  They are being coerced into making decisions that
might be in the best interest of a small minority group or a small
special interest group, and that is not what is best for our country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Phil, we thank you so much for being with us in
Behind the Headlines and look forward to seeing you again.
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I thank you, Kristi.  It has been great to be with you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares insights of some experts who have researched the adoption issue.
We'll find out why adoption is no longer mainstream.  Please
stay tuned.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are talking about adoption.  I am joined by Gracie 
Hsu, a Family Research Council policy analyst, who has looked extensively 
at the legal entanglements that surround adoption.  Also joining me is 
Bill Pierce, President of the National Council on Adoption, whose 
organization is spearheading proposed adoption changes; and Chris Casey, 
Executive Director of the Campaign for the American Family, who is 
currently organizing an adoption seminar this spring. Welcome to the 
show.
<p>
Gracie, we certainly welcome you back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. You
have been studying adoption for a while.  What have you seen in
adoption trends?  We looked at some disturbing numbers in the
first segment about a tremendous decline.  What are you finding
out?
<p>
MS. HSU:  What we are finding out is that fewer teenagers
and fewer people who have unwed pregnancies and births are choosing
adoption.  Whereas there used to be maybe a significant number
of pregnancies that would end in adoption, and especially if they
were unwed, now we are looking at about 2 percent.
<p>
NCFA has done a great job in tracking these trends over time, but 
what we're seeing is that the laws, also, when it comes to adoption, 
have not been encouraging this; in fact, they have been trying to make
it so it is less popular, especially in foster care situations,
where it makes it even more difficult for adoptions to take place.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bill, actually, I have been acquainted with your
organization for 10 years.  I have been here in Washington long
enough to say that.  What have you seen with the laws surrounding
adoption?  Are they hostile, actually, to its being accomplished?
<p>
DR. PIERCE: Well, they are, because if you think about it for
a second, our tax laws are one example.  Our tax laws provide
benefits for people through deductions if they decide to have
a child biologically.  Our tax laws even provide deduction if
someone medically decides to terminate a pregnancy.  But our tax
laws have no benefit whatsoever if someone tries to adopt.
<p>
So one of the things we have been trying to do, as Gracie knows and
as Chris knows, is to work for an adoption tax credit to be passed
at the federal level to make it possible for more people to adopt.
<p>
One of the big things that would help to really reprivatize adoption,
that would empower ordinary people, that would help change the
system in a dramatic way, would be to put a $5,000 refundable
tax credit as part of adoption.
<p>
The nice thing about it, it is one of those things which is bipartisan 
in its origin. We have both Democrats and Republicans that like it. Newt 
Gingrich thinks it's a great idea.  I was at the American Enterprise 
Institute the other day, and I heard David Bonior say that he would 
endorse it.
<p>
I think the challenge now is for us to see whether the Congress,
which is always talking a lot, can actually put a small, simple
piece of legislation together and put it through without turning
it into a Christmas tree and hanging everything that we would
like to see on one piece of legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But that's a fraction of adoption costs, are they not? I 
mean, what does the average adoption today cost?
<p>
DR. PIERCE: Well, there's a tremendous range, but I would say somewhere 
between $6,000 all the way up to $30,000.  But $5,000 would make the key 
difference for lots and lots of people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Chris, your organization has targeted adoption as something 
that is one of your goals. Why?
<p>
MR. CASEY:  Well, my father, the former governor of Pennsylvania,
Bob Casey, when he was governor, made adoption a top priority,
and he thinks that it's time for the national government to do
the same thing.
<p>
We have a lot of people out there who have done great things in the 
adoption area privately, but we don't see a national effort by our 
government to make it a top priority. We think it's time that that 
happened, and I think if that happens, if you have rhetorical change, 
in addition to legislation change that Bill has talked about, that people 
will start to see it as the positive, life-affirming option that it is, 
and I think then you will see that the number of adoptions start to 
increase, and, hopefully, through the work that we are doing, bringing 
people together to talk about the many problems and barriers that currently
exist in the system, we can have some real changes, I think, relatively
quickly.  I think that it is the kind of issue that has not seen
its potential on the national level, and I think it is a perfect
time for it, because we see the tremendous social costs that go
along with family disintegration.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, your father, who is a Democrat -- a lot of people think 
that this is a Republican issue, but it's really not -- chose adoption. Do 
you think because it was difficult in Pennsylvania or because he wanted 
to make it easier? Why adoption?
<p>
MR. CASEY:  Well, he has always been a strong pro-life advocate and has 
seen the tremendous dichotomy and schizophrenia, if you will, where people 
in this country will go to China, to Russia, to Latin America to adopt a 
child.  They will jump through all sorts of hoops and at tremendous 
personal sacrifice.
<p>
At the same time, when you have 4,400 children being
aborted every day, that is a situation that obviously is out of
balance, and I think he saw that operating on the state level
and wanted to do something on the national level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting that you would think adoption would be 
the common ground where pro-life Americans and people who support
some kind of legalized abortion would be able to come together.
But it doesn't seem like that is what really happens.  Gracie,
what is your experience?
<p>
MS. HSU:  Well, what is interesting is that public opinion polls 
overwhelmingly say that people are in favor of adoption. If you are 
given four options as to an unwed teenager who is pregnant, what should 
she do, the number one answer is always adoption.  That gets the most 
votes out of everything else. And the least popular is abortion, and in 
between there is marry the father and to have the baby and raise it 
herself.
<p>
But even though public opinion is high on adoption, what we are
finding is that people don't practice this, and much of the reason
why is because we see a social trend that says illegitimacy is
okay.  We are growing in illegitimacy statistics.  People are
having kids outside of wedlock in their thirties and forties,
even, and it is perfectly normal. People accept this.
<p>
There is also the fact that abortion really changes the entire 
equation; that once you have abortion, most people are concentrated 
on do I want this baby or do I want to abort.  They are not thinking
what is best for this baby.  They are not thinking child-centered.
They are thinking what is best for me in my circumstances.
<p>
And so until we can reach beyond the selfish need, and once they start
to focus on the child, then they do realize that adoption is the
best alternative.  But it takes a while to get there now.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: One of the things that strikes me as interesting about
the challenge that we face in terms of promoting adoption as we
should is that I think even if you put aside the issue of abortion,
which is obviously a key issue, and you just look at it from the
point of view of economic conservatism, there's a lot that needs
to be done, because in town -- and I have been in this city now
for 26 years -- I have heard very seldom what I would call the
economic conservatives, the libertarians, really focusing on adoption,
I think, the way they should.
<p>
I don't think that they understand that if you talk about welfare reform, 
if you talk about independence, if you talk about all of the issues that 
are critical to economic conservatives, that adoption is a real solution 
here. This is a way to take a pregnancy which is untimely and which may 
have tremendous social and economic negatives for a whole variety of
people and turn it on the flip side and make it an economic positive.
<p>
I mean, if you just take the comparison between a lot of state
laws that provide mandated insurance coverage for infertility
treatment -- infertility treatment is basically about a $35,000
procedure for a 25 percent chance of having a healthy baby.  Well,
if you compare that to adoption, adoption is, at most, on average,
a $15,000 cost for a 100 percent chance of having a healthy baby,
and economic conservatives should see that as a great bargain.
<p>
They should also see it as a great bargain in terms of preventing
welfare dependency, of preventing secondary pregnancies, of preventing
divorce because people got married when they were not really wanting
to.
<p>
So I think one of the things that particularly <i>Straight Talk</i>
and the Family Research Council has been great at doing is in
getting out to economic conservatives and giving the message to
them that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It costs less.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: -- leaving the issues of morality aside, economic conservatives 
should really start focusing also on the issues of adoption.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So many broken wheels end up with a broken-down adoption 
system, and I would like us to look a little bit at foster care.  You
know, one of the things that we have seen as an impact -- and
I would like you all to say what you all have seen -- in adoption
is the fact that in foster care, sometimes we are spending years
and years and years of a child's life not severing damaged parental
bonds and allowing that child to go out of the welfare system
and into a stable married home.  We are holding children sort
of in perpetual child jail.
<p>
The Gregory K. situation, for example, when the boy tried to divorce his 
mother, could have been resolved with a severing of a very damaging 
parental relationship early. I don't think that should be taken by any of 
us to think that we don't want to hold families together when possible. 
<p>
But tell me what you're seeing, for example, with foster care, where 
children are there for their entire life, transferred from home to home
with no future.
<p>
MR. CASEY: It's a very tragic situation.  We hear a lot of tragic stories 
of kids being bounced between the birth home and the foster home.
<p>
Foster care costs about $10 billion, the state and federal costs together, 
whereas, as Bill points out, adoption is basically a cost-free solution.
<p>
I think foster care was originally intended as a temporary home for kids 
and oftentimes ends up being semi-permanent; in some cases, permanent.
And it cannot replace an adoptive home where you have loving,
willing parents who will care for the child, and that is the option
we should be pushing.  We need to move away from the long, prolonged
waits and go to a system where kids are given a better chance
and taken out of an abusive home on a more timely basis so they
don't spend so much time in foster care.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: One of the things that reminds me of the foster care issue 
is, indeed, some material that I got from Chris's organization the 
other day. There is a case up in Philadelphia involving Baby Mitch, 
which is a perfect example of what we're talking about.  Here we're
talking about a newborn baby which was abandoned.  Usually that
baby would end up going into the public foster care system, rattle
around the system, and be lucky if, in a year or two, that child
ended up being placed for adoption.
<p>
Well, they did something really radical, and they turned the baby 
over to the private charitable sector, and they said, &quot;Find a 
home for this child.&quot; And that is one of the things that we think 
would make real good sense, and in fact one of the things that we 
have been trying to push on the federal level is something called the 
Abandoned Babies Act, which was introduced by Representative Fawell from
Illinois, and what he is basically saying is, &quot;Look, we're
not trying to take anybody's rights away, but we ought to jump-start
the system so that if a baby is abandoned, you get that kid through
the system in a hurry and you get that kid into a permanent home.&quot;
<p>
Quite frankly, I think that the way to do that is to do what they
did in Philadelphia and what they have done before in some states,
and that is to basically say, &quot;Look, we're going to take
the issues that have to be done by the state -- the police powers,
like protective services -- and we're going to leave that in the
hands of the public welfare department.  But the other things
that can be contracted out, that can be given to the private voluntary
sector, we're going to give them those things to do.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are getting a lot of calls at Family Research Council
every day, people who are interested in adoption, and I've got
a list myself of people who want more information.
<p>
Chris, you are getting ready to have a conference.
<p>
MR. CASEY: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have very little time left.  Where can they call and 
what will they hear at your conference?
<p>
MR. CASEY: Well, they can call me at the offices, and the number is 
(703) 875-8724, and I will be happy to send them materials on the 
conference.
<p>
Dr. Pierce is helping us with the conference, and there are others, 
national adoption leaders, that we're going to convene.  We will have 
a seminar on May 9 here in Washington where we will bring together
experts to talk about the problems, and then in the fall we're
going to have a full-day conference in early October to expand
upon it and to talk about solutions.
<p>
I think one of the things that we would like to see is, if this 
government, the national government, can talk about putting 100,000 
cops on the street in high-crime areas, we think it's time that we 
worked towards the goal of 100,000 adoptions each year for the next 
five years. That would go a long way, we think, towards rebuilding the 
family in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is very exciting, and I would like to thank my 
guests.  Call Family Research Council for more information.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we introduce
you to an attorney who facilitates adoption and a couple whose
unique experience in adopting a child you won't want to miss.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome Barbara Jones, 
an adoption attorney who has facilitated many successful
adoptions, and Benny Phillips, pastor of Fairfax Covenant Church,
and his wife, Sheree.
<p>
The Phillipses have six biological children, which is amazing in 
itself, but they are here to share the story about their youngest 
daughter, number seven, Julia.
<p>
Thank you for being with us today.  Thanks so much.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Glad to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  This is so exciting.  We were talking about some of 
the legalities of adoption in the first segment, and it is very, 
very difficult.  But yours is a story that so many people call us 
about wishing they could adopt, and we get many, many calls.
<p>
Now, I am going to hold up a photo of your family. I think some 
people are going to have a hard time understanding
why, with this lovely family, you all had the yearning to adopt
and your passion for adoption.  Tell us why.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Well, about, I guess, 10 years ago, 10 or 11 years ago, 
God just dropped something in my heart that some day we would be 
adopting, and at that point we had only two children, I think.  Time 
passed; we continued to have children, as you see, and as we got more
involved in the pro-life issues and talked to various people,
their experiences of how you can serve and help as far as the
pro-life movement is concerned, one of the ways we felt like God
would have us get involved is through possibly a crisis pregnancy,
and that is how this all developed, was through a crisis pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sheree, do you remember that day?
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS: The day that she came?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The day you got your child.
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  As a matter of fact, we were contacted by
a mutual friend about a very young teenage girl who had scheduled
an abortion but had consented to talk to a couple, particularly
a pastor, about her decision, and we had the privilege of going
to meet her, along with her mother, to speak with her, to encourage
her, to express love to her and concern for her, and we were delighted
when, just a few days later, she called and had canceled the abortion
and asked us to consider taking her baby.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fantastic. And, Barbara, you helped facilitate that, 
I understand.
<p>
MS. JONES:  I had the great privilege of working with this precious
family.  Not only do they have a heart for children, but their
heart was very expandable.
<p>
I think some of the most exciting things that we went through were 
just the relationships that they were experiencing with the birth 
parents.  After they met the birth mother, they had the opportunity 
to go and meet the birth father, speak with him to see if in fact he 
was amenable to this particular family receiving his child.  That 
meant a great deal to him, and it established the rapport and the 
relationship for him to be able to relinquish his child as well and 
know his child would be in good hands.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are you finding as you have been handling adoptions? 
So many people are deterred and intimidated by the legal barriers, 
really, to adoption.  What are you finding in your practice to be 
true about the legal barriers to adoption?
<p>
MS. JONES:  Well, much of it is myth.  With some of the media
cases -- Baby Jessica, Baby Richard -- there is a tremendous fear
that is really evident when you speak to adoptive couples.  But
as we educate them and point out in some of these cases there
were actual legal errors that may not have been proclaimed by
the media and teach them that the relationship can make such a
difference, just in meeting the birth parents.  I think education
is really a key.
<p>
Also, there are the statistics.  There is such discouragement that 
there are not babies to adopt, which in fact, there are babies to 
adopt, and it is showing families how to meet birth parents, to link 
up with them for adoption.
<p>
I think another concern is cost.  It is very costly, and as a result 
of educating, and people like Benny and Sheree, pastors, doing it in 
their church, many churches have established funds to help the families 
with some of the costs to defray them, and also to be able to point
out other areas, if there are grants available, to direct families,
even to teach them such things as they can take loans against
life insurance policies, home equity loans; also, churches many
times just take an offering for the family.  So to encourage them
that if they really have a heart for it, there is a way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What were you surprised about?  As you began to have a 
passion for adoption as a solution to abortion, what surprised you as
you were learning?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think probably the thing that surprised us 
the most was how quickly you emotionally get involved in the process 
and how, as we began the process of adoption, particularly a 
trans-racial adoption, just how your heart -- talk about expandable 
heart -- just how your heart grows and expands for this whole issue, 
and you get to a place where you really want to be able to provide not 
only these children with homes and environments but to be able to serve 
people who are in crisis situations, that this is a viable option, and 
the church can do something about it, and to instruct even people
in our churches that, hey, here's an opportunity for us to carry
out the mission, to broaden our evangelism, and to really make
a difference in people's lives.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of people are afraid to adopt.  Were you all 
afraid to adopt?  Were you afraid about being a media case where someone 
was going to come back and say, &quot;I changed my mind&quot;?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  I think for about 15 minutes, and after Barbara talked 
to us and we asked that question and she was able to educate us as to 
what is really going on, it dissipated, and from that point on we didn't
carry any concern whatsoever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Tell me, Sheree, about the first moment that you saw 
the baby.  What was that like?
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS:  Well, it was a moment I'll never forget, because, to
be quite honest with you, I had some concerns about adoption.
Having had six biological children, having been told that we
would never have children, I received each of these children so
eagerly.  I was a little concerned, to be candid, that I would
have the affection and the love and the bonding that I experienced
with my biological children with an adopted child.
<p>
But because we were able to share the labor experience with our birth 
mom, we were able to be in an adjacent room and receive our little
baby girl, we heard her first cries and she was presented to us
still wrapped in her little newborn blanket, when the nurse walked
in and handed her to me, I can honestly say that in that moment
I knew this is my little daughter.  And the moments we had there,
an hour or so that we had with her, holding her, talking with
her, experiencing -- her maternal grandmother was there, and we
got to share that time with her -- was a precious moment.
<p>
For any adoptive mom that I speak with who has, understandably, 
similar concerns, I can say that the love that we have, the bond that
we share with our daughter Julia, is no different than that that
we have with our biological children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you find that as you -- you get to see this miracle 
regularly.
<p>
MS. JONES: I do.  One of the most fun questions is always to -- when 
I am working with folks that do have biological children or a biological
child and they are seeking to adopt or going through the process,
is to say to them afterwards, &quot;Please, tell me what it's
really like, because you've had the privilege of being a biological
parent and an adoptive parent.&quot;
<p>
Benny and Sheree were the two that did it best and in a most lasting 
way, in my memory. They said, &quot;Well, it's different but it's the 
same, but you love them just the same,&quot; and then the tears came, 
and they just can't put it in words, but what that showed me is that
there is truly a grafting into the heart, and they understand
more than us -- we were not adopted -- what it really is like
for the Lord to adopt children, that He loves us unconditionally,
and that always is the case.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very much so.
<p>
You get to see a lot of people long term. What do you find? People 
adopt once; they want to come back and adopt more children. You hear 
some people saying, &quot;Well, sure, it's great maybe at that 
moment, but what about later?  Does the shine wear off?&quot;
What are you finding as that has been your focus?
<p>
MS. JONES: The shine doesn't wear off.  For some families, they are 
satisfied when there are two siblings because there is a brother or 
a sister in the family, and often through agencies that is the limit.
In the past it has been maybe two children per family.  So sometimes
they are content with that.
<p>
Then you meet the family like the family that is down in Florida, the 
owner of the Orlando Magic team who has many children.  Occasionally I 
work with couples where there is no limit, and they come back for more 
and more and more. There is no limit to their love and their household.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is very, very exciting, and we want to actually
let people meet Julia.  If you want to come on and bring her in,
and this is your oldest daughter, I understand?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We would like to have you --
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: This is Jamie.  She is not our oldest, she is our oldest 
girl.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Oh, your oldest girl.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  We have a son 18 -- come here, sweetie.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Great.  Come on in to Dad.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  And this is Julia.  Come here.  Look at the camera. 
Everybody wants to see your pretty face.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So what have you found as your family has adjusted to 
this newest child?  What myths about adoption do you laugh at now that 
you look back?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  Oh, wow!  I mean, we do laugh at the
myth that you can't love an adopted child as much as one of your
own, because I can't make a -- there doesn't seem to be anything
distinguishable to me in the way we relate to her and how we feel
about her as I did when she was her age, you know.  And the children
-- I mean, to watch these children relate to her and how they
have taken her -- as a matter of fact, the problem is her kind
of ruling things.  And so that whole thing of, you know, it's
different -- do you love, do you bond -- I find that that may
be difficult at first for some to get through that moment, but
you do get through it.  You really do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's very exciting.  Thank you for sharing your story.
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS: Thank you so much.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear
about the other side of adoption as we meet a young woman who
went through two different experiences in placing two children
for adoption.  Stay tuned for more after this break.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  I would like to welcome back Barbara
Jones, an adoption attorney, and a good friend of Barbara's, Nicki
Scolaro, who has a unique and touching story to share about the
circumstances of placing two children for adoption.
<p>
Thank you very much, Barbara, for being back, and Nicki, for coming 
today. You placed two children for adoption, two different kinds of
adoption, closed and open, but tell us a little bit about why
that was a decision you made and how you came to make it.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Well, the first time I became pregnant, it was a situation
where abortion was not even a thought to me.  I just was raised
in a background and the family environment in which we just didn't
believe in abortion.  So I knew from the moment I found out I
was pregnant I was going to go with adoption.
<p>
With the first experience, I ended up going away to a maternity home. 
It was a very sheltered environment.  Counseling was provided.  But it 
was different in that only half of the girls actually placed their 
children for adoption, so it wasn't that that was what everybody did. 
But I knew what I was going to do from the moment I found out I was
pregnant, and it was a closed adoption.
<p>
It was just a situation where I described the type of family in which 
I would like my child to grow up, and they named some prospective 
clients only in a description of them.  I didn't meet anybody.  I 
don't know any names.  It was very closed, and after I had Lauren, my 
first child, I left the hospital 18 hours later and I had an hour to
say goodbye to everybody I had lived with for four or five months
and leave.
<p>
I had no contact for the first couple of weeks after
I returned home with the agency, and it was just all very standoffish
after that, and in that respect it was just not a positive experience
for me, just because so much was left to the imagination, and
there was just not a lot of comfort there, because I wasn't given
any information about --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you have a lot of fear about where your child was 
or --
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Yes.  I didn't know anything about the family.  My main 
concerns with that situation are, if something were to happen, would 
anybody ever tell me? How do they feel about me?  Situations like that 
where it's just, you know, when you are left with your imagination, you 
can imagine some pretty terrible things.  And when I came home, it was 
just a very awkward situation for my family.  It was a hard thing to
handle, and I ended up getting in a bad relationship and getting
pregnant again.
<p>
Actually, I was planning on keeping my second
daughter, simply because the adoption experience was not a positive
one, and I just didn't think it was possible to do it again. 
So, about six months into my pregnancy, I realized I was no more
equipped at that time to be a mother than I had been before, and
I still wanted to finish college and do things with my life, and
I just didn't see anything positive coming out of trying to raise
a baby on my own.
<p>
So that's when I decided to adopt again, or place for adoption again, 
and I knew there had to be a better way to do it, and it just so 
happens that I was living with a family who took me in as an unwed 
mother, and his doctor's nurse wanted to adopt. So I just called her 
and was like, &quot;I'm pregnant; do you want to talk?&quot;  I mean, 
it was a very awkward situation.  It just seemed so unnatural, like, 
&quot;Hi, do you want my baby?&quot;
<p>
So we actually ended up meeting, and just by luck we just fell in 
love with each other.  She and her husband are just wonderful people, 
and they had adopted before, and it just worked out so perfectly. I 
mean, it just doesn't seem like anything at all went wrong. I became 
very close with them, and they were actually in the room when Katherine 
was born. In fact, I was spending the night at their house and I went 
into labor, so they took me to the hospital.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A very much better experience.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Yes, totally the opposite extreme from Lauren's situation. 
And the comfort that I feel from knowing them so personally and seeing 
her house.  I know her dog and her older sister.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: I mean, there is just nothing left to my imagination. I 
don't have to wonder about anything, as well as for them, any questions 
she may one day have, they will be able to answer.  So it is a very 
positive experience.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think in the first -- there is a lot of discussion 
about how -- although a lot of women think adoption might be something 
they would like, that there really is a lot of need for counseling to 
deal with the emotions connected.
<p>
From your experience, would that have helped even the first time,
to have had someone there?
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Oh, definitely, definitely. When I came home from having 
had Lauren, I was in this emotional wilderness, and they pretty much 
didn't tell me what it was going to be like as far as -- you know, all 
they talked about was, &quot;Oh, you get to start school in a couple 
of months,&quot; and they talked about me as far as what I would do for 
the rest of my life, but not in relation to the loss I felt with -- I 
mean, there is a hole there.  You get -- all these maternal instincts 
come, and there is nothing there to take care of, and it's a hard 
thing to deal with, and I think, had I had counseling at that time,
I more than likely would not have gotten pregnant again.
<p>
But I ended up, once I did get pregnant again, I realized I had to 
have some help, and I was in counseling for a while, and it totally
changed my life.  I mean, I really needed that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And now you're going to graduate from college soon and are 
looking toward law school and to a lot of other choices.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Yes.  I am actually considering becoming an adoption 
attorney, because there is so much that I think needs to be changed. 
As we were saying before, there are so many myths about adoption
that people just have this horrific picture of it, and it really
does not have to be that way if you do it right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, Barbara, you are involved in these situations. What 
are you finding as you are dealing with young women making very hard
choices?  What do you find that you need to tell them?
<p>
MS. JONES: You mentioned the counseling. First of all, when I meet 
with a birth mom, generally, they have already matched with a 
prospective adoptive parent, or it might be a situation where they come 
from a crisis pregnancy center, and I will just give them free legal
counsel so they can factor that into the decision-making process,
whether they would actually be able to walk through it, and many
times that assists them in coming to that decision.
<p>
I think counseling is critical.  I have worked with birth moms who have 
been in total denial, told me that they never felt the baby kick, that 
when they went to the hospital, they were expecting maybe their period
was coming. There was such incredible denial, but then here's
the reality of a baby.
<p>
My favorite counselor with birth moms is in fact a trained social worker, 
but she is also a birth mother that placed a child six years ago, and 
she is so effective because she knows the issues of their heart. And 
when a birth mom can be -- if you can walk her through her grieving and 
all the things that she is going to be experiencing, it helps her to do 
the hard thing that she is doing and it gets her over that just really
difficult period and brings her to wholeness and healing again,
gives her hope.
<p>
So counseling is critical.  I think education is critical. Even in the 
legal relationship, working with birth parents, it is far more than just 
the law part, because in many ways you are a friend and you are walking 
them through those different stages.  You come to care very much for 
them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The grieving is something, I think, that people don't talk 
a lot about, even when you are making a decision that it is something 
that you're letting go.  How long did it take you to sort of grieve
and get over that?
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Actually, I can't say that it is something that ever 
really ends.  There comes a point where definitely you don't cry every 
day. It's a loss you have to deal with constantly.  I think, at least 
for me, I can say that it is just something -- I had to accept that this 
was just part of who I am now and part of my life, and you have to move 
beyond the shock of, oh, my gosh, this actually happened to me, or that
I actually did this, and you have to try to look at it as a positive
experience.  I mean, my life is much better, her life is much
better, this family is happier, and you have to just focus on
the positive.
<p>
But there are still moments when I think it is almost surreal, like 
I can't believe I did that, not in a bad way, but just it seems 
unbelievable.  But I think there is always going to be something, like 
it's very hard for me to imagine, when I do get married and have 
children, being happy about being pregnant or something like that. 
There is always going to be something there that I am going to 
associate with having children that will never leave me. It is like 
I will never forget that they exist. They will always be my first two 
children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure, absolutely. What are you finding -- you know, Nicki 
is thinking of, saying now the way to deal with it is to be positive. 
When you are talking to a birth mother, is it helpful to say, &quot;Let's
think of the positives&quot;?  What is helpful?  What have you
found to be helpful when you are there?  Because it is easier
for Nicki now to say, &quot;This is how I deal with it.&quot;
What is helpful when you are there talking with someone who is
considering adoption?
<p>
MS. JONES:  First of all, to let her know that it is her decision and 
no one is going -- we are not going to pressure her. It is also very 
important, I think, to esteem a birth mother, to tell her she is a woman 
of honor, and she is a woman of integrity, to hold her head high, because 
she is bringing life three ways:  to this infant, to her own body, not 
experiencing the ravages of abortion, and she may choose to give the gift 
of life to a family that is waiting.  So I think that is very important.
<p>
Also, the other thing that seems to just really stand out is the
relationship that birth parents establish with adoptive parents,
and sometimes they will tell you that the sweetest part about
adoption is the relationship with the adoptive parents, and some
will say that we're afraid we're going to miss them more than
we'll miss our baby, because we know in time we'll go our own
ways and separate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much for being with us, both of you, and I 
really appreciate the stories that you're telling. When we return, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a clip from CBS's <i>48 Hours</i>, 
which brings into light a whole new perspective on parenting
and who has the right to raise children.  Don't go away.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Coming up, we've got a clip from <i>48 Hours</i> 
which takes a look at homosexual adoption, a very controversial topic.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>

[Clip from CBS <i>48 Hours</i>, February 22, 1996, follows:]
<p>
MALE VOICE:  . . .it really doesn't matter whether they have a father 
there or not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Men and women are not interchangeable puzzle pieces.
<p>
MODERATOR: It matters to Kristi Hamrick and the Washington-based Family
Research Council, a conservative think tank.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  . . .the issue here is not two women who benignly want to 
set up a home; it is people actively seeking to rewrite the world, to 
rewrite the law, to rewrite child development into their own image.
<p>
MODERATOR: The judge who wrote the New York decision said that when it 
comes to the best interests of a child, stability and two parents at
home is more important than sexual orientation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The judge is wrong, because eventually these children are 
going to want to know, why wasn't there a father there for me, why wasn't
there a mother there for me, why do I feel like something is missing
when everybody tells me that I've got everything I need?  Because
they need both.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> invites you to share in a very special annual Family 
Research Council event, the Washington Briefing.

<p>

The 1996 briefing brought together people from across the nation
to hear from some of the [people] most able to provide insight
into America's politics and the challenges facing today's American
family.  The wide range of briefing speakers, from Congressmen
and Senators to journalists, to individuals engaged in pro-family
battles, provides inside-the-beltway knowledge [to] which we as
the public are not often privy.

<p>

So we hope you'll join us tonight as we present highlights of the 
1996 Washington Briefing.

<p>

To begin, though, let's hear from some of the leading freshmen in the 
House of Representatives.  Congresswoman Sue Myrick of North Carolina,
Congressman David McIntosh of Indiana, and Congressman George
Radanovich of California answer some challenging questions asked
by some of the Washington Briefing attendees.  These are questions
that you may have wanted to ask many times and questions that
you hoped reporters would ask but didn't.

<p>

So we've gone beyond the newscasts and ignored some of the true 
insights that they might uncover as <i>Straight Talk</i> brings 
you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

[Segment from Washington Briefing follows:]

<p>

QUESTION:  What can we do to get the truth out, and, number two,
why is it that our side of the story isn't being told, except
through underground mechanisms that some of us hear but nobody
else does?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  Some of us who have been up
there all this year have been fighting this battle since the day
we got there in trying the turn around the way the message is
communicated, what we say, what we do, and tell the truth about
what we're doing.  But we haven't been successful in convincing
the powers-to-be to get it done.  We aren't going to get it through
the national media. We have to pay for everything we get.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RADINOVICH: What we want to leave here is emphasizing 
the fact that we need help in the form of volunteer effort and money in
order to get the message out.  But in addition to that, pray Psalm
37 continuously, because within your sphere of influence, there
is likely to be, I wouldn't say unlimited but an uncharted amount
of time for prayer, and that works.  You sit down and you pray
that prayer about what's going on in this country; you will, on
your knees, turn that election around, and I want to just totally
emphasize that.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

QUESTION: The Speaker was named the Man of the Year, and he 
certainly has had a great deal of energy in the contract, and we 
don't hear much from him anymore.  Does he still have the support 
of the freshman class and the Republicans in Congress, and what 
role is he going to play in this next year?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  Well, he does have support of the class.
I'll just say that.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  Yes, definitely.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  The freshmen are behind him.  There has
been a lot of media that has been trying to divide us and say
that there is a problem within the Republican leadership, and
so forth.  That is not the case.  Newt stepped back to do the
vision thing again, which is the Contract with America idea. 
That's what he is about.  That's what he's best at.  He has turned
leadership duties over to Dick Armey and rest of us who are in
leadership.  We all have liaison responsibilities with particular
bills that are coming on the floor.  That is something that hadn't
happened before.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  You'll see the freshman
class rise up in Newt's defense, and they will continue to try
to attack him, because he has verbalized and stood for the things
we believe in.  He, as Sue mentioned, is very consciously at this
point preparing for the next fall's election, and he realized
that during the Presidential primary it would be difficult for
us to have a lot of leadership coming out of the House of Representatives,
because people would be focused on choosing a nominee for the
party.  But if we laid the groundwork now, we could go forward
once the nominee is chosen or becomes apparent and work towards
this renewed agenda.

<p>

He came back and briefed all of us a few weeks ago after the break 
that this was his plan and how he was doing it, and we all went up to 
him and said, &quot;Let us help in any way possible, because we want 
to support exactly what you're doing there.&quot;

<p>

QUESTION:  This question may sound cynical, but I ask it in all 
sincerity.  You're only freshmen for one session, and this freshman 
class is so great.  How long will it be before your freshman class 
falls into lock-step with the old guard in Washington, and now we've 
got to count on more freshmen?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  I think we probably all want to touch
on that one, but I will just say that we and those of us sitting
up here who are in freshmen leadership per se work very hard to
make sure that doesn't happen.  We kind of serve as each other's
conscience.  We prod each other.  One of the strengths we have
is that we're all willing to take on different issues, and somebody
will honcho a different issue, which is why we've been able to
do a lot, and that's very good.

<p>

But when we got here, we decided [that] together we were a force and 
we had some power, and if we weren't together, we were nothing; 
individually, we can do nothing. So we work very hard to keep us 
together, even when we are not freshmen.  Those of us who come back 
will do the same thing, and we will, hopefully, be able to work with 
the new freshmen coming in to make sure they do the same thing.

<p>

It is very important to us that we keep that mind-set.  We try to 
remind ourselves who we are, where we came from, and why we're here all 
the time.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RADINOVICH:  I think most of the freshmen that
have come in really were remarkable in one thing, and that was
that, as Sue said, they let you know who they were, how they thought,
and what they intended to do.  We did that formally through the
signing of the Contract with America, which was on September 27,
1994, and the election was after that, on November 8, 1994.

<p>

So that is something -- if anything else represents the change
that we bring or the beach head that we have established inside
the beltway, or however you want to put it, [it] is the fact that
we were clearly about who we were so that the voters across this
country who are smart, not dumb, knew exactly what they were getting
when they went to the polls, instead of trying to paint yourself
into something and then coming here and doing something else.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents more from the Family Research Council's 1996 Washington Briefing.
What can we do to help in the fight for pro-family issues?  Former
Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, a leading Democrat, shares
his ideas after this break. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. Former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey began our
1996 Washington Briefing, taking on the pro-life debate from a
unique perspective.  Let's hear what Governor Casey has to say
as we share with you FRC's 1996 Washington Briefing.

<p>

GOVERNOR CASEY: When I was governor of Pennsylvania, and I finished 
my service there in January of 1995, I saw first hand the root cause
of most of the social dislocation in our country, and that, of
course, as you well know and as this organization has championed,
the dislocation flows from the disintegration of the American
family.  Unless we try to reconstitute, as all of you know so
well, try to reconstitute that institution called the American
family, America will continue in a downward spiral.

<p>

Now, that is not being apocalyptic; I think that is being quite accurate
in terms of where we are in America today.  And I would say, if
one thing has become crystal clear in 1996 in the debate thus
far in the Presidential sweepstakes in America, it is, from where
I sit at least, not just the economy; it is also the culture.
And those candidates out there with a single-track message, who
talk only about the economy, don't seem to last too long.  It's
not that people are not interested.  Of course, we're interested,
and people want to know where America is going and where the candidates
out there today propose to lead us.

<p>

I would like to suggest two directions today, not exclusive by any 
means but important.  Number one, I think we've got to make adoption a 
number one national priority in the United States of America.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And I want to tell you why.  I ran a major state, no different from 
New York, California, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, you name it.  Thousands
of kids trapped in the foster care system; cost $10 billion, with
a B, $10 billion a year.  And all of the federal incentives, the
reimbursement systems, are in the direction of keeping those kids
in foster care, and they stay there too long, and when they leave,
they wind up too often either in the penitentiary or in the cemetery.

<p>

And why can't both parties stand up say, We disagree on a lot
of things, but there's one thing we can agree on, and that is
the most cost-effective, compassionate, effective alternative
for children in America today who find themselves trapped in foster
care is to make it easier for the adoption process to work, on
both the public side and the private side, so that the disincentives
in our federal reimbursement system are reversed in favor of urging
and giving incentives to states to take children out of foster
care and put them into adoptive homes where they will have a real
chance to be decent and law-abiding and happy and productive citizens.
Aggressive advocacy of adoption, I think, begins the process
of reconstituting the American family.

<p>

In my state of Pennsylvania in 1987, we joined with a group called One 
Church/One Child run by the Black Ministerium.  It began in Chicago and 
came to Pennsylvania. We teamed up with them at the state level, and 
over the next seven years, we placed 800 children, African-American 
children, in adoptive homes.  We began a new statewide initiative to 
press for adoption, to make it a top priority. We can do it and have to 
do it, it seems to me, at the national level.

<p>

Let me move now to a second proposal, and that is one with which 
you are very familiar:  Is America going to provide legal protection 
for the child or not? And how long do we have to wait?  We've waited 23 
years.  Another 25 years?  When is this debate engaged?  If not now, 
when, and if not you, us, well, then who?

<p>

Let me tell you what I am talking about.  We have an ideal opportunity 
right now, at a time of great spiritual and cultural renewal in this 
country, symbolized, I would submit to you, by the tremendous impact 
this organization and Gary Bauer and all of you have had in shaping 
public opinion in America.  I would commend to your reading this article 
here that I've brought with me today in the <i>Women's Quarterly</i>. 
It is written by a feminist, or at least a pro-choice person, whose
name is Candace C. Crandall.  It just came out.

<p>

She explains in this article why the pro-choice movement is suddenly 
playing defense. The title is -- you'll excuse me -- but &quot;The Fetus 
Beat Us.&quot; You see, we're winning this battle.  We're really winning
this battle.  It seems that too few of our own people realize
that we're winning this battle.

<p>

Look at some of the signs. The First Lady tells us abortion is wrong. 
<i>Newsweek</i> magazine. Kate Michaelman said that abortion is a 
&quot;bad thing,&quot; her words.  Henry Foster says that the 
abortion is a &quot;failure,&quot; his word, which he abhors. And 
Susan Estrich(?), who ran Mr. Dukakis' campaign, said, &quot;We're 
winning in the courts&quot; -- that is, the pro-choice side -- 
&quot;but losing in the streets.&quot;

<p>

Now, all of these signs and trends have made their demands on
the political system, and so in 1994, the Republican resurgence
in the Congress -- you've heard Mr. Steeper's(?) analysis of the
1994 returns when the number of people who voted for the Republican
Party in the congressional elections zoomed, catapulted, exploded,
from 27 million in 1990 to 36 million in 1994.

<p>

The Freedom of Choice Act went down the tubes, never got out of 
committee.  Medical schools aren't teaching young doctors about abortion 
anymore. Over 80 percent of the counties in America don't have abortion
clinics 23 years after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. In 1994, pro-life 
congressional candidates won, by and large, and pro-choice candidates 
lost, by and large.

<p>

Two conclusions follow, from where I sit, from all
of this.  One, cultural issues are central to the emergence of
the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States, just
as they are, in my judgment, to the demise -- some would say the
disintegration -- of the Democratic Party at the national level.

<p>

The <i>New York Times</i> had a front-page story about two months ago
talking about the Democrats and the defections across the United
States at all levels, not just retirements in the Senate and the
Congress; in state legislatures, in local government all across
America.  I think this concern I am talking about here today is
what fundamentally drives that demise, because how can the party
which came into being and which prided itself on leaving no one
out and no one behind, prided itself on the protection of the
powerless, how can it write off -- since when did America write
off -- an entire class of people, especially the most vulnerable
of all, and say, &quot;There's nothing we can do.  The children
must die&quot;?

<p>

That's not America.  That's not who we are. That's not our American 
experience.  We've never accepted that before, except in one case in 
the 1860s when the Supreme Court said that African-Americans are 
non-persons; they have no rights. That mistake was corrected. The 
mistake of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> remains to be corrected. But it will 
be corrected, and it will be corrected, in my judgment, in our 
lifetime if we make this case and make it consistently and make it 
with passion and make it, if you'll excuse me, with a sense of outrage 
and say to the people of this country, &quot;What are they doing to 
America, when we have lost 30 million?&quot;

<p>

And what do we have to show for it? Are women more liberated or more 
free?  I ask you, when is a woman more free, when she is giving life 
or when she is taking it? And is America's true character to be found 
in an abortion clinic or in an adoptive home?  What is consistent 
with the essential goodness and decency of the American people?

<p>

I think our people understand that, and if we present it to them 
as a natural outgrowth of the American experience, of expanding the 
circle of the commonly protected and making the Declaration of 
Independence not just words on a page but words to live by, we're 
going to prevail, because I firmly believe that abortion is destined 
for the scrap heap of history. I believe that we've got to continue 
to speak for the child. And if we do, I believe this country will 
realize the potential that Jefferson had in mind when he said that 
these rights, the most important of which is the right to life, 
these rights come not from the state, not from the Congress, not 
from the Supreme Court, not from the state legislature, but from 
the hand of God.

<p>

That's the challenge that I leave with all of us here today.
Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Please join us after the commercial break as we 
continue our 1996 Washington Briefing highlights with Rabbi 
Daniel Lapin.  You won't want to miss it.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  Rabbi Daniel Lapin is a strong advocate
of the preservation of America's families through Judeo-Christian-based
conservative values.  Rabbi Lapin has influenced many with his
commentaries on the socioeconomic trends that have shaped this
country.  Let's hear what he had to say to FRC's Washington Briefing
attendees.

<p>

RABBI LAPIN: There are two different views of America
today.  There is the view held by the Boy Scouts of America, by
Family Research Council, and by so many other Americans, actually
a majority of Americans, who still remember that it is duty, it
is faith, it is intellect.  It's doing what we know to be right,
not what we feel like doing.  And feelings, while very important,
come second.

<p>

Let us take a look for a moment at two organs that
the good Lord has provided us with.  He has provided us with eyes
and ears.  Let's ask ourselves for a moment which of those two,
eyes and ears, is the avenue to the emotions and which one is
the avenue to the mind and the intellect.  Think for a moment.

<p>

Gentlemen -- this is a quiz just for the gentlemen -- have you
or any other male whom you know, at the present or at any time
in the past, ever become involved with a woman in an utterly unsuitable
relationship that was destructive, painful, and going absolutely
nowhere?

<p>

[Laughter.]

You do not have to raise your hands for this one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I will take the answer as a yes from virtually all of us. When that 
happened to this man we all know, when this happened, was it because 
of the way the woman looked, or was it because of the way the woman 
spoke over the phone? Eyes and ears stand clearly for an emotional 
dominance versus an intellectual or obligation/faith/duty-driven view 
of the world.

<p>

While America was driven by words and by the ear, we were a nation 
that was capable of weighing things out, looking at the long term, 
being careful about things.  But as soon as we turned into a nation
that gets most of its information through the eyes, look what
happens.  Everything changes, and we are now -- every single debate
today is framed in emotional terms, everything.

<p>

What about the children?  Hillary Clinton made an entire industry, with 
her friends, out of the children, because that is a wonderfully 
emotional picture, and nobody stops to think that children shouldn't be 
Hillary Clinton's problem; it should be their parents' problem.  And if 
she wants to help children, she should help the parents, not the children.
We don't need a direct line from the government to our children.
We want that line to go through us.

<p>

We don't need schools where teachers are told, &quot;Be certain that 
your children are encouraged not to tell their parents about this 
part of the program.&quot; That is what children are taught in 
public school today:  &quot;Don't tell your parents about this. 
They won't understand.&quot;  We don't need that. But in an 
emotionally driven society, it is very difficult to deal with that.

<p>

Now, emotional is short term. It's now.  I've got to do something 
about it.  There's somebody starving. There's somebody hungry. 
There's somebody out there who needs help.  And there is no cause to 
ask oneself, what is the long-term impact?  And this is why it is that 
otherwise well-intentioned people, intelligent people, even 
intellectual people, would go for the welfare system as it is, 
because it is only reasonable if you bring up onto my screen a 
wretched, miserable, suffering human being. Ladies and gentlemen, 
is there anybody in this room who wouldn't feel driven by compassion? 

<p>

But don't do that to me.  I resent it.  You are robbing me of an 
opportunity to weigh it up intellectually. I don't want the picture of 
the starving person in front of me while I weigh this up.  I want to be 
able to think clearly for a few minutes and evaluate what is the most
effective way to help this problem long term.  But as long as
you are wrenching at my emotions, I can't do anything about this.

<p>

And that's why it is, in the book of Numbers, chapter 15, &quot;And
you should not stray after your hearts and after your eyes.&quot;
Heart, if you think about it, heart is a metaphor for the emotions.
Don't stray, says Numbers chapter 15, don't stray after your
heart and don't stray after your eyes.  You must have a heart,
and you must enjoy your eyes, but that's not a way to make decisions.

<p>

And that is what is happening.  The Peter Jenningses and the Dan
Rathers of the world are emotionally driven; they are visually
driven.  And the consequence is [that it is] very difficult to
maintain stable structures in society, because emotions are short
term; intellect and duty are long term.

<p>

This is why it is that Washington, D.C., is absolutely filled with the 
most wonderful single women, who truly desire to be married and to 
raise families, and it is tough to find guys that are man enough for the 
job, because we have been turned into an emotionally driven society,
not an intellectually driven one, and emotional is short term.
Short term, there are no benefits in marriage, particularly with
the wonders of the sex revolution that says that premarital sex
is just fine.

<p>

You have now eliminated the last possible, conceivable
-- well, that is perhaps not a good choice of word -- the last
possible reason why any man driven by short-term emotionalism
should ever contemplate marriage.  It's not possible.  Only with
the long-term view is that possible.

<p>

Now, what is the counter? If, indeed, we have become a society driven 
by the eye, driven by emotionalism, driven by the short term, that that 
is the final argument -- listen to our politicians sometimes; listen 
to public speakers.  You provide an emotional reason, and that's it. 
Everybody's satisfied.  That's the end of it.  It's non-refutable. You 
can't do anything about it.

<p>

This very hotel is running a campaign to add onto your bill for 
UNICEF, and there are pictures of children in need. It's tough. But 
you know something?  I'm not going to do it, because I am not 
convinced that the United Nations best knows how to make sure that 
that money goes into the tummy of a starving child instead of into 
that of a bloated bureaucrat.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And so there needs to be a restoration of the intellectual
faith aspect of life.  We've got to rebuild that, and I have two
very specific recommendations for you, two very specific recommendations,
recommendations that you can carry out with you to your families,
to your friends, to your neighborhoods, and above all convey these
ideas, if you would.  Tell them your rabbi sent you.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Convey these ideas as a proud religious conservative.  Let's come
out of the closet.  It seems everyone else has.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

There's nothing wrong with saying, &quot;I am a religious conservative,
and it is my religious belief that fuels my ideas,&quot; because
politics, ladies and gentlemen, is wonderful.  Politics is what
enables us to live with one another in spite of differences without
resorting to guns and fists.  We can talk our differences through.
And politics is nothing but applied values, and we must be proud
to say where our values come from, because there is no other way
to combat the drive of the heart which we should not follow, the
drive of the eyes which we should not follow.

<p>

And so my specific two recommendations are:  number one, reduce your 
TV watching by at least half an hour a day.  Now, just to give you the 
figures here, ladies and gentlemen, I have done this calculation over
and over and over again.  I can't believe it myself, but believe
me, it is true.  If you methodically cut out half an hour a day
of television watching, which I am sure every one of us can do,
you gain, over the next decade, six months of productive time.
Six months. Do you know what you and I could do with six months
of productive waking time?  That is the time that half an hour
a day of television will buy you.

<p>

But it buys you something much more urgent than that, and that 
is a reduction in your visual input, and it gives you an opportunity 
to get a little bit more verbal input, which is more balanced. How 
do you do that?  Practice conversation. Encourage people -- do you 
know that there are Americans that have the television on during 
family dinner? Don't do it. It's terrible.

<p>

Those are my two suggestions:  half an hour less television a day 
and only conversation when the family is together. It's going to 
be very tough, because a society that has overwhelmed itself with 
emotionalism and with imagery and with eye-driven content is going 
to find it very difficult to converse. Have you noticed that? People 
are awkward when there's nothing on and we are reduced to nothing 
but conversation.  We have lost the art, and it can come back.

<p>

And, fortunately, we have such a ready source of material to bring 
it back, and that's the Bible. There is something to talk about. 
There is something to talk about, and there is a way of latching 
onto any aspect of events of the day and using the time to analyze them 
from an intellectual point of view with no pictures.  Expose your children
to that.  Encourage other people to do the same.  It's a wonderfully
exciting experience.  But apart from the pleasure it brings, it
reduces the visual input, which makes the participants that much
less an emotional crowd.

<p>

And, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, as these crashing waves of 
cultural chaos threaten to engulf the very civilization that has bred 
us, it is only going to be a traditional Judeo-Christian vision of 
society, made possible by all of you here today, that is going to 
restore the health of our great country. And it will. It will because 
we are at the very beginning of America's third great religious 
reawakening.

<p>

The first one, in the early 18th century, brought about American 
independence. The second one, in the 1800s, laid the groundwork for 
the abolition of slavery.  And the third one, ladies and gentlemen, 
that we are right in the middle of right now is the one that is going
to restore the moral, cultural, and economic health of our blessed
land.  Tell them your rabbi said so.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will share more 
of the 1996 Washington Briefing as we hear from Oklahoma Senator Don 
Nickles.  He shares some exciting changes he hopes to accomplish in 
the upcoming months. Please join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. The 1996 Washington Briefing allowed us to hear 
from those in government who are ardently fighting for America's 
families.

<p>

Senator Don Nickles is a real leader.  We now share with you 
his perspectives on current issues pending on the Senate floor and
how those issues affect you and your family.

<p>

SENATOR NICKLES: I want to talk to you about a whole bunch of issues 
that are kind of pending, and I will go kind of fast and talk about 
those and encourage your involvement and encourage your input, because
a lot of these are very important to families, one of which, I
am just going to say, is one of our biggest items.

<p>

Many of us believe very strongly in balancing the budget, and we believe
we should not spend more than we take, and you say, &quot;Why?&quot;
Well, that is economic policy and that is prudent and that is
fiscal.  I will tell you, I think it is vitally important for
our kids.  I don't think it is morally responsible to be leaving
our children with decades and billions and now trillions of dollars
of unfunded debt that we have put on their shoulders.  So I think
it is high time -- well past time, frankly -- for us to balance
the budget and quit laying more additional debt on our children.
That is what the fight is for.  It is, are we going to morally
responsible?

<p>

We live in the greatest and the freest county in the history of 
mankind. That is a real blessing. God has blessed us. But we see a 
lot of challenges and in some cases some actions
that are taken either by President Clinton or maybe by Congress
that infringe on our freedom.  Maybe it is excessive debt.  Maybe
it is policies that are coming down from the administration that
really infringe on what I would call a family-friendly environment.
And when we see that, I think we have a real obligation to stand
up and say, &quot;Wait a minute.  That's wrong.&quot;

<p>

You know, it is not just fiscal issues.  I will just give you an 
example: welfare. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed two welfare
reform bills.  He campaigned that we need to end welfare as we
know it, and he always got applause.  I was one that was applauding.
We need to.  We have 334 federally defined welfare programs,
means-tested welfare programs:  if you meet this criteria, you
get the benefit.

<p>

We don't think that makes a lot of sense. A lot of us say, &quot;Wait 
a minute.&quot;  These government welfare programs are well 
intentioned; good intentions.  I don't fault the intentions of the 
authors of the proposals.  But what you have is program stacked on 
program on top of other programs, and the net result is that we have 
created a welfare dependency cycle where people are looking to 
government as their sole source of solutions to problems instead of 
to families, instead of to communities. Instead of developing an 
interest in trying to climb that economic ladder, they say, 
&quot;Give me a handout.&quot;  We have almost created a generational 
welfare dependency cycle.

<p>

We are going to have a debate before too long on minimum wage.  I am 
going to oppose their efforts.  And you say, &quot;Well, why?&quot;
Hey, I used to make minimum wage.  My wife and I have been married
now 27 years; she has still put up with me.  Our first jobs, we
both made minimum wage.  And, frankly, it wasn't enough.  President
Clinton and others say, &quot;Oh, no, we think it should be against
the law for you to have a job unless you pay such-and-such,&quot;
and therefore pricing some jobs out.  Maybe it is that janitor
service, maybe it is pumping gas, maybe it is sacking groceries.

<p>

But that might be that 16-year-old in Chicago that has some
open time during the summer, and so if he can't get a job, what
is he going to do?  And a lot of times people end up in the wrong
environment.  Instead of doing something good and positive, maybe
a job, and saying, &quot;Hey, this job doesn't pay enough, I need
to learn more, I need to get a better education, I need better
training so I can get a better job,&quot; they end up involved
in drugs or in crime, and so on.  And so to me that is an important
issue.

<p>

It is an important issue when we talk about crime. Unfortunately,
I notice President Clinton has got maybe an election year conversion.
He is starting to talk about his war on the drugs.  We just did
two papers talking about Clinton's about-face on the war on drugs.
He is now going to increase funding for the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.  What he didn't tell you [was] that in 1993
he reduced the office from 146 employees to 25.  What he didn't
tell you [was] he cut the office by over 80 percent in 1993; he
totally gutted the office.

<p>

When you talk about family values, it is interesting. You remember 
the Clintonites just ridiculed Vice President Quayle when he started 
talking about family values. Let me tell you something. Dan Quayle 
was right, and welcome aboard the Clintonites and others when you 
start talking about family values.  Family values are important.

<p>

I urge you to get involved.  I urge you to get involved in these 
campaigns, whether for House members or for Senators or for the 
President of the United States.  It is critically important, and it 
is not just so you can elect more Republicans.  I am a partisan 
Republican. I am chairman of the Policy Committee, and so on.

<p>

Find out where people stand on issues.  I will be very comfortable if 
this group will go out and find out where people stand on issues, 
regardless of party.  I will be very comfortable with whoever you support.
You find people that have character, people that believe in family
values, people that really think as you do on a lot of these issues,
whether you are talking about abortion, whether you are talking
about gays in the military, whether you are talking about who
should be surgeon general, who should be appointed to the Supreme
Court.

<p>

These are awfully important issues.  These are issues
of life and death.  These are issues that deal with the future
of our kids and our grandkids, so they can come back and say,
&quot;Yes, we really do thank God for the fact that we live in
the United States of America, because it is still the greatest
and the freest country in the history of mankind.&quot;

<p>

Thank you very much. God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> gives you a look 
at issues being battled by our very own Family Research Council staff. 
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The Family Research 
Council staff works diligently to positively shape issues affecting 
today's families, from pro-life issues to cyberporn to gay marriage. 

<p>

FRC briefing attendees wanted to know some specifics on those issues, 
so they asked our staff. Let's hear those questions and answers on 
tonight's Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

STAFF MEMBER: It would seem like to me -- and I guess this is to Bob 
Knight and Bob Maginnis -- that a President that has pushed the 
homosexual issue as strongly as he has, that in itself would be enough 
to defeat a President, and I wonder why we haven't been stronger
on that, to use that against him.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  One problem is you don't see too many opposition 
figures out there in front on this issue, frankly.  It's a hard sell 
for us in Washington to persuade people to take it on, even though it 
is a clear winner with the American people.

<p>

Right now the Republican nominee will have a terrific opportunity 
to delineate the differences between the two parties should he 
choose to do so, and that is by taking up the gay marriage issue. That 
is going to be a monumental issue in this country during this year, 
during this election year.

<p>

You have to ask yourself how many politicians would want to be in
the position of voting against laws that uphold traditional marriage
during an election year.  I mean, this is a gift to anybody who
wants to take it up, and yet we frankly have been meeting opposition.

<p>

We are hoping that will change this year, because the marriage
issue is a winner.  The polls show that 71 percent of the people
in the state of Hawaii are against gay marriage, liberal Hawaii.
Polls show similar figures for the nation as a whole.  And given
that this is after about 10 years of mainstream media propaganda
about homosexuality with almost no answering except the work we
have done and some other groups, once the issue is joined and
the facts are out on the table, I can only imagine that those
figures will rise.

<p>

So the real problem is we need some leadership in the political 
realm to take up the cause that we know all Americans would 
respond to.

<p>

COL. MAGINNIS:  It has only been the Family Research Council -- and 
I can say that without any reservation -- that has really led the 
charge on this issue, that has held the fort.  We have been in the 
courts, and we are the only organization in the courts in this 
country battling the issue of homosexuals in the military.

<p>

One of these cases, probably the <i>Thomasson</i> or the 
<i>Abel</i>(?) case, will go to the Supreme Court this fall, and
we will have a decision this time next year which will tell us
what the Supreme Court thinks about this issue.  What the Supreme
Court tells us about this issue will have just about as much significance
as what they tell us about the Second Amendment out in Colorado.
Probably it is going to have a lot to do with some of what Bob
just outlined in regard to single-gender marriage, because they
cite all these military cases as evidence that there is no problem
with this.

<p>

I will tell you that the people on the Hill -- and
I have talked to a lot of them on this issue -- they run from
it because they are afraid of it.  People in the military -- I
talked to the chief of staff of the Army and to most of the senior
leadership.  They ran from it.  There are only a few people that
are willing to stand up and tell the truth.

<p>

STAFF MEMBER: I just wonder what is being done to get pornography off 
of the Internet.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Just in January, as part of the large Telecommunications
Reform Act of 1996, we had the Communications Decency Act, which
is specifically designed to deal with the accessibility of pornography
on the Internet.  So that was passed, and that was a huge victory
for us.  We worked for a long time on that, with other groups
as well.

<p>

Immediately after President Clinton signed the act, though,
the ACLU filed suit against the Communications Decency Act, saying
it was unconstitutional, and I am traveling to Philadelphia at
the end of this week for the trial in that case.

<p>

The ACLU thinks it is unconstitutional because they think any 
restriction on anything that can remotely be called speech or expression 
is unconstitutional. They are wrong, and they usually lose, and we 
expect that they will lose in this case, too.

<p>

What the CDA does is says that mild pornography, which adults have a 
constitutional right to get -- we don't like that, but that is the state 
of the law -- cannot be given to children, and that is on firm legal 
grounds. So the CDA is well within constitutional precedent, and we 
think it is going to be upheld.

<p>

Does that mean that there will be no pornography on the Internet? 
No, that is not what that means, because pornography laws are broken 
every day.  But the fact is, there will be ground rules, and there 
will be a law that a prosecutor can use to prosecute people who violate 
this new law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with 
us to hear how you can get more information regarding the key issues 
affecting you and your family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>.  I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> presents two incredible women who 
have committed themselves to making a difference.  Theirs is 
not a random sentiment but a focused love for those children 
who have suffered the most severe physical, emotional, and 
sexual abuse.

<p>

Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson founded 
Childhelp USA more than 20 years ago, and it has become the 
largest national nonprofit child abuse treatment and 
prevention organization.  We had the opportunity to visit 
the Alice C. Tyler Village of Childhelp East to see how 
children's lives are benefitting from Sara and Yvonne's life 
work and the work of Childhelp staff and volunteers from 
across America.  You won't want to miss seeing the 270-acre 
Virginia facility that houses children ranging from 2 years 
old to 12 years old. 

<p>

Like the more than 3 million other children who 
endure abuse each year, these children long for healing, 
both physically and emotionally.  Tonight's show will help 
you understand why Childhelp USA serves as a lifeline to 
suffering children across our nation. 

<p>

In addition to the staff of Childhelp USA, the 
volunteers provide a crucial aspect in the healing of abused 
children, from organizing fund-raising events to purchasing 
a child's birthday gift.  I had the opportunity to talk to 
Connie Olsen, a vice president of the Childhelp USA Board of 
Directors, Chairman of the Alice C. Tyler Village of 
Childhelp East, and wife of someone close to us here at 
Family Research Council, Phil Olsen, Vice President of 
Resource Development. 

<p>

Connie's Childhelp involvement began in California 
and continues here on the East Coast and nationwide.  So let 
us now bring you an inspirational story not often heard in 
the broadcast or print news coverage as we take you Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Connie, you're a national board 
member with Childhelp.  There are a lot of good 
organizations.  This is certainly a phenomenal one. 
But why this one?  Why did you choose it? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I graduated from social work from 
Utah State University, and when I had children I stayed 
home, and when my youngest one was 4 years old, I started 
looking for something outside the home, a charity to get 
involved in, and someone approached me and asked if I wanted 
to be a part of a chapter in Orange County, California, to 
raise funds for an organization called Childhelp USA for 
battered and abused children.

<p>

So I did a little bit of research, found out what 
they did, what they were about, and thought, This is for me. 
This sounds great.  So I took a tour of the Village and 
joined the chapter.  That was in 1981. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So as a person who had not been 
involved full time in working with abused children, what 
impressed you about Childhelp?

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think the thing that impressed me 
the most was the dedication of the volunteers, as well as, 
when I took a tour of the Village, the dedication of the 
childcare workers that worked with the children.  I could 
see that they were really there not because they were 
burdened by what has happened to these children but because 
they really felt there was hope for them, and I was so 
impressed with the process that they used with the children 
to try to heal them.  That is what really impressed me. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As a board member, what are your 
goals for Childhelp? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  The goals that I have as a board 
member are to try to help raise the funds to do the 
necessary treatment that is necessary for the children, from 
the art therapy to the animal therapy to excursions for the 
children, to anything that is needed to help them build 
their self-esteem, get a good education. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You have gotten to see some really 
troubled kids come into this program.  I mean, how would you 
describe the lives that you have seen so that people can 
understand the kind of trauma we are talking about? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  Well, as I think you have probably 
been told, the children that we get at the Village out here, 
their last resort is a psychiatric ward.  So the average age 
of our children right now is age 5 and 6.  They are really 
young.  We have children that have just finished their last 
dose of chemotherapy.  We have children that are 
handicapped. 

<p>

You look at these cute little beings, and you just 
look at the trauma that they have been through already, and 
they are only 5 and 6 years old.  It just touches your heart 
and makes you feel so good.  Even if it is as a volunteer, 
there are just certain things that you can do, whether or 
not to go to a toy store and get different donations for the 
therapy that they have in art or whatever it might be.  But 
the cases are severely abused. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What makes the biggest difference in 
the lives of these kids? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think it is the fact that they 
realize that when they come here that they are not going to 
fail, and the staff knows that they are not going to fail, 
that they are going to work with them until they are 
successful, and they don't accept failure.  And I think that 
that is probably, for many of these children, the first time 
that they have ever gotten that feeling from an adult. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there any special child that 
comes to mind that you labor for here at Childhelp USA? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  When I lived in California, I was a 
special friend to a little 4-year-old girl.  One of the 
other reasons I got involved with Childhelp was that I could 
involve my children, too, in the process.  And so we had 
this little 4-year-old girl who was our special friend, and 
we were able to take her on different excursions away from 
the Village.  So even now, after -- that was in 1984, and 
even now, I think about that little girl and -- she had been 
sexually abused -- and the things that she had gone through. 

<p>

Even as a volunteer, you get tired, and you are 
knocking on doors, and you get people slamming the door in 
your face sometimes, and you are just a volunteer.  But when 
you think back at the children and why you are there, I 
think that is the special thing in your heart that keeps you 
going.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What one thing would you like people 
to know about Childhelp USA?  This is the first time maybe 
they have even heard of it.

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think the most important thing is 
that they really care for children, and they sacrifice and 
do anything that they can do to really make that child feel 
better about themselves, learn forgiveness, and understand 
what happened to them the best way that they can.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Connie, thank you so much for being 
with us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  Thank you for asking me.  This was 
great.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you two women who are dedicated 
to the prevention, treatment, and research of child abuse.
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I had the opportunity to visit a 
wonderful facility where abused children find a home and a 
safe haven, and I also had the chance to meet with two women 
who made it all possible for these abused children to 
receive healing. 

<p>

Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson were 
introduced to the critical need for such an organization 
more than 25 years ago, and <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes 
you on a visit to the East Coast Childhelp USA Village. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA: Childhelp is one of the leading 
organizations fighting child abuse across America.  We deal 
in research, prevention, treatment, and we are trying to 
make a difference in this world and turn these children that 
have been abused into wonderful citizens where they will not 
continue that abuse, that cycle, and we are making great 
headway.

<p>

We are very thrilled that so many people in this 
country now are aware of child abuse, because when we 
started our efforts in that direction, very few people knew 
about it, nor were they really sure that it was happening.  
And so the laws have changed, the issues are at hand, people 
know exactly where to go most of the time for help.  We have 
the National Child Abuse Hot Line, 1-800-4-ACHILD, and 
people can call there for help, whether an adult or a child 
in distress. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you say your goal is to stop 
the cycle of abuse.  So what do you mean by that?  I mean, 
these children come in and they are injured.  What kind of 
cycle would go on? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, we try to turn that child 
around.  The first thing you do is deal with their self-
esteem and build their potential where they know that they 
are a human being that is loved.  They have been told so 
frequently that they're a bad kid.  They're the ones taken 
out of the home, and so they feel that they're the ones that 
have done something wrong.  You have to assure them that 
they are a loved individual that can give back to this 
world.  And once you deal with them in therapy and in 
treatment and give them what they need to become whole 
again, you can turn a child around.  In fact, it is easier 
to turn a child around than it is an adult sometimes; in 
fact, most of the time.  They are like little sponges that 
take to heart the love and the care. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Their self-esteem is just rock-bottom 
when they arrive, and we try to make them feel good 
about themselves, and whatever is their interest, we try to 
work with them and build that, whether it is art or animals 
or whatever; it all plays a part of their self-esteem. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, people need to understand we 
are not talking about children who are having trouble 
reading.  Childhelp deals with a special kind of child.  
What kind of child would be involved in the program? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, these are the most difficult 
cases, children that really can't fit into an ordinary 
foster home, as an example.  In fact, many of them have had 
failed placements, as they call them.  They are like rubber 
balls going from foster home to foster homes because the 
foster homes are not always trained to care for these 
children.  They are not therapists, and these are children 
that are hard-core cases that need to be dealt with in the 
milieu that we have at our villages of Childhelp. 

<p>

The staff is tremendous in these villages.  They 
have to have a lot of care.  They have to have a great deal 
of patience, and they do wonderful work in turning these 
children around, and these are, as you say, not ordinary, 
just the ordinary child-abuse cases, so to speak; these are 
children that really come from mental hospitals quite 
frequently because of their emotional impact or, if they did 
not go to the villages, would end up in a hospital such as 
that.  So they definitely are hard core. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You know, also, a great part of 
the healing is love, and the staff really have a lot of love 
in their heart for these children, and we have had children 
who have arrived and they couldn't walk, they couldn't talk, 
and it's wonderful to see the staff work with these children 
and get them to walk, and maybe they are 2 and 3 years old 
and they're still in diapers.  But it's wonderful the love 
that they give these children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  These are children that have been 
molested, been abused, been beaten, been severely neglected 
and are generally underdeveloped on a multitude of levels? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  There is no question about that. 
There are so many different -- we will say this about every 
child that comes to the Village.  They are all emotionally 
battered, emotionally disturbed.  You would have to be to 
live through what they have been.  But every child is an 
individual.  They have their individual problems, and that 
is why each one has a specific program for them that is 
dealt with in how to deal with the child. 

<p>

We were at a staff meeting this morning looking on 
to see how that twice a day they have these meetings to 
determine how that child is doing and progressing and 
changing the modality of how they're being with that child 
if that child is not responding. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They work with them as an 
individual.  It is wonderful. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  They say that if you even attempt 
fund-raising broadly, that people cannot connect with that, 
but for people who are involved in helping others, that they 
have to do it specifically; that it is better to have 
someone support a specific child, better to have someone 
work for a specific goal.  Is there a child in your mind, or 
one or two children that you think of when you go out to try 
to make it happen, to try to bring in money, to try to work 
it?  Tell me about the children in your minds that you're 
thinking, This is a hard day, but today I'm doing it for 
this child. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  I think that when you break down a 
case, that is always the best, to think of one specific 
child, as you said.  There are 3.1 million cases of child 
abuse that are reported, but for every one reported, there 
are three to four that go unreported.  But when you bring it 
down to focus on one child's problem, you and I can relate 
to that. 

<p>

There are many favorite stories that Yvonne and I 
have.  One little boy had been locked in a closet all his 
life, and he had come to our Village, and we really raised 
him.  This is the Village on the West Coast.  We cared about 
him very, very much, because we had watched him develop from 
a child that could not speak and was so withdrawn.  He had a 
little limp.   

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  He didn't develop right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  His foot turned in because of the 
fact that he had been locked in that closet for so long. 

<p>

But we saw him through actually the time he was 12 
years old, and he was adopted by a minister and his wife.  
And so when we followed his case, to know that he could turn 
out to be even a human being, it was wonderful to see. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  With this same little boy, 
remember, we always have a Christmas program every year, and 
the children put on the play, and he was one of the first 
children at our Village on the West Coast.  We were all 
there together, and we had a couple of people who sing on 
the Lawrence Welk Show come and sing with the children, 
Guy(?) and Rolna(?). 

<p>

They were playing the guitar and singing, and all 
of us, we were baking cookies and singing Christmas carols 
and everything, and this particular little boy went up and 
looked at the guitar and looked up in their faces.  He had 
never heard music before.  And just a simple thing like 
that --  

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  He didn't know where it was coming 
from. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  He didn't know where it was coming 
from, but he had never heard it before, and then he loved 
it.  He thought music was the greatest. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We also had two children that were 
brother and sister that were raised with a group of dogs, 
and they really acted like dogs.  They would bite, they 
would bark.  Our staff had to deal with them on a one-to-one 
basis for a long time and really teach those children 
everything, how to go to the bathroom, how to eat correctly, 
and they were really something when they came to that 
Village.  We saw them shortly after that, and to see them 
just a few months later as an angel in the Christmas 
program --

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Again! 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- it really rewards us, because we 
do work very, very hard every day to bring in the money to 
keep our facilities going, and that is not an easy task. 

<p>

Sometimes when you get so tired, you think, well, 
maybe we should sit back and let someone else do it.  But we 
realize that our hearts are so in it, and we are so 
dedicated, that somehow we can tell the stories first hand, 
what is happening. 

<p>

The reward is to go to the Village, like we are 
here today, and see what is going on with the children and 
know that they are cared for and they are being turned 
around. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing 
child abuse.  Let's hear how Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime 
Fedderson began their efforts to heal broken lives and 
hearts of children.

<p>

You were actresses. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And somehow you got invited to go 
overseas on a trip to look at international children.  How 
did that happen? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, we were actresses in the 
1950s and 1960s, and they interviewed like 500 actresses to 
go overseas to entertain the servicemen, and we were the two 
selected, and they didn't even know we knew each other.  So 
it was meant to be, for sure.  But we went overseas in 1959, 
in October, and we went through one of the worst typhoons in 
the history of Tokyo. 

<p>

We were very young, and we took our little 
dictionaries with us, and we went out to see some of the 
area that had been hit so severely, and when we did, we 
found 11 little children huddled together on the street 
trying to keep warm, and their little hands were cracked and 
bleeding. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It was so cold.  It was horrible, the sight. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, it was so sad. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  They grabbed us and tried to get under our coats --

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They got under our coats. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- to keep warm.  It was really a 
tragedy that we had never seen. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  That is right.  We kept saying, 
"Do you have a <i>mama san</i>, do you have a <i>papa san</i>?" 
And they would say, "No, no," and we learned that these children 
were orphans, and they were Amerasians; they were American-
Japanese children, and they didn't have a home.  And so, 
through our military connections, we were able to place them 
in a home with a wonderful Japanese lady who had already 
taken 10 others off the streets in her home. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And when you went home, you raised 
money to help support those children? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes.  Well, before we left, we were 
<i>mama sans</i> of 21 children instantaneously.   

<p>

But then they started leaving children on the 
doorstep and up the block with notes pinned on them, "For 
the orphanage of mixed blood."  And so it ended up, before 
we came back to the States, we had over 100 children 
completely entrusted in our care, and that is when we came 
back to the States and began International Orphans, Inc., 
and from there we built onto that orphanage and built three 
other orphanages in Japan.  So we had four orphanages in 
Japan before Congress asked if we would do the same thing in 
Vietnam.  And so we went into Vietnam and built five 
orphanages, a hospital for orphans, and a school. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  So that is what we did overseas, 
and our work was kind of completed over there, and then 
Nancy Reagan said, "You know what?  You're looking for a new 
project here in America.  Why don't you look into child 
abuse?"  This was about 25 years ago, and we really hadn't 
read much about it at that time. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We thought she got it wrong. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  So, anyway, we got a small grant 
from Sacramento.  We looked into the problem, and of course, 
we learned that it was the number one killer of infants at 
that time.  Can you believe that, 25 years ago? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  But, you know, before that, we 
organized a Vietnam baby lift and brought the children over 
to this country.  We did not care for those specific 
children in an orphanage site, but each one of those were 
adopted the moment that we took them off the plane.  It was 
then that we went into the child abuse arena and ever since 
have been in that. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we are standing now at the site 
of what is going to be definitely the premier child abuse 
treatment center in the United States, probably the world.  
I mean, what do you think about in a moment like this? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, I think at one time in our 
life we thought we were going to be actresses and one day 
get married and have children, which we did.  But at the 
time when we found these little children on the streets, we 
thought we were just going to help them and that this was 
why we were selected to go over there, to help these 
precious little ones through the storm and find a home for 
them.  We didn't dream at that particular time that it would 
unfold like it has, and now we are one of the leading 
organizations to help abused and neglected children here in 
America. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  At that time we had no idea that God 
had planned this for our mission in our life, and we are so 
glad that He did, because it means that our life has been 
fulfilled in a glorious way to help these children become 
whole again. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You both are mothers, but in a way 
you probably feel like mothers to a large family. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, absolutely.  And we even tried 
to keep up with the children, the 11 that we found on the 
streets in Japan that caused us to start this whole thing, 
and I guess we are grandmothers and maybe great-grandmothers 
by now with those children. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  It is true. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Because we started so long ago, 37 
years ago.  But it is wonderful to see them turn out well 
and to come back and say that it made a difference in their 
life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you all have been friends for a 
long time. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Almost 40 years. 

<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So how would you describe, each of 
you, the thing that your friend brings to this special task, 
because you know each other better than probably almost 
anyone.  This is a very special task.  What special skills 
-- you know, describe each other.  What are the special 
skills you each bring? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, I think we both have the 
heart for children and the love for children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, Yvonne deals with the 
volunteers a great deal. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Yes, I work a lot with the 
volunteers. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And she has a lot of patience, and 
she deals with them very well.  I do more the business end 
of it.  But she really knows how to handle those chapters 
and do well with them. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  We have a lot of wonderful 
volunteers.  We have chapters on the West Coast, the East 
Coast, down south, up north, and they work very hard for the 
children, and they are special friends to the children, and 
that means an awful lot.  They pay for their child's 
birthday party, and then they contact them all year long, 
and they have their picture.  But it is very nice for the 
volunteer and also for the child that that child has a 
special friend besides the staff that they see every day. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is really important for the 
children, isn't it, giving them other kinds of connections? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right, because sometimes they do 
not have parents involved.  Sometimes they do, but sometimes 
they don't.  So that's their very special person in their 
life.  And when they put on a program, like at Christmas, 
they always look for their special friend, because it's like 
having a parent out there watching them.  So it means a lot. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  In fact, we have had children come 
back to the village at times to tell us and thank us for 
their time, but to tell us about their reflection of those 
years at the Village.  And one the things they recall most 
is about their special friend and that someone was not 
really paid to look after them but wanted to do that and 
cared about them and reached out to them.  So it made a big 
difference in their life. 

<p>

Some of the things that we say to children that 
you think really didn't make a dent and you're not getting 
to them, later in their life, they recall that and will tell 
you that it really did and that they appreciate the time and 
effort and the care that you gave them.  And so that was 
wonderful for us, to be able to see our graduates, so to 
speak, come back and let us know what it meant in their 
life. 

<p>

This one particular little girl I am thinking 
about had a scrapbook in her arms, and she sat down and went 
over the pictures with us, and she said, "These were the 
best years of my life."  And it really did something to us, 
because if those were the best years of her life, then we 
had accomplished something. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Where all are there Childhelp 
organizations and centers? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have a village on each coast, 
east and west, and then we have an advocacy center, a sexual 
abuse advocacy center, in Knoxville, Tennessee, and one that 
was opened in Manhattan, New York, in conjunction with 
Cornell University, and then we have foster homes and group 
homes.  We have survivor programs and, of course, one of the 
main programs is our National Child Abuse Hot Line. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Amazing.  How many calls do you get 
a year? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have reached the capacity of 
300,000 a year.  It's more like between 150,000 to 200,000. 
That was the year that we had <i>Scared Silent</i> with Oprah 
Winfrey, and it was shown at the same time on all three 
networks, and so our phones really went bonkers.  But we are 
hoping to be able to answer more and more calls as we 
expand.

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And as we're on TV more, like this 
show, it really helps, because people hear the number and 
they use the number.  They call.  And we hope that people 
will if they need help. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
continue our discussion with those who are fighting for 
America's abused children.  Join us after this break. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. We are sharing with you 
my visit to Childhelp USA East Coast Village and my 
discussion with Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson, the 
founders of Childhelp. 
	Ironically, in a way, you all both were on the 
<i>Ozzie and Harriet Show</i>, which is the program that people 
often sort of derisively say, "Well, family values people 
want to recreate Ozzie and Harriet.  And yet we have seen 
since those days a rise in child abuse numbers and a 
breakdown in the family that has been unprecedented.  What 
is different today than was true of the time when you all 
were both really television stars? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our American values. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right, the morals. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our values have broken down.  The 
dysfunctional families that you're seeing today.  People are 
not taking time with their children to teach them the right 
pathway in life.  And so we notice a big difference, and we 
think that's why we are having so many cases of our children 
not being cared for, the gangs. 

<p>

You know, when you treat a problem like child 
abuse, you're covering more territory than just that; you 
are really counteracting a lot of social ills all the way 
through the pathway, because you are dealing with juvenile 
delinquency up to the hard-core criminal, because it has 
been proven that the largest percentage of those that are 
incarcerated have been abused as children. 

<p>

So until we change the other spectrum, the other 
funnel, get the money to the child's issue, we are not going 
to see a change.  We have to get to that child to make the 
difference for our future. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Think of how the movies have 
changed and think of how TV has changed.  I know since we 
were in the movies in the 1950s and the 1960s, they are more 
violent, and the sex that is shown, and everything has 
changed.  It influences the children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There are statistics that would say 
that one in three girls and one in five boys will be 
molested.  Do you believe that? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, we definitely believe that.  In 
fact, I think that we heard of some new statistics that have 
just come out that are even larger than those figures.  I 
don't think that America knows yet what we're doing to our 
children.  We have to wake up.  And, yes, it is wonderful 
that we are more aware of what's going on than we did, say, 
10 years ago, or, as you say, when we were in the movie 
industry.   

<p>

But America still has to wake up and really band 
together to make that difference.  And if we don't, then 
we're going to lose America, a lot more than just our 
children.  That's what counts. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You know, when we got involved in 
this 25 years ago, it was kind of kicked under the rug.  It 
was around, child abuse, but we were the first organization 
to do a television special, to make people aware of the 
problem.  And I think people are more aware.  We have 
changed our laws, which we need to still change more, but 
because of that, they are reporting more, and so we are able 
to do something about it, and that is very important. 

<p>

We worked very hard to get to the young children. 
As you know, our ages are from 2 to 12, and we feel that the 
younger we can get them, the sooner that we can turn those 
children around, because the older they get, the more set in 
their ways and the more abuse they have had, so it is harder 
to turn those little lives around. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Help people understand.  When they 
say one in three girls and one in five boys molested before 
18, does that mean parents need to be afraid of actual 
physical, sexual molestation?  I mean, what are we talking 
about?  Is there a range of behaviors? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Training our children to be aware.  
We have a wonderful program right here that is working out 
of our Washington, actually our Virginia office, and that is 
the Good Touch, Bad Touch, training the children when they 
are in grammar school and on up how to deal with that, what 
they should look out for.  And when you educate them, they 
will be aware. 

<p>

We just have not educated our children well 
enough.  We haven't educated our children who have children 
how to be good parents.  And so I think that we are seeing 
somewhat of a change in that direction where we are trying 
to put the emphasis on that, where it belongs. 

<p>

But the age of a child -- you want them to be able 
to trust people, and you want them to be loving and kind.  
However, they have to be aware of strangers and what to do 
and what not to do. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  A lot of times they are not 
strangers, though; they are people they know, and that 
really complicates the problem. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is scary, because I think we 
are all pretty good at telling children, Run away from a man 
who wants you to get in his car. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right.  But when you say it's your 
stepfather or your stepmother or something like that, or 
uncle --  

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Who is the general perpetrator?  
Tell us about them. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Generally, it is someone they know. 
It's either their own parent, their stepparent, neighbors, 
relatives, that type of thing.  And that is scary because, 
naturally, these are the people whom the children do trust. 

<p>

One thing that we should all be aware of is the 
fact that we should listen to our children.  When the 
children often tell you what has happened, let's say if the 
father or stepfather, the perpetrator -- the mother kinds of 
pushes it off or says, "Oh, you're just making it up," 
instead of really listening to what your child has to say.  
And that is an emphasis that we would like to make, to 
listen to your children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Have you found the 1-800 number to 
be a good way to get to some of those children? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, yes. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, absolutely.  That hot line is a 
lifeline.  The thousands of lives that have been saved that 
we know about personally that have been saved through that 
hot line -- you realize how valuable it is.  The children 
really don't know where to go.  They're afraid to tell their 
mother, or they've told their mother or whomever -- their 
father, their teacher -- they haven't listened, they haven't 
responded.  They don't know what else to do. 

<p>

But when they call 1-800-4ACHILD, we will tell 
them what to do, and we have the capability of patching that 
call in where a child does not have to hang up and redial 
another number, let's say in Paducah, Kentucky.  It patches 
them right in to the appropriate authority with that child 
on the line, and then we take care of the situation from 
there with the local, let's say, child protective services, 
sheriff's department, or whatever. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And it's 1-800-2ACHILD for the 
hearing impaired. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Reaching children is one powerful 
audience, but it does seem that having a center so near 
Washington, D.C., gives you an opportunity to reach another 
audience.  Is this Virginia center specifically located to 
talk to some of the men and women in the Nation's Capital? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, actually, Yvonne and I had 
that in mind.  We wanted a place near Washington, because so 
many of the politicians that we had called on prior, they 
wanted to come to the Village on the West Coast to see what 
we were doing, but they couldn't come that far. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And some of them have. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes, many of them have, but many of 
them couldn't.  And so we said it would be nice, where they 
are really setting policies and dealing with the issues, if 
we had a place near Washington that they could come and 
couldn't make too many excuses of why they couldn't be 
there. 

<p>

And so that was our target as far as being near 
Washington, and that is why this is not too far away.  It is 
45 minutes from Dulles Airport, to give you a sample of 
time.  And so we have had politicians here on the spot to 
see how the child abuse is being dealt with from this angle. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I was a police reporter and a court 
reporter and have seen many horrendous cases myself and a 
lot of child-molesting trials, and it is very difficult to 
find a place to send children who have been severely abused. 
Your waiting list has got to be pretty tremendous. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  It is. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It is, but we're building new 
cottages.  There will be one going up for 16 more children 
imminently, and perhaps two.  We are hoping that we will 
receive enough money that we can do two at the same time for 
32 more children.  And so the need for expansion is great.  
We're hoping that people will open their hearts and their 
pocketbooks so that we can do more. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Kristi, we're so excited about this 
because this is our new Village, so to speak.  New cottages 
will be built there. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Great.  It's beautiful! 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Sixteen to a cottage, and it will be 
like a little neighborhood in a cul-de-sac.  So the very 
first cottage will be built now on this specific ground, 
starting either this month or the beginning of next.  So 
we're very excited to see this happening. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You'll have to come back and see 
it after we complete the homes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We will. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And see the children running around -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And this will open up a lot of doors. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  This 
is so needed. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We need more cottages, as you're aware. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, I can imagine. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have beautiful land on which to put it. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is wonderful. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  So we are thrilled that more 
children will be healed right on this spot. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares 
more from Childhelp USA.  We'll also discuss how you can 
become involved in changing the broken lives of abused 
children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.] 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you the 
conclusion of my visit with Childhelp USA founders Sara 
O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson.  You'll hear more about 
why their vision for abused children is so needed and how 
you can become a part of that vision. 

<p>

The best change in law from your perspective was 
the laws to take a child out of the home?  What was the best 
change that took place since you got involved? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  To protect those that came forth to 
say they suspected child abuse, whether it was a teacher, a 
pediatrician, the next-door neighbor.  They were afraid to 
say that because -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Because they could get sued. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- if they went to court and the 
judge would decide, well, the child could have fallen down 
the step and therefore broken his arm, then that person 
could turn around and sue that doctor or whomever, and he 
was not protected in any way.	 

<p>

And so now, you know, in every state you can be 
prosecuted for not, in certain areas, I mean as far as 
teachers are concerned, and pediatricians, et cetera, you 
are mandated by law. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What is the next change that's 
needed in the law? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, there are many changes we 
would like to see in the law.  We would like to see that 
children that are taken out of their home are cared for in a 
better way and that more money would be put in where we had 
more social workers to be able to take care of the children 
and take the children out in the first place, because it's a 
proven fact that now a large percentage of cases they can't 
do anything about; they can't even go to somebody --  

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Have to leave them in the home. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It is just those children who are in 
immediate danger most of the time that can be helped. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  If it's a life-and-death 
situation, then they remove them, but, unfortunately, many 
others need to be removed, also, for a time, anyway.  And we 
are not going around trying to take anyone's children from 
them, but on the other hand, if they need help and if the 
child needs to be removed for a while, then we're for that, 
of course. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We are not protecting our children 
like we should. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a strange situation when it 
comes to molesters, because the research is clear that 
molesters are serial offenders, generally molesting, from 
your research, 117 children per person, and that is very 
chilling to people, as well. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Yes, it is. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What would you tell parents who are 
concerned that something might be happening to their 
children?  What are some danger signs? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, danger signs, you mean of the 
child to -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  For the parent to be aware of.  As 
they look at their child, what might clue a parent in that 
there is something there to be concerned about? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Definite mood changes.  You mean of 
the child themselves? 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Definite mood changes, a child going 
inwardly that maybe had been very much of an extrovert, or 
vice versa.  Any time that a child complains of certain 
hurts on their bodies, when their personalities change, 
their emotions change, which is readily to be seen when 
something like this happens, quite frequently. 

<p>

Many children try to put it out of their minds as 
if it didn't happen and cover it up, which, of course, then 
is a major problem as they grow older.  But usually, if a 
parent knows their child, they will notice a big difference 
in what has happened due to that trauma. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Also, I think, if a child doesn't 
want to be with an uncle or an aunt or someone alone, that 
the parent should think about that and listen to the child, 
because environment there's probably a reason that the child 
doesn't want to verbalize because that person is a relative 
or a friend and they might get in trouble for saying, 
because maybe they've been told, "This is our secret; don't 
you dare tell or I'll do something to your mother or your 
father," or whatever.  So the child has to keep that secret. 

<p>

But they may be trying to tell you something in a 
different way by, "I'd rather not go alone; I don't want to 
go over there to visit so-and-so, and if I do, please don't 
leave me alone with that person."  Think about it. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  I knew of an actual case of a child 
that loved Cub Scouts, and all of a sudden, he didn't want 
to go, and of course, the parents were saying, "This is 
ridiculous.  You're almost through with this term, and if 
you don't want to next time, but you must finish out this 
term now for your Cub Scouting."  This little boy screamed 
and yelled and did not want to go, and it was because the 
Cub master was molesting those children.   

<p>

So I go back to the fact that we have to stop and 
listen to our children and hear what they are saying to us. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right.  That's so important. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As you work with the children here 
at the EastCoast Village -- and there's the West Coast 
Village -- you are hoping to do something in the lives of 
those kids.  What are you hoping to accomplish in the lives 
of children as they leave? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Grow up and be good citizens and 
not abuse their children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And to give them inner light and let 
them express their own potential, their own little 
individual being, to fit into the network of society and let 
them know that they are cared about and loved, and teach 
them to love themselves, as well. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You have to love yourself before 
you can love others. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And a good bit of your program helps 
bring out their passions.  You have painting and riding and 
a variety of things. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  That is very important. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And that was really different from a 
lot of programs which were rather antiseptic and almost 
jail-like.  What was your vision when you were looking at 
something to build for kids? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our vision was that Yvonne and I 
wanted to build a home that would really be homelike.  So we 
visited all around the United States different facilities.  
Now, keep in mind this was almost 20 years ago. And the ones 
that were supposed to be the best -- we went to New York, 
Michigan, all over the place, and we visited, and we were 
horrified.  The rooms for the children were not bright and 
cheerful at all.  Many did not even have bedspreads in the 
rooms or pictures hanging. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They were all white. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  The therapy they talked about, they 
were lucky if they saw a therapist once every three months.  
And so, knowing that, we said, You know, we would like to 
change the thinking, frankly, from our social service field 
and deal with a place that would be where we would want our 
own children to be if they had to be in a place like that. 

<p>

And so every room that we decorated, every program 
that we insisted upon to go in from the beginning, was done 
with that in the back of the mind.  What would it take for 
our child to be rehabilitated and feel loved and nourished 
and in a homelike setting?  And that's where we were coming 
from. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And when my daughter was growing 
up, she used to love to go to the Village and ride the 
horses, and I think she wanted to move there. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So that had to really touch your 
hearts as mothers, then. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To walk around and think of your own 
children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  That's exactly right. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And that was the criteria on which 
we opened our first village of Childhelp in California. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And, you know, it pleases us 
because the children, our children, have never resented the 
time that we have spent with the children at the Village.  
We have always made them feel a part of it.  And now they 
are involved in our work, which really makes us very happy. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.  So for the people that 
are watching and would like to get involved, what can they 
do to help?  What kinds of things are there?  And we are 
obviously going to show a number.  But how do people get 
involved? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, we have chapters and 
auxiliaries affiliated in every place where we are, and 
there are many things volunteers can do, from hands-on 
situations where that is feasible and they are trained 
volunteers.  We can do that.  But, also, there is so much 
work behind the scenes.  So we can use anybody that is 
willing to help, almost. 

<p>

The Special Friends program is very important, 
too, but that only comes about if you are a member.  So we 
are saying to call and we'll find a place, hopefully, for 
that volunteer who wishes to make a difference. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What one word, or couple of words, 
but how would you describe, then, overall, as you look at 
your life's work, how would you describe it? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Busy. 

<p>

[Laughter.] 

<p>

Very rewarding, though. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Extremely fulfilling. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Very. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And I don't know what we would have 
done with our lives without this, even it has consumed our 
life, that we feel that we were brought here for that 
purpose --  

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  No question about that. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:   -- and so we're very pleased that 
we're able to do it. 

<p>

[Segment from Childhelp Dinner Event follows:] 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Childhelp has survived and prospered 
for 37 years just because of people like you who have been 
willing to volunteer their time and to share their money.  
There is nothing that cannot be accomplished when a 
community agrees to roll up its sleeves and do whatever it 
takes to make life better for its children. 

<p>

I want you to know that you're champions.  Every 
single one of you in this room is a champion.  So on behalf 
of the children we serve, I stand here in their stead to say 
thank you. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> celebrates Mother's Day just a few
days early.  Mothers are such an influential part of a
child's life and possess the privilege and opportunity to 
shape the lives of little ones.

<p>

We all like to talk about our moms, sometimes 
lovingly, sometimes in frustration, but, unfortunately, in 
our cultural conversation, it is rare that mothers are 
revered and the art of motherhood, honored.  So we think it 
is important that on this special holiday we highlight the 
joys and pains of motherhood.  In fact, I had the chance to 
speak with mothers whose lives are different in a variety of 
ways but all share the experience of motherhood.  Tonight, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you their insights, experiences, and 
wisdom. 

<p>

And since I am not yet a mother, I asked a good 
friend to help me along.  Charmaine Crouse Yoest is a mother 
of two, former Deputy Director of Policy for the Family 
Research Council, a contributing editor for <i>Policy Review</i>, 
the Heritage Foundation magazine, and author of a new book, 
<i>Mother in the Middle</i>.

<p>

Charmaine, thanks for being here with me today. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Thanks, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We probably couldn't tape-record most of our 
conversations.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I am looking forward to hearing more about 
your book, <i>Mother in the Middle</i>, and I wanted to start 
off by saying here once a year we take the time as a culture 
to talk about motherhood, but even recently a lot of the 
stories are very negative.  You know, on Mother's Day we'll 
have stories on why our mothers have ruined our lives. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Why do you think motherhood has been 
so disrespected? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, that was the most fascinating 
thing about the research for this book, is there have been 
several different reasons.  The most current, of course, is 
feminism, and I think that we made a big mistake in the 
women's movement of trying to say that our whole identity 
was going to be wrapped up in the workplace.  And so if you 
go that direction, then motherhood and children becomes an 
impediment.  So I think that is one of the biggest reasons. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be talking more later, but 
first let's hear what blessings motherhood has brought to 
the women with whom I spoke.  They are special women from 
inner-city Washington to the suburbs, and I know that I 
learned a lot, and I hope that you, too, will have the 
chance to learn and relate to their experiences of 
motherhood. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  One thing I would say we get from 
children, it has been my experience, is unconditional love. 
I think sometimes parents see themselves as loving their 
children unconditionally, but for most of us, we chose to be 
parents.  But none of our children chose to be born. 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  I didn't realize what holding 
your own child the first time would be like.  I mean, it 
really for me was like falling in love with somebody, almost 
like when you fall in love with your husband.  It was just 
-- that's an experience that you can't have with somebody 
else in your life except your own child. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  The blessing is first for me, 
and then the daily hard toil is nothing compared to the 
blessings and the joys. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  It's a joy that cannot be explained, 
cannot be felt until you decide that you're going to do it. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  My perspective is not they're a 
burden and they're work, but just that they're a true 
blessing from the Lord, and I just have learned to delight 
in them.  It has really made my life more joyful. 

<p>

MS. VAILES:  When your children come along, you 
see them as blessings, and the burdens hit you afterward. 

<p>

MS. HARDISON:  No amount of money or personal 
affirmation can replace those things of molding young 
children, watching them develop.  It's incredible. 

<p>

MS. ANDERSON:  They'll just come up to you and 
they'll put their little hand in your hand, and there's 
nothing any better than that. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  You get appreciation for the 
little things that make up for the bigger world, and I think 
sometimes you miss that if you're not a mother or not 
involved with children, because children will stop and say, 
"Look, look at the flowers," or, "Look at the bee," "Look at 
the butterfly," and you know, you're just walking past all 
that stuff, and you'll miss it.  And I think they kind of 
bring you back to, you know, where you should be focused. 

<p>

MS. LEE:  You know, there are certainly 
sacrifices, and I could be in a bigger house or wearing 
better clothes or, you know, whatever.  But I don't think 
I'd be any more happy than doing what I'm doing now. 

<p>

MS. SMITH:  Just the little things she's learning; 
it's really a joy, and she's just the delight of my life. 

<p>

MS. THOMAS:  I mean, I'm constantly aware of, oh 
my gosh, what an awesome job, and they're looking at me.  
I'm like their first person that they're really thinking, 
this is how people ought to be.  It's pretty humbling. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  Children love you unconditionally, 
and I think that that's, in my view, a blessing from God, 
because it gives me a different insight into the love of God 
to see this little person who's going to put their arms 
around you regardless of what happens.  Or we've been harsh 
with them, or if they've been disappointed, they still love 
you, and they do that from the beginning, even before they 
learn to speak.  They have ways that they learn of 
expressing their love. 

<p>

The other thing I would say is that children have 
a certain manner of expressing like fresh and creative 
things, and so I try to listen to my children very 
carefully, because there's so much that they say to me that 
I haven't taught them, and so I have an opportunity to learn 
from them, and that's really a blessing. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You all are experienced mothers now. 
But what advice would you have liked to have known before 
you became a mother? 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  Breastfeeding doesn't come naturally. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I mean, just to be intensely practical, nobody 
told me that.  I thought, you know, you're equipped 
biologically to do this; that's the way the Lord intended it 
to happen.  And that, at least in my experience, and I know 
in the experience of a lot of women, that is just not the 
way it happened.  And nobody told me that. 

<p>

I think those first early weeks with your first 
child especially are really critical to your self-esteem as 
a mother, because you're doing it the first time, and those 
kinds of things like breastfeeding and just caring for them, 
you can easily feel like you've gotten in over your head. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  It's something that you never can 
probably hear enough, is that the best-laid plans of 
yourself and how you think that life is going to be gets 
changed, and God has the best-laid plans, and I know most of 
my friends know, and you know, that I have a little girl who 
is three, and she had some mild disability issues, and we 
thought, you know, this would be our special child. 

<p>

We had our son Mack back in October, and he has 
very severe disability issues.  He's at home with us right 
now, on a respirator, and with a variety of physical and 
neurological difficulty. 

<p>

But it is still, with all the responsibility and 
the hardship and challenges, the joy is incredible, and I 
would always tell that to anyone.  No matter what happens 
with your child, no matter how challenging.  The joy is 
incredible. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  I wish I knew or maybe someone had 
told me -- you know, you hear all the time, almost like a 
cliche, that it goes by fast, but I don't think I really 
appreciated that.  My older daughter is six now, and she's 
going to kindergarten, and next year she'll be gone most of 
the day, and as I mentioned earlier, just learning, making 
sure that despite the pressures and whatever stress you 
might have in your life of raising children, that you are 
delighting in your children.  You're looking into their eyes 
and into their faces, and you're taking that time out to 
read them a story or to have the quality time with them that 
can so easily seem to be squeezed out, out of a day, and all 
those things I don't think I really -- it took me a good 
three years of raising my children to learn those lessons, 
and I wish I had known ahead of time. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Because I am an educator, 
it's so funny.  You know, you can teach a sister one year, 
and in two years or the next year you can get a brother, and 
they're so different, and I would say, "How do they come 
from the same house and they're so different?"  And I would 
say that all the time. 

<p>

But when I had my own, I realized how they could 
come.  You know, the gene pool is mixed together and you 
come up with whatever you come up with.  My kids are night 
and day.  But I used to always say, "How do they come from 
the same household?  Do they have the same mother?"  And it 
is so amazing, and people tell you, "Kids are not the same." 
I knew they weren't the same.  I knew that. 

<p>

My father used to always say to us, "Fair is not 
equal," and I never understood that until I became a parent. 
He would always say, "Fair is not equal," and I didn't 
understand what that was until I had my own. 

<p>

MS. THOMAS:  I just find that I really had to 
become a better person myself.  You know, I just thought I 
was a pretty cool kind of person, that I was a pretty 
patient.  It wasn't a natural thing, but I had been working 
on it, and I thought I had that pretty well in order. 

<p>

There's nobody that challenges that like a little 
toddler.  Nobody.  I mean, nobody has made me that mad in my 
lifetime. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

You know, of anything that I have done, and just 
learning to love beyond that, learning just to keep self-
control over that, because, I mean, he's precious to me.  I 
mean, I'd die for him in a heartbeat.  But he's driving me 
nuts.

<p>

And just learning to give that to God, the part 
that I'm just out of control over, and just being the adult 
and stepping back and what do I need to do in this 
situation.  Sometimes it's the discipline, sometime it's 
just an extra hug, that they've been attention-deprived that 
day because you've been running around too much, and that's 
really what the problem is, and it's just really hard to 
discern that and not take it as a personal affront. 

<p>

MS. LEE:  Before I had children, I worked and I 
had this immaculate house and great meals, the kind that Mom 
made every night when you came home.  And now it's like, 
"Well, honey, Spaggetios or hot dogs, which is it?  You got 
a choice." 

[Laughter.]

<p>

It's just really difficult at the end of the day 
to muster that energy to get in there and cook and get the 
house clean, because, you know, you feel better about 
yourself if you look good and your house looks good and your 
husband comes home and goes, "Wow!  I've got a perfect wife 
here.  I've got a perfect wife that's a mom, too."

<p>

So I have really had to just step back and say, 
Okay, I'm not perfect; my house isn't going to be perfect, 
and we're just going to do the best that we know how and be 
happy with that.  So I'm learning to change my level of 
happiness. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  When I had my first child, I went to 
classes and I was sort of soaking up all this advice which 
turned out to be irrelevant. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And so the lessons that I did get, I didn't have 
the experience of wanting to trust them because nobody told 
-- there were some things that happened that nobody told me 
or warned me they would happen.  So I said, well, this is 
such a --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like what?

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  Well, just that, you know, when you 
take the Lamaze class, it's supposed to be so easy and so 
simple to just have this baby. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And it wasn't like that at all.  And I'm saying, 
"What did I take these classes for?"  None of this stuff 
that was supposed to happen in the class happened, and all 
of the stuff that wasn't supposed to happen, did.  And so I 
began then to sort of not trust the official sort of line 
about even how you have a baby.

<p>

But I recognize that each mother is different.
Your bodies are different.  You just sort of bring to that 
process a whole different sort of sets of strengths and 
weaknesses and disabilities, et cetera.  So, so much of it, 
you just have to learn by experience.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about motherhood, and we want 
you to join us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We're celebrating Mother's Day 
in our own unique way, and I am joined by Charmaine Crouse 
Yoest, who is not only a mother of two but also an author 
and national spokesperson on family issues.  She also 
happens to be a very good friend of mine, and I am happy for 
the opportunity to share this special show with her. 

<p>

Well, Charmaine, we just saw the first of three 
segments looking at real-life moms talking about real-life 
problems, and I think the one thing that I was really struck 
by was that nobody said it was easy; everybody just said it 
was worth it.  I think sometimes in the discussion of 
motherhood there's this insinuation that it's going to be 
easy, that you can do it. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Well, you know, I think the thing that 
really struck me, as well, about that is this element of 
surprise.  You're surprised by the fact that it isn't easy, 
but the surprise over the joy.  We heard that over and over 
again with those women, and that is so much what we heard, 
too, doing interviews in the book, is that, you know, 
motherhood has been so devalued in our society that when you 
get into it -- well, you remember when I had my kids.  I had 
the same thing happen to me. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: I was, you know, a little bit hesitant 
about getting to this whole mom thing, and all of a sudden, 
my kids were there, and it was just unbelievable how -- you 
know, nobody can tell you.  That's a cliche, but nobody can 
tell you what it's going to be like ahead of time. 

<p>

I think that that is a natural thing, but in our 
society today it's accentuated, and that turns into being a 
problem when we've got this whole system that is geared 
towards women taking six weeks of leave and then going 
straight back into the work force. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right, and the book that you were 
mentioning was your new book, <i>Mother in the Middle:
Searching for Peace in the Mommy Wars</i>, which I really liked,
because there is a conflict, I think.

<p>

Well, maybe there doesn't have to be, but there 
certainly is a conflict that is described between the fact 
that we as women can achieve many things, and motherhood is 
an aside, as though motherhood is not an area where I 
achieve, or motherhood is not even important for me to 
attempt to achieve, like you do the motherhood thing, yes, 
whatever, maybe, maybe not.  But your career -- you know, 
here's success. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But it's not easy. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Well, I was really struck -- in doing 
the research for the book, we went back and did kind of a 
content study of some of the women's magazines, and one of 
the articles that really jumped out at me that is always in 
my mind was from <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, and they said, "Can You Be 
Somebody and a Mommy Too?"  And the whole idea was, they 
said -- of course, the article was saying yes, you can be 
somebody, but still, that title just continued to stick with 
me, because I thought, you know, that's the subtle message 
that we're sending to the next generation of women, that 
being somebody and being a mommy is not the same thing. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: So I think that's a real problem for women today.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting, because I think 
there is a big generation gap between <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine 
and MTV, Generation X, and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, because 
in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, I think the message is very 
clear, and not just the <i>Journal</i>, not to slam on them, but 
there was an article you and I were commenting on not long 
ago where a woman was commended as being this female worker 
of the year, and she had been cutting deals on a phone while 
she was in labor and was back to work the next day, and she 
got an award for that.

<p>

MS. YOEST: Yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you and I were talking about 
where were her priorities, and then you contrast that with 
Generation X data that says that they're the group of people 
who have most suffered from a lot of broken homes, and most 
say they want to change their work day to accommodate their 
family.  What did you find?

<p>

MS. YOEST:  You know, it's funny.  Since we're 
friends and this is a more informal discussion, I will tell 
you honestly, one thing that has struck me in terms of the 
aftermath of the book is you see some of the -- I go through 
this myself -- you see some of these articles.  There was 
another article in the <i>Journal</i> where they were highlighting 
these really top women, and the whole point of the article, 
Kristi, was that these women had achieved so well because 
they had wonderful time management skills.

<p>

So I walked around for the rest of the day going, 
"Oh, gosh, so that's all it really takes, is great time 
management skills."  But, you know, that's a bogus message 
to be sending to women that if you just manage your time 
correctly, then you're going to be able to hold down a full-
time job and be a perfect mom to your kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST:  And it was really kind of comforting 
to me because I was doing an interview later that day with 
another mom who has four children, and she is running a 
business out of her home, and I mentioned this article to 
her, and the conflicted feelings I had had reading it, and 
she just laughed.  She said, "You know, I was one of those 
women.  Everybody looked at me and thought I had it 
together.  I had great time management skills," she said, 
"but I knew that my family, and particularly my kids, were 
suffering." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. Don't you think that -- you 
and I have talked a lot about it -- that we have to expand 
our definition of womanhood?  So I ask you a leading 
question:  Don't you agree with me? 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But we have defined womanhood as we were oppressed 
economically, so now, the real woman today has the best 
resume on the planet, rather than that women are very 
relational, that the husbands and men in their life and 
their families are important; and, significantly, at the 
Family Research Council, we have seen a lot of data	 that 
says most women during the first five years of their 
children's life would like to adjust their work schedule to 
accommodate that, rather than a lot of our federal 
proposals, which are all organized toward getting women back 
to work, because work is what women really want, isn't it? 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And isn't that a little narrow? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, that's what my passion is all 
about with this whole issue, is that <i>Parents</i> magazine just 
ran a study.  They surveyed 18,000 of their readers, and 
they found that only 4 percent of those 18,000 women wanted 
to be holding down a full-time job.  Sixty-one percent of 
them wanted to have a part-time job.

<p>

So I'm looking at this and saying, You know, but 
our federal discussion is all centered on day care, as if 
that is what women want.  And what we found in talking to 
women was that that was not what they wanted, that they were 
really struggling with this issue of how to put their 
children first. 

<p>

Going back to another thing you were talking 
about, in terms of the issue of sacrificing for your 
children, I think one of the difficulties in talking about 
this issue and that I struggled with as I wrote the book is 
that there are no easy answers.  You can't come down and say 
that, okay, here's the perfect work/family balance.  You 
know, we subtitled it, <i>Searching for Peace in the Mommy
Wars</i>, so we kind of wrestled with this question, what is
peace?

<p>

Well, peace is not necessarily that everything 
will be easy.  And in today's society, in our secular 
society, people equate difficulty with something being 
wrong.  Everything should be easy.  But, you know, the truth 
is that children are a sacrifice, and we have to come to 
grips with that. 

<p>

Kind of to tie that a little tangentially into 
another thought is that this has to start with women, 
because if we keep waiting for society --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To fix it. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: -- to revalue women, yes -- but if 
women don't value children, then why should anyone else?  
The problem is that feminism has, for decades now, wanted to 
make it out that men and women were exactly the same.  The 
problem with that is, you can't get away from the fact that 
women do have this intrinsic biological connection to their 
children that, just by force of nature, is different than 
what it is for the man.  And so I look at that and say, 
Okay, as one of the women mentioned, you know, breastfeeding 
is a pretty important component of raising your child.  
That's a vital connection to your child. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And it's hard. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  And it's hard.  And if the mother 
doesn't value that, then why would the father?  Why would 
society? 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right. 

<p>

We're going to talk more about the difficulties 
and challenges of motherhood. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, 
we'll gain more insight into motherhood and the issues 
facing mothers today.  Stay with us. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. With Mother's Day just around 
the corner, tonight we are sharing some real-life motherhood 
experiences.  In fact, let's hear what these mothers had to 
say about some of the hard lessons they have had to teach 
and learn from their children. Join us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What lessons did you find hard to 
teach your children?  What were things that were difficult 
to transfer, values or skills or just the kinds of things 
they need to be the people you wanted them to be? 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Well, I'm still at the 
teaching stage, so what I'll say is, it's so amazing how -- 
because my kids are close in age -- you want them to share, 
and sharing is a big thing.  So you want to teach them to 
share, and I was on this mandate about a year ago.  I'm 
going to teach them to share.  I don't care.  They're going 
to learn to share, and dah-dah-dah-dah, and I gave them all 
these biblical points of why they should share, you know, 
all of the stuff, until I realized they were sharing.  It's 
just that they have to work it out, and if I just kind of 
stay out of it, they will share.  As long as I'm giving them 
love and support, they'll work it out.  But, you know, 
you're so into, when they're two and three, they're going to 
learn to share.  But, eventually, if you live what you 
teach, they'll learn it, so it's kind of easy. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  That's true, what Sabrina is 
saying, and I, too, want to teach the sharing, but I want to 
teach what a strength it is to share and to give, because 
the world is about keep, get, take from whoever else and 
just keep for yourself.  I would like to teach my children 
that that is a position of weakness, and the sharing and 
giving is the real position of strength, and I'm trying to 
work that in. 

<p>

My mother says that it's difficult, but if I 
remind myself that this is a four-year-old, he's not going 
to exhibit this behavior today, it becomes less difficult.  
I feel I'm putting things in that perhaps I'll see in the 
future, and I have to remind myself that he's not going to 
learn it in two minutes, three minutes.  It may be years, 
but soon, I hope that he reflects the kind of behavior I'm 
nurturing now. 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  Loving seems to come naturally to 
children if you give them an environment in which it can 
flourish.  They're just so loving and responsive.  But all 
of the other things, like manners and not screaming, you 
know, just all the things that toddlers learn, are hard, I 
think.  It's hard to shape somebody gently and with respect 
to who they are, so that you don't feel at the end of the 
day that you've kind of beaten them down but that you've 
really nurtured them. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  If it's this kind of challenge when 
they're two and a half -- I've got a three-year-old -- what 
the challenges are that are ahead of us and how much harder 
it's going to be to teach them to respect your body, to 
respect other people, to learn the harder the things they're 
going to be met with in grade school, now -- unfortunately, 
in grade school and middle school -- and I am in awe of that 
responsibility, of getting prepared for that and learning 
what I need to learn to be able to help them through that. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  I think, ideally, as a mom, you 
need to be confident and secure and kind of as if you've 
already done it, but you're really doing it for the first 
time.  So again, with my three, I feel like, as the years 
have gone by, I am getting more confident and secure. 

<p>

But probably the area I struggle a lot with is 
just, as we have been talking, the area of discipline.  I 
think part of that has to do with, you know your own 
boundaries; you know what's appropriate, because I find it 
hard to -- I put off disciplining them, and you see that 
children -- they need it.  You know, they need to learn 
boundaries.  They need to learn what's right and wrong, and 
they need to see that there's consequences. 

<p>

And so I have seemed like I learn this repeating 
lesson that the more I put it off, the harder it is for me 
and the harder it is for them.  As a friend of mine once 
said, you can't as a mom expect to be popular.  You have to 
be willing to be unpopular.  And that's true, because even 
after I have disciplined, I want to run in and have that 
close bonding and friendship, and I need to restrain myself 
and say, you know, let there be distance and let my kids 
learn the hard lessons of life. 

<p>

MS. ANDERSON:  With the discipline and stuff, you 
know, the kids will say to me, "Mom, you know, I don't like 
you very much." 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I'm like, "Well, you know what?  I'm not liking you right now, 
either." 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I'm like, thank God we still love each other, you 
know.  I said, "There's nobody in the world I love more than 
you."  I said, "Sometimes we don't like each other very 
much."  But it's a hard thing to teach them that you still 
love them even in that discipline time and stuff. 

<p>

MS. VAILES:  Other people have a lot to do with 
and a lot to say about how the children come up.  "Don't let 
those children run in the church."  "Don't let them do 
this."  And it's difficult.  Patrice and I know that because 
of our differences, and it makes me reflect on the 
differences that I had with my own mother in raising them. 

<p>

So I'm learning to stay out of things and let her 
handle it.  You know, they're her children.  It's difficult, 
but I'm learning. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that motherhood has 
been severed from womanhood in the discussion of it?  
There's a lot of focus on work, women as people who make 
money, women as people who have a career.  What about focus 
on women as people who bring the next generation to life? 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Well, I personally feel 
that, in the African-American community, mothers generally 
worked, if not full time, at least part time, so I think 
that we were excluded from the discussion, anyway, and now 
that they're including a discussion of working women and 
working mothers and whatever, we are more included in the 
discussion, and I think before we were excluded, and I don't 
think that was an issue for our community, generally, 
because most of us worked.  My mother worked, my grandmother 
worked, her grandmother worked.  I am from a lot of women 
that worked.  I work.  I'm sure my daughters will work. 

<p>

So I think that that whole issue wasn't an issue 
for us, and I think that we're now becoming included.  And 
there are still African-American mothers that don't work and 
stay home with their children, which is wonderful, too.  But 
I think that now we are more included as a community. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you would say most women work. Go ahead. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  I would say that, in terms of how 
womanhood relates to motherhood, one of the most important 
things a woman can do, a mother can do for her children, is 
to have and to convey to them a strong sense of her own 
identity, and it's not like, well, I'm less than or I'm 
subordinate or I'm weak or I don't have any potential.  But 
I think that the mother's sense of herself gets conveyed, if 
not through words, through behavior, to the children, so 
that I would like to think that whether I work or don't 
work, that I live my life in such a way that I'm an 
inspiration and an encouragement to my children to become 
all that they can be. 

<p>

But we live in a society that has peculiar ways of 
sort of pigeonholing mothers and women so that you have this 
role and not that role, and I think that that can really be 
a problem.  Especially in the black community, that's a 
problem.  We get so stereotyped and even demonized and 
denigrated.  You know, well, you're a mother; you're not 
this and you're not that. 

<p>

My perspective is that whatever I achieve, 
whatever I accomplish, it is for my children; it's a major 
part of my being there for them as an example, as a role 
model, as an inspiration. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  Yes, I agree with what Cheryl 
says, and somewhere mothering is lost on society.  I think 
there is the physical mothering of having our children and 
nurturing them, and also, there's the spiritual mothering 
for me, and that is the woman that works in her community, 
that is working at school, in the offices, the president of 
a company or whatever.  It's a whole nurturing, bringing to 
birth, giving life to whatever -- babies, careers.  It's a 
whole world of things that today's world doesn't see, 
doesn't grasp. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll 
talk further about motherhood today.  Join us after this 
break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm joined again by 
Charmaine Crouse Yoest, who is helping me, a future mother, 
decipher roles of mothers today in America.  Welcome back, 
Charmaine.

<p>

MS. YOEST: Thanks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  My mother would pay to know when. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But to kind of springboard off the conversation 
that we just saw with the group of mothers, it was 
interesting talking about the fact that mothers are a 
spiritual force and a broader force and have a bigger 
influence than, you know, five minutes with my kids and I'm 
off to make my real impact in the work world.  Did you find 
that in your research? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  You know, that's a real linchpin of 
what I'm thinking about in motherhood here and what we're 
talking about in the book.  It's just that children have 
eternal value, and when our society became more secular, we 
lost that appreciation for anything that has to do with the 
eternal.  And so, as a result, I think that was a huge part 
of the devaluing of motherhood. 

<p>

It was really kind of interesting to me to look 
back to history and to see if we had any kind of model for 
what motherhood could be.  In the early 1800s, mothers were 
put up on a pedestal, they were revered, for precisely the 
reason that she was mentioning, that they had a force in 
society.  The power that they held as the women who were 
raising the next generation of Americans was very deeply 
honored, and they were seen to have influence in the wider 
community, not just within the home. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't it Winston Churchill who said, 
"The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world"? 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And there was a real valuing of the 
impact that women had in the lives of the people around 
them, broader merely than work. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, and we have just lost an 
appreciation for that.  The most moving thing to me, we tell 
in the book the story of Harriet Beecher Stowe.  She was the 
woman who wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, which is partially 
credited with igniting the Civil War.  The genesis of that 
book, she told a friend once, was in the summer when she 
lost her baby son to cholera.  As any mother who has gone 
through that experience, she was so grief-stricken, and 
shortly thereafter, after her son died, she started hearing 
stories about slave mothers who were just viciously ripped 
apart and separated from their children forcibly, never to 
see their children again, sold into slavery.  She just so 
identified with the pain of losing a child that she sat down 
and wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>.

<p>

When I heard that story, I thought, you know, 
that's what motherhood is all about.  Making a difference in 
the larger society, having your own personal experience 
connects you into the wider society at large, and giving 
your actions a motivation that is more important than just 
your small family. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It was interesting, looking at some 
business models lately, I think what was powerful was that 
in a lot of ways a lot of workplaces are structured after a 
masculine role model where it is very linear -- you do this, 
you do that -- where they said that women managers were more 
relational and built teams on the strengths of individuals, 
while men liked to designate and delineate a task and build 
it on the strength of the description or the formula. 

<p>

We have been tempted to say that the formula is 
right and the relationships are wrong, and I think, in a 
broader perspective, women bring to business and to the 
community an appreciation for those relationships that is 
different. 

<p>

I was interested to see some chamber of commerce 
data recently that said that the majority of start-up 
businesses in America today are begun by women looking for 
options and are doing it in niche businesses. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Yes, and in fact, do you know that 
women have a very rate of success with home-based 
businesses?  This is a real growth industry. 

<p>

I was struck, to play back to the last piece, the 
one woman who was saying that she comes from a long line of 
mothers who have worked, and one of the points that we 
really wanted to hammer home in the book is that women have 
always worked.  Work is not a shameful thing. 

<p>

I think that we can sometimes, in this whole 
debate over women and work, from a conservative Christian's 
perspective, sometimes there can be a bondage that women 
feel in that if they need to work or if they are working in 
some way, that that is wrong.  But that is kind of twisting 
a biblical model of work.  It's okay to work.  The point is 
that our children do come first. 

<p>

And so what we are really wanting to bring into 
the public discussion is, if women need income, they don't 
necessarily need a job.  How can we be more creative in 
looking at our society and making it easier for women to 
augment their income through home-based work, through part-
time, through flex-time, through job-sharing?  There are so 
many exciting options out there, particularly with the 
technological age. 

<p>

Debbie, my co-author, and I wrote this book 
together and only got together once over the course of 
writing the book.  We did it all by computer.  And it's 
amazing to me.  It's so exciting, the opportunities that are 
out there. 

<p>

I think it's sad to see women who are struggling 
so hard, wanting to spend more time with their children.  
That's what we heard over and over again from women as we 
talked to them for the book.  And they're not getting any 
support for thinking creatively in the broader society.  All 
you hear women's activists saying is, "Well, women need more 
day care."  I don't think that's what real women are saying. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, women don't want that.

<p>

I was really struck by some day care data recently 
that 50 percent of children under 18 are cared for by their 
mother who is staying at home, and of the remaining 50 
percent, one third of those are cared for by mothers and 
fathers flexing their work schedules so one of them is 
always there; one third of them are cared for in a household 
with extended family, and a very small percentage of that is 
maybe a nanny; and of the remaining one third of that 50 
percent, only that small percentage chose an institutional 
day care setting.

<p>

But the conversation is all as though this is what 
women want -- we want a place to send our children to -- 
when I think that people's patterns are clear that we want 
to keep our children close, even if we need to earn extra 
money. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. That's what so frustrating, 
is that the national debate doesn't reflect the mother in 
the middle, the woman who is struggling and saying, "How can 
I be with my own children?"  That's what troubling to me as 
a public policy person and as a mother, is to see almost 
this train coming down the track.  Even the Republican- 
dominated Governors' Conference called for more day care 
money in the welfare reform bill. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  So I see our public policy discussion 
going an entirely different direction than where I think the 
women of America are going, because I was very encouraged in 
terms of talking to women.  I felt like there is a real 
renaissance of revaluing motherhood across our country, of 
women saying, "I'm going to draw a line in the sand, and 
this is what's important to me, and I'm going to make this 
decision for my family whether I get patronized or not." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Especially, I think, among younger 
mothers, and we're going to get to talk more about that 
later.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we're going to share 
more from mothers who give their advice to women considering 
having children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. We are continuing our 
celebration of motherhood.  Let's hear some advice from a 
diverse group of mothers to women who are considering having 
children.  Let's see if that biological clock is worth 
listening to.

<p>

Today in America, one in four couples is 
infertile, and the number is growing, and there are a lot of 
factors that are playing into that.  For children up for 
adoption, there are 40 certified, on-a-waiting-list, 
available couples per child. 

<p>

So there are a lot of women who are going to see 
this television show that would like to be where you are, 
would like to have children.  And just thinking about them 
for a second, or people who are just grappling with this -- 
there are a lot of women who don't have children -- my 
husband and I, we don't have children yet -- here on 
Mother's Day, what are your thoughts for those women out 
there who wish that they were among you? 

<p>

MS. LEE:  I try to tell my friends now that are in 
the mid-thirties or early thirties that are putting off 
motherhood -- "Oh, I'll be a mom some day.  We're not ready 
for it yet" -- I say, because we had a very difficult time 
conceiving with our first child, and I just can't tell them 
enough, "Don't wait.  If this is what your heart's desire 
is, don't wait.  The career can wait.  You have a lifetime 
of a career after your child is grown.  But this is the time 
right now where you have the energy, your body is physically 
ready."  I just would advise them to go ahead and get going 
on it, put the priorities first.

<p>

MS. VAILES: I was very happy to have my children.
I guess the one thing that I would like to stress is being 
there for them and being open to hearing what they have to 
say.  I used to say that the Lord blessed me because I don't 
show my panic; it comes much later.  So my children could 
tell me anything.  It's the communication that helped me 
learn, helped me grow, helped me become more flexible.   

<p>

It got to the place that they used to tell their 
friends, "You need to talk to my mother," about problems or 
whatever was going on with them when they saw things that 
needed to be changed.  And they would come to me with 
everything.  So it's very easy, now that they are adults, to 
have open communication. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  For me, having been a public health 
nurse -- and I have had opportunity to travel quite a bit to 
Third World countries -- I have always had a desire to 
adopt, and as you talk about the statistics, I would 
encourage people that there is something you won't have, 
having your own, and yet there are other special things you 
will have if you're able to adopt.  And that is something 
that I still hope, in the future, that we might be able to 
do even though we have been able to have our own, because 
the world is a needy place.  There are needy kids out there, 
and it just takes a little bit of love.  You've got people 
here that desperately want children and children here that 
desperately need homes. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS: Women that don't have 
children, they need to pray to see if that's what God wants 
them to do, because God's wishes are different for everyone, 
and there might be a role for you as an extended family 
person that might be much needed in comparison to you 
raising your own, and you have to pray about that. 

<p>

I know that I prayed before I started having my 
children, because if you met me about five years ago, you'd 
say, "She's having kids?" 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So I was like, mmm, I don't know if I want to do 
that.  So you have to pray and you have to wait and see what 
His answer is. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  You don't know what's down the road 
for you when you start trying.  Maybe you conceive 
instantly, and that's great, because so many of us don't 
have that luxury, and what a nice surprise to find that out. 
Otherwise, you may find out you've got some difficulties and 
you need the time to work through it, and you can't do that 
when you're 38.  You don't have that much time. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  I would have missed -- how do 
I say this? -- the whole world of mothering if I didn't have 
children, because for me there was all this mothering that 
needed its connection or its contact, and it's all of what 
they have said and just a whole lot of other things in me, 
and I needed to make contact with that that needed my 
mothering, and I would have missed all of that without 
children, and it's all of your teaching and your learning, 
the prayerfulness, the growing up, just everything that you 
bring to that need, your purpose to that need, and that's 
what I would have missed, and I am glad I had the blessing 
to connect.                                                   

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  You have to love children.  I mean, 
that's the most important thing that you do as a mother, is 
to love them.  I mean, that's your job, that's your 
responsibility, that's your basic obligation, is to love 
them, to lead them; that is, to give them some sense of 
direction, some sense of boundary, some sense of discipline, 
some sense of orientation when they lose their way, to lead 
them; that is, to be the parent, be the adult, at least as 
long as they are needing that; also, to listen to them. 

<p>

There are so many children whose behavior 
indicates that they don't have anybody to listen to them or 
who will listen respectfully to what they have to say and 
will sort of give them a sense of self-esteem and of their 
own worth by saying, "Well, you're important.  I'm going to 
listen to you.  You have something to say."  Or, "I'm 
interested in how your day was, or what your ideas and your 
thoughts are."

<p>

This is important, this listening, because I think 
that the more we invest in listening to our children, the 
more we kind of help them to become socialized and to just 
realize, well, I'm an important person.  I have something to 
contribute, something to say.

<p>

And then the last thing is to learn from them and 
to recognize that parenting is a learning experience.  Even 
if you have studied developmental psychology, it seems that 
once you have mastered, sort of, as a parent the stage where 
they are, they have a way of leaping to the next stage, and 
then you've got to catch up and say, "Okay, this way of 
dealing with the child has got to grow as parent." 

<p>

This is what I am experiencing as a mother, is 
that I am learning how to be a mother from them as I have 
watched them go through their changes and their growth and 
their development.

<p>

But my commitment, again, my obligation is to stay 
with that process and not to say, "Okay, well, you just go 
ahead; I'm going to stay stuck right here."  And as you are 
probably aware, there are adult parents of adult children 
who get kind of stuck at a particular stage of mothering, 
and then it's really difficult for that adult child, because 
it seems to me that the overall goal and purpose of 
parenting is to do everything you can to prepare that child 
to be an independent, interdependent human being, an adult, 
and not to sort of put them in some sort of perpetual 
childhood because of your own emotional needs or whatever. 

<p>

So the goal is that they can really reach their 
full potential as adults, but this listening, this loving, 
this sort of learning from them and this leading them, for 
me, is what motherhood is about. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the 
break.  Stay with us to hear how you can get more 
information regarding issues affecting you as a mother or a 
father and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I 
would also like to thank Charmaine for all her insights. 

<p>

Charmaine, we just heard a lot of really good 
advice from some moms.  In the little bit of time we have 
left, what advice would you give women searching for peace 
in the mommy wars? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, you know, Kristi, it was really 
inspiring to talk to women who have been so creative in 
finding their own peace.  We have a whole chapter of stories 
we tell of women who have found a situation that really 
works for them. 

<p>

I think the message that we wanted to send women 
home with was that you can make your own life, what you want 
it to be, that there are opportunities out there, and that, 
as women, we need to be aggressively moving into the 21st 
century and staking out the territory and saying this is 
what motherhood of the next millennium is going to look 
like. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: And we can create our own terms and 
our own situation in a creative way that isn't dictated by 
what the activists are saying they think motherhood should 
look like.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, it has been unfortunate, a lot 
of the women who say they're for women are just for big 
resumes and abortion, and you think there's a little more to 
womanhood than that. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: A lot more. Yes, exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to want to have you read 
this book.  If you'd like to receive more information about 
the Family Research Council, tonight's guests, or get a copy 
of Charmaine's book, please call us at 1-800-225-4008. 

<p>

Next week we'll be discussing a chilling issue 
facing us today:  euthanasia.  You won't want to miss this 
potential impact that will come with a contract with death. 
Please join us when <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i> returns. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight's <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at an issue surrounding our
personal mortality: life, death, and euthanasia.  Do we want
an America in which doctors have the authority to kill
ailing patients?

<p>

Just yesterday, Dr. Jack Kevorkian was acquitted
for the third time of charges involving his role in yet
another death.  These acquittals, along with several liberal
court rulings, are sending a message loud and clear to the
nation's elderly, our disabled, terminally ill, and in fact,
our entire population.  The message:  be healthy or beware.
Who will decide which of us are too sick to take up so-called 
valuable resources, and should we give that authority 
to physicians?  Tonight we will discuss whether euthanasia 
serves the population compassionately or acts as a means of 
coldly eliminating expense and our own humanity.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Robert Knight, FRC's
Director of Cultural Studies.  Bob speaks about an issue 
heatedly discussed just this morning on the House floor, the 
homosexual activist Cherry Jubilee Celebration, a gay-sponsored 
party, that took place in taxpayer-supported federal buildings.

<p>

Yesterday, Steve Gunderson, the gay representative 
from Wisconsin, talked about this issue for an hour on the 
House floor.  Today, Bob Knight gives his insight, and he 
shares an FRC exclusive video about the homosexuals' use --
possibly misuse -- of federal buildings.  Trust me, you will 
not see this on local broadcasts or read about it in many
newspapers. So <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes you Behind the
Headlines.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You know, a lot of
people may have heard in the news about a party called
Cherry Jubilee.  It has been a bit controversial, and in
terms of Behind the Headlines, we would like to understand
what exactly does that mean?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, every spring, we have the 
cherry blossom festival, and the cherry trees bloom around 
the Tidal Basin, and they are beautiful, and increasingly in 
recent years homosexual activists have held various events 
around the city, and they call it the Cherry Jubilee.  This 
year they staged events in two federal buildings, and we got 
wind of this not through some great spy network; they 
advertised it in their publications.

<p>

So we thought, well, this is curious that federal 
buildings, one of them the Andrew W. Mellon Library, which 
is an old august building right on Constitution Avenue 
across from the Smithsonian, was going to be used for a big 
party, an all night long party, and then there would be a 
recovery brunch -- they call it recovery, I guess from the 
party the night before -- in the Rayburn House Office 
Building, which is the largest office building housing 
congressional offices.  We thought, is there something wrong 
with this picture? We'd better take a closer look.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think people would be very 
surprised that this kind of party would have taken place in 
a taxpayer supported federal office building.  How were the 
homosexual activists able to get access to these rooms?
They are kind of tough to book.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Now we have placed many calls to the 
Andrew Mellon Auditorium and the General Services 
Administration, and they will not return our calls.  I think 
they are starting to circle the wagons about this, because 
people are wondering how could they commandeer these 
premises for a party that really got out of control?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we were taking a look at some of 
the different homosexual literature talking about the Cherry 
Jubilee party, they said that it was a certain kind of 
party.  Could you help us understand what kind of a party 
Cherry Jubilee was?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, that is what caught our 
attention.  In a local publication, they said it would be 
like a circuit party, which is something you will see in New 
York and other major cities in which thousands of homosexual 
men gather and have an all-night party, and usually you will 
see drugs present at parties and sexual acts being 
committed, and just basically an orgy, to not think of a 
better word for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is rather amazing to imagine that 
there were parties in federal office buildings where sex 
acts were taking place.  You know, frankly in Washington, 
DC, that kind of thing has always been very controversial, 
you know, whether it is people jumping in the Tidal Pool or 
different things that people said they did in offices.
Every time it has come up, it has been very controversial.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, and other things.  I wonder if 
you could have a prayer meeting, you know, at the Rayburn 
House Office Building.  Maybe you could, maybe you cannot, 
but I know of at least one instance in which a group was 
denied use of a federal facility.  That was Anthony 
Falzarano's[?] Transformation ex-gay ministry.  He asked the 
Museum of Women in the Arts, a federal building, if he could 
have a conference there, because outside groups can rent 
rooms, and he was just flat-out refused, and he was never 
told why, and I have to suspect it is because of the nature 
of his group.  He helps people out of homosexuality, and 
that is not politically correct.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, Bob, my understanding is there 
is some video of this event.  How did that come about?
Where did that come from?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, we contacted a photographer who 
is famous for getting into events and taking footage, and he 
agreed to go into this event, and he stayed the whole 
evening, and he had a camera, and he went in with a 
companion, and they took shots of each other.  So they were 
just celebrants along with everyone else.  Then he swung the 
camera around and took footage of the dance floor and other 
areas, and some of the footage is so dark you cannot see it, 
but he provided a narration for us and told us, look, I will 
tell you what was really going on in the corners, things you 
do not really want to know about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What surprises you the most about
this kind of activity in a federal building?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I think the lack of oversight by 
Congress and by the Clinton administration as to what is 
going on in the federal buildings.  I mean, these are 
government buildings.  They are paid for with taxpayer 
money.  The stamp of approval of the U.S. government and 
thereby the American people comes about when you stage an 
event in one of these buildings.  The government is saying 
we think this is fine; this is okay.  But, in fact, it is 
not okay.  Our representative Bob Dornan said on the floor 
of the House that this is an outrage that federal buildings 
can be used for events like this, and I hope more comes out 
of this.  I hope they actually have an investigation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is very likely that there will be 
an investigation of this party and of who may have set it up 
and where the federal money may or may not have gone.  What 
is the most likely scenario for bringing this about?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I would think that would be at the 
core of the investigation, how it came about, because 
outside people like us are not getting any help out of the 
government in determining how this was able to happen.  So I 
think we need congressional help to do it, and I hope that 
is something that occurs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Bob, you were able to get some 
videotape of this particular activity.  How did you get that 
tape, and could you explain to us a little bit about what we 
will be seeing?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Okay, yes, I think seeing is believing, and a 
picture is worth 1,000 words.

<p>

[Cherry Jubilee segment follows.]

<p>

NARRATOR:  Washington, DC, the nation's capital.
Every year during April, thousands of tourists come here to 
see the cherry blossoms.  They also come to see Washington's
magnificent architecture and monuments to the nation's
leaders of government, industry, and the arts.

<p>

On the weekend of April 13 and 14, 1996, two 
federal buildings were sites of two celebrations of which 
few Americans were aware.  The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium 
is named after industrialist and art collector Andrew 
Mellon, who donated much of his fortune to help found the 
National Gallery of Art.  On the afternoon of Saturday, 
April 13, preparations were underway for what was advertised 
in homosexual publications as the Cherry Jubilee Main Event 
Party to be held in the Mellon Auditorium across the street 
from the Smithsonian Museum of American History.

<p>

That evening, the dignified auditorium, which was 
built in 1935 and has played host to presidential events, 
took on a different cast.  It was bathed in colored lights 
to create a rainbow flag, the symbol of the homosexual 
activist movement.  Inside, thousands of half-naked men 
danced and writhed on the main floor of the auditorium.  
Then event, sponsored by two AIDS activist organizations, as 
well as several local businesses, also had support from 
major corporations:  American Airlines, Snapple, American 
Express, Starbucks Coffee, and Miller Beer.  The party 
lasted from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

<p>

Throughout the evening, limousines dropped off 
many of the participants.  As the evening wore on, the 
dancing became more lewd and suggestive, with some dancers 
simulating sexual acts and others shedding clothing.

<p>

Just off the dance floor, at least one couple 
appeared to be having oral sex.  In the darker corners and 
in the restrooms, men met to have sex with one another.  
Restroom stalls were occupied almost continuously with two 
men at a time, and the sounds coming from them indicated 
that cocaine was being snorted and sex acts were occurring.  
Outside, in an alley next door, men disappeared into the 
darkness in pairs.  So many men were using the area, 
security people finally closed it off.  Public urination was 
common, even in front of the building facing Constitution 
Avenue.

<p>

The next day, Cherry Jubilee ended with the 
Capitol Hill Recovery Brunch at the Rayburn House Office 
Building.  Inside the foyer of this historic building which 
houses the offices of many congressmen, drinks were served 
at an open bar while a disk jockey played music.  Cameras 
were forbidden at the event, whose location was arranged by 
openly homosexual Republican congressman Steve Gunderson of 
Wisconsin.

<p>

According to a homosexual publication, the weekend 
events raised $50,000 for two Washington-based AIDS groups:  
Food and Friends and the Whitman-Walker Clinic.  Whitman-Walker 
Clinic, which treats people with AIDS, also hosts 
meetings for gay political activists and promotes such 
causes as lesbian parenting.

<p>

The clinic, which is supposed to discourage 
unhealthy activities such as occurred during the Cherry 
Jubilee party in and around the Mellon Auditorium, 
advertises routinely in the Washington Blade's Lights Out 
section, a supplement that features ads for strip clubs, 
bathhouses, phone sex, prostitution, and orgies, in short, 
the type of unsafe sex that has led to the tragic epidemic 
of AIDS among homosexual men.

<p>

The Cherry Jubilee was not the first time that the 
Andrew Mellon Auditorium has been used for a homosexual 
activist event.  In 1993, during the homosexual march on 
Washington, the auditorium hosted the National S&M Leather 
Fetish Conference.  The event celebrated sadomasochistic sex 
and featured virtually naked men being led around in dog 
collars by their dominant partners.  Pornography and sexual 
paraphernalia was sold, including several publications that 
promote pedophilia, the sexual use of children by adults.
Inside the auditorium, a slide show depicted graphic sexual 
acts.

<p>

SPEAKER: Sadism and masochism. S&M is an 
absolutely wonderful part of, well, sexual life. This
building has the S&M leather fetish contingent for the march 
on Washington.  The S&M Leather coalition of organizations 
from around the country picked up some money, and it is a 
government building.  The Federal Government provided this 
building with just a few applications and permits and some 
money.

<p>

NARRATOR: Americans who have become aware of 
these events have these questions:  how could taxpayer 
supported federal buildings be commandeered by homosexual 
activists for their activities, why did the activists choose 
the federal buildings when they could have rented any number 
of other places to hold these events, and why have political 
leaders done nothing when apprised ahead of time of the 
Cherry Jubilee events in the Rayburn House Office Building 
and the Mellon Auditorium?

<p>

It is time that people knew how their federal
buildings are being used for celebrations of homosexuality,
dangerous sexual activities, and the taking of illicit
drugs.  It is also time to ask why corporations are lending
their good names to this radical agenda and why America's
political leaders are standing by doing nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, if people would like to get a
copy of this video and of some of the materials that go with 
it, how could they do that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, they can call our 800 number --
that is 800-225-4008 -- and obtain a copy of the video.  We 
are asking a $7.50 donation just to cover the costs, and 
that is not much for a video, let's face it.  But we did 
incur some expenses in making it, but we are more interested 
in getting it out there so people can see how far the 
homosexual agenda has gone in this city, that they can 
countenance basically an orgy on federal premises and most 
people do not bat an eye.

<p>

It is that bad, folks, and I think this video 
would be a great tool to convince friends who are wavering 
on the issue and think, oh, it is not that big a deal.
Don't worry about it. It's just a matter of tolerance.
Well, if it were just a matter of tolerance, it would be
simple, but it is not.  We are talking about people who are
trying to commandeer governmental power, governmental
buildings, and basically force the homosexual agenda on the
rest of us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being with us on 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, thanks for having me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break,
<i>Straight Talk</i> speaks to those fighting against the
legalization of euthanasia.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape segment follows.]

<p>

NARRATOR: A new pro-life movement is quickly
emerging across the nation. These cries for life not only 
echo for unborn children who cannot speak for themselves but 
also for the elderly in response to a chilling trend that 
currently is sweeping courtrooms nationwide, the litigation 
of the so-called right to die.  Physician-assisted suicide 
has become the politically correct term for euthanasia, 
which on March 6, 1996, a federal court of appeals ruled a 
constitutional right.

<p>

At present, the very essence of human life and 
existence appears to be at odds with a growing belief that a 
doctor can help a patient die in the name of humanity.  In 
ancient Greece and Rome, patients never knew if their 
doctors would heal them or kill them.  From those troubling 
times emerged the Hippocratic oath in which doctors pledged 
to do no harm.  Are we on a slippery slope to the same fate 
ancient Greeks and Romans faced?

<p>

DR. KEVORKIAN:  The first thing you do is check
the morality of a law, and if it is immoral, you disobey it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do that.  You pass any law against
assisted suicide and euthanasia and I will disobey it, I
state it openly, because it is immoral medically.

<p>

NARRATOR:  Soon, the right to die could become the 
duty to die.  Patients with high cost health care or lack of 
family support could feel pressured to end their lives 
prematurely out of fear and loneliness.  Masked in the name 
of humanity is a threat too great to be ignored, doctors and 
health care providers literally snuffing out innocent lives 
in the hour of their greatest need for compassion and 
healing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To help explain what euthanasia 
advocates mean when they talk about compassion, I am joined 
by Dr. David Stevens, Executive Director of the Christian 
Medical and Dental Society, who recently testified before 
the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee in opposition to 
euthanasia.  Also joining me is David Morrison, a researcher 
and writer for the Human Life International, which has 
researched euthanasia internationally, and its impact on our 
nation today, and Gracie Hsu, an FRC policy analyst whose 
work deals with the impact of so-called mercy killings.

<p>

Welcome.  It is good to talk to such an esteemed 
group of people.

<p>

Doctor, as our only official doctor here, I guess 
the thing that I would like to ask is, judging from your 
experience in the medical profession in school and the 
reading of the journals and certainly in your professional 
acquaintances, how comfortable are you with your colleagues 
and peers making life and death decisions for other people?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think most doctors are very 
uncomfortable with it.  I think that is why the AMA has come 
out so powerfully against this, which some people doubted 
they would.  This is not about the right to die.  This is 
about the right for doctors to kill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  And that is taking medicine into a 
whole level than it has ever been before.  It is giving an 
enormous amount of power to doctors to literally decide 
whether people should die or live.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gracie, you have a degree, a 
master's in public health, and did some extensive studies at 
Johns Hopkins.  Where do you see this trend going in terms 
of empowering physicians, not to save life but to kill when 
it is cost-effective?

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, as we all know, two years ago, 
when Clinton came out with his health care reform plan, one 
of the biggest things that we talked about was the rationing 
of health care resources.  There is only so much money to go 
around, and so where is it best suited, and obviously people 
in the latter stages of life who have terminal illnesses use 
a lot more of those health care dollars than anyone else 
does.  But is that to say, then, that they are somehow less 
suitable to receive those monies simply because they would 
die anyway, and I think really that is the crux of this.

<p>

Doctors are so pressured now, because of HMOs and 
because of other constraints with money, to cut their health
care spending, and this is one way that I see the movement
going, and I think that is the most troubling, especially
for doctors, because it is not necessarily their own
decisions any more, but it is the AMA's or it is the HMO
that they work for or some other type of cost containment
kind of structure that is bearing down on them.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think the key thing is this is
dangerous.  It is dangerous for people.  It is dangerous for 
you.  It is dangerous for me.  It is dangerous for my 
mother.  The way this law is being formatted and what they 
are trying to do is that this will be a personal choice 
between the doctor and their patient.  Can you imagine going 
to the hospital to visit your mother who is very ill, and 
you get there and she is not there, and you ask what 
happened?  Well, my doctor, the doctor that has been taking 
care of her, helped her kill herself last night.  She 
thought that she was too much a burden on the family.  She 
thought that the inheritance was being eaten up. She
thought that you were tired of coming to see her, because
you had not come as often. Can you imagine the guilt that 
that is going to bring on people?

<p>

Then, we need to understand something.  All of us 
escaped the abortion issue.  We are here.  We are not going 
to escape this issue.  This issue is going to face every one 
of us personally.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  David, you have been writing about 
that.  I mean, in some ways euthanasia and the discussion on 
physician-assisted suicide is, in your writings, you are 
seeing it as an extension of the abortion issue.  How do you 
see that being connected?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  In the fact that both the recent 
9th Circuit decision and the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision had as 
part of their foundation the notion that people can define 
their own reality, that people can define their own notion 
of what is objectively right and wrong, that human life is 
not kind of a universal standard.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What would the standard be then?  If 
you look at what the 9th Circuit said and the 2nd Circuit 
said, and you were very critical of the thinking in their 
decisions, what would be the standard to decide whether life 
had value?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, people need to go back to the 
universal standard which has been in place for 400 years, 
which is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary 
care, that if, heaven forbid, a person gets cancer and 
begins to die and comes to a point where really all medical 
science has for them is pretty much exhausted, they should 
have an option to say no more extraordinary means, which 
means experimental treatment, whatever, should be used to 
save them.  The disease will take its course, and they 
should be kept comfortable, fed, turned, I mean, all the 
palliative care, but that in terms of having a doctor come 
in and kill them is wrong.

<p>

I mean, what the doctor was saying is absolutely 
true, because the Royal Dutch Medical Society came out 
earlier this year with agreement with the Dutch government 
to back away from physician-assisted suicide in Holland 
because of the doctor stress.  Now they want the situation 
to be where a doctor does not actually do it, that he is 
providing the mechanism for doing it; the person does it 
themselves.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Dave makes a really good 
point in some of his writings in ordinary versus 
extraordinary care that I would like you all to comment on.  
I think one thing that is confusing for people when they 
hear about the so-called right to die is what does that 
mean?  Does that mean I have cancer and I am not going to 
get better and I am merely going to be made comfortable and 
allowed to die?  Is that the right to die?  Because that is 
not what you all are talking about.

<p>

DR. STEVENS: There is a lot of confusion.  I 
think that is one reason that 75 percent of the people in 
the United States right now think that physician-assisted 
suicide is a good thing.  There is so much confusion about 
somebody is going to force me to stay alive against my will, 
and there are laws on the books across this country that 
prevent that from happening.  That is not what we are 
talking about.  What we are talking about is someone helping 
you decide and assisting you in killing yourself, and that 
is a world of difference.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And the thing is, you see, the 
Hemlock Society and all these pro-euthanasia groups that are 
really pro-patient-killing groups, they are coming in and 
making hay off of that confusion.  They are coming in and 
putting a videotape of someone like the guy in Canada, 
Austin Bastable[?], who the Canadian Right to Die Society 
had on DeathNet[?], they had him on the Internet with a 
video and everything, and it was a courageous battle to die.
People look at that and they think, my gosh, that should not
happen to me. Heaven forbid.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they do not understand.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  They do not understand.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to clarify this 
a little further in just a moment.  Join us after the 
commercial break as <i>Straight Talk</i> continues our discussion 
of euthanasia.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. It is hard to believe that 
euthanasia has even made it to our nation's courts, and here 
tonight to explain why is Dr. David Stevens, Executive 
Director of the Christian Medical and Dental Society; David 
Morrison, researcher and writer for Human Life 
International; and Gracie Hsu, an FRC policy analyst.

<p>

Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Gracie, we were talking a little before about the 
pressures, why people would feel a need to have a family 
member killed, and you had a point to make.

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, if we look at abortion as an 
example, what we find is that women, because they have now 
this choice whether to have an abortion or not, we find that 
many fathers of their children say, look, I am not going to 
take care of your child, because you have that choice.  You 
chose to bear this child to full term, and now it is your 
responsibility.  In that same way, we can expect to see a 
diminished quality of care for the elderly in hospices and 
nursing homes everywhere, because they will be saying to 
them, well, you should be taking your own life; why do I 
need to help you?

<p>

We have this whole perverse understanding of 
compassion.  No longer is it to talk somebody out of their 
depression and to make them feel better about themselves and 
to feel better about life; it is, look, you have no life 
worth living, you might as well kill yourself.  I remember 
as a student health advocate at UCLA, we were told that if 
there was somebody who was thinking about committing suicide 
and you felt that their thinking was -- that they had 
actions planned, that you had a requirement to report that 
to the police because their life was worth saving, and it 
was not because of privacy or anything else.  You had to 
breach that barrier, and you had to say that person's life 
was more important than any breach of privacy or
confidentiality that I may have promised that person.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is an interesting philosophical 
shift where before if someone is talking of killing 
themselves, we have a duty as human beings to care for them 
and to talk them out of it and help them understand the 
value their life has, and now, what?  We have a duty to make 
an appointment so that we can point you to the tallest 
building so you can get the job done?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  One of the things that Gracie said, 
one of the things that I wanted to comment on is that 
palliative care, which is caring for people in the last 
stages of life when medical technology for cures has run 
out, is very low or to non-existent in countries that have 
active patient killing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you are saying that in the Netherlands, for 
example --

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Right, in the Netherlands palliative care is no 
where near what it is in the United States, even, or other 
countries in Europe.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Doctor, do you think there are 
physicians that would embrace assisted suicide?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think there are a lot.  Maybe not 
as many as some think, but we only have to look at the 
abortion issue; a little over 2,000 doctors do the vast 
majority of abortions in this country.  I think more will 
get involved in this.

<p>

I think this whole thing is driven by a perversion 
of language.  You know, you talked about suicide.  They use
the word rational suicide.  That is an oxymoron.  There is
no such thing as a rational suicide.  If you are suicidal,
you are not rational.  It is like somebody standing on a
bridge.  You walk up to them, and they explain to you why
they want to kill themselves, and you say, okay, I know it
is hard to jump; let me give you a push.  That is what we
are doing with this issue.  Your doctor will ease it.  It
will not be such a hard decision.  We will make it pleasant,
as you jump.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  The thing is when we as a society 
begin to define death as a good, okay, then it is only 
natural that if we define it as a good, we want to give it 
to other people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now one of the distinctions you make 
in your writings, David, is you say it is understandable 
that at some point a cancer patient, for example, there may 
be nothing else that they can do, and we make them 
comfortable in the death process.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  There may be nothing else that we 
can do to reverse the cancer, that may be true, right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right, and so we make them 
comfortable.  But you make a distinction between medical 
care, that we may be at the end of our medical options, and 
depriving people of water and food.  Why do you make that 
distinction?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Because in my view, depriving 
people of water or food is the same type of the thing as 
patient killing.  It is a slower -- I mean, obviously, there 
can be instances, very limited numbers of instances, where 
to actually give food causes more pain, in which case you 
could make an argument that if you are going to give 
painkilling drugs, you should also withhold food, because it 
has caused the pain, as part of the drugs, but that is not 
the standard.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you see in the medical 
community on that, Doctor?  I think a lot of people -- they 
are afraid that physician-assisted suicide means that if I 
am dying of cancer, my doctor will give me a painkiller so 
that I can proceed in that process.  Does the medical 
community draw lines between ending care and stopping food 
and water?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, there is a lot of debate on 
that issue.  Personally, I think, right along with David, 
that is cruel and unusual punishment.  I mean, we send 
millions overseas to take care of starving children and then 
turn around and starve a relative to death to kill them?  
This was the circuit court ruling in New York.  That is what 
they based -- they said it was discriminatory.  If you are 
willing to do that, then how can you say that you will not 
give someone a handful of pills to kill themselves?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Which is ironic, because we are 
going to justify giving them a handful of pills because we 
are in favor of starvation?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Yes, because we are starving them to 
death. Let's be more humane; let's give them a handful of 
pills.  I mean, this circuitous reasoning that is going on 
in the courts is baffling to me in the profession and, I 
think, a lot of other doctors.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And what I would stress here is 
that each one of these cases is an enormous failure of 
compassion, of real compassion, which is drawing close to 
someone and being with them in their pain, because one of 
the people who sued in the New York case, the 2nd Circuit 
case, was a man dying of HIV/AIDS, and one of the things he 
said in his suit was that my friends have -- my condition 
has progressed to the point that my friends will not come 
visit me.  They say that seeing me gives them nightmares.
So he is going through this terrible experience.  He is
entirely by himself.  His family has forsaken him.  So in
that circumstance, suicide can seem like a much more
appealing prospect.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So instead of us feeling indicted by 
the fact that this gentleman needs love and we are not 
giving him love, we are as a society to feel indicted 
because we do not kill him?  It seems extremely illogical.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  It is not true compassion.  It is false compassion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I wanted to ask you, Doctor, though, 
because one of the reasons why a lot of people are going to 
be talked into killing themselves is going to be money, and 
what do the numbers show us about the costs of our medical 
care at the end of life?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, people say there is not a 
slippery slope on this issue, but I think it is not only 
slippery, I think it is greased in the United States, 
because 50 percent of health care costs occur in the last 
three months of life.  There is going to be enormous 
pressures on doctors, hospitals.  Insurers are going to be 
putting these pressures, the government, to limit cost, and 
because of that, it is going to drive this into new realms, 
not just the patient who is willing to do it, but the 
comatose person, the disabled person, the elderly person, 
and what was the option or choice to die is going to become 
the duty to die.  You have an obligation to society to do 
this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Especially for, I think, the 
comatose patient and some of the people who are not as able 
to speak, we are going to run into a real abortion quandary 
where we are killing our friends and relatives.

<p>

I want to talk about this further.  When <i>Straight
Talk</i> returns, we will share more insights into the effects 
of euthanasia on our nation.  You will not want to miss it.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are delving 
into the topic of euthanasia with Dr. David Stevens, David 
Morrison, and Gracie Hsu.  Welcome back.

<p>

Doctor, you had just given us the chilling figure 
that 50 percent of health care costs normally comes in the 
last 3 months of life, which is going to pressure a lot of 
relatives, not to mention HMOs, into convincing people to 
die.

<p>

Gracie, do you think that the money argument is 
going to play well in the public health field, or will they 
be patient advocates?

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, unfortunately the public health 
industry has been very well known to say that quality of 
life matters much more than the sanctity of human life, and 
so whether it be abortion or euthanasia, they are very much 
in favor of seeing if the quality of life is not there, then 
abortion before they are born and euthanasia after they are 
elderly is a good thing, and unfortunately, the economic 
costs are very large, and they loom greatly in public health 
and in medical circles.

<p>

In fact, in December, when I was with the American 
Medical Association and some of their delegates, talking 
about what are the biggest issues that you see, and I was 
trying to bring to them a pro-life perspective.  They said, 
you know, honestly, the biggest issue right now is economic 
costs and how much it costs to sustain life and especially 
in the last years of care.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But quality of life, I mean, that is 
really in the eye of the beholder sometimes, and I think we 
all -- David, you have written about it, too -- hearken back 
to the quality of life conversations that Nazi Germany had, 
and in the Dr. Kevorkian trial, it has been interesting.  We 
were just talking about that at the break.  The quality of 
life discussion has even infiltrated there.

<p>

Tell us what you saw, Doctor.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, the quality of life discussion 
is all about whether this life is worth living, and that 
means somebody has to make that decision.  Somebody sits 
back, and today it can be one place, and tomorrow it could 
be another group of people, that all of a sudden they do not 
have that quality.

<p>

It was interesting.  Today the prosecutor at the 
Kevorkian trial held up a newspaper from 1933.  Headlines 
blaring said "Suffering to be Ended." That was the Germans 
stating that they were going to begin killing those that 
were disabled, that were retarded, that they were suffering, 
that we were going to relieve their suffering by killing 
them, and we see where that door once it was opened led, and 
I think the same thing is going to happen here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: David, I would like you to address 
that point, because clearly if we start talking about 
quality of life, then we are talking about not the sanctity 
of life, not even -- I mean, it is very much going to be 
subjective.  Who is going to make that decision?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, in Holland, for example, more 
and more it is doctors, but it is also relatives.  The Dutch 
government did a survey or a report on the practice of 
patient killing, or euthanasia, in Holland.  It was called 
the Remalich[?] Report.  The third reason listed for 
involuntary euthanasia, which is where the person involved 
in being killed does not say yes, please or no, don't, or 
whatever; they are just killed -- the third reason is the 
family could not take it any more.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I mean, that is just ridiculous. The family cannot 
take it any more, so we are going to get rid of our problem.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, because when euthanasia came 
into Holland, it came in not even as a law.  It is still 
technically against the law, but there have been a series of 
judicial agreements, arrangements, understandings over time 
which has made the practice of patient killing, in fact, not 
prosecutable, and what has happened is it started out with 
very narrowly defined -- you had to be very sick, you had to 
be terminally ill, almost the last stages, all these 
qualifications.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You had to ask for it.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  You had to ask for it.  Well, it 
has just been broader and broader and broader.  Again, if 
you define it as a good, the tendency is to give it to more 
people.  So now you have people who are merely depressed.  A 
doctor was brought up on charges in Holland last year 
because he had administered -- he killed a patient who had 
been just mentally -- you know, both of her sons had died, 
she was very depressed, and he had killed her, and they 
brought him up on charges, and they acquitted him.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  It is interesting, too.  Another 
most infamous case was a 27-year-old ballet dancer, and she 
had arthritis in her toes and could not dance any longer, 
became depressed, and her doctor helped kill her.  I mean, 
is that all life is worth?  I cannot dance any more, I 
cannot do another vocation, I cannot go help kids in some 
part of the world?  I mean, there is where life has gone, 
and that is where it will go here, if we are not careful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think we have been schizophrenic 
in our thinking about this.  If you think recently about 
Christopher Reeves, for example, who very sadly broke his 
neck not 10 miles from where we are right now, and I think 
has received very positive public response to his very 
courageous fight, and I remember him being interviewed, and 
he said that he was at that point that he wanted to die and 
his wife and his children said we need you, and that was a 
turnaround for him, and I can imagine the same situation 
where, what, the wife and the children say youre expensive?  
I mean, we are really losing the fact that life brings an 
intangible quality, and I fear we will not see a lot of 
those stories if this keeps up.

<p>

DR. STEVENS: I have treated thousands of patients 
that have been terminally ill.  Almost every one of them 
sometime during the course becomes depressed and despondent.  
Do you know they are scared of?  They are scared of two or 
three things.  They are scared of being a burden.  They are 
scared of loss of control.  They are scared of death itself.  
They are scared of pain.  What they are really wanting -- 
they are sitting out there signaling, saying do you still 
care for me?  Do you still love me?  What we are turning to 
is to say, no, you are right, maybe it would be better if 
you were not here.

<p>

What a message we are sending to people.  When 
they need us the most, we turn around and say, now, here is 
a handful of pills, here is a canister of carbon monoxide.  
We have diagnosed the problem right.  I would be the first 
one to say health care in this country is not perfect, okay, 
and it can be done better, especially at the end of life, 
but we may have the right diagnosis, but this is the wrong 
treatment.  We need to deal with the depression.  We need to 
deal with the cost concerns.  We need to deal with a loving 
atmosphere.  We need to deal with pain control.  But we do 
not need to kill the sufferer to eliminate the suffering.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And the thing is, too, that there 
is a witness now.  There is a growing witness, I think, for 
the truth in this, which is coming from Mother Teresas 
whole order, from the Houses of Love she runs for people 
with AIDS around the country.  People do not know that there 
is an organization called LARGE[?], which is a series of 
communities around the world for people who are 
developmentally disabled and people who are not, and they 
all live together, and there are powerful voices there about 
the value of life, the value of living with, quote, unquote, 
a disability.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a slippery slope, isn't it? I
mean, in abortion what we have said is that life is as 
valuable as it is to me.  I have an interesting -- reading 
feminist literature, there was an interesting thing in the 
New York Times Magazine not too long ago -- Gracie and I had 
some long conversations about it -- where the woman came to 
the conclusion after having her own child that it wasn't a
person until she had decided to have the baby and accepted 
its humanity, and until then it was merely a decision, and I 
wonder what kind of leaps of logic we are going to see in 
the end of life.  So you were a person, you were my father, 
until now.  You have a health problem, and so now you are -- 
what? -- not a person.  You are plant life.

<p>

I would like to ask you all in terms of the 
slippery slope, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
and other very radical pro-animal groups have argued that, 
you know, animals have their own sort of humanity, and it 
would be better for us to experiment, for example, on 
comatose patients than it would be for us to ever use animal 
tests.  Do you see this kind of euthanasia discussion 
leading to that, because, again, I think, if you look at 
euthanasia, in Germany that that is exactly what happened in 
the death camps, that we saw experiments on humans.

<p>

We actually do not have a lot of time left. Doctor, let me have 
you answer that.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, I think we are moving to that, 
and all we have to do is look at Kevorkian, you know, the 
physician-assisted suicide poster child.  He back in the 
1960s was going around with an ophthalmoscope and looking 
into people's eyes and retinas as they were dying to try to 
see the exact moment.  He has proposed that we harvest 
organs from prisoners that are going to be killed.  I mean, 
this whole thinking that there is no sacredness to human 
life, we can do whatever we want to people once they are no 
longer declared to be human.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a powerfully dangerous slippery slope.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares insights from 
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer.  Please stay 
tuned, and thank you to my guests.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. FRC President Gary Bauer had 
the opportunity to speak at the 1996 National Day of Prayer 
event and provided his insight into the current plight of 
our nation and its families. Let's hear what Gary had to 
say as we share some Homefront News.

<p>

<p>

MR. BAUER:  For about 10 years now, two-thirds of 
the American people have been saying that America is headed 
in the wrong direction.  They said that when George Bush was 
in the White House and the Democrats controlled the 
Congress, and they are saying it now with Bill Clinton in 
the White House and the Republicans controlling the 
Congress, and I do not believe it has anything to do with 
the ebb and flow of politics or who happens to be sitting in 
the Oval Office.

<p>

I think the American people are pondering the soul 
of America.  I think they are thinking about a mother in 
North Carolina who straps her children in the back seat of a 
car and sends it to the bottom of a lake, or about a family 
in Los Angeles that makes one wrong turn and before they can 
get off that street of killers, their 3-year-old child is 
dead of sniper fire, or the incredible headlines a few weeks 
ago of a 1-month-old baby almost being kicked to death by a 
6-year-old in a robbery, and the politicians read the 
headlines, and they have no idea what to do.

<p>

My friends, there are many, many ways to measure a 
great nation.  You can measure it by the size of its 
economy, the strength of its military, and the gleam of its 
cities, and by those measurements the United States is a 
great, great nation.

<p>

But you can also measure a nation by how many of 
its families are broken, how big its virtue deficit is, how 
many of its children will cry themselves to sleep, and the 
fact of the matter is that tonight in Washington, DC and in 
the suburbs and all over this country, too many of our 
children will cry themselves to sleep, too many children 
without a father's arms to comfort them, too many children 
exploited by drugs or pornography, too many children who 
have bought into the siren song of the culture that says if 
it feels good, do it, and by that measurement, we are in 
danger of becoming something much less than a great nation.

<p>

Now all the politicians are asking why?  What 
happened?  What is the government program we need?  I don't 
think there is a government program.  I don't think there is 
any number of bureaucrats that can make it right.  I believe 
that what happened is that we forgot God, and having 
forgotten God, we have unleashed the hounds of hell on our 
streets and our neighborhoods and our communities, and 
unless we are willing to deal with that, then all the 
politicians in the world will not be able to put America 
back together again.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we will share our conversation
with a true American hero.  Almost 1 year ago, on June 2, 
1995, U.S. Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady's life changed 
forever.  On that June afternoon, Captain O'Grady flew 
his F-16 over hostile Bosnian territory enforcing the 
United Nations no-fly zone, when suddenly an anti-aircraft 
missile hit his plane.  From then, miracle after 
miracle led to his rescue, which occurred almost 6 days 
after Captain O'Grady found himself hiding in hostile 
territory without food or water.

<p>

The successful Marine rescue mission brought 
home a brave new hero, and we will find out how Captain 
O'Grady's experience shaped what he is doing today and 
shapes his future.  You will not want to miss this 
exclusive <i>Straight Talk</i> interview.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Robert Knight, the 
Family Research Council's director of cultural studies.
Bob enlightens us on a crucial social and policy change
which threatens to redefine marriage as we know it now
and have known it since even before recorded history.
The courts in Hawaii are toying with redefining marriage 
to mean two men or two women or fill in the blank,
instead of protecting the relationship at the core of all 
civilized societies, marriage between a man and a woman.

<p>

Bob shares important information regarding the 
ramifications of this change that you probably will not 
hear on the broadcast or print news coverage as we take 
you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You know, it may 
seem strange to a lot of our viewers, but we are actually 
going to have a conversation about what is marriage, and 
why do we even care what it is?  Why are we talking about
marriage today?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has been forced upon us.
This is not an issue that we raised, because we have been 
for marriage all along and want it to stay the way it is:
the social, legal, spiritual, and economic union of a man 
and a woman.  That is what it has been for centuries.  In 
fact, if you just reduce it to the bringing together of 
the two sexes to form families, that is the way it has 
always been across cultures around the world for 
thousands of years.

<p>

So the only reason we are even discussing it is 
because of a court case in Hawaii.  Three years ago,
three same sex couples sued to get a marriage license.
They were denied by the state of Hawaii because there is 
an opposite sex missing in each couple, and so they took 
their case all the way to the Hawaiian Supreme Court.
That court told the state:  find a compelling interest in 
maintaining this definition of marriage, or we are going 
to legalize homosexual marriage under the state's gay 
rights law.

<p>

So right now that court case is simmering.  It 
is supposed to be heard in August, 1996, and because of 
the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, if Hawaii legalizes gay marriage -- that is 
an oxymoron -- then all the other states would see their 
laws threatened, because a couple from California or 
Illinois or North Carolina could fly to Honolulu, get a 
bogus marriage certificate, come back and say under the 
Constitution, you have to recognize our license.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, I think we almost have to 
explain that a little further, because that is the clause 
through which all contracts in all of the states are 
accepted, such as drivers' licenses or marriage licenses 
or even business agreements.  Would the full faith and 
credit clause sweep this nationwide?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it would.  There is one little 
-- well, a lot of rays of hope here.  For one thing, 
states are moving very rapidly to protect themselves.  At 
least nine states have enacted laws saying, look, we mean 
by marriage one man and one woman and that is it, and we 
are not going to recognize any licenses from anywhere 
that say otherwise, and this is continuing.  I expect 
more and more states will adopt these kinds of laws.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there precedent for one state 
to say that for us we will restrict agreements from other 
states in certain areas?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, yes.  The Congress had to 
take this up because of child custody proceedings.  There 
were different varying definitions of what a child is and 
that sort of thing.  So Congress stepped in and said, 
well, look, we will amend the U.S. code and make national 
definitions that everybody can use, and that is what is 
happening now at the federal level on the marriage issue.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act, introduced in the 
House and the Senate, does precisely that.  It says that 
no state can be forced to renounce its own definition 
just because another state has taken up a radical 
redefinition, and it also defines marriage as one man/one 
woman for the federal government, which is no small 
thing, unfortunately.  Government is too big.  You are 
talking Social Security, the military, the welfare 
agencies.  The use of the term marriage and spouse is 
everywhere in the federal code.  So this would make a 
major dent in the drive to redefine marriage if the 
entire federal government goes on record as supporting 
the traditional definition of marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It seems obvious, Bob, that the 
Hawaii case could have drastic social consequences, but I 
think the question that most people would really like to 
hear you answer is what does it matter if two men or two 
women decide to go through a legalized ceremony for their 
relationship?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, that is the problem, and that 
is what we hear all the time.  Hey, how are you 
threatened?  Barney Frank says it all the time.  How are 
you threatened if I and a lover live together?  Well, you 
are threatened any time the moral order is shaken by 
activities that are immoral and hurt people.
Homosexuality by its essence hurts people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How does it hurt people?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because it is a breakdown of 
the moral code.  When sexuality is not channeled into 
marriage -- and we are talking about premarital sex, 
adultery, homosexuality, anything short of marriage -- 
and historical precedents show that it breaks down the 
moral order.  It breaks down the way we live.  It hurts 
the kinship structure.

<p>

Marriage was not invented to oppress 
homosexuals.  It was invented because it is the way to 
form families, and it is the building block of 
civilization, and when you have any sex outside marriage, 
you run the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, 
breaking down support for marriage within the culture, 
which has already happened in this country with no-fault 
divorce and the whole push for premarital sex.  Marriage 
has already been cheapened to the point where now 
homosexual activists think they can deal the final blow 
by expanding the definition so far that marriage will not 
mean anything any more.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the conversation on this 
issue of marriage being redefined for homosexuals has 
surrounded the point that marriage tames men.  So if we 
had marriage for gay men, they would be tamed.  But don't 
women really tame men in the context of a committed 
relationship?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I think women help a lot, because 
men have something else to live for other than their own 
appetites and desires when they have families.  So I 
would not dismiss that out of hand, but the claim that if 
we let homosexuals marry they will suddenly behave 
themselves is bogus.  In areas where they have de facto 
gay marriage, like San Francisco, where they really 
recognize the union, the social pathologies are still 
soaring, and the gays are very clear in their literature 
that what they mean by marriage is different from what 
other people mean.  They have outside relationships.

<p>

Andrew Sullivan, the editor of the <i>New Republic</i>,
said that gay male relationships may even be superior to
marriage, because they understand the need for outside 
sexual contacts.  So they are not even talking about
monogamy.  Furthermore, other gay activists have been
even more candid, like Michelangelo Signarilli[?], who
said we need to get marriage because it is the final tool
to ram through the rest of the homosexual agenda:
teaching homosexuality to children in schools, forcing
businesses to provide benefits to subsidize
homosexuality, the whole gay agenda.  He also said, look,
we want marriage, not to live by society's moral code but 
to help destroy an archaic institution.  I mean, this guy 
is priceless, because he is actually saying out loud what 
the gay activists have been planning all along.  So in 
the name of tolerance, we are supposed to accept 
something that really will destroy marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, on <i>This Week with David
Brinkley</i>, California Attorney General Dan Lundgren made 
an interesting defense of marriage, where he said that 
one reason why we protected marriage, that union of 
man/woman and then the family that came from it, was 
because of the implications for that on social breakdown 
and that increased crime, in particular, was a real 
problem for societies where men and women did not work 
together consistently for the raising of children.  Would 
homosexual marriage of any kind create some kind of 
safety net against crime?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, no, it would do the opposite, 
because it would reduce the support for marriage within 
the cultural and legal codes.  Once you redefine marriage 
so that it is not even the bringing together of the two 
sexes, then the sky is the limit.  You could have three 
people, four people.  Unmarried heterosexual couples have 
piggybacked on the gay rights agenda to demand that they 
be treated the same as married couples.  If that happens, 
then the support for marriage disintegrates, and when 
marriage disintegrates, commitment is lessened.  You do 
not have the ties between the generations.

<p>

I do not think the average person really -- 
well, maybe average people do.  They are smarter than all 
the activists put together.  They know marriage is the 
glue that holds society together.  It ensures kinship 
passing from generation to generation.  We talk of our 
grandparents and our children yet to be, and there is a 
linkage there.

<p>

When sex goes outside marriage, you break that 
linkage, or if it goes into a phony homosexual type 
marriage.  I mean, you do not have that generational 
intimacy and passing on of property, names.  I mean, 
think of what a society would be with widespread so-called 
homosexual marriage.  It would be in utter chaos.
So why would we want to introduce a chaotic element into 
a society that already needs to bolster marriage?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Really at the heart of this 
controversy over redefining marriage is the traumatic 
social change of making children available for adoption 
into households with two men or two women and then the 
very powerful social message that children do not need a 
mother and a father, that as long as two guys care about 
you, or two women, that a whole lot of social 
relationships are insignificant.  Are you concerned about 
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Children are desperate for clues as 
to how to grow up, to be either men or women, and they 
look to both sexes for clues.  Boys look to their dads 
for how to grow up to be men, and they look to their 
mothers and their fathers for how women and men interact, 
how husbands and wives interact, how mothers and fathers 
interact.  They have to learn how to treat the opposite 
sex and be treated by the opposite sex.

<p>

The same for little girls.  You know, without a 
dad, they are not sure how men should be treating women, 
or without a mom -- that is their role model.  That is 
their security in developing their femininity.  If you 
take that away, you are trying to create an artificial 
gender identity by theory basically rather than by 
experience.  So when you have a household in which you 
have mom and dad replaced by just two men or two women, 
you are leaving out such an important element that the 
child knows it.  We are experimenting on children.  This 
is wrong.

<p>

Again, nobody knows this better than single 
parents, who are struggling mightily to try to replace 
that void in the child's life that they know is there, 
and a lot of parents are heroically trying to fill that 
void.  But in a homosexual household, now you are talking 
about having one sex missing entirely and a distorted 
version of sexuality and relationships presented to the 
child on a daily basis.  This is putting children at 
risk.  It is not reasonable to assume this will have no 
impact on children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The homosexual activists have 
talked a lot about the fact that they need to redefine 
marriage under the law so that they can give property 
through wills, so that they can visit loved ones in the 
hospital, but do we really need that kind of huge social 
change to accomplish those two goals?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, most of the activists greatly 
exaggerate any legal problems they already have.  You can 
leave anything you want to anybody in a will.
Homosexuals already do that routinely.  What they want is 
that family should not have an advantage in any legal 
challenge to a will, and to do that you would have to 
devalue family entirely.  You know, children coming out 
of a marriage, even if it is sundered, should have 
certain rights in an inheritance proceeding.  What the 
gay activists are saying is they should not have any more 
standing than, say, a string of gay lovers, and that is 
wrong.

<p>

As far as hospital visitation, that is not a 
federal issue.  It is not even a state issue.  That is 
between the hospital administrators and their patients, 
and there is no reason that gays should seize marriage, 
completely radically redefine it, just to have a change 
in hospital visitation rules.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It seems a bit extreme.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it is the most compelling 
argument they have, that, oh, I can't even visit my lover 
in the hospital; isn't that unfair?  Maybe it is, but you 
do not seize marriage and radically redefine it to 
correct that one problem, if it is a problem.  You know, 
there is a reason family members have been given priority 
in visitation of loved ones.  Friends cannot make the 
same claims that family members can.  The same with 
homosexual lovers.  No matter how close they are, it is 
still not family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, as we take a look at some of 
the serious possible changes in our culture that could 
come from redefining marriage, I think it is interesting 
to remember that the family is defined as that unit bound 
by blood, by birth, by adoption, and by marriage.  What 
do you think the most serious social consequence is if we 
change what marriage means?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, already, marriage has been 
severely weakened by many forces:  pornography, no-fault 
divorce, sex education that omits marriage as a central 
element and talks about partners.  I mean, marriage is 
already, as the author Maggie Gallagher says, on the outs 
in the society.  She calls it a post-marital culture, and 
we are reaping a whirlwind from it.  Certainly crime is 
one of the greatest aspects of that, but if we go the 
final route and say that men and women are not different 
and homosexual marriage is the equivalent of a man and a 
woman together, then we have embraced a lie.  We have 
embraced something that is so toxic that it will spoil 
the whole culture, because you cannot lie about something 
as basic as nature and get away with it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thanks so much for being with 
us today, and we are going to watch very closely what 
happens through your work on the Defense of Marriage Act.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for having me, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares my conversation with Captain Scott 
O'Grady.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I recently had the 
opportunity to speak with Captain Scott O'Grady, the Air 
Force pilot who survived 6 days and nights in hostile 
Bosnian territory before his miraculous rescue.  This 
life-changing experience occurred almost 1 year ago, and 
Captain O'Grady's life has not been the same since.

<p>

Let's hear what he has to say about life as an American hero.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Scott, thank you so much for 
joining us on <i>Straight Talk</i>. I do not think there are 
too many people who have not heard your story by now, and 
we do want to hear your story, too, but your life has 
changed a lot since you were rescued.  How is it 
different?  I mean, all your life, you are training to be 
a pilot, and suddenly you are a pilot plus more, 
something philosophical for America.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, it is something that I 
thought was just going to go away, actually, and when I 
moved out to Hill Air Force Base, Salt Lake City area, 
where I am now assigned, flying the F-16, I pretty much 
thought that a lot of the requests in the mail would come 
to an end, and they have not, and I was trying to decide, 
you know, what can I do with all of this, and I am 
working hard on trying to fulfill all the requests a lot 
of people have of me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What kind of requests do people have?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Oh, there are a lot of 
different charity organizations that would like to have 
me stop by or community organizations and schools.  That 
is what I do now is I fly the F-16 half the month, but 
the other half of the month I travel a lot, and I do 
speaking engagements; I do the schools, or just as an 
example, I will go to a fund-raiser for a charity.

<p>

I am deciding now that I need to get some 
organization.  I have some help from people that are 
helping me with all the requests, and I am going to 
narrow it down to where I am going to concentrate on two 
charities.  I am going to concentrate on still visiting 
schools and doing things for community organizations, but 
people have to realize that I am only one person, but I 
do tell them that if they would be patient, that I will 
live a long life --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And you will get there some day.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  I will get there some day.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  In a way, you have become the 
ambassador for the military to the rest of the America.  
I think the military in some ways is at a time, 
especially in the media, of a lot of criticism, and you 
have presented a symbol of what the military is proud of.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: See, I am not a spokesman for the military.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, I understand.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: And I do not even recruit for 
the military.  I do not do that.  But I will tell people 
all the time how happy I am to be serving in the military 
and how fantastic it is to have worked with all the great 
people that are in the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines, 
the Army, and the Coast Guard.  People have to realize 
that we are just like everyone else in America.  We are 
the same people.  We have the same feelings.  But yet we 
are also doing a job that does not ask the normal demands 
that a job in the civilian sector would.  We are in a job 
that could ask for you to put your life on the line to 
defend freedom, and people are dedicated enough and 
believe in their cause that if that is the call, then 
they are going to go ahead and do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have a friend right now that is 
in Korea.  Obviously there are some tensions there, North 
Korea talking about going into the demilitarized zones, 
and there are a lot of hot spots around the world.  He 
told me that the thing that was most impressive to him 
about your experience was that you went by the book.  You 
know, you were sitting there following all these 
procedures and that this was successful.

<p>

How did your training prepare you for what you experienced?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, training is something 
that we have in the military, and it prepares us not only 
just how to run things on a day-to-day operational basis, 
but also we prepare for emergencies.  We prepare for the 
unexpected.  It is all training that is based on previous 
successes and previous failures, because you always learn 
from your experiences to be able to benefit those in the 
future, and that just does not go with military training; 
it goes with day-to-day living.

<p>

But it was a foundation for me to grab hold of, 
something that was real and tangible when everything was 
going crazy all at once in just brief short periods of 
time, but it also does not give you the motivation to get 
through a time like that.  You have to derive your 
strength from somewhere else, and the inspiration I got 
was definitely from people that I know that have gone 
through worse situations, those who have been prisoners 
of war, those who have been in survival situations, maybe 
not even in combat, and I knew that they had gone through 
hard times and could get through.

<p>

So they gave me inspiration, but really it came 
down to, for me, getting the strength to get through it 
came from faith, came from love of family, came from love 
of country.  And that is really where, when you get down 
to the bottom basics of going through a situation like I 
went through, you have to have somewhere deep inside you 
the will to live, love of life, and that is where it 
comes from.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the President 
of the United States, accompanied by General John M. 
Shalikashvili, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 
Honorable William J. Perry, and Captain Scott O'Grady.

<p>

GENERAL SHALIKASHVILI:  Mr. President, Secretary
Perry, members of Congress, other distinguished guests,
members of the Armed Forces.  Thank you for coming, even
in this rain, and for helping us welcome home this very 
special young man, Captain Scott O'Grady, and to extend a
warm welcome to his father, Dr. O'Grady, his mother, Mrs.
Scardapane[?], her husband, Mr. Scardapane, Scott's
brother Paul and his sister Stacy, and his grandparents.
We are delighted you could all be here today, for surely
this is a very proud and a very happy moment for us all.
Welcome.

<p>

Ten days ago, like thousands of other men and 
women in uniform, performing dangerous missions in 
difficult and demanding circumstances all over the world, 
Captain O'Grady was flying over Bosnia, doing his part to 
deny the skies to those who would rain death and 
destruction upon that war-torn land below, but as we all 
now know, in the early morning hours of 2 June, the 
course of Captain O'Grady's life took a dramatic turn, 
and the next 6 days put to test every bit of his 
knowledge, every fiber of his courage, every bit of skill 
and determination, and every ounce of faith that he could 
muster, and for 6 long days, people around the world, his 
family, his friends, every American, waited impatiently 
for news of his fate, and while they were 6 long days for 
us to wait, they must have seemed like an eternity for 
Scott O'Grady.

<p>

Then, on the 7th of June, out of the darkness in 
the hills of Bosnia came that voice; this is Badger 52.
At last we had our opportunity, and so a remarkable team
that had been praying for that call sprang into action.
NATO's combined air operation center in Vicenza, Italy -- 
Americans, Italians, Dutch, French, Spanish -- under the 
direction of U.S. Air Force Major General Hal 
Hornberg[?], quickly took control and started issuing 
orders.

<p>

At Avigliano[?], Colonel Chuck Wald[?] began to 
launch air defense suppression aircraft and those that 
would provide close air support, if needed.  Others made 
sure that air refueling aircraft were in station, to 
include a French KC-135.  Still others double-checked 
that NATO AWACs and the French E-3M with Major 
L'Enfant[?] on board, were ready to provide airborne 
control and radar data, and off the deck of the USS 
Kiresarge[?], under the command of Colonel Marty Burn[?], 
into the dark foggy night rose those who would this day 
do the heavy lifting, the Stallion helos, the Cobra 
gunships, the Harriers, and the Marines of the 24th 
Expeditionary Unit, and 2 hours and 5 minutes later, 
Colonel Marty Burn reached out his hand and pulled Scott 
aboard the rescue helicopter.

<p>

Although they still had to dodge bullets and 
shoulder-fired rockets, Scott was at last on his way 
home, and the professionalism, the courage, the inner 
strength of Captain O'Grady and every member of the team 
that brought him home are vivid reminders, if reminders 
we need, that our greatest strength and the source of our 
deepest pride are our men and women in uniform, and the 
deeds of courage that we are here to salute and applaud 
are reminders, as well, of our responsibility to take 
care of them and of their families.

<p>

Scott, today is an especially great day to wear 
America's uniform, and you and the rest of your team have 
made it so.  For that I thank you and I salute you, and 
with a great deal of happiness, I welcome you home.
Welcome home, Scott.  Welcome home.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more from 
Captain Scott O'Grady after this commercial break.  Don't
go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are sharing our 
conversation with Captain Scott O'Grady as he discusses 
memories of the fateful events which changed his life 
forever.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  The first thing I want to do is thank God, thank 
God for His love.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you remember most about 
your experience?  We have heard a lot.  You were 
obviously shot down, you were behind enemy lines, and 
they were looking to kill you, and eventually you were 
rescued.  What do you remember most about that 
experience?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, if I would have come 
home and nobody would have paid attention to the story 
and I just would have returned to my family, it still 
would have been the most positive experience of my life.
The thing that people have to realize is that I do not
recommend, you know, life-threatening situations as being
something that everybody should explore, but it was 
definitely something that I was able to, like I said 
before, look inside myself and see what is really 
important in life, and the relationship you have with 
your faith, and it is not just so much having a faith as 
having trust, and then love of family.

<p>

I would have given up everything I own to be 
able to return to my family, and you realize that that is 
what is really important, those relationships, because 
materialistic things are things that you are not going to 
take with you, and it isnt until your health is 
threatened that -- you forget all the time in your day-to-day 
living how valuable your health and your well-being is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How has it changed you now, now 
that you have had this experience, really a crystallizing 
moment where you could have lost everything including 
your life?  So how do you live differently?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Oh, I still have the problems 
as everybody else, but you just keep on constantly 
remembering what is important in life and where your 
priorities should lie, and with that, though, try to 
simplify your life to where then you can have the room 
and the space and the time to be able to concentrate on 
those relationships that are the most important thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What kind of advice would you give 
somebody from that?  I mean, what kind of tool to help 
them understand?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  I think the biggest thing is 
people have to realize that myself and other individuals 
who have gone through a situation like this, we did not 
ask for it, and we also of course prior to this would 
say, oh, gee, I could never get through something like 
that, because even now I have people who come up to me 
and say I never could have done what you did, and that is 
not true.

<p>

You would be surprised what kind of strength you 
have inside you when you are faced with an adverse 
situation, and you have to just concentrate hopefully on 
what is really important in life.  I know that everybody 
gets wrapped up in the day-to-day living, and there is 
always this to worry about and that to worry about, but 
if you take a step back and kind of look at the big 
picture, you realize that most of the things you are 
dealing with and most of your worries in life really are 
not that important.

<p>

MR. PERRY:  We are here today to celebrate true 
grit, great training, superior technology, and 
outstanding leadership.  The true grit is obvious to the 
entire country.  It was the courage and skill 
demonstrated by Captain O'Grady.  They shot down his 
plane but not his spirit.  The true grit was also evident 
in the courage and skill of Colonel Burn and the Marine 
Corps search and rescue team.  They proved that the 
Marines have landed and the situation is well in hand.

<p>

The great training was evident in the efficiency 
of the operation, reflected in Captain O'Grady's training 
and survival techniques, and the Marines' training in 
search and rescue operations.  Training is the key to 
ready effective forces, because the more you sweat in 
peace, the less you bleed in war.

<p>

Normally, the technology of greatest importance 
in search and rescue operations is our night vision 
devices.  These allow us to operate at night and give us 
the benefit of stealth.  As the Army says, we own the 
night.

<p>

However, this search and rescue operation had to 
be conducted in daylight.  So we lost the advantage of 
operating at night.  But fortunately, we had the 
advantage of another piece of technology, the Global 
Positioning Satellite, or GPS.  Captain O'Grady used the 
GPS receiver in his survival kit to determine his exact 
location to within 100 feet, and the search and rescue 
team, using its own GPS receiver, was able to set down 
virtually at the pilot's position. This allowed them to 
keep their time on the ground, the time of greatest risk, 
to only 2 minutes.  This was an amazing performance for a 
search and rescue operation.

<p>

I want also to note the outstanding leadership 
of General Jawin[?], Admiral Smith, Lieutenant General 
Ryan, and, yes, General Shalikashvili.  They were faced 
with a really tough decision.  They had planned a night 
operation to take advantage of our night vision 
technology, but Captain O'Grady's radio signal was 
confirmed just 3 hours before dawn.

<p>

So they had to make a choice, either to wait 
another 18 hours until the next nightfall to rescue him, 
and that would risk that the pilot would be captured 
during the day, or to go immediately, even without the 
advantage of operating at night.  They chose to go.  It 
was a gutsy decision.

<p>

It turned out to be the right decision, and it 
was in the best military tradition, exemplified in a 
famous letter that was pointed out to me by General 
Sullivan, Chief of Staff of the Army, the letter that 
General Sherman wrote to General Grant.  He said:  I knew 
wherever I was that you thought of me, and if I got in a 
tight place, you would come.  To Captain O'Grady, Colonel 
Burn and the Marine search and rescue team, General 
Jawin, Admiral Smith, and General Ryan, you should be 
very proud of your performance.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we 
will hear more about Captain Scott O'Grady's heroic 
experience and miraculous rescue.  Join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. We are sharing 
with you my visit with an American hero, Captain Scott 
O'Grady, as we hear some of his memories and trials and 
triumph.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Could you describe for us your 
darkest moment and your brightest moment during that 
experience?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: The darkest moment was 
actually when I was on the ground for the first couple of 
hours and the people were walking very close to my 
proximity, and I heard approximately five or six 
gunshots, and they were all carrying rifles, and the way 
it was sporadically done, along with the different 
locations, the only thing I could conclude was that they 
saw something or heard something that they heard was me 
and shot at it, and that scared me, because now I am 
thinking that the probability of getting caught is going 
to be very high, but I also was anticipating the fact 
that I would be mistreated, but now, because of that 
occurrence, I thought instead of being mistreated, they 
would probably just kill me.  So that was actually the 
time of a very heightened state of fear.

<p>

Prior to that, a lot of things happened to me, 
but I just did not have time to be afraid.  Afterwards, I 
really was not afraid when I was out there.

<p>

As far as the greatest moment, it was definitely 
when I finally could hear Tio Hanford[?] come up on the 
radio and respond to my voice.  That was like being 
reborn.  It was like a bolt of energy that ran through me 
that I had never had before, because you wanted to let 
loose on every emotion possible; you wanted to laugh, you 
wanted to scream, you wanted to cry, and that was a 
fantastic and phenomenal moment in my life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Then when you returned to base and 
you got to see men and women who you knew well and who 
had really prayed for your return, what was that like?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  That was unexpected and a very 
emotional time, too.  In fact, when I got off the 
airplane and I saw everybody in the hangar, I had to go 
and get cleaned up, because, again, I was very emotional.  
So we went off, and I took a little bit of a breather, 
and then we came back and said hello to everybody, and 
that was a fantastic time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you have any momentos from that 
experience, either a mental momento or even a physical 
momento?  Do you have anything that you can hold in your 
hand and you remember?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, I always have my cross 
on, and that was with me, and I had my Swiss army knife 
that got me through, and then my watch.  But as far as 
momentos, the biggest thing is just the memory of the 
event, and it has actually become a story to me, because 
I have been able to tell a lot of people about it, and 
there are no nightmares.  It is actually the most 
positive thing that has ever happened to me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It changed your life.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  It definitely did.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, I know you are going to work with St. Jude's.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, I am going to try to 
start a relationship with two charities.  We have not 
done anything yet.  I am trying to organize all these 
things that are coming up in my life that I never 
expected, and one of the two charities I really want to 
set up a relationship with is St. Jude's Children's 
Hospital, also the Make A Wish Foundation.  Both 
concentrate on children which are going through adverse 
times, trying to overcome diseases that are life-threatening, 
and if that does not tug at your heart, I do not know what will.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we close, Scott, your 
experience really can relate to what these kids are 
facing.  They are going to be asked to deal with pain and 
suffering that they are pretty unprepared for.  What do 
you think you can tell them when they are looking to 
something that seems very dark to them?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, the biggest thing I 
learned is you never quit, and you never even think about 
anything but a good outcome.  You always keep a positive 
mental attitude.  But for me, the reason why those two 
hit home so well is the fact that these are children that 
do not have the normal lifestyle that I had when I was 
growing up.  They do not have a normal childhood.  Here 
they are inflicted with something that they did not ask 
for, just like I did not ask for what happened to me, and 
yet have also such great life and spirit inside of them.  
It is really a treat to be able to go and be able to do 
something for those children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And their tragedies can be a great triumph for 
them, as well.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: Oh, yes. Yes, it is definitely character-building.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Scott, thank you so much for being with us on 
<i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Thanks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares how policy makers and communities can make a 
difference in stopping the breakdown of marriages in 
America.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you a portion 
of a recent panel discussion at the Heritage Foundation, 
which tackled the collapse of marriage and its economic 
and social consequences.  Bill Mattox, the Vice President 
for Family Research Council's Policy Division, provided 
his expertise regarding this important issue.  So let's
hear some of Bill's insight on tonight's Homefront News.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>

MR. MATTOX:  There are many implications for 
policy makers and others for the collapse of marriage, 
and I want to take just a minute to outline a couple.  
For public policy makers, I think it is going to be 
extremely important for public policy makers to be 
cautious about making divorce law distinctions between 
couples with children and couples without.

<p>

Bill Galston[?] did all of us a tremendous favor 
several years back when he and Elaine Kaymark[?] 
presented a paper from the Progressive Policy Institute 
called "Putting Children First," which argued that on 
many of these kinds of questions, the first question we 
should be asking ourselves is how will children fare, how 
do children fare, and what ought we do to meet the needs 
of children?

<p>

I think that is a very important question for us 
to consider when it comes to marriage, for all of the 
reasons that have been cited about the negative effects 
of divorce and out of wedlock childbearing on children, 
but I guess when it comes to public policy, I am a bit 
disturbed about the possibility of making distinctions on 
this basis, considering those marriages in which a child 
is present somehow different from those in which a child 
is not, and the reason is just because I think, though it 
is clear that a child's well-being is more adversely 
affected by the break-up of his own parents' marriage, I 
think it is nevertheless true that a child is going to be 
affected by the failure of other marriages in the 
community, most especially marriages of their neighbors, 
their extended family members, their grandparents, and 
other role models in the community.

<p>

I also think, by the way, that we need to look 
at the whole question of affirmative action, of all 
things, and how it may be contributing inadvertently to 
problems of marriage breakdown in the black community, 
and there is a dramatic difference in the way in which 
minority women and minority men are being assimilated 
into the current labor force.

<p>

What you see is that minority women are much 
more likely to move into positions of promotions and get 
higher salaries than are minority men, and I think part 
of the reason for this may in fact be that with the 
current affirmative action policies dealing with both the 
subject of race and gender, that what has happened is 
that a minority woman is in a sense a two-bagger for an 
employer.  If he hires or she hires a minority woman, 
that both improves the race makeup and improves the 
gender makeup, whereas a minority male is kind of a mixed 
bag.  He improves the race mix, but it comes at the 
expense of the gender mix, and I think for that reason 
there is a subtle inclination or pressure or tendency for 
some employers to favor minority women over minority men.

<p>

Lastly, let me say that as much as we might want 
to try to tackle this through public policy, I am not 
convinced that the problem can be turned around 
significantly by public policy means.  In fact, I am 
increasingly convinced that it is going to be churches 
and other community-based institutions that will help to 
turn this around.

<p>

We need to be encouraging leaders in religious 
institutions to deal with what I believe to be a rather 
casual attitude about divorce and remarriage in both 
their doctrinal teaching, as well as in their premarital 
counseling practices, whether or not they conduct those.  
I am extremely encouraged by this idea of having 
community marriage policies where all the ministers in a 
community agree that they will not marry someone until 
they have gone through premarital counseling.

<p>

I also think there needs to be greater emphasis, 
of course, at the practical level with marriage 
enrichment programs, and I think that there needs to be 
an emphasis on relationship building across generations.  
This is something that I think can be facilitated to a 
great extent by the church.

<p>

The couples that succeed are those who learn to 
resolve conflict.  It is not that they do not experience 
the same ups and downs and have the same sort of problems 
as everybody else.  It is that they manage to somehow 
work through their difficulties, to persevere, and to 
quite often come out on the other side of those problems 
with a stronger marriage, and I think in many ways some 
of the older couples in our communities and in our 
country have the opportunity to share with younger folks 
that sense of, hey, you can make it, stick it out, work 
through these things, and can perhaps strike that balance 
that is so needed where we hang onto our romantic ideals 
about what we want marriage to be while at the same time 
confronting the sober realities of how difficult it quite 
often is.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight
on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are looking at the drug crisis which
has crippled our nation, destroying communities and shattering
families.  Illicit drug use strangles the life out of many people,
and America desperately seeks solutions.  One of the newest answers
comes in the form of needle exchange programs in which drug users
who shoot up exchange used, often AIDS-tainted needles for sterile
needles.  Needle exchange programs claim to curb the spread of
the AIDS virus without encouraging drug abuse, but is that true?
Tonight, we will investigate.  You will want to hear what some
experts have to say about our continuing battle against drugs
and for lives.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Family Research Council's president,
Gary Bauer.  The political implications of character are news
this week, as analysts discuss what the Whitewater convictions
of Bill Clinton's friends will mean for his presidency.  With
years of political experience, Gary Bauer brings a special insight
into the power of the values and character issues.

<p>

Polls indicate that most Americans believe that our country
is on a downward spiral and that politicians are poor role models,
especially on moral issues.  Let's hear Gary's predictions on
where America's values are headed as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are here today on Behind the Headlines.
Thank you, Gary Bauer, very much for being with us.

<p>

Gary, we are talking about whether there is a future for
character and values issues today with the current political climate,
and you have been a champion of values issues for the last 20
years, but some people think that character and values issues
today are waning.

<p>

Do you agree?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I don't know.  There is good news and bad news.
I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming that the overwhelming
majority of the American people are worried about values related
issues.  I mean, that shows up in just about every poll you have.
You have two thirds of the country saying that we are headed
in the wrong direction, and when you press them on it, it usually
ends up being value related or issues related to virtue.

<p>

The bad news, however, is that there seems to be a disconnect
between that public concern and the political process.  The most
disturbing poll I have seen of all has just come out in the last
couple days by, I believe, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and it showed
that only 22 percent of the American people think that electing
someone of high moral character to the presidency is important.
Now I wonder whether that is an accurate poll or not.  If it
is accurate, that is a pretty disturbing sign in a country that
in the past grew up talking about George Washington cutting down
the cherry tree and Lincoln walking miles to return a library
book, and so forth, and it may be a sign of the fact that we have
really drifted a great deal in recent years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, it would appear that some of the cynicism
could be created by the media.  If you look back at Watergate
and at that as being a time in our nation where we said all our
politicians are crooks and liars, and now people are really taking
a lot of the attitudes that politicians are lying anyway.  Do
you see that as you go across the country, that people are assuming:
well, they are all liars, so I want to get the best liar I can
get.

<p>

MR. BAUER: That may be exactly what is at the heart of that
polling result.  I do go around the country a lot, and there is
incredible cynicism among the public.  Many times people are just
throwing up their hands and saying I give up; I have tried election
after election to find somebody that will represent my values;
I am always disappointed; it doesn't make any difference; I'm
just going to do the best I can in my home town in my neighborhood
and forget all these guys that are making all the promises to
me.

<p>

I think there is a sense in the public, too, that all politicians
do have a problem with the truth, and so why hold them up to an
unnaturally high standard by insinuating that you are only going
to elect people of high moral character?  I tend to become cynical
about these things, too, but I actually believe that there is
a difference in many races in the candidates.  I think you can
find people in both parties that have high moral character, and
I would urge my fellow Americans to not give up looking, because
it is too important to do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In past elections, personal character was a
powerful issue, and in fact, if you look at the Eisenhower race,
Eisenhower basically ran as I am the one who is the good guy,
who helped you all in World War II, so vote for me because of
who I am, not for what I stand for.  Character has really been
powerful, and yet today it seems that policy is all that counts.
We do not even look at character at all.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, yes, Eisenhower was the ultimate character
campaign, and I think Americans very distinctly and very intentionally
voted for somebody that they thought would bring a certain set
of character values into the Oval Office.  Today, I don't know,
there seems to be this disconnect.  In my view, for example --
I am not speaking about any particular politician; I'm just making
a general point -- if there is evidence that a politician can't
keep his promises to his own spouse, then the question that comes
to my mind is why in the world would I trust that politician to
keep their promises to me, somebody that the politician doesn't
even know?  He's made no legal or faith-based commitments to me
as a voter.  I think all those things about how a man or a woman
running for office, all the things in their personal life, do
end up sending us signals about what we can expect from them in
office.  There is a fine line about how much of this you actually
bring up in a campaign.  I don't think most Americans want their
personal lives debated, but on the other hand, I think we do want
to know the character of the individual that we are electing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You mentioned earlier, Gary, two stories that
really have marked the nation's psyche, stories about George Washington
saying I cannot tell a lie, or Abraham Lincoln and his tremendous
honesty and a character that we have all nationally admired, and
it seems that a lot of these stories have marked who we are as
a people, but are they still being taught to our children?  Are
they still having an impact on our national psyche?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, this may be one of the things right at
the heart of the problem.  When I was Undersecretary of Education
under Bill Bennett, one of the things we did was go back and look
at the textbooks in use in America's schools around the country,
and much to our shock, we found that those stories that you and
I grew up with and I would suspect most of our viewers grew up
with, are not in the textbooks anymore.  You can't find elementary
school textbooks that tell the George Washington story.  These
stories are now in some ways mocked and are considered to be a
part of legend, and the character-forming role that they played
with young people has been abandoned.  In fact, we went back and
looked for a couple of dozen things, things like the great sayings
from America's past -- I regret I have but one life to give for
my country, things like that.  Those all have been taken out of
American textbooks, and I think much to our detriment.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The character issue has played a very large
role with President Clinton in the various campaigns that have
been run against him, and it was interesting over Memorial Day
Weekend that some Medal of Honor winners took out full page advertising
chastising him for trying to hide behind his symbolic title of
commander in chief to get away from a sexual harassment suit,
and as one columnist said, he takes one character flaw, dodging
the draft, and highlights it in his attempts to dodge a second
character flaw, which would be alleged sexual proclivity.  Yet,
the character issue does not seem to stick to Bill Clinton.  A
lot of people are urging Bob Dole to make it an issue.  Do you
think that it is going to work?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, this is the question that George
Bush asked himself during an entire campaign.  The character issue
was a major focus of the Bush/Clinton campaign, and as we all
know, it did not work.  Bill Clinton won.  I can understand why
the Dole campaign wants to try to use the character issue now,
and maybe they will have more success with it, but I am afraid
there is not a lot of evidence, at least as of now, that this
is going to be a cutting edge issue for people.  I think character
is important.  I think politicians ought to talk about it and
continue to bring it up, but I think the Dole campaign is going
to have to find more than that if they hope to take care of the
rather large lead that Bill Clinton has opened up as of now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At one point in our nation's history, adultery
would in and of itself be a sufficient character issue to knock
you out.

<p>

MR. BAUER: No question about it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But today what would do that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I don't know. I mean, I am not sure there
is one single character issue that by itself would doom a candidate.
Certainly, people still get upset about financial matters, evidence
that a candidate has cheated on his income taxes or has played
fast and loose with the public's money.  Those things still seem
to strike a responsive chord.  But in matters of sexual mores
and in marriage and those kinds of issues, the country seems to
have gone pretty far down the road as being willing to ignore
those things in making judgments about who to elect to high public
office.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When it comes to candidate Dole, it is pretty
universally believed that he has phenomenal character, and obviously
he is scarred in the service for his country, and people do think
that he has character, but when it comes to the values issues,
people sometimes question whether he will really be a fighter
for them.  Do you think that his vice presidential candidate will
be a very key factor for him, because a lot of people are looking
to that appointment to send a statement about whether he will
be a fighter for values issues.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, first of all, let me just say about Senator
Dole that he is a dying breed in America, I think.  That is my
father's generation, and they were unique in their commitment
to their country, the sacrifices they were willing to make.  People
will have political disagreements with Senator Dole, but I think
they have to concede that there was a time when men like Senator
Dole were in the majority, and now as time passes, there seem
to be fewer and fewer people that would fit the description that
one comes up with when you look at Senator Dole's career.

<p>

On the other hand, you raise an interesting point. Senator
Dole has a reputation of being a grand compromiser and of cutting
the differences between the two sides.  Right now, I think what
Americans are looking for is somebody who will stick to their
guns and will be predictable on the kind of values they are willing
to speak up for, and because of that, I think the vice presidential
choice really is important.  I think Senator Dole needs to pick
somebody who has the same values and the same philosophy as he
does.  Otherwise, he is going to send the signal that he really
does not care that deeply about these issues; why else would you
pick someone as your running mate that disagreed with you on major
things.  So this is going to be an important decision for Senator
Dole, and I hope that he will defy the inside the beltway wisdom
on this and pick another solid conservative to be his running
mate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What values issues have a future in this election
in your estimation?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think where the values issues really
reach critical mass is when they touch on young people and what
it is we are teaching our children.  I think that any time that
Senator Dole can bring up America's youth, can talk about the
concern that I think Americans feel about where our children are
headed, the statistical evidence that something has gone seriously
wrong with how we are raising young people in the country -- those
are issues that I think are very important in the public mind.
I think it is why Bill Clinton tries to picture himself as often
as he can with children, why he has talked about getting tougher
on discipline in the schools.  He knows these issues strike a
bell with the American people, and this could be an issue that
would end up being very important before the election is over.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you once again for being with us
on <i>Straight Talk</i>'s Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: My pleasure, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight
Talk</i> begins our discussion about America's drug problem and
the validity of needle exchange programs as a solution.  Please
stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape following.]

<p>

MAN: I think there definitely is a drug problem in the United
States, basically because of the irresponsibility.  People want
to use them and want to use them how they want to do it, and it
basically just gets really out of control.

<p>

MAN: Drugs are just ruining our country.  I mean, the economic
structures behind drugs that I know of is astronomical.

<p>

WOMAN: See, I think there are a lot of problems with drugs
now that they are illegal.  I think a lot of people would take
it to an extreme if they were available.  I mean, people take
alcohol to an extreme right now, and I just think it would cause
more problems.  It is much more dangerous.

<p>

MAN: I just think legalizing drugs is going to maybe take
away the demand for it, but the violence is going to be there,
and it is just going to turn our society -- it is going to keep
going downhill.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: America's war on drugs has entered a new battleground,
with some using a deadly virus as their sword, and they are winning
some ground.  Needle exchange programs are cropping up in cities
across the nation.  Currently 75 needle exchange programs reside
in 55 U.S. cities, and these programs claim to save lives.  According
to a 1995 government-commissioned study, providing clean needles
to intravenous drug users slows the spread of the HIV virus. 
Yet, many experts, government officials, and addicts themselves
question these findings, and many of those questions arise from
the examples of other countries such as Switzerland, where needle
exchange programs were implemented, along with easy access to
clean intravenous drug paraphernalia through vending machines.

<p>

In Zurich, drug users were provided a safe haven in which
to obtain needles, known as needle park, which soon became a drug
orgy of sorts for addicts, providing 12,000 needles per day before
the park closed in 1992, because of the social decay it was causing
in the community.

<p>

The addicts then sought refuge in an abandoned railway station,
where 15,000 clean needles were exchanged daily.  In that environment,
attitudes toward drug use grew lax, making it easier for drugs
to become mainstream via legalization.

<p>

Yet problems with the drug culture did not go away.  Switzerland's
30,000 heroin addicts are the highest per capita rate in Europe,
and the Swiss have the second highest HIV infection rate.

<p>

It seems America has not learned from nations' experiments.
Will we pursue policies that make drug use easy, or will we build
successful rehabilitation programs?  Do drug overdoses with clean
needles justify so far failed attempts at reducing the spread
of the HIV virus?  Will federally funded needle exchange programs
pave the way for drug legalization?  These questions must be answered
before the drug war claims more lives, some of them even today.

<p>

MAN: We are losing the battle, and until the government
switches its playing ground and switches what it is really targeting,
we are going to continue to lose and eventually lose our children,
which is going to be the biggest loss.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: No one can ignore America's battle for lives,
and tonight I am joined by some real warriors:  Shepherd Smith,
the president and founder of Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy,
who researches effective AIDS treatment and compassionate care
for those infected with the virus; also here is Lieutenant Colonel
Robert Maginnis who serves as the Family Research Council's policy
expert on America's drug problems; and we are joined by Dr. Sally
Satel, who is a psychiatrist at the District of Columbia's Pretrial
Drug Treatment Program.  Welcome to all of you.

<p>

It is certainly a dark setup piece, but I think the question
that a lot of people are asking is is there a growing drug problem
in America, because you are seeing some nightly news reports to
indicate that it is not really the issue that we all thought.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, since 1979 we have cut the number
of people in this country that are routinely abusing drugs in
half, but now since 1990 and 1991, the number of especially marijuana
users is up, and we are not really sure if that is going to lead
to an increase in heroin.  The heroin numbers are up, too, but
we are still waiting to find out if that is going to be a long-term
effect.  So we really need to come back and reexamine the things
we did well in the early 1980s to begin to turn this around. 
Clearly there is a problem, and it is an ongoing problem.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Shepherd, you have been working with this for
a while.  You know, in terms of evaluating what was successful,
what do you think was successful?

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, one reason numbers are down, HIV has claimed
a lot of lives of IV drug users.  The area of concern is young
people is where we are seeing the greatest growth today in new
drug use.  Programs that are successful are ones that show individuals
who are addicted to drugs that someone cares about them, that
there is an opportunity for them in the future if they make corrections
in their life today.  Programs that simply support the behavior
and affirm that behavior really have not shown to be effective
that we have seen.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You are working with pretrial drug treatment,
Dr. Satel.  What are you finding about drug use?  Is it going
down, and if not, why not?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, we have a waiting list that is as long
as you can imagine.  I happen to work with patients who are in
the inner city, so I believe in that group there probably has
not been much of a decline ever in the last decade or so.  The
people I work with are those who come from backgrounds where parents
were addicted.  Often they do not know their father, and their
mother was involved with drugs.  When you have patients who will
tell you, no, I don't do cocaine -- a lot of those people do marijuana,
PCP, and some heroin, but when their reason for not doing cocaine
is because they saw what it did to their mother, you know you
are dealing with a very, very compromised group of people here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that it is the loss of life that
has resulted in slightly lower numbers, or do you think that it
is the loss of maybe yuppie users, because you are saying the
inner city is staying the same.

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, I am saying in my population, yes, it has
stayed the same.  So I do not see any particular influence in
terms of drug use as a whole.  I do think that the crack epidemic
may actually be waning a bit in the inner city; again, you could
say there is almost a self-limiting effect, when one generation
sees how the previous generation has been devastated.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, but as the crack epidemic wanes,
we are finding a growth in the methamphetamine epidemic that is
moving from the West Coast here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And for people who do not know what that is, Bob?

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: That is speed, basically.  You know,
it is manufactured here in the United States, so you don't really
have to ship it in like you do from Columbia cocaine. So there
is a very serious problem.

<p>

But going back, the mixture that we saw on the setup where
you have AIDS, an emotionally charged virus that is impacting
throughout the country, and we mix that with heroin or needle
users, you know, just a complex issue but a very frightening issue,
and we saw the situation in Switzerland, and there they were giving
out needles.  They were giving 15,000 needles a day in Latin Park[?]
there in Zurich before they shut the place down.  It was a madhouse.
I mean, there were murders.  The police would come in.  They
would turn over the cars.  There were all sorts of problems. 
Well, in this country today there is a movement to try to place
needle exchange programs in virtually every city where there is
a problem with AIDS and needle exchange.  After all, where do
most of these programs take place?  They take place in the inner
city that Sally is talking about.  They take place where you have
a high incidence of HIV.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. But why not?  Why not needle exchange?
I mean, what the needle exchange people are arguing is that if
I am exchanging dirty needles with people who already do drugs
-- I am not encouraging drug use, but what I am doing is at least
cutting down the risk of AIDS.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, that is what they are going to
tell you, but the evidence -- you know, we have gone through the
studies.  In the National Academy of Science, they acknowledge
-- a couple of physicians; there are only two, two of the three
MDs on the study -- they say, look, it is not the panacea that
it is being made out to be.  There are problems.  The best solution
for this problem is to provide treatment for people who are on
drugs.  If we get them off drugs, they are not going to come down
with HIV because they have been using dirty needles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So at the very least, needle exchange is not
an anti-drug program.  I mean, at the very least, it is not trying
to stop drug use.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Not at all, and in fact, you can give a clean
needle to an addict, and it really does not stop the transmission
of HIV if they go out and share that with another infected individual.
The message has to be don't share your works, and you do not
need to give out any equipment to give that message.  But where
the programs probably have an effect is establishing a relationship
with people who use drugs, and they feel that someone cares about
them, and they are more inclined to listen to what they say about
not having sex with somebody who is infected, not sharing needles,
and in that context they have a value, but it is really independent
of the fact that they give out clean needles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Shepherd, you have been working with AIDS and
HIV for years.  You are well-known for this issue.  Do you see
any reason to read needle exchange programs as successful in terms
of decreasing actual AIDS/HIV, and following up your comment about
death?

<p>

MR. SMITH: We really have not seen evidence that is substantive
in respect to the value of needle exchange programs and reducing
HIV infection rates.  What we are concerned about is there is
a basic logic or illogic, if you will, in the AIDS community that
says affirm people where they are, meaning don't say anything
negative about their behavior, if they are having multiple sexual
partners or if they are using drugs or they are into all sorts
of different sexual activities.  You know, affirm them where they
are.  So what needle exchange does is it does not warn the individual
that the behaviors they are participating in are very harmful
to them, and we think that honesty is a good policy, that you
ought to, you know, lay the cards on the table and say this is
your life, you can have a good future, but what you are doing
is destructive and you need to eliminate that activity if you
really want to have a fulfilling life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is not just the needles.

<p>

MR. SMITH: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to talk about this more. <i>Straight
Talk</i> brings you more after this commercial break.  Don't go
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing two of America's
tragedies:  drug addiction and AIDS.  Here to explain whether
needle exchange programs can positively affect these problems
is Shepherd Smith, president of Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV
Policy; Lieutenant Colonel Robert Maginnis, a senior policy analyst
at the Family Research Council; and Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist
who works for effective treatment with drug addicts.  Welcome
back.

<p>

We were discussing needle exchange programs before, and there
are a lot of things that people are attempting to get better behavior.
Like there is crime attached to drugs, and there is AIDS attached
to drugs, and yet some people argue that we are moving toward
legalization by some of these programs.  Do you see needle exchange
programs as being positive in terms of legalizing drugs?

<p>

MR. SMITH: They certainly contribute to the idea that drug
use is okay.  I mean, if the government is going to sponsor programs
to help addicts participate in this destructive behavior, then
it can't be all that bad.  Unfortunately for young people, we
haven't heard from this administration, we haven't heard from
any leaders, that these behaviors are harmful, and we are seeing
just dramatic increases, not just in marijuana use but smoking,
as well, tobacco.  They all interrelate.  Fortunately, in respect
to sexual activity among young people, we have seen maybe a peak.
It can't get much higher, but maybe we are going to turn the
corner soon.  But clearly the message of needle exchange is detrimental
to young people and their attitudes about drug usage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see, Doctor, in your program?
People come in and they are obviously addicts.  Are you attempting
in terms of treatment to say drug use has got to stop, or are
we talking about facilitating them and making them better drug
users, like better alcohol users or better smokers?

<p>

DR. SATEL: No, we are saying drug use has got to stop.
Now remember, the population that I am working with are people
who have committed crimes.  So they are in a drug court, and actually
they have been given a choice by the judge.  You go to jail or
you go to treatment.  Believe it or not, some of them actually
choose jail, but of those who come to treatment, no, they get
urine tested twice, three times a week.  We are very strict about
an abstinence policy, and actually we are seeking in these people
for more than just stopping drug use.  We really want to resocialize
them.  We want to make them into citizens again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In terms of some of the other gateway programs
related to AIDS and drugs, some people -- needle exchange and
also giving people drugs so that they won't commit crimes, so
here are free drugs three times a day; we are seeing that in Sweden.
Do you see any reason to believe from your population that giving
needles or giving free drugs will have any positive social effects?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Kristi, we give drugs in a sense.  We give methadone.
That is a substitute for heroin, and while I think those programs
can do a lot of good, they do reduce the commission of crime by
people who are in methadone programs, there is less AIDS transmission
of people who are in methadone programs, but about 60 percent
of people in methadone programs in New York City use cocaine,
and I actually think -- I would like to know your impression of
this, but a methadone program that I once worked at in Connecticut,
I thought that they had a fairly high threshold for dismissing
people from the program when they broke the rules, the rules being
that they used other drugs or they committed crime, and I think
the reason that the threshold was higher was because they wanted
to protect them from transmitting HIV and from contracting it.
So I think it has actually changed the profile of methadone programs,
HIV.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As in encouraging methadone use or crack cocaine
use or cocaine use?

<p>

DR. SATEL: I think it has changed the standards of acceptable
behavior in methadone programs where a patient might be dismissed,
might be said, listen, you have to leave our program if you are
going to commit crimes or use other drugs, but I think now there
may be less momentum to do that because the programs are concerned
about having people on the street now using dirty needles.  At
least before they were using the methadone and there was some
degree of safety and supervision.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like, Bob, we are substituting one
pathology for another in many ways.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, I certainly agree with that assessment.
You started off by asking about what is happening in our culture
in regard to maybe legalization.  The analogous situation that
we saw in Switzerland, this year they have an election to decide
whether or not to legalize drugs.  Now they did not start off
with that.  They started off incrementally with needle exchange
programs, with heroin programs.  They give some methadone, but
they have heroin programs, with people in jail, they give them
heroin, with people in the streets that they come in every day
and up to nine times a day they get their free heroin shots. 
And those types of programs have really facilitated a change of
attitude in the culture about drugs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In what way, Bob?  Explain that.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, they look at the problem, they
say it is out of our control, we might as well facilitate this.
You know, now they want to put drug addicts, heroin addicts,
repairing cars.  One company bragged a couple months ago that
this is the way we ought to go.  There were 94 executives of the
largest Swiss companies that came out in a public statement and
said, look, we give up on this.  We want drugs legalized.  We
think the government ought to be involved in facilitating this.
We want to reintegrate drug addicts back into the culture.  Then
companies stood up and said this is what we need to do.  So our
concern with needle exchange programs, which have yet to demonstrate
that they truly reduce HIV contraction and at the same time do
not increase drug abuse, is that if we open up the floodgates
that we will never be able to put the genie back in the bottle.
It is a scary situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that I have noticed is that often
the people talking about legalizing drugs ironically and even
sadly have drug problems in their own families.  I mean, Surgeon
General Joycelyn Elders is a good and sad example of that, her
own son being convicted of drug use.  Are you seeing that that
is one of the realities of the legalization discussion, that it
is people saying, look, so much is out of control, forget it.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, when you find one pathology, you
are liable to find another.  You know, where there are drug problems,
there are also crime problems, there are also out-of-wedlock birth
problems.  You know, all sorts of problems kind of rotate around
the same types of issues.  I don't know.  It is one of the most
gripping problems we are faced with.  I was with Senator Thompson
just a week ago, and we were trying to figure out -- you know,
the senator from Tennessee -- we were trying to figure out what
to do about the juvenile problem in this country, and we are about
to explode with violence that we have never seen before.  It is
tied into the drug issue.  It is tied into a lot of the things
that are going on in the culture.  Frankly, we are not sure, but
what we do know, based so far on these studies, is that this is
not the panacea that it has been made out to be.  We do not need
to expand the horizons of needle exchange programs and follow
a course where the Swiss have already tread.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about one minute left.  Dr. Satel,
could you address that really quickly?  Are we seeing that tracking
with family histories, that drug use is a family problem that
goes generation to generation?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Again, the patients that I am seeing, very much
so.  In fact, sadly in many cases the whole family is involved
with drugs at some time, but I should also add that sometimes
having a history of substance abuse in one's family accounts for
some very passionate advocacy, as well.  So I think it cuts both
ways, often to our advantage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is really powerful, especially in some
of the new public service announcements out.  There are some very
vocal advocates.

<p>

We are going to talk more about this when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns.  We will hear more about America's drug problem and the
possible solutions.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking to experts in
the fields of drugs and HIV/AIDS policies.  Here tonight are Shepherd
Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Maginnis, and Dr. Sally Satel.
Welcome back.

<p>

Shepherd, you were talking earlier that these experts that
have been giving us sometimes bad drug policy advice or AIDS advice,
they have a lot of factors working in their own lives.  Maybe
you could explain that a little.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, the curious thing that I have found going
to international AIDS conferences and national HIV conferences
and so on is that the experts really do not want to address fundamental
problems, because they participate in a lot of the behaviors that
put people at risk in the first place.  For example, the biggest
predictor of a sexually-transmitted disease -- and HIV is an STD
-- is numbers of partners.  Yet, you cannot say at an AIDS meeting
that promiscuity is a bad thing, that having lots of partners
is a harmful behavior.  You would be ridiculed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why?  I mean, that seems obvious.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Because all of the experts have participated
in that behavior.  The same thing with the use of drugs.  Many
of these people are the product of the drug and sex revolutions
of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  They experimented with drugs.
They did not become addicted themselves.  So they really don't
see any negative side to the use of drugs, particularly recreational
use.

<p>

Consequently, we often go back to affirming people where
they are.  It is okay to participate in that behavior as long
as you do it safely.  So that is why clean needles, condoms, and
dental dams are the answers that these folks have to this epidemic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than giving our youth a clear message
about sex, about drugs, and maybe even about alcohol.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Sure, absolutely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let me ask you then, following up on that,
Dr. Satel, we are saying that some people have used drugs and
haven't had a bad experience, and so they are not appreciating
that others can't deal with it.  I mean, are you finding that,
that drugs and alcohol are more parallel than we thought?

<p>

DR. SATEL: I think there is an enormous arrogance, actually,
among people who have managed to use these drugs and luckily for
them, in a sense, haven't succumbed.  They are highly dangerous,
as you know, and I see firsthand people who have just abdicated
their life to this.  I mean, when you have a mother who abandons
their child in a car because of crack cocaine, I mean, a maternal
instinct is a pretty hard thing to break, but somehow a drug can
saw its way through that.  I mean, this is not recreational use,
and it is certainly not a romanticized addiction to heroin.  This
is devastating.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And yet people aren't willing to treat it in
a devastating way.

<p>

Why do you think, Bob?  I mean, why have we got this disconnect
between playful drugs and the fact that people will sell their
own children, as we saw recently in the news, a woman who sold
her children to a drug dealer to pay off a debt?

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, there are tragic situations all
over.  The general perception is that the risk associated with
marijuana or alcohol or any of the other drugs is not that bad,
and if you track the national surveys of mostly teenagers, you
find that the risk assessment just keeps going down.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Their attitudes toward the risk.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, their attitude about the risk associated
with consuming these things.  Why?  Because our leaders in our
country have not been beating the drums that this is bad for you,
and the parents have in many cases come out of the 1960s where
they have been abusers themselves, and they have a guilty conscience
about it, and they just are not going to stand up there and tell
that young man or young woman that this is going to kill you,
it is going to ruin your life, and this is my experience.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Clinton Administration has come under criticism
for weakening the message on drugs, for firing a lot of people
in the Office of Drug Policy, and Just Say No might have been
simple -- it wasn't the only part of the program, but it certainly
was a clear signal.

<p>

Shepherd, do you see some of these changes?

<p>

MR. SMITH: Absolutely. The Clinton Administration deserves
all the criticism on this issue it can get.  It devastated the
National AIDS Policy Office.  It has not spoken out to say that
these behaviors are harmful.  You know, it is so politically correct.
One of the words you cannot use in PC is normal, because that
implies that there is abnormal behavior, and so we can't say anything
negative then about behaviors that are harmful, and with our hands
tied under political correctness, we have not been able to talk
about values in respect to how children, young people, should
live.  We haven't been able to articulate relationships, what
I am obligated to you in a community to do and what obligations
you have to me, to help each other, to pick each other up, to
point out failures and to then correct our ways.  We can't do
any of those things.  So we are letting young people make decisions
that adults have difficulty making.  I mean, it is a horrible
situation, and this administration bears a great deal of the 
responsibility of where we are today.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This administration, Dr. Satel, has focused
a lot on things like considering needle exchange and considering
any garden variety of segue program, rather than strictly dealing
with how do we get out.  You are an expert in that.  What programs
work in terms of getting people out?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, speaking of the administration for a second,
I would like to note that they also cut the budget for treatment
programs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So they cut the policy arm and the treatment
arm both.

<p>

DR. SATEL: Yes, they did.  Meanwhile, we may be regulating
tobacco, which gives a very bizarre message.  That is a potent
irony.  But there are programs that do work, programs that frankly
I think could work better.  For example, actually, the program
that I am involved in, which is tied in with the court system,
I think is very powerful, because it has real sanctions and a
real accountability for the individuals that are going through
it.  As I mentioned, we get urine tests, and then there are other
kinds of consequences if patients do not comply.  But there are
other kinds of treatment, and they depend on the severity of use.
I do wish we had more residential treatment programs.  There
are only about 15,000 beds in the country, and according to ONDCP,
we have something like 2 million hard-core addicts.  Now admittedly
I don't think every one of them needs a bed in a residential treatment
program, but I would say a good proportion of them do, and those
programs are long-term.  They are 18 to 24 months.  Phoenix House
is an excellent model.  It really rebuilds people.  It does not
see addiction so much as a disease but as a symptom of a disordered
life that needs --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Let's just have you comment on that quickly,
the idea that addictions are diseases versus maybe disorder or
lack of self-control or whatever.  Has that affected this problem?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, I think there is a lot of rhetoric about
addiction being a brain disease in fact, and while I concur wholeheartedly
that of course a drug is a toxic substance and it works on the
substrate of one's brain, so of course there are neurobiological
components to addiction, especially of course tolerance, where
you need more drug to get the same effect, and withdrawal.  Those
are clearly mediated through the central nervous system, but why
people start to use drugs in the first place and why they relapse
after months, sometimes years in fact, of being clean, that is
not something that is neurobiologically motivated.  That is a
much more complicated psychological process, and I think we underestimate
that by calling this a brain disease.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You get the last word, Shepherd.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, personal responsibility has to come back
into the vocabulary, and good programs need a spiritual element
to them to really show people that there is hope, that there is
a greater being that can help them through this, and that they
do have a future.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank you all for being with
us.  As always, Bob has been a kingpin in bringing a great team
together.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares how today's culture
influences choices regarding drug use.  Don't go away.

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. We now bring you a clip from CNN's <i>Showbiz
Today</i>, which looks at efforts to legalize and glamorize marijuana.
FRC's David Chamberlin gave his opinion on this phenomenon,
and we now share it with you on Homefront News.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: If you are weeding through the record store this
weekend, you might want to check out Hempilation[?].  It is a
new tribute album of sorts to the joys of pot smoking.  Some talented
musicians participated in the project.  Ron Tagg[?] reports their
work has ignited quite a controversy.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: At a New York party, Capricorn Records launches
the controversial new album, Hempilation, a CD that celebrates
the use of marijuana.  Groups such as the Black Crows, Blues Traveler,
and Cypress Hill sing the praises of pot on this new compilation
album.  Royalties from the sale of the CD will benefit NORMAL,
the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.  The
group wants to decriminalize marijuana for medical, recreational,
and industrial purposes.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight we're going to ask some tough questions about sex and sexual 
politics. Does it matter whether people engage in heterosexual or homosexual 
sex? What does the research reveal?
<p>
Family Research Council examines a broad spectrum of issues
that affect families today.  One of the most controversial is
homosexuality.  Today homosexuals and lesbian activists are a
powerful force in government and in the media worldwide.  At the
heart of the debate is an effort to change the historical definition
of family, from that foundational unit bound by marriage, blood,
and adoption to any kind of relationship.
<p>
Tonight's show will focus on the current status of the homosexual agenda. 
In particular, we will look at the United States armed forces, which was 
highlighted in a key court battle just yesterday.  But more about that 
later in the show.
<p>
First, let's hear what Gary Bauer, president of the
Family Research Council, has to say about another critical issue
featured in the news during the past few weeks:  Bosnia.  Could
President Clinton's peacekeeping mission shape the world's future
in a drastic way?  Gary Bauer provides you with his perspective,
unedited by the media, as he takes you behind the headlines. 
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This week one of the biggest news items is Bosnia.  What 
pitfalls do you see for the President and the nation in the Bosnia conflict?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, you know, Harry Truman had said a long time ago,
&quot;The buck stops here,&quot; meaning the Presidency.  Bill
Clinton ought to be aware of the fact that it is very easy as
commander-in-chief to commit American soldiers in all sorts of
places.  It is very hard to extricate them with honor once you've
gotten them in a fix.
<p>
If you put 20,000 or 30,000 men on the ground in Bosnia, and a year 
from now there isn't peace, then getting out of Bosnia while maintaining 
the credibility of the United States is going to be very tough; and at that 
point the American people, I believe, and public opinion generally will 
turn on the President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that this will bring the
women-in-combat issue to a head again here in the United States
debate?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  It will raise the women-in-combat issue again.
 I have noticed that almost every press story filed in the last
couple of weeks manages to show a woman in uniform.  I think,
if you have women in the service on the ground in Bosnia who end
up dying in combat or dying in accidents or become the targets
of terrorists, that you could have another whole debate in the
country about the appropriate role of women in combat, which is
a debate, I think, that is long overdue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the Bosnia debate, do you think that 
Americans will be more in favor or less in favor of women in combat?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think, long term, Americans are going to be in favor of the
ability of women to join the military and serve in support positions.
 But I think once Americans see young women, their daughters,
coming home in body bags, whether it is in Bosnia or the Middle
East or some future conflict that we are not aware of, I believe
at that point public opinion will turn against this idea of complete
equality in combat of women and men.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Another big news item internationally is Ireland and the 
divorce debate. What do you think will happen to Ireland now that they have 
approved divorce by a very narrow margin?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, if I were Ireland, I certainly would hesitate before I 
would go down the road that the rest of the West has taken in the last 30 
years. No-fault divorce was hailed in the United States 20 years ago as a 
great advance.  What now we know looking back on it is that no-fault
divorce has resulted in a lot of abandoned women and children.
 And it is harder to get out of a contract with a lawn service
company than it is to get out of a contract with your spouse.
<p>
I think Ireland made a mistake.  That was a very narrow vote.
 The other interesting thing about that vote is that every major
political party in Ireland, every major newspaper, supported liberalizing
the divorce laws.  And yet with all of the establishment saying,
&quot;Vote yes,&quot; only barely half of the country voted that
way.  Half of the country had no representation whatsoever.
<p>
So I think there are still a lot of traditional-values people in
countries like Ireland, certainly here in the United States, and
I think that we still have a chance of seeing a rebirth of traditional
values, in contrast to the vote that took place.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Family Research Council released a poll where the number 
one finding was that people believe that because of the moral decline,
the country is in real trouble.  There is a very tragic story
about a woman who sold her son because of a $2,000 drug debt.
 What do you think this situation says about the direction America
is headed?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, this is the outrage of the week,
right?  I mean, almost every week, there is some horrific story
that, just a few years ago, would have been unimaginable.  The
week before this, it was the story out of Illinois about these
thugs literally cutting a baby out of a woman that they murdered.
 Before that, you had Susan Smith sending her children to the
bottom of the lake.
<p>
You know, people come with all kinds of explanations.
 Some people say it's government programs causing these things.
 Other people say it's heartless social policies, or it's poverty
or whatever.  I don't believe it's any of those things.  I think
it is evidence -- all these things are evidence of a country that
has drifted away from its basic belief in God and from a basic
embrace of traditional values.
<p>
Now, when a culture does that, all through history, whether it was ancient 
Rome or ancient Greece or America in 1995, there's a terrible price to pay, 
and we're paying that price now.  Hopefully, Americans will see these things
and rethink the trends of the last 30 years.  But for now, we
are going to continue to reap a terrible whirlwind of tragedy,
family breakup, and horrors that we are already beginning to see
on a daily basis in the newspapers.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Anthony 
Falzarano, a former homosexual who has devoted his life to ministering to 
the homosexual community.  Stay with us as Anthony brings us his perspective
on the cultural struggle taking place.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  For thousands of years, homosexuality has been discouraged
in cultures the world over.  Experience, common sense, and considerable
medical evidence show that homosexuality is immoral, unhealthy,
and destructive to individuals, families, and societies.
<p>
So why is America seeing homosexual activism on so many levels?  Why
are homosexuals featured on network TV comedies?  Why are homosexuals
featured on news broadcasts and in newspapers and magazines all
over America?  Why are they so loudly pressing for gay marriage,
gay adoption of children, gays in the military, and special civil
rights?
<p>
The short answer is that this did not happen by accident.
 Gay activists have waged a 40-year campaign to change the culture,
aided by a willing media.
<p>
In 1948 and in 1953, Alfred Kinsey released his famous Kinsey reports on 
male and female homosexuality. Kinsey made the case that homosexuality was 
widespread and not much different from normal sexuality.
<p>
In 1950 the first American homosexual activist group, the Medishien(?) 
Society, was formed. Citing Kinsey and producing many unscientific but 
well-publicized studies about homosexuals, activists began working to change the
moral consensus about homosexuality.
<p>
In the 1950s, UCLA psychologist Evelyn Hooker did three studies comparing a 
group of 30 homosexual men with 30 heterosexual men.  Although that study 
showed clear psychological differences, gay activists and the media have 
misreported the studies as showing that somehow homosexuality is normal.
<p>
The next big steppingstone came in 1973.  After a campaign of intimidation,
the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from
its list of disorders.  The gay lobby within the APA is now trying
to criminalize psychological therapy for those seeking to leave
the lifestyle.
<p>
At the same time, aggressive lobbying extended to more than just organizations. 
It became political, at the grass roots, city by city, state by state. Sodomy 
laws have been swept from the books in more than 25 states.  Gay rights laws
have been passed in nine states and in more than 100 cities. 
Gays are bringing court cases seeking to adopt children, to marry,
and to serve in the military.
<p>
MILITARY OFFICER:  The military's policy on homosexuality does a great 
injustice to the thousands of military personnel who are highly trained, 
dedicated, loyal, and who also happen to be gay.  This policy must be changed 
now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In all of these efforts, activists have employed
a flood of bad studies which we can only call gay science.  Here
are the claims:
<p><ul>
<li>Ten percent of the population is homosexual.
<li>Homosexuality is genetic.
<li>Gays comprise a third of all youth suicides.
<li>Gays are a major target of hate crimes.
</ul><p>
Although none of these has been verified by reliable science, media 
reports have persuaded many people that they have.
<p>
Last week an activist group -- Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and 
Gays -- launched a $1 million advertising campaign to vilify people who 
oppose the homosexual agenda.  The TV ads feature scenes of gays being
beaten, with the image changing to the face of Pat Robertson,
Jerry Falwell, and other opponents of homosexual activism.
<p>
The intent is to say that anyone opposing gay activism directly causes
hateful physical attacks on gays.  The intent is to silence all
critics.
<p>
Homosexual and lesbian activists have made it clear in
recent days that they are in this fight to change the world --
from one that values and cherishes home, family, and heterosexual
marriage as the cornerstone of society to one that says anything
goes.
<p>
With us tonight is Anthony Falzarano, executive director
of Transformation Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Anthony himself
has been transformed after rejecting a long-time homosexual lifestyle,
and he is here to bring you his testimony and practical insights
regarding today's homosexual community.
<p>
Thank you very much for joining us, Anthony.  You are working with an 
excellent organization and running an excellent group here in Washington, 
D.C., that works with homosexuals, talking to them about what's true. 
There are a lot of messages out there.  What do you see as some of the
biggest pieces of propaganda in the homosexual debate today?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Oh, the number one piece of propaganda that is being
pushed on America today is that people are born gay and that there
is a genetic predisposition to homosexuality, and that is not
true.  There is nothing out there, Kristi, that proves that. 
There is not one bit of information.
<p>
I am a former homosexual. I was gay for nine years until I came to Christ 
and got help from a national organization called Exodus International, and
they helped me leave the gay lifestyle behind successfully.  I
am now married and I have two children, and I have been married
for 12 years, and I am living proof that you are not born gay.
 We are currently helping about 6,000 former homosexuals within
the ex-gay network.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And from your experience both inside and out of the lifestyle, 
do you see an aggressive, or more aggressive, push today, or have you seen 
an accumulation of efforts to bring us to the place where we are, especially 
like, for example, in the military?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, the gays in general, they are highly organized.  They 
are much more organized than the church in America.  They are much more 
organized than our government.  They are real grass roots.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Why is that?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's real simple.  They don't typically
have wives and children to go home to at night, and they can work
14, 15 hours a day, and they are very organized and very determined,
and they are fighting for their lives right now.
<p>
In the military, with the Clinton Administration now, they are just getting 
license to push homosexuality into the military.  They have been in the
military for years, and they have been underground, thank God,
but now with the Clinton Administration they are just coming out
of the closet in the military, and we are heading for a disaster.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You actually were part of some of the efforts to
talk to the American Psychiatric Association.  Do you see that
as being in recent history one of the more disastrous changes
that took place?  Because what it said was, We're going to now
say that this is just a normal condition.  You actually went there
recently.  What has been your involvement with that, and what
have you found?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, what is really under attack
is authority in this country.  Basically, the American Psychiatric
Association, in 1993, was lobbied by the gay activists, the insurance
industry in our country, to push homosexuality out of the DSM-III,
which is the official digest of psychological disorders.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What's in it for them, though?  Why do you think they would 
do something like that?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's real simple.  Basically, if they want gay rights, 
and if they can erase from the books that homosexuality is a neurosis, 
that it is a disturbance, then they can claim that they actually are a 
minority, that they are actually born this way, and, as if you are a woman 
or a Jewish person or a Catholic, that you should be able to be protected
under our Constitution.  That is their motivation.
<p>
What happened was, the reason the American Psychiatric Association was 
lobbied by the insurance industry is because if you go for sexual 
reorientation counseling, it takes six months to two years to walk out of 
homosexuality successfully, and we are talking maybe $100 a session.  You 
are talking about $10,000 by the time somebody walks out of homosexuality.
<p>
If they give gay affirmative counseling, that is six or seven
sessions with a psychologist or a psychologist --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To tell you that you're fine.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: -- to tell you you're fine, there's nothing wrong with you; 
you went to the gay lifestyle.
<p>
Well, that happened in 1973.  Now it is blowing up in the insurance industry's 
face because now, before somebody dies of AIDS, they are spending about 
$250,000 a patient before this person dies of AIDS.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When you're looking at talking with a person who is in a 
homosexual lifestyle, in particular, I understand you are talking about 
sexual identity disorder, that there are roots to homosexuality and lesbianism 
inside of a person in their life.  What is sexual identity disorder?  What are 
you seeing?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, 80 percent of the people that come
to Transformation Ministries in Washington, D.C., have been sexually
molested and/or raped as children.  We see that.  We take an informal
poll every six months, and the data is accurate.  It keeps coming
up constant, somewhere between 70 to 80 percent.
<p>
We see the male homosexual did not bond with his father.  We see the lesbian 
did not bond with the mother.  So we see non-bonding with the same-sex
parent over and over again.  We see high levels of divorce, high
levels of alcoholism, very, very dysfunctional family situations.
<p>
I don't know why this is not being reported to the media, other
than there is a 6,000-member gay journalists' organization now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  You know, the gays are in control in Hollywood; they are in 
control of television; they are in key positions at the <i>Washington 
Post</i> now; and they watch everything that is coming into the newspaper 
or television and radio, and they are editing it out.
<p>
A reporter from the <i>Washington Post</i> came to our ministry six years 
ago. He wanted to do a story on us.  After the meeting, he said, 
&quot;This is fantastic. This is news.  We're going to do a story in the 
<i>Post</i> on it.&quot;
<p>
He calls me the next morning.  He says, &quot;Anthony, 
I hate to tell you this, but we can't do the story.&quot;  And I said,
&quot;What happened in the last 12 hours?  You were so excited
last night.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: He said, &quot;My editor's a lesbian, and she killed the 
story.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There is a lot of one-sided telling of the story of
homosexuality and lesbianism as we have researched, at Family
Research Council, the literature.  One of the big projects that
we did was the Ten Percent Project, which took a look at the research,
the good research which said 1 to 2 percent of the population
was gay at best compared to 10 to 20 that the homosexuals were
talking about.
<p>
One of the things that is missing today, though, is an analysis of the 
good scientific data on homosexuality and lesbianism.  What are you seeing? 
I know we are seeing a repetitive message that it's genetic.  What's your 
answer to the &quot;it's genetic&quot; statement?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's an absolute lie that comes from the pit of hell. 
Basically, we are seeing many people come through Exodus and walk successfully 
out of a homosexual disorientation.  We see them going on to marriage.  We see 
them having children.  We see them out of the lifestyle 10, 15, 20
years.  I have been out of the lifestyle totally now for 12 years.
 I mean, it's doable.  It's hard.  It's the equivalent of coming
off of heroin.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What does it take?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: I mean, you are really turning your life totally over to 
Jesus Christ to realize that you need this higher power -- and I call
my higher power Jesus Christ -- to walk successfully out of a
lifestyle that basically permeates your entire being.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it is more than like a 12-step program.  To leave the 
lifestyle does require that looking outside of yourself.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes, finding out the root causes, what happened to you as 
a child; putting together a puzzle of dysfunction in your early upbringing;
finding out what happened with the relationship between you and
your same-sex parent; submitting your fleshly addictions.  Many
homosexuals are addicted to pornography, masturbation, promiscuous
sex.
<p>
I mean, I had a guy in the ministry who had sex with over
5,000 partners, and he was 32 years old.  Now, that is an extreme.
 Many people that come to Transformation and Exodus-type ministries
have never had a sexual encounter, just suffer with the fantasy
and pornography part of it.
<p>
We help all kinds of people.  We help people who are prostitutes, who are 
homosexual prostitutes. But what we see over and over again -- sexual 
addiction, sexual molestation early in youth, and we see brokenness with 
the same-sex parent and great, great dysfunction in the family unit, the 
upbringing.
<p>
And the devil is attacking the family.  He is trying to destroy
the family now, and we must keep our families together.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And that's at the heart of it, isn't it?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's an attack on the family. Today it would seem
that what we are doing is we are looking at redefining the family
to include anything that a person might be involved in.
<p>
But for someone that wants more information about your organization, could
you give us a couple of phone numbers?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes, absolutely. I think the Exodus number will be appearing 
on the screen. But we are in San Raphael, California, the national ministry 
called Exodus.  It is area code 415 454-1017.  Transformation in Washington
is area code 202 371-0800.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And for someone who wants a little bit more information, Anthony, 
what would you say to the person who is -- we've got just a couple of seconds 
left -- who is considering a homosexual lifestyle and wonders if they're
gay?  In 15 seconds, what would you say to that person?  &quot;What
if I'm gay?&quot;
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Don't believe the lie. Yes, you are struggling with a 
homosexual disorientation. But think of yourself as a man or woman struggling 
with homosexuality disorientation; don't think of yourself as gay.  There is 
quite a distinction between being homosexual and gay.  Homosexual means I 
suffer with this. Gay means coming out of the closet.  Before you come out
of the closet, get some help from Exodus International.  You don't
have to be gay.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for being with us, Anthony.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss a pivotal
and possibly historic event which occurred just yesterday as the
Family Research Council presented evidence denouncing the involvement
of homosexuals in the military in a court case.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  December 5, 1995, could be recognized
as a significant date in the battle over homosexuals serving openly
in the military.  On this date the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>
was heard before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Virginia.  Family Research Council was granted permission, in
an unprecedented decision, to present oral arguments along with
the Justice Department in this case over the dismissal of Navy
Lieutenant Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified homosexual.
<p>
LT. THOMASSON: This policy that tells gay and lesbian service members
that they can go in harm's way for their country but that they
can't &quot;come out&quot; and try to dispel the stereotypes or
overcome the prejudice with which they suffer is absolutely inimical
to the very Constitution that they've all sworn to defend.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  He is one of several servicemen who has highlighted
problems with the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; standard.
<p>
Within days of coming to office, the Clinton Administration began
promoting homosexuals and lesbians for open service in the military,
despite a long military history that barred such service because
of its impact on military order and effectiveness.
<p>
In 1993, Congress passed a clear law that prohibited homosexuals and 
lesbians from serving.  But the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations were written to implement the law, and they made the standard
unclear, some say deliberately so, to encourage lawsuits that
attack the law itself.
<p>
ACLU SPOKESWOMAN: For over two decades, the ACLU has worked in the courts to 
bring about change in our nation's policy on the service of lesbian and gay 
Americans, and for the past six months, the ACLU Washington office has played
a leadership role in working with the administration and Congress
to develop a plan that would usher in a new day of freedom for
these service members while ensuring the readiness of our nation's
defense.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Family Research Council was allowed to
testify after arguing that the Justice Department was not going
to uphold the law, which would be their traditional role, but
instead, they were going to argue that the vague standard, &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; would fulfill the requirements.
<p>
That would mean that both the plaintiff, Lieutenant Thomasson, and the 
Justice Department would essentially be on the same side.  And so the
Family Research Council stepped in to make the case for the legal
standard.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  I was pleased with essentially what
Professor Woodruff said, because he really set the agenda straight,
and that is that there is a distinction between what the directives
say and what the law says.  The laws are very clear in regard
to this whole issue that homosexuals should not serve.  What the
directives have done, what the Clinton Administration has done,
is contrary to what the American people have long wanted, and
that is to not allow homosexuals to serve.
<p>
And so I feel very good that Professor Woodruff really drew the line in 
the sand for the American people today, representing not only the American
people but the United States Congress.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Each side says that they are confident that they will be the 
victor.
<p>
REPORTER: Are you going to appeal if you lose?
<p>
LT. THOMASSON:  We're not planning to lose.
<p>
FEMALE:  And that's why I'm very confident that
the government side will win, because the implementing or the
augmenting argument from FRC will be helpful in that regard.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And both sides agree on one thing:  No matter which
way the ruling goes, this pivotal case will move on to the Supreme
Court.
<p>
With us now are two individuals who have been at the forefront
of the battle against homosexuals getting involved in the military
in service.  I would like to welcome Lt. Col. Bob Maginnis, a
policy analyst with the Family Research Council, and Melissa Wells-Petry,
an attorney for Family Research Council who has represented FRC
in several court cases.  Thank you so much for joining us.
<p>
You all were obviously both in Richmond yesterday.  What is so pivotal
about this particular case?  Why does this one matter so much?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, this is the first time an amicus, such
as us, was allowed to argue in federal court to point out the
obvious, that the Clinton Administration is not enforcing the
law that passed Congress back in 1993, and that is ludicrous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I used to actually be a reporter covering the courts.
 I've never seen an outside amicus of any kind be allowed to speak.
 I don't know.  Melissa, you're an attorney.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: It's a very unusual situation.  It does happen, but very 
unusually. And there are a lot of unusual things about this case, not to
mention what you brought up in the beginning, is that essentially
the homosexual activist community and the Clinton Justice Department
are taking a united front, and they are going into court and saying
the policy allows homosexuals to serve.  And, actually, the law
does not allow homosexuals to serve, and it has been our role,
it has fallen to us say, &quot;What part of 'No' don't you 
understand?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, when the law was written, Congress was, in
essence, attempting to make it clear after Bill Clinton came to
office, &quot;You're talking within days of getting here about
gays in the military; we're saying that open homosexual service
is a problem.  Here's the law.&quot;
<p>
Why did it even go this far?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, back in the summer of 1993, President
Clinton, as you showed in your video, announced his policy from
the stage at Fort McNair.  It was don't ask, don't tell.  And
then when the law took effect, the law basically took the longstanding
bar against homosexual service and it just codified it; it made
it a law.  And the distinction between what Clinton said at Fort
McNair and what the law says are really night and day in terms
of who should serve.
<p>
The Clintons have created special classes of homosexuals, those homosexuals 
that will remain, quote, celibate and those homosexuals that engage in what 
homosexuals do. And the law doesn't talk about it.  It says all homosexuals 
are homosexuals.
<p>
I think what you're really seeing here, Kristi, is just a basic
power grab by the Clinton Administration.  Now, it's not the first
time that this administration has tried or actually has put itself
above the law.  But, really, what you are seeing here is you are
seeing a situation where the American people and Congress said,
&quot;No, it is a very bad idea to put homosexuals into the military,&quot;
and the Clinton Administration is so committed, for reasons best
known to itself, to that agenda, to putting homosexuals into the
military, to enlarging the homosexual agenda in our nation, that
now there is this power struggle.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And there's a power struggle.  You know, Congress passes 
laws. The President is supposed to faithfully execute them.  If he
doesn't do that, what do we do?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Who does?
<p>
Bob, you were in policy at the Pentagon and had a long military 
career as well and worked on the policy of gays in the 
military. Some people are going to say, &quot;There have always been 
homosexuals in the military.  Why not have open homosexual service in the
military?&quot;
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  No.  Well, Melissa and I were a small group of people 
that essentially did most of the background work on the President's group 
that worked in the Pentagon on that. There are a lot of reasons, and we 
discovered many of those during the course of that six-month study.
<p>
Clearly, there are cohesion reasons.  There are military readiness reasons.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, explain cohesion for a second.  I don't think people -- 
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  It is what keeps units working, keeps them
fighting together, trusting.  You know, you have to trust the
person in the foxhole with you, in the tank, in the airplane,
to do the types of things and not to be sexually aroused if you're
the same gender under some pretty intimate types of situations.
<p>
We heard from thousands of people when the Army went out and asked
old soldiers and present-day soldiers, &quot;Tell us, have you
ever had a problem?&quot;  And we heard a lot of problems out
there, current and old problems, about homosexuals that were,
quote, in the closet but were discovered to be doing things that
really undermined the trust and confidence you have to have in
one other.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And this is a fact in particular, isn't
it, when you have someone who is in authority over younger men,
in particular?
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Absolutely.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And I think it's very important to point
out that the fact, whenever you have a rule, whatever that rule
is, there are a certain number of people who don't abide by it.
 There are a certain number of people who evade it and therefore
don't bring the problems that the rule was designed to address
necessarily into the situation.
<p>
But it's a whole 'nother question to say, What would the military be like 
if we removed that rule totally, took all the brakes off, took all the 
restraints off? You cannot compare an army where a few soldiers are breaking
and evading the rules to an army that has no rules.  So that analogy
just breaks down analytically.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have more time to talk later.  But the military 
traditionally has said, We want you to not be sexually active with each other, 
men and women, man and man, however you want to do it.  You have found
that to be disruptive now sometimes even with women in the military.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Absolutely.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Very clearly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tell a little bit about why the military says to
the people involved in it, Don't sleep together.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, I can tell you that I did some -- and I can't give 
you details -- but investigations during Operation Desert Storm in
Iraq and Saudi Arabia, where we had relationships among soldiers,
some of which were senior, which are the ones I investigated,
which in some cases didn't happen but they were alleged to have
happened, and you go down and you talk to the soldiers that are
under this supervisor, this senior person, and there's a lot of
backbiting, there's a lot of distrust, finger-pointing, and just
morale bottoms out.  They don't trust this person because they
think they're off sleeping with the commander or whatever.
<p>
MS.HAMRICK: Right. Sexual politics.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  It's really a loyalty question.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to get more into that.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i> following this commercial break.  We'll hear
more about yesterday's court action, more about these kinds of
sexual politics.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I am joined once again by Bob Maginnis and Melissa 
Wells-Petry, both of whom attended and were active in the recent court case, 
<i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. Welcome back.
<p>
Family Research Council is not my first job. I have been in many 
different work environments where there is sexual harassment, in particular 
one where the boss was sleeping with different women in the office.
<p>
It seems to me simple to understand that the same reason I don't want an 
army that sleeps around is the same reason I don't want that going on in my 
own office or the kind of pressure that -- who gets promoted, the people 
who sleep or don't sleep?  What are you seeing, Melissa?
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Well, it should be simple to understand, especially when we 
feel that way about the normal work environment, and there is absolutely
nothing ordinary about being in the military environment.  This
is an organization that has a sense of togetherness, physical
and emotional, that really has no parallel in the civilian world.
<p>
And when you are talking about the remarkable dynamic of sexuality,
it really begins to involve people's, not only their full attention
but their loyalties.  And inside the armed services, one's loyalties,
every soldier's loyalty must be to the mission, not to some little
intrigue that is going on inside the company.
<p>
That is the seed, that pernicious seed, that begins to flower into what 
Bob said was this breakdown in morale across the board.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What have you seen, Bob, in your experience?  You've done a 
lot of investigation.  When there are homosexuals serving in a unit and
they haven't told per se but there's a knowledge that they are
gay, what is happening?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, there is a common knowledge amongst especially the 
young, enlisted soldiers when you have especially, say, a sergeant who 
everybody suspects is gay, but the seniors can't quite catch this person in 
the act, and they won't acknowledge it.  And so it has created a level
of tension which is just -- you could break it like you're breaking
ice.  You know, it just shatters once it is discovered, because
everybody knew it.  But it is terribly devastating.
<p>
Any sexual issue -- because most of what I investigated were sexual issues
for senior officials, and I saw a lot of them -- and, invariably,
you would talk to the people and they would tell you what was
going on and how this was dysfunctional.  It was just like the
coffee(?) talk.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  See, that's what is so artificial about a policy that 
focuses only on when you tell.  That's completely fake, because -- let's face 
it; let's have some common sense here -- the difference between a homosexual 
who is unknown and one who is known, that state of affairs can change in the 
twinkling of an eye.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And that state of affairs is very transient, depending on 
the opportunities presented, the emotional appeal that is involved in a 
situation, and so on. So we are talking about the Clinton Administration basing 
a policy on something that not only is fake but is like ephemeral.  It
goes like that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's a trust level, too, isn't it? I mean, basically, we're 
saying I will identify myself by the way in which I will have sex and say that 
I will never have sex. Isn't that what we're asking people to say?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, we are.  We are essentially --
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Well, under the Clinton regulations, right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Under the Clinton regulations.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: They are asking -- like Thomasson yesterday.  They are 
saying, &quot;Why in the world didn't you ask him whether or not he was
going to remain celibate?&quot;  Now, he didn't say anything about
that in the testimony, but that is essentially the expectation.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  But I always find it amazing that celibacy,
which is frankly out of fashion everywhere in public policy --
you can't get anyone -- in fact, people are suing if you try to
include an abstinence-related protocol in your sex education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And suddenly celibacy is in vogue among homosexuals in 
the military?  You know, in every program that has to do with sex, the last 
thing that they are factoring in is celibacy or abstinence.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes. Our Federal Government just spent $400,000 to do an ad 
campaign that is going to advise you to use condoms.  But in the military, 
apparently, no one is going to have to.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Yes. Oh, yes. Celibacy is in vogue there, yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And yet the military provides pornography to the soldiers and 
homosexual pornography now.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: That is a new development.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you think of that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: We checked.  About two weeks ago, we went to the 
Pentagon, and we looked at what pornography was on sale at the Pentagon
bookstore.  Now, there are only nine different books of heterosexual
pornography -- there were some empty spaces, so we assume there's
more -- and there were two for homosexual pornography.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: There were sales at the Fort Myer post exchange for 
homosexual flags and bumper stickers, and so forth, to identify yourself.
<p>
Now, this is under the Clinton Administration policy that says homosexuals 
aren't supposed to be serving, and yet you have, at taxpayer expense 
subsidizing this stuff, no taxes being charged for the sale of it, and it's 
out there.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And, of course, it is broader than just -- I mean, when you 
begin to talk about pornography, you are talking about impacting on
the whole --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The whole sexual climate.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: -- moral and social climate of command.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. This isn't going to go away, and we're going to have 
to have you all back. When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at the Family
Research Council's effort to show that the media does not always
present the facts.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back.
<p>
The Family Research Council's director of cultural studies, Bob Knight, 
has been involved in the media for many years, working at one time for the 
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>. In a 1993 Accuracy in the Media press conference, 
Bob presents some facts regarding the homosexual agenda and how the media 
presents it to the public. Let's take a look at his insight as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> brings you Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
<center><h4>Segment from Accuracy in Media Press Conference<br>
June 1, 1993</h4></center>
<p>
MODERATOR:  Our next speaker and I have something in common.
 We both come, figuratively, out of the belly of the beast.
<p>
Bob Knight was a former editor of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. I 
formerly was a correspondent for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, so we 
know the media from the inside out.
<p>
Bob is now director of cultural studies at the Family Research Council. Bob?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Well, the reason we are here today and here to see the video is 
because the media has been omitting what's really important.  They have
done this on a number of occasions.  But in all my years in journalism,
I never saw an issue treated so dishonestly as I have the gay
issue.  And it is what is omitted that bothers me.
<p>
You know, you can pick up the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington 
Post</i>, and I think the information there is reliable.  But it's what 
they're not telling you that is significant.
<p>
They didn't tell you, for example, that Roberta Achtenberg was an attorney 
for the bath houses in San Francisco at the height of the AIDS epidemic. 
In 1984, the Public Health Department tried to close those bath houses
because they knew they were a breeding ground for AIDS and were
taking the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of young gay men.
<p>
She was an attorney for a group of bath house patrons and managed
to keep them open.  I think this action may have contributed to
the loss of life of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men.  And
yet the media didn't think that was worthy of reportage.
<p>
Similarly, the way they reported on Roberta Achtenberg's role in 
persecuting the Boy Scouts was curious.  They said that right-wing 
opponents had accused her of punishing the Boy Scouts and being against
the Boy Scouts' policies of excluding homosexual scoutmasters.
<p>
This is full public record.  She has been doing it for years.
 She has made no secret about it.  And yet it is left up to debate
whether she actually did it or not.  It almost seems as if her
critics took it up, and yet there is ample opportunity to document
her attitude on the issue.  That was never done.  It was left
as a cloud.
<p>
I will give you a personal example of media bias.
 When I was at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, somebody had written a 
story about gay cruising in Laguna Beach, California, which is a gay
mecca much like Key West.  The gist of the article was that gays
had changed their cruising methods.  They weren't frequenting
the parks as much.  They weren't hitting the public restrooms
as much, although some still were.
<p>
This story went on for 80 inches, which is typical for an <i>L.A. Times</i> 
story. Our motto used to be, &quot;Get it last, make it long, get it 
right.&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, anyway, I got hold of the story.  I was editing it, and I
said, &quot;Wait a second.  You know, in this entire article about
gay cruising, you never mention AIDS once.&quot;  And this was
when AIDS was really taking off.  It was the most obvious topic
in the gay community at the time.
<p>
And I asked the editor, I said, &quot;Why aren't we mentioning AIDS?&quot; 
And he said, &quot;Well, we just didn't think it was relevant.&quot; 
AIDS not relevant to a story on gay cruising and whether there's a change 
in habits? Come on.
<p>
This is why we are here to see this video today.  The
media has been systematically excluding information about the
homosexual lifestyle, about the politics surrounding the issues,
about almost everything associated with the issue.
<p>
Another prime example would be the idea that gays are born that way, that 
there are genetic studies that indicate that you are born gay and there's
nothing you can do about it.  The latest study that was touted
was in the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i>. It was by two 
researchers, Drs. Bailey and Pillard(?), and they had done a study of male
twins previously.
<p>
I remember the <i>Washington Post</i> headline.  It
was something on the order of &quot;Study Indicates Lesbianism
Has Genetic Origin.&quot;  What they didn't report was in the
very same edition of the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i> was an
article that reviewed all the current literature on the issue
by two doctors and psychiatrists, and they concluded:  &quot;At
present, there is no evidence to substantiate a biologic theory
of homosexuality.&quot;
<p>
Further, they said, &quot;Efforts to do so seem to be more driven by lack 
of satisfaction with the current psychosocial explanations than anything 
else. There is no new medical evidence that is solid to suggest that it is 
biological.&quot;
<p>
But this is typical.  An authoritative article goes unnoticed;
one that supports part of the gay agenda gets heavily publicized.
<p>
What you are about to see on this video is what did not get publicized
in Washington.  I have heard people in the media try to say that
what you see on the video is just on the fringes of the march,
that it really didn't represent what went on that day.  But we
had people out there.  They were all over the mall, and they said
this stuff happened everywhere.  If you were in Washington that
day with your kids, you couldn't avoid seeing obscene acts committed,
anti-religious imagery, topless lesbians, any number of bizarre
sights that were carefully hidden from the major network shows
and from major print media.
<p>
So I think the report, that group out of California that did such a fine 
job with their first gayagenda film and their second, which deals with the 
homosexual agenda in education, have done -- if anything, they have surpassed
themselves.  This is a dispassionate look at what really occurred
that day in Washington.  It deserves to be viewed by every American
so they know exactly what the homosexual agenda is about.
<p>
Thank you very much.
<p>
[Applause.]

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight we're talking about an issue which has touched each and every 
one of us:  divorce.  As rampant as divorce is across the nation, it is a 
topic that is rarely discussed, perhaps because of the emotional chord of 
regret, heartbreak, and disillusionment it strikes.
<p>
Tonight <i>Straight Talk</i> confronts divorce head-on.  We're going to ask, 
What impact has it had on society?  Why has there been such a drastic rise 
in the divorce rate over the past three decades?  And, most importantly, is 
there a way to curb this damaging cycle of family breakdown?
<p>
First, let's hear from Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's
Assistant to the President for Government Relations.  After years
of working on Capitol Hill, Marty provides a unique and insightful
look into issues before Congress which affect our nation.
<p>
I had the chance to discuss some of the most current Hill wars with
Marty, so let's see what he has to say, without media editing,
as we take you behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are here today with Marty.  Thank you
so much for joining us.  Marty works on Capitol Hill for the Family
Research Council.  And this last session of Congress was historic,
because for the first time since 1973, we saw an actual limitation
on abortion -- not all the way through yet -- the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act.
<p>
Marty, what has it said about Congress today that they are looking at 
banning a procedure that might end a child's life when they are pulled 
into the birth canal and killed moments from birth?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think that this issue was chosen very strategically, 
and it was a very good decision to use legislation like this that focused 
on a particular procedure and forced people to deal with the reality of 
abortion. So many times in the past, the pro-abortion side has been able to 
engage the argument on cliches, and so on, of keeping the government
out and that sort of thing, and not focusing on the child.
<p>
So it is very important that people understand what is going on,
and as you pointed out, most people don't realize that late-term
abortions are a reality.  They believe that they are only in the
first three months and even only for hard cases -- life of the
mother, rape, incest, perhaps a few other hard cases -- and it
is much broader than that.
<p>
This bill is going to land on the President's desk, and the indications 
are that he will veto it.  But it will help to point out that he does have 
a very extreme position that is in line with the most extreme advocates of 
abortion on demand in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that will hurt the President if he vetoes 
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think it will.  I think he is probably falling
back on his friends at the major networks to try to put the best
spin on it, and he will say that there wasn't the appropriate
health exception, and of course, we all know that the health exception
they're talking about is a license for abortion on demand.  It's
a definition of health that encompasses any possible social or
psychological circumstance.
<p>
But the President will try to project that he's just so concerned about 
women's health and that he signed such a law in Arkansas, and if only 
that could have been there, he would have signed it, but in fact, his 
allies all know that that was a gutting amendment which the Senate defeated, 
and it remains to be seen.
<p>
I think the grassroots pro-family and pro-life movement know that that is 
extreme, and they are really catching on and getting the word out.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that the best thing that happened in the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act debate was that we talked about what's 
actually happening in abortion clinics.  What do you think the take-home 
message is for pro-life Americans as they have seen some success, even
if the President does veto it?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think that the educational issues are very important, 
that it is important to talk directly about the issue, let people understand 
what the realities are, and to use this legislation as a focal point to
show that the license for abortion in this country is so broad
and so extreme that it really needs to be addressed.
<p>
It is an uncomfortable issue for many people.  They would rather not deal
with it.  But this is the type of issue that causes them to take
a second look.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There has been a lot of attention on Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
on his high negatives, on possible ethics problems.  Is his persona going to 
be a problem for Republicans as they are dealing with the budget debate?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think it is causing some problems in that it really 
has emboldened the Democrats.  They feel that they have him on the
run a bit, and that once they start digging into even this limited
ethics probe that is now in place, that it might open the door
for a wider probe.
<p>
I think they do have to be careful, though, if they start down this 
road and seem obsessed with this, that their candidates are not talking about 
the issues; that it could have a backlash.  But right now it does seem to 
have energized them, and some of the comments, particularly the reference to
the treatment on the airplane back from Israel and how that might
have impacted on decisions regarding the budget, have been unfortunate
and probably overstated.  I don't think that that really had anything
to do with the decisions on how that budget was handled.  I think
that was the way things were going anyhow, but it is unfortunate
that the Democrats and some of the media had an opportunity to
cast it in those terms:  He shut down the government because he
was mad at the President type of argument.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Representative Enid Waldholtz, a Republican of Utah, is sort 
of struggling with her own values issue right now.  Her husband is going to 
be indicted, and she came forward recently and said, &quot;I'm innocent and
I'm not going to resign my seat.&quot;  What impact do you think
that is going to have on what is going on now?  Any at all? Is
this bad for the GOP or is this just bad for Representative Waldholtz
personally?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, it is certainly problematic for her personally. 
There are some out there now who are starting to make the charge, &quot;Well, 
look at these hypocrites. These were the family values candidates, and 
they're hypocrites.  Some of them have had troubled marriages, there are a 
few divorces, and in one case the spouse of one of the members admitted to 
being unfaithful.  And yet they are trying to say that this somehow
suggests that there's a values problem for that member of Congress.&quot;
<p>
So these are very curious charges, and what people stand for is
not really related to perhaps potential failings of a few members.
 You have to look at the broader issues.
<p>
The same people who are trying to zero in on this are trying to ignore some 
of the other issues that the Senate Banking Committee is now looking at 
and gross inconsistencies in who knew what about Whitewater and related
issues, and many of the people in the press who are looking at
every little iota they can find about Newt Gingrich are very anxious
to avoid the issues of who might have obstructed an investigation
of wrongdoing, and so on, within the administration.  So there
is a double standard that has been there for a long time, and
this continues to be a problem.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, we appreciate taking your time from up on the Hill. 
Thanks so much for being with us today.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Bill 
Mattox, Vice President for Policy at Family Research Council. He will 
bring us his perspective on divorce and how it will affect almost 1 million 
children this year.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[From marriage ceremony segment]:
<p>
MINISTER:  In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
and what God hath joined together, let no man put asunder, and
you may now kiss your bride.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Today, when people think of marriage, all too often the next 
word that comes to mind is divorce.  The 50 percent divorce number comes 
from a yearly comparison of the number of new marriages to the number of 
divorces. Overall numbers are not as bleak.  The fact is that one-quarter
of all those who have ever been married will also be divorced.
<p>
Still, divorce links all American lives because, directly or indirectly,
we have all been affected by it.
<p>
MALE INTERVIEWEE: My parents got divorced when I was real young.
<p>
FEMALE INTERVIEWEE: My parents were divorced when I was 10 months old.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, the prevalence of divorce may be the factor which creates 
the acceptance and understanding of this phenomenon, one which leads
to an increase in child abuse, juvenile crime, sexual promiscuity,
teen male suicide, and even more broken homes.
<p>
Divorce, amazingly enough, also increases one's chances of health problems. 
The <i>American Journal of Public Health</i> found that either the breakup
of one's marriage or the divorce of one's parents significantly
reduces the average lifespan.  Divorced men who don't smoke have
only a slightly lower risk of dying from cancer than those who
smoke a pack of cigarettes a day.
<p>
Considering how divorce negatively impacts so many lives, it is interesting -- 
and disheartening -- that the divorce rate has tripled over the last 30 years.
<p>
MALE INTERVIEWEE: I just think it's a product of our society in general.
<p>
FEMALE INTERVIEWEE:  I think there's a lack of commitment, that
marriages are easier to get out of, and there's just not the commitment
to the family that there used to be.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But, as the people who have watched the breakup of their own 
homes or the homes of loved ones can tell you, it's not easy to save a 
marriage. There are no easy solutions to this epidemic problem.  But the
research agrees with those who have struggled through:  it is
worth the effort.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  With us tonight is Bill Mattox, Vice President for Policy with 
Family Research Council.  Bill has been examining the divorce issue for years 
and has been widely published on the subject of divorce effects on the very 
young, seen not too long ago in the tragic suicide death of singer Kurt
Cobain.
<p>
Bill, welcome.  Thanks for being with us again on <i>Straight Talk</i>. 
You have been tracking the impact of divorce for a long
time.  What kinds of trends are you seeing, especially over the
last 30 years?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, in terms of the actual prevalence of divorce, the 
divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has kind of plateaued since that time. 
We have seen a slight decrease since that time in the number of divorces 
in each year.  But it is still a very, very serious problem, and especially 
when you look at this from a historical standpoint, comparing the prevalence 
of divorce today to two or three generations ago.  Many, many more people 
are affected today; many more children are affected today than ever before.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When a lot of the movie industry in the 1960s and
1970s very much glamorized divorce and glamorized let's get out
and be all that we can be, and now we've kind of seen what we
are in divorce.  What impacts happen to the people who actually
divorce?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, you know, this is really one of the
most interesting things about this subject, though it is a sad
note, is that if you talk to a lot of that 20-something generation,
those kids 18 to 30 years old that we have been polling in several
of our public opinion surveys, you find that concern about this
issue is greater among that group than among older Americans,
and I think part of it is because many of them have grown up in
an era where divorce was commonplace, where it was at one point
glamorized.
<p>
And yet they have seen the negative fallout and have experienced 
that firsthand, either in their own lives or perhaps in observing 
the lives of their friends.  And it is not a difficult thing to 
convince them that this is a serious problem and one that really 
ought to be addressed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think one thing that I found interesting.  Family Research 
Council is getting ready, under your leadership, to do a state-by-state 
divorce stats release -- it is going to be coming soon -- that, state by 
state, the statistics are different.  What did you see in that?  I found
that very fascinating.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  It is interesting that there are some significant differences 
between different states and, indeed, different regions of the country.  Oddly 
enough, you can reasonably predict the divorce rate in any part of the country
by knowing the number of days out of the year that a woman can
wear a bathing suit.  Now, I am not suggesting that there is a
correlation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Oh, my goodness!
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But, basically, if you think of the sunbelt region, which 
includes, of course, the Bible belt, what you find is that divorce rates
in that part of the country are dramatically higher than in the
Midwest and Northeast.  The mountain states in the Far West tend
to have higher divorce rates, as well.
<p>
There are some important reasons for this.  One is that divorce rates among 
Catholics, Jews, and Mormons tend to be significantly lower than among 
Protestants, and so --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And they're in the northern regions.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Especially in the Northeast and Midwest, you have
a high Catholic population.  So part of the reason why you have
higher levels of divorce in the Bible belt than in, say, states
like Massachusetts -- I mean, get this.  Teddy Kennedy's home
state is number one in marital stability, and Donald Trump's,
New York, is tied for second.  Who would have ever thought it?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fascinating.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  So the prevalence of a Catholic population is a major 
predictor here.
<p>
But perhaps an even more significant predictor of differences in divorce 
by state is the degree of social integration; that is, how rooted are the 
people living there in a larger community.  And what you find is that in 
areas of the Northeast and Midwest where you have had families that 
have lived in this area, in this neighborhood, for years and years and 
years, the communities are more stable. When couples go to marry, their 
families know each other.  There is a wide circle of people who can advise 
them about whether or not they're compatible and also a wide circle of people 
who can hold them accountable, to say, &quot;Look, we're counting on you
to make this marriage work.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: When you see marriages in less stable areas, more transient 
areas --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Like Washington, D.C., or Los Angeles, or commuter
towns.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Exactly.  What you have -- a lot of military
towns see this quite dramatically -- what you have, then, is situations
where people are quite often marrying without knowing a lot about
each other.  They quite often have dissimilar backgrounds, and
they do not have the community surrounding them to both advise
them and hold them accountable, which is so critically important.
<p>
And, indeed, this is, I think, one of the very important functions
that churches should be providing and, indeed, in some areas are
serving to provide, because we know that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: More counseling, more accountability -
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Exactly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A discussion of what you're getting into.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right, because of the one things that we do know that
is rather encouraging in terms of the relationship between religion
and divorce is that those who attend church on a weekly or even
more frequent basis have dramatically lower divorce than do those
who attend less frequently or not at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Let's go through just a couple of quick things on that. 
There were an interesting series of dynamics on, if these things are in 
your life, you are less likely to divorce.  What are a couple -- five,
ten -- things that you see with that?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, sadly, even though a lot of young people who have gone 
through the divorce of their parents are worried about this, quite often 
they are at higher risk of divorcing themselves, partly because they 
haven't seen good role models in their own home.  And again, this is why
the role of the community is so important, and the role of churches,
to model good marriages, so that those who haven't seen it at
home can at least know what it is that they are striving for.
That's a significant predictor.
<p>
The age at which one marries often has a significant effect. The younger --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We were talking about this the other day.  So the 
50-year-olds and the 18-year-olds, they've got different sets of resources.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right.  Those who marry in their teens are
at greater risk, in part because the maturing process has not
quite often taken full root, and so the marriages are more fragile.
<p>
Generally speaking, if you can make it through that first eight-year
period, that is when most divorces occur, is during the first
eight years of marriage.  There is also, then, a kind of upturn
when men and women hit mid-life crisis in their forties and whatnot.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But if couples can make it through those kind of critical 
early years, then the chances of long-term success are much, much greater.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, I think what was interesting -- now, obviously, I just 
want to state Family Research Council would not want a battered woman or 
someone in a domestic violence situation to continue to be injured.  We 
are talking about marriage-strengthening patterns and things that
are generally true.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Oh, no question, and I think this is a very, very important 
point. If you look at public opinion data about adults, say, a year, two 
years, three years after the divorce has occurred, quite often what you find 
are folks who have very serious regrets, who believed that -- they believed
this lie, that divorce was going to be liberating; it was going
to make their lives easier.
<p>
And yet what they discover is that quite often they have merely exchanged 
one set of problems for another.  And many of them, at that one, two, three 
years out point are saying, &quot;Gee, we wish we had tried harder.  We
wish that we had given it a better shot, because maybe we could
have worked something out.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, as a person who married later, I can definitely say dating 
can be not all it's cracked up to be.
<p>
But marriage provides a lot of benefits that I was not aware of.  We were 
looking at the video piece. Health benefits. What are some of the 
surprising collateral benefits of marriage?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  It is interesting, and I guess the important point there to make, 
as well, is that the health benefits, though they are present for both men and 
women, they are especially present for men.  Men benefit significantly from
marriage in any number of different ways.
<p>
As you pointed out, there is a lower correlation for things like lung cancer 
as well as stomach cancer, less alcoholism, less depression -- all sorts
of health benefits that are associated with stable marriage. 
And it comes in part from the fact that they've got someone to
help encourage them to adopt good health patterns, to regulate
their diet, to encourage them to exercise, that kind of thing.
<p>
And there is a certain stability that comes into their lives that
isn't always present in cases where one is living alone, especially
if they are still dealing with the emotional fallout of a divorce
or a painful marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, it is funny. I saw Zig Ziegler speak, a motivational 
speaker, business leader, talking about how men who were kissed on their way 
to work made more money than men who were not, which was an interesting 
statistic.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But I appreciate your being with us, Bill, and I would
encourage people to call Family Research Council for more data
on this.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we continue
to discuss divorce.  We will talk to some people who are practically
examining this issue state by state, and we will examine some
proposed changes in legislation which discourage an &quot;easy
out&quot; of marriage.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would now like to 
welcome Larry Huff, Director of State and Local Affairs for the Family 
Research Council; and two individuals with whom Larry works closely:  Randy
Hekman, Executive Director of the Michigan Family Forum, and Dennis
Mansfield, Executive Director of the Idaho Family Forum.  Gentlemen,
welcome.
<p>
Randy, you have had an interesting career.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: That's true.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You have been a judge, a father of nine, lots of --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Not nine, just 12.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Just 12!
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  We've got to get that number right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Gosh, I demoted you.  I have to -- and as a judge, what
can you tell us about how no-fault divorce has affected us as
a culture?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, as we've already heard from Bill Mattox, it has 
impacted lives, certainly mothers' and fathers', but especially kids'. 
Seventy percent of children that are currently in juvenile facilities 
today have come from broken homes.  In fact, most of the people that a 
juvenile court judge -- and that was the kind of judge I was for 15 
years -- are from families where there has been divorce, or no marriage 
in the first place, but most of them divorce.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
And you are in Idaho; you are in Michigan.  What prompted you all to say, 
&quot;Divorce reform is something we're going to take on&quot;?  Because 
it is certainly not the thing that is on the top of a lot of people's
lists.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  It really isn't.  In fact, if you were
to go through most of the state legislatures, you'd find that
most people would look at you, and they would say, &quot;Well,
why do you want to get rid of no-fault divorce?  Why do you even
want to engage in the debate over this?  It seems like you're
looking for an issue.&quot;  And that has not been the case.
<p>
We think the issue is already out there.  It's on every street corner,
it's in every broken family, it's in every bottle of booze; that
there's a divorce that is sort of divorcing, in a sense, the physical
from the spiritual across our culture, and it's happening family
by family.
<p>
So our thought was, if we were really to deal with the social ills 
that are involved in Idaho, which is a very conservative,
very pro-family kind of state that still is seventh in divorce,
along with Alabama, then we'd better engage in the debate now
and in essence be a point person on it.  So that's why we jumped
in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are you seeing nationally, Larry?  Family
Research Council is taking on a divorce reform project.  But why?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  I think it is largely due, Kristi, to the fact that
there is just a recognition across the country increasing that
families who stay together are a model for a prosperous society
and virtuous society, and that that is the model that works, and
a recognition that with the breakdown of families comes the breakdown
of America, and it's beginning to impact more and more lives,
and when things impact us personally, I think it moves us to want
to make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I want to ask you all, a lot of people, they think, 
Yeah, divorce is bad.  Okay, what are we going to do about it?  Okay, 
try harder.
<p>
But you all are doing some things, some real things, to change how 
divorce works in America.  Please describe that.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You see, back in the late 1960s, early 1970s, folks thought, 
well, you know, there is such acrimony in our courtrooms, and we have such 
a problem with divorce.  People are showing up.  They want to get a divorce,
and one of them has to pretend that they've been wrong or done
some sort of faults.  Let's eliminate that charade.  Let's just
have no-fault divorce, which means that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But they had to do that why?  Because you couldn't get a 
divorce --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You couldn't get a divorce without showing some
fault.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  So the husband or the wife would admit to fault. They said, 
&quot;Let's do away with that.&quot;
<p>
Well, we now have no-fault divorce, which means that either party can get 
a divorce from the other party for any reason at any time. What that means 
is that it is legally easier for a person to divorce their spouse, even if 
they've been married for 20 years, than it is to fire someone that you hired 
last week. There is no legal way to stop that party from leaving.
<p>
The net result has been significant injustice for parties.  It has resulted
in women, particularly, losing major economic strength.  In fact,
one study shows that women lost like 72 percent of their income
following divorces.
<p>
No-fault divorce actually also hurts existing marriages. You don't 
really want to invest in something unless you feel that it is going to 
be worth my investment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  But you can't hold onto your spouse. They can turn away and 
walk away for any reason at any time. Why invest in that marriage? 
As a result, existing marriages are hurt through no-fault divorce.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So how will we change that?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Well, we're hoping in Michigan -- in fact, there is a
bill in the legislature in Michigan -- and our hope would be that
early next year we are going to see the first state in the Union
to reverse no-fault divorce.
<p>
What it would do, it would allow divorce based on mutual consent; that if 
both parties truly want the divorce, fine.  But if only one wants it -- the 
husband wants out so he can marry a new model, for example -- he can't just
walk away and get that divorce automatically.  He will have to
prove fault against that spouse of his or else get that spouse
to agree, and for both of them to agree, and basically, there
is going to be a financial transaction at that point to get --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: And that's the way it ought to be.  The man that deserts the 
person that he has committed his life to and the children that they have 
spawned through that relationship, it seems to me that he ought to own up to 
that commitment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So we are talking about a two-tier system.  If we
both agree, we both sign out, we're out.  If we don't agree, then
there's going to be some money changing hands.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Well, if they don't agree, there is going to have to be a showing 
of fault under those circumstances.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  I would shy away from calling it a two-tier system.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Okay.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  I would say, more importantly, that it
is the logical consequence of a covenant relationship; that we
have covenanted together to be one, and we're going to march ahead,
and if you want out, well, you know what?  There's a price for
everything, and that price may be that you just don't have an
easy out, whether it's the husband or the wife that leaves.
<p>
And in fact, what we're doing in Idaho is we're watching Michigan,
and we're hoping that, depending upon the movement of the governor
and the legislature in this, that would see Idaho, Washington,
Oregon, and other states come up, but we are definitely ready
to roll on this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So there are a lot of states watching what is 
happening there?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, there are other settlement formulas that are out there, 
aren't there, Larry, some saying that if there is a divorce that 
children's standard of living cannot change?  What are some of the other
options that people are looking at in a divorce formula?
<p>
MR. HUFF: There are a lot of disincentives built into divorce in 
different fashions, and what we found is that actually a lot of those end
up trying to reform marriage laws instead of reforming divorce
laws, and creating different types of marriages and this kind
of thing, and giving the courts a lot of latitude dealing with
what happens to the kids, and some of that is positive and some
of it is not.  But what we really want to focus on again is instituting
justice back into the divorce laws.
<p>
The number one product of government should be to produce justice, and that 
is just not happening in our divorce laws.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So what does the opposition say? It sounds reasonable.  You 
know, divorce is the number one impoverisher of women and children.  So why 
would I not be in favor of this?  And I'm sure you're not going to tell
me that your whole legislature is saying, &quot;Yes, let me sign.&quot;
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, a lot of them are.  Frankly, legislation doesn't
happen -- with all the possible things to enact into law, legislation,
even if there is general agreement, doesn't happen unless the
heat is turned up a little bit and the public seems to want it.
<p>
Frankly, the biggest obstacle is the public is just getting aware
of what this issue is, and so part of our job is to inform the
public, and the media has been helping us in Michigan to do that,
and I'm grateful for this program to do the same.
<p>
But the only opposition that we have seen, frankly, has been a number of 
family lawyers.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: They are earning their keep with no-fault divorce, and they may 
have some concern that if things change, maybe they'll have a hard time 
earning their keep.
<p>
It is interesting that back when the law changed in 1972 from fault to 
no-fault, the lawyers opposed that change, as well.
<p>
Interesting -- the feminists -- there are many feminists,
believe it or not, who favor a return to more of a fault system,
because women typically -- again, men get really beat up by no-fault
divorce as well, but a lot of women do, especially those that
have custody of the children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And get exchanged for the trophy wives.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  That's right, and they end up -- no-fault divorce says, Hey, 
we're just going to be even split, everything right down the middle.  But 
the typical woman earns 75 cents on the dollar for every man, and so 
following that divorce, that is why women's income plummets, typically.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And the man's generally goes up, I think, what, 40 percent?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, that's one study.  I've seen other studies suggest
that it's even or it may even go down a little.  Nobody really
wins big time through divorce; few people do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Right. But nobody gets hurt like the children.
<p>
MR. HUFF: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk a little bit more about
that in just a moment and, Dennis, hear more about what is happening
in your state, as well.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i> following this commercial break. We will hear more about 
the tragedy of divorce, both nationwide and state by state. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Tonight we're talking about divorce and the 
crippling effect it has on individuals, as a nation and as a whole.
<p>
I am joined once again by Larry Huff from the Family Research Council, 
Randy Hekman of the Michigan Family Forum, and Dennis Mansfield of the
Idaho Family Forum.  Welcome back.
<p>
Larry, when we're taking a look at divorce, it's hard not to look at 
children. It's not just about a man and a woman.  There are, a lot of 
times other, other people involved.
<p>
What have you seen when it comes to divorce reform?  Are children going to 
be better off?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Well, we think they will, Kristi, because, as you mentioned, in 
the wake of these breeches often lie kids with broken hearts, and
the opponents of moving back to a system that requires more justice,
these opponents say, &quot;You know, if you do this, you are going
to reinstitute bitterness and acrimony back in the process.&quot;
<p>
I think that's just really a naive view, because when people get
divorced, unfortunately, there's going to be bitterness there,
and what we have now is that bitterness is transferred to the
custody battles, and in those custody battles the kids are often
the ones that just really get hurt and get caught in the vise
between this acrimony that is there between the parents.
<p>
And so we believe that settling this issue at the beginning of the 
divorce proceedings will really take some of the pressure, at least in
the divorce process, off of the kids.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In a fault system, will the parent found at fault have 
fewer, perhaps, privileges in terms of the children?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  I really think that changing it more back to a fault system 
will actually give more clout to the more innocent party.  See, under 
current law -- just think through with me for a minute -- under the current 
law, where you can leave your spouse at any time -- let's take a classical 
example. The man does leave his wife and children that he has been married
to, say, for 15 years.
<p>
Right now, she is required to negotiate with him. He already has what he 
wants, which is the divorce. And so she needs to come to him and say, 
&quot;Look, if I can't have you and the family back together, at least give 
me the house, enough money to survive this experience, and custody of the 
kids.&quot;
<p>
And he could come back to her and say, &quot;Hey, look.  Don't
push me too hard or I'll go for custody of the kids.&quot;  And
I have seen illustrations of that in real life.
<p>
If we change the law like we're hoping to do in Michigan, he does not 
automatically get the divorce he wants.  He will be required to negotiate 
with her.  And again, she can say, &quot;Look, if I can't again have
the family together, at least give me these three things.&quot;
 He will have to pay a higher price, you might say, to get out
of the commitments he has made.  And that's justice.  That's the
way it ought to be done.
<p>
Now, let's not sound sexist here.  Often -- in fact, I have some 
illustrations where men come home from work and are aghast.  Their wife, 
their children are gone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. It happens.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  The divorce has been filed.  Next thing they know, they're 
obligated to be paying child support.  Wife is now living with her boyfriend 
with the kids, and he has to subsidize it and gets to visit with his kids at
McDonald's every other week.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's sad out there, especially for people who don't want 
the divorce.  What if you don't want a divorce?  Can this change result in no 
divorce?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: I think what it really does, it results in the opportunity
for discussion, because right now, when that spouse leaves and
the divorce papers are sitting there on the table and the husband
comes in from a camping trip and his kids are gone or the wife
comes -- there is no discussion.  You know, that decision has
been made.  They're out the door.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: What we're hoping for is that there's an opportunity to 
come back to not necessarily a rekindling of that spark that happened
but at least civil discussion that may ultimately lead to reconciliation.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You know, it could be done, though.  There's a group
called Retrovive(?), which is a Catholic-oriented group.  These
consist of folks who have been to the brink of divorce.  Many
of them have been through divorce and have worked themselves back
together, the word &quot;rekindling.&quot;  I mean, they have
rekindled the relationship; they are more in love now than they
have ever been.
<p>
They then mentor other couples whose marriages are on the ropes, and 
they have an 80 to 90 percent cure rate, believe it or not.  That is an 
amazing --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is a phenomenal --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  And they're around the country. It's a big group.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  And even those that aren't in an official capacity -- my wife 
and I have poured ourselves into two families, one that was divorced for nine 
years, the husband and the wife.  They remarried and they have had now five 
years of marriage that has been outstanding.
<p>
Another that was separated, husband and wife, for a year and a half.  We met 
them through a series of Providential occurrences, acted as agents to bring
them back together.  They've been married now for two and a half
years.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Great.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the things that we have seen here at Family Research 
Council looking at the data is partnering troubled couples with healthy 
couples --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- that that is a tremendously successful thing to do. And 
there have been even discussions of requiring some counseling in a 
no-fault/fault situation. Is there consensus for that, Larry, on a 
national level?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: For requiring counseling?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Yes.  There are a number of states introducing divorce reforms 
of all types, and the most popular divorce reform is to require counseling 
both on the front end and what they call so-called reality therapy for 
those who want to divorce.  Before you get a divorce, you just need to 
understand some of the implications.
<p>
The one caveat that I think we all have a consensus on is that we want 
that to be done -- we think it is a good thing to provide it, as long as 
it is done by people who are in the business of counseling; that is to say, 
private-practice people, the church, people like that, not government 
counseling. We don't think government counseling is the proper solution.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. The government's good at taking your money,
but saving your marriage?
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  No, not good.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  It's just not under their purview; it is just not a
positive thing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And wouldn't there need to be a bias in favor of saving 
the marriage?  I think one thing I am concerned about is, in the 1970s and 
1980s, there was a bias toward counseling to get out.  You know, &quot;You're 
right; you're stressed.&quot;
<p>
MR. HUFF: Self-actualization.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.  Really, no-fault divorce has that same bias.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  We give all the legal clout to the party
that wants to break the relationship now and no legal clout to
the party that wants to preserve the relationship. It shouldn't
be that way.  If marriage is that important to our culture, which
it is, if anything, the presumption should go the other way. 
We need to change that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think it takes too much to the therapeutic 
state of mind that we would require counseling? Are you at all 
concerned about that, that we're a little -- are we headed into 
psychobabble land?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  Well, no, I don't think that's the case, but I do think 
that it goes back to the issue of communication.  For example, we were 
talking earlier about communities who have made a decision in our clergy 
to come together and say, &quot;This is our basic understanding of the
covenant of marriage.  Let's have counseling before marriage.
 Let's have counseling before a divorce.&quot;
<p>
What these covenants have been -- in fact, I think the entire state of 
Michigan may ultimately move towards that.  Isn't that right, Randy?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: They're looking at it, yes.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  In fact, the clergy are coming down there and saying, 
&quot;Look, you cant' leave me, as a Methodist, move over to that guy who 
is a Presbyterian and get married without going through this type of 
pre-marriage counseling.&quot;
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  That is not legislatively induced.
MR. MANSFIELD: No.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  And they've done it in communities -- Peoria, Illinois; 
Modesto, California; Louisville, Kentucky; certain communities -- all 
the religious leaders of all denominations have come together and said, 
&quot;Look, we can agree on two things. We think marriage is great; we 
think divorce is bad.&quot;  And so let's just commit that we will not 
intentionally marry someone in our churches, our synagogues, whatever, 
unless these folks have first gone through four months of premarital 
counseling, mentoring with an experienced married couple, some premarital
testing, maybe some conflict resolution discussion.
<p>
It has been amazing how the numbers of divorces, like in Peoria, have 
gone down 20 percent from the year they instituted this, and stayed
at a lower level, and in other communities that have done it.
 We're thinking of doing that for the whole state of Michigan,
by the way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fascinating.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  But again, totally outside of the legislative control.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There has to be that private-public partnering.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  We really view it as two rails on a road that brings the 
locomotive of our culture down in a quick way.  One is law, one is culture. 
Our belief is that if we can help encourage the clergy to realize that those
two things are true -- marriage is good and divorce is bad - 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: -- and then have accountability with it, the locomotive that 
we have sort of attached our culture to can have a smooth trip.
<p.
Right now, I am telling you, there are all sorts of curves and problems up 
ahead, and we've got to take a leadership position.  Quite frankly, the 
legislative leaders and federal leaders are not even talking about it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: No, they're not.  And I was wondering, Larry, on a state 
level, are there some states that are not interested in this at all?
 I mean, you look at a state like Nevada.  They make a lot of
money from the divorce machine.  I mean, they practically advertise
it.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Well, it is easier to get a divorce in Nevada than
in any other state in the Union, and the divorce rate in Nevada
is higher than any other state in the Union.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: An interesting connection.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Yes, there is a nexus there. And, yes, I think that we have a 
ways to go in shaping a consensus that justice needs to be reinstituted. 
I mean, some folks still are just not interested.  But again, I think there 
is an awakening, and I think folks are beginning to perk up and say, 
&quot;Wait a minute.  We have a responsibility here.&quot;
<p>
I mean, again, healthy marriages are the basis of civilization, and it has 
been so for centuries, and just a recognition that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And is &quot;justice&quot; the word for it?  Is that the 
phrase that you are taking forward?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  I think it really is. Yes, it is.  I mean, again, we want people 
to recognize their duty and their responsibility, and the law is a teacher, 
and the purpose and the product of law should be justice, and that's what
we must reinstitute into the divorce process.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That seems to have been almost the unspoken thing, that the law 
became the enemy of marriage rather than the advocate of it.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: I think you're right.  Also, I think that in what Larry has 
talked about regarding justice, that needs to be the point of discussion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk more about this.  When
we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at the Family Research Council's
efforts to shed some light on an interesting and possibly criminal
issue related to the famous Kinsey sex reports.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The Family Research 
Council's Director of Cultural Studies, Robert Knight, has been 
investigating the famous Kinsey reports and, with the supportive work from 
Dr. Judith Reisman, wrote and produced a documentary which provides shocking 
evidence that the Kinsey Institute could have ben involved in the sexual 
abuse of children as part of the famous Kinsey human sexuality studies.
<p>
Just last week, Bob was asked to participate in a news conference called
by Congressman Steve Stockman.  It was an attempt to spur the
government to further investigate those possible criminal allegations
involving Dr. Kinsey or other sex researchers working with him.
<p>
Let's take a look at Robert Knight's insights as <i>Straight Talk</i>
brings you Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[From a press conference held December 7, 1995, on the Child 
Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995]:
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE STOCKMAN: Today we are going to be dropping a bill that 
asks that Congress to look into whether there was any violation of the 
law regarding a study by Kinsey.
<p>
I as a public servant have no greater duty to this country than to protect 
the most innocent, and that's the children.
<p>
We are not accusing anybody at this point of anything. We are asking 
merely that we look into the study to see if there was any criminal 
activity.
<p>
What I as a government official would like to do is to find out if the 
government was involved in molesting or manipulating poor, young children for 
the benefit of so-called pseudoscience.
<p>
We are not here to ask for anything more than to look into whether criminal 
activity may have been taking place.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Hi.  I'm Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies
for the Family Research Council, and I'm writer and director of
<i>The Children of Table 34</i>, which is a half-hour documentary video
that we just released that exposes the use of children in these
sexual experiments.
<p>
It is founded on the work of Dr. Judith Reisman, who has been courageously 
trying to uncover this mystery for more than 15 years, or about 15 years. 
I mean, talk about tenacity. Dr. Reisman has been at it for more than a decade, 
and she has been ignored.  The scientific establishment has chosen not to
take up her case, and it is time they did so.
<p>
This bill, the Children Protection and Ethics in Education Act, merely asks 
Congress to let some light into the Kinsey Institute and try to determine
what happened to these children about 50 years ago in Alfred Kinsey's
famous sex studies.  He has clear tables of data revealing systematic
molestation of children.
<p>
Most recently, because of statements made by Dr. John Bancroft, current 
director of the Kinsey Institute, we have reason to believe that what Dr. 
Kinsey wrote and what the current Kinsey Institute is saying are quite at 
odds. At the very least, we have a scandal of accuracy, and at worst, we
have a scandal of criminal molestation of children in the name
of science.
<p>
We are asking Congress -- and we commend Representative Stockman, who 
is bringing this forward, along with 41 of his colleagues -- to do 
something that should have been done years ago.  Dr. Reisman pointed it 
out, that there really is no statute of limitations on crimes of this 
magnitude.  The Nuremberg laws were clear. You can't sweep something 
under the carpet for 50 years and hope it stays there.  The truth 
eventually will come out.
<p>
We have high hopes that with Congress now opening the door, and perhaps 
with some cooperation from the Kinsey Institute, we can get to the
bottom of this.  I have more hope for that than I did before,
because Dr. Bancroft broke silence on the topic.
<p>
I just mentioned earlier that he said there was a problem with the data. 
Specifically, Dr. Kinsey wrote that there were nine pedophiles who 
collected the data on the children.  Dr. Bancroft now says there was one
elderly pedophile, now dead, whose name he refuses to reveal.
<p>
We are asking Dr. Bancroft to come out with this man's name. 
Surely, if you can uncover priests molesting children, oh, 10
years ago, 20 years ago, you can uncover the name of a guy who
was supposedly responsible for much of this research 50 years
ago.
<p>
It may lead to the unraveling of the mystery.  It may tell
us how the children were obtained for the experiments, where they
got them, whether parents gave permission, where the children
are now, which ones of the children are in need of care.  This
is a traumatic experience these children went through if in fact
the data is accurate in these tables.
<p>
So Family Research Council commends Representative Stockman, Dr. Reisman, 
and everybody who is trying to get to the bottom of this, and we wish for 
a speedy resolution of this problem.
<p>
Thank you.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
One week ago today, the most exceptional minds on welfare policy and 
the most successful front-line workers met together for the Family 
Research Council's &quot;A World Without Welfare Symposium.&quot;  The 
purpose of this extraordinary event, put together by FRC policy analysts 
Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson, was to talk about a world without 
the failed safety net of government but with the loving support of a 
dependable community. If you have ever asked yourself, &quot;Is there a way 
to help people really do better?&quot; please stayed tuned.
<p>
But first, let me share with you an insightful conversation I had with one
of the key symposium speakers, Dr. Virgil Gulker.  Dr. Gulker
is the founder and president of Kids/Hope/USA, which is a revolutionary
volunteer service model that helps people get involved in the
lives of needy children and families.  He has also authored several
books about real volunteerism, written from hard experience after
founding Love, Inc., an international network of over 300,000
church volunteers.
<p>
Let's hear Dr. Gulker's perspective on one-on-one support rather than 
anonymous welfare subsidies.  It's a story you're not likely to read in a 
lot of media outlets, as we take you behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're here today with Dr. Virgil Gulker.  Thank
you so much for being with us on Behind the Headlines.
<p>
Your program, Kids/Hope/USA, is revolutionary.  How did you get started in 
this kind of unique partnership program?
<p>
DR. GULKER: I had done a lot of work with church volunteer programs, because 
I just have the absolute conviction that within the larger Body of Christ
we have the most awesome potential to get to children and families.
 When I researched Kids/Hope/USA, however, I found that there
were some changes in program models that we had to look at; that
the experts I had talked to had very clear feelings about what
the local church could do.  Virtually everyone said, &quot;Get
these folks to come alongside young children at that time in their
life when their values are being formed, their self-esteem is
being developed.&quot;
<p>
Yet when I went to the churches and asked hard questions about what a 
program model could look like, the pastors were saying, &quot;Virge, 
please don't set up another agency or program.  You need to do this. You 
need to help us reach these children and families.  But we have so many 
agencies coming to us already, saying, 'Give us your money, give us your
prayers, give us your best volunteers,' and somehow that is going
to build up the church.  In reality, it's not building up the
church; it's weakening the church.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: My own church has caring ministries, a person who makes sure 
that you get a meal if you're sick or a ride to the doctor if you need
one.  It's a volunteer program.  Are we talking about a formal
volunteer program that is overseen in the church?
<p>
DR. GULKER: What I offer a church is a system that will show them how to
recruit, train, supervise, and affirm their members specifically
for relationships with at-risk kids who are identified within
the local elementary school.
<p>
We are not putting together a pool of church volunteers; we are putting 
together those individuals from your church, for example, who really catch 
the vision for a child.  And it is really a manageable vision.  We're not 
saying we want 20 or 50 hours a week.  We're saying, &quot;Give us an
hour a week for at least a semester, and you can change the life
of a child.&quot;
<p>
We are getting reports back from teachers and school personnel that are 
so extreme, I don't even dare to put it in our literature, because no one 
would believe it.  These teachers are saying that after two sessions with a 
church volunteer, they see significant academic and behavioral improvement 
in these children.
<p>
And I think it is important for the listeners today, too, to recognize 
that for so many of these young children, especially elementary school 
children, that the primary need is not food or clothing.  Those needs may be 
present, but the primary need is to have someone come alongside them and 
affirm them; someone to say, &quot;Billy, Judy, Samantha, Jasmine, you have 
value. I care about you. I love you.&quot;  And the best way to express
that love is just to put an arm around the child and be there
for them.  The results are incredible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So what the church does is a local church says, &quot;We have 
a concern for children,&quot; and they would choose a neighborhood school, 
I am assuming --
<p>
DR. GULKER: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- a single school, an elementary school generally --
<p>
DR. GULKER:  Yes, right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And then you come in and say, &quot;All of you in
this church who are concerned about the children in the school
that is your community program, community school, we're going
to help you help these kids.&quot;
<p>
DR. GULKER: Right. In fact, we actually get involved a little earlier than 
that. Once they express interest, I don't ask them to make a commitment to 
do it.  I ask them to form an exploratory team.  We gather some folks
from the church and community and, together, we look at two questions:
 One, does the church have access to these children?  And to find
that out, we need to go into the elementary school.
<p>
I wish you could go with me on some of those visits to school as the 
principal, teacher, social workers, et cetera, sense that this collection
of people might be coming into the school to help them love the
children.  It is amazing what an impact that has on them.
<p>
The second question for us is, does that church have the commitment
and the capacity to do this kind of work?  Because we are not
just asking them to collect food baskets; we're looking for some
long-term relationships.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you define commitment and capacity?
<p>
DR. GULKER:  For me, first of all, it means finding
out whether or not a church really wants to pull this off.  Again,
because we're dealing with relationships, we dare not engage a
child if we're not serious about maintaining it.  I don't want
a church member or a church coming back saying, &quot;Well, Virge,
you didn't tell us that these kids don't smell so great,&quot;
you know, or that they're coming from homes where there's dysfunction
and so forth.
<p>
I had to find ways to really prove commitment and
capacity, and what I look for are a number of things:  One, I
want them to pay a part-time director.  Now, in churches that
ranges from a reasonable wage to a nominal fee for a church member.
 We always want someone from that church to direct the program
so we can develop and maintain relationships.
<p>
There is a modest budget that we ask the church to provide, and many 
of those line items can fit within the existing budget.  I ask, also, 
for a fee for my organization.  It is based on church size.  It ranges
from about $2,500 to $8,000 depending on the size of the church.
Right now we are working in churches ranging from about 150 members
to 3,500.  We are working experimentally with an inner-city church
with 30 members, and for them that fee is less.
<p>
Another commitment criterion for us is the willingness of the pastor to 
be one of the volunteers.  I cannot exaggerate the importance of a pastor
who puts his rear end on that little chair next to that child.
 The school and the church know at that point that they are committed.
<p>
We want a minimum of 10 volunteers who can go into the school.
 We recruit those volunteers plus substitutes; also, one prayer
partner for every adult-child relationship.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Earlier, you said that your program costs each church that 
participates a fee.  What does your program provide to the churches for 
that fee?  I am sure it doesn't underwrite the whole cost.  But what
would they receive?
<p>
DR. GULKER: It is generally about a third of what we need to set up a 
program in a church. But for that money, we offer the presentations to 
appropriate church audiences; we work with that exploratory team; we 
train the leadership team, the director; and then we provide the training 
through a Christian child psychologist for the volunteers who go into the 
schools.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The statistics on father absence in the inner cities
and in homes across America are brutal.  Clearly, this is a tremendous
social pathology.  Because of that, do you see a need for more
male volunteers?  Are you seeing the problem of father absence?
<p>
DR. GULKER: Our request now as we go into churches is that 60
percent of the volunteers be men.  I have nothing against women;
I married a woman.  But the reality is that I am so convinced
that Christian men can be God's gift to this culture if they are
willing to respond.
<p>
As we have men going into the school coming alongside these children, 
the children at first are mystified. Some of them, candidly, have no 
idea what a father model is like.
<p>
One school superintendent who reads to all of the kindergarten students 
in his district reported recently that after reading a story in a kindergarten 
class, a little girl came up to him and just looked at him very quizzically, 
and finally she said, &quot;So this is what it's like to have a daddy?&quot;
<p>
I don't know that the men in our audience, for example, know that if they
make that connection, they will never be the same, absolutely
be changed, guaranteed.  We will train you at two levels:  first,
relationship building, and second, the specific methods and materials
for working with that child.
<p>
Teachers who refer students are giving us, first, a list of positive 
characteristics of this child, because that is what the relationship will 
build around.  We need a specific objective for the child, plus we need 
periodic progress reports so that we know if we are proceeding in that child's 
life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What would be an example of an objective for a child?
<p>
DR. GULKER: Aside from relational issues, a child may need help
in learning simply to read or to read with greater proficiency.
 We have had a number of children who don't know how to spell.
 We get second and third graders who cannot read, and again, if
they don't master that skill soon, they are not going to make
it.  The probability of welfare dependence, unemployment, drug
usage, all of those personal and socially destructive behaviors,
increase in a much greater level for these children who are not
mastering those skills.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How does a volunteer achieve relationship objectives? Is 
that accomplished by then just showing up?
<p>
DR. GULKER:  A quick story.  One of our volunteers, who is
one of the wealthiest people in her county, was matched with a
child who is from one of the poorest families.  The teacher said
to her, &quot;Betty, this child has lots of needs, including some
academic.  The primary need is for someone to let him know that
he has value.  Simply by being with him, by being a kind adult
role model, you are going to communicate that to him.&quot;
<p>
Betty noticed that her little boy needed shoes, and she said to the
teacher, &quot;May I buy these shoes?&quot;  The teacher said,
&quot;Please don't do that because it is going to have a devastating
effect on the family if you do that.&quot;  Betty could buy this
boy a shoe store; she is that wealthy.  Yet she needed to understand
that the boy's greater need was for love.
<p>
I talked to her recently, and she said that as she entered the school 
recently, the boy saw her at the end of the hallway, and he threw his arms 
open wide, and he began to run down the hallway shouting her last name:
 &quot;Mrs. Matthews, Mrs. Matthews!&quot; to love her, and when
he approached her, he just wrapped her in the biggest hug.  She
was impacting his life, because suddenly he felt good enough about
himself to accept her love and return that love to her.  It is
amazing how quickly that happens.  Children are wonderfully resilient.
<p>
We get terrible referrals sometimes:  the mother of a third-grade
boy who, after having another baby this past November, went to
court, decided she didn't want the third-grader anymore, and gave
him away.  He is now living with his grandparents, and we have
a man working with him.
<p>
I think it is important for us as Christians to recognize that Christ can 
use us to be the redeeming factor in the lives of these kids.  Without our 
involvement, we will lose a generation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will bring you the 
highlights from the Family Research Council's symposium, &quot;A World 
Without Welfare.&quot;  You won't want to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are bringing you a one-of-a-kind welfare symposium, 
where those who are tackling our current welfare problems all over the 
country gathered to strategize on the kinds of changes needed to help
broken lives.  Let's take a look.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: We do have quite a lot of work before us before we can say the 
phrase, &quot;World Without Welfare,&quot; and mean more than the title of a 
one-day symposium. This day will be devoted not only to arguing that the 
welfare state needs new limits but to outlining what will be required
of us, and social conservatives in particular, if we are to realize
those limits.
<p>
We are asking for a return to the vision of our founders, and the fact that 
calls for relimiting government and rebuilding civil society should sound so 
radical to our modern ears is really a testimony to how far wrong we have 
strayed, especially in the last 30 years under Great Society programs.
<p>
One of the founders' most important insights is that the freedom of 
individuals and the vitality of communities are not competitive but 
intertwined, and that assumption has staked out a large plot of common 
ground to be shared by conservatives of all stripes.
<p>
Of all the speakers here today, Dr. O'Lasky is probably the one who needs 
the least introduction.  His work has dramatically redefined the terms of
the national welfare debate.  Please join me in welcoming Dr.
Marvin O'Lasky.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
DR. O'LASKY:  Thank you all very much. Thank you, Jennifer.
<p>
Let's start out by thinking about all the people here who are not only 
well intentioned but also intent on seeing good results, who understand 
the difference between effective compassion and what is well intentioned 
but often does exactly the opposite of what it sets out to do.
<p>
The essential problem of the welfare system now is that sometimes it 
succeeds in keeping people fed, but it kills dreams.  It kills the helping
dream of many Americans.
<p>
There is good news around the country. Folks here in this room who are 
doing it know it, that we are recovering the lost tolls of charitable success. 
We are seeing a new great cloud of witnesses emerge.
<p>
We are living in an era with many heroes who, I should say, are ordinary 
people who become heroic as they show through hard suffering with, that the 
American dream of compassion is not dead.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. We are showing you some 
highlights from last week's World Without Welfare Symposium.  Now we have
the chance to hear from Dr. Virgil Gulker, whom I spoke with earlier
in the show.  He has more to tell us about the need for volunteers
to touch the lives of those trapped in poverty.  But it's not
as hard as you might think.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995.]:
<p>
DR. GULKER:  I want to thank Jennifer E. Marshall and the Family Research 
Council for convening this very singular gathering.  I know of no other 
similar gathering that I have heard of or attended around the country. I 
think they are giving us an opportunity to discuss the critical issues
facing all of our communities, the church, and especially the
poor.
<p>
I look at the 350,000 religious congregations in this country
-- average membership roughly 100 people per congregation -- and
I think of what those 35 million Christians could accomplish.
 Their potential is awesome.  Yet I hear so little about the role
the church and its members can play in this process of reaching,
reconciling, and healing lives.
<p>
The experience of Love, Inc., says very clearly that there are Christians 
in every community who are prepared to help, to give hope, to share love, 
if they are approached, if they have the appropriate training, and if
they are affirmed for that relationship.
<p>
As Jennifer said, what I learned with Love, Inc., through the 300,000 
volunteers was that we don't need heroes.  We need very simple, very basic 
people, people like me and like many of you, who are prepared to come
alongside someone who needs principally love, nurture, and affirmation.
 The church is that sustainable local organization.
<p>
If we can give them an infrastructure, a personnel department designed to
link their members with children and families in the neighborhood,
we can change the lives of the church members and the lives of
those people.  The church simply giving out food or money or clothing
is not going to make it.  That is the same kind of commodity distribution
that the welfare system has tried for so long, and it has not
worked.
<p>
We are the Body of Christ.  We have the most awesome potential
not just to share Christ but to share that transforming, reconciling
message that can change and empower lives.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Tonight's show gives you some highlights of
FRC's &quot;A World Without Welfare&quot; Symposium.  We now hear
from Don Everly, founder of the Commonwealth Foundation and the
National Fatherhood Initiative, as well as Robert Woodson, founder
and president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,
dedicated to empowering low-income families.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: The panel he will moderate includes spokesmen from both the 
think-tank world and the grassroots, and together they will explore what 
we might be able to do to foment a new social revolution, even while 
recognizing the limits of New York and Washington to address matters of the
heart.
<p>
So please join me in welcoming Don Everly, who will make
a few introductory comments, and then we will hear from our panelists.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MR. EVERLY:  I wanted to talk -- actually, being the wrap-up panel, we 
probably carry some obligation to try to tie together the day.  Actually, 
the interesting discussion this morning about libertarianism versus 
traditionalism sort of centered on an idea that I think is actually very 
important.
<p>
There are very important arguments to be made within public policy. There 
is also very important work to be done beyond this more sterile and
fragmented debate about the actual cause and effect of the rise
of the central government and what you can actually expect if
the central government pulls out, and that is to promote social
change by nongovernmental means.  It is sort of libertarian means
to traditionalist or moral ends, if you will.
<p>
I asked that the panel be entitled &quot;Building a New Social Movement,&quot;
or I would actually prefer &quot;new social movements,&quot; plural,
because I think social movements are very different than political
movements.  They tend to be very dynamic and grassroots and independent
often of political and policy affiliations, and I want to talk,
just to set the stage for discussion, about a few of those things.
<p>
But I ask that we consider this whole question of how we, as we
are moving into this very critical period with government retreating,
can actually conceptualize and try to implement broad-based social
change through social movement. So I really compliment the FRC
for stepping into this important arena.
<p>
So I think, having set the stage, I am going to encourage the panelists 
to move in any direction they wish with this, but the suggestion was that 
we use this panel to kind of talk about how we might work as leaders
-- moral, spiritual, social, community leaders -- to orchestrate,
direct, summon forth the kind of social change on a society-wide
basis.
<p>
I will first make the introductions very briefly, just
by giving you my own personal perceptions of these very distinguished
people.
<p>
Bob Woodson really is the founding father of the American
neighborhood empowerment movement and has brought more insight
to the changing concepts and techniques of how to reclaim neighborhoods
and empower people and empower families as well as anybody and
been a voice for that, bringing into our public debate a concern
for the empowerment of neighborhoods and families.
<p>
Moving along, Ronald Moore -- and again, you have his bio with you -- I 
have been hearing so much about the program in Mississippi, as I am
sure you have, Faith and Families, and we are very, very eager
to hear about the innovative work that is being done there to
sort of throw public leadership behind the importance of churches
in providing community-based charity.
<p>
But let's start with you, Bob, and we'll move right across the table.
<p>
MR. WOODSON: Thank you. Since I run an organization that conducts 
conferences, I will take seriously the charge to be brief.
<p>
The National Centers aids low-income people in 38 states to achieve 
greater independence and self-sufficiency, and we do this by going around 
the country and studying not dysfunction of low-income people, but we 
study their capacities and their strengths and identify them as the
experts, and we have learned some things out of that experience
that I will share with you that will constitute my remarks.
<p>
But I think [there are] some principles that should guide our work.
 Bill Bennett, not too long ago at a conference, said that liberals
look at low-income people as a class of victims and conservatives
tend to look at low-income people as aliens.  I think this is
true, that some of the principles that we follow, that we find
very useful, and that the goals should be not to protect people
but to give them the capacity to protect themselves.
<p>
The second principle is the low-income neighborhoods over the past 30 
years have seen $5 trillion worth of poverty programs parachuted into
their communities by professional providers, with the requirement
that they participate.  Now I am witnessing conservative paratroopers
strapping up, prepared to parachute in, with an emphasis on what
we as outsiders can do for those people inside, and I think this
needs to be rethought and challenged.
<p>
The other principle that we can do is that we need to be careful to strip 
labels from people. I think it is possible to be appalled at one group 
attacking another group because of their race or their religion.  We ought
to be upset about that, without having to identify the race of
the villain or the race of the victim.  We ought to be against
violence and insensitivity and bigotry, regardless of the perpetrators.
<p>
Another point that I think would be critical, and that is to not
just offer charity to poor people but use the considerable political
and economic strength of churches and church-goers and others
to remove the kinds of government barriers that prohibit faith-based
organizations from properly serving their own peers.  I think
professional credentialing is the primary barrier that low-income
providers have that is enshrined in state and local and federal
policy; that certification is not synonymous with qualification.
 It is elitist, and those elitists are not just liberals.  Poor
people have to confront conservative elitism, too.
<p>
And so, therefore, if conservatives really wanted to make a difference 
in terms of empowering people, they should work as we have done with the 
National Institute of Justice, Clint Boleck(?), World magazine, and 
Christian broadcast, when many of the groups that we help have transformed
the lives of thousands and thousands of hard-core drug addicts
by using Jesus Christ and the gospel.  But yet they are confronted
with state policies that require them to have master's degrees
as providers.
<p>
But yet it is very difficult to get conservative politicians interested 
in such an issue, and therefore, I think a group like this and others 
ought to look at ways that they can mobilize to remove the barriers.
<p>
The other thing we can do as a principle is to look upon some of these 
local providers not as objects of our charity but teachers of us, because 
many of them have overcome some of the greatest difficulties that life
ever serves up.
<p>
Secondly, they do not believe in rehabilitation. Rehabilitation attempts 
to restore you to what you were before. Grassroots people do not believe 
in rehabilitation. They believe in transformation.  They don't want the 
person to return to what they were before; they want them to return to a 
new person, to become a new person.  They are the experts at this, and 
there is a lot that we can learn.
<p>
I would like to see scholars sit at the feet at some of these experts, 
question them, explore with them how they were able to do what they do, 
and make low-income providers the experts.  It is quite possible today 
for people to be experts on poor people, be they left or right, and never
talk to a single poor person.
<p>
The other thing that I think you can do is to stop studying failure and 
study success.  Conservative scholars look down their nose at capacity 
studies of poor people. This ought to change.
<p>
And finally, I think that we need to remove the barriers that separate 
people across the divide, that we need to disaggregate poverty. Some 
people are poor because of external circumstance.  For people like that, 
a helping hand is all they need.  But the kind of poverty that troubles 
most of us is caused by moral and spiritual crisis, and that can be saved 
not by some outsider coming in offering a helping hand, but that outsider
should strengthen local providers.
<p>
What I find troubling about a lot of mentoring programs, it assumes 
that people, institutions that are indigenous to those communities do not 
have the capacity to heal.  So, therefore, I think, before you rush to 
recruit volunteers to go into low-income neighborhoods and reach out for a 
child, you ought to first determine whether or not there is a local antibody
that is resident in that neighborhood that is already doing that,
and what can you do to strengthen that local antibody to reach
that child.  Because sometimes, if I were to come into your home,
walk past you to tutor your child, take them to the zoo, and then
buy them shoes, what does it do to your relationship to your child?
<p>
So let's not assume that all low-income people are not responsible
parents or there are not institutions indigenous that could play
a constructive role. I will end on that.
<p>
[Applause.]

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>.  We continue
to bring you the Family Research Council's World Without Welfare
Symposium.
<p>
Now we will hear from the Reverend Ronald Moore, who
pastors two churches and is the field coordinator for the Mississippi
Faith and Families Program.
<p>
Then FRC's Jennifer E. Marshall, the symposium's creator and organizer, 
will give her insight into the day's successes and our welfare state's 
future.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
REV. MOORE: Good afternoon.
<p>
So many times, we are concerned about being politically
correct.  Since I'm a Baptist preacher, I don't have to worry
about that.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
If I was an atheist this afternoon, I would tell you that man perhaps 
crawled up out of a slime pit; in his crawl, he lost his tail; that man 
wasn't created, he evolved. But I am not an atheist; I am a Baptist 
preacher. So God created man.
<p>
If I was Black Muslim today, I would tell you to put all
your faith and trust in Honorable Elijah Mohammed.  But my Bible
tells me that my Savior was born in Bethlehem. Elijah Mohammed
was born in Georgia.
<p>
My Bible tells me that my Savior would die one Friday afternoon on a 
cross. Elijah Mohammed died in a hospital. My Bible tells me that my Savior 
would get up the third day morning. Elijah Mohammed has been dead a long 
time. He hasn't gotten up yet.  So all of my faith and trust is in Jesus 
Christ. I believe that Jesus Christ changes lives.
<p>
A few years ago, before Kirk Fordice was elected governor of Mississippi, 
many people were wondering, what are we going to do about this decadent 
mess that we have in this state.  We are the poorest state in the Nation.
 We have the highest rate of unemployment.  We have the highest
rate of teenage pregnancy, and we have more children being born
out of wedlock than any other state in the Union.  So we've got
some problems.
<p>
But finally, our governor, after riding through our state, looking at this 
decadent mess that we have, going from housing complex to housing complex, 
going from community to community, just threw up his hands and said, 
&quot;Listen. Government created this mess.  Maybe government can help fix 
it, but not alone. Government can only help.  But this problem has to be 
turned over to an entity that has been empowered to change not just conditions
but change the lives of individuals.  This needs to be turned
over to an entity that doesn't just treat the effects of problems
but can treat the cause of the problems.&quot;  He asked the local
churches to become involved in the lives of welfare recipients.
<p>
You know, we have spent, someone said earlier, over $5 trillion
in this war on poverty, and in Mississippi we have had every job
training program that you can imagine. We have had every food
program, every program that you can imagine to help the homeless
and help children that have been born out of wedlock, and we're
still in the same condition we were in some 15 years ago.
<p>
So what needs to be done?  Well, first of all, we realized that we had
to get the churches involved, that we needed some positive grassroots
action from the local level to engage the lives of these AFDC
families.
<p>
The governor of our state asked all of our churches -- we have 5,500 
churches in Mississippi -- to adopt at least one welfare family.  We 
have 55,000 AFDC recipients in Mississippi, and out of that 55,000, if you 
were going to see the profile on a particular family, you are probably 
going to find out that these families, 80 percent are African-American 
mothers. You are going to find out that they read perhaps on a sixth, seventh, 
or eighth grade level, and most of them have four to five children, and
they haven't worked in the last 10 or 12 years, and they have
all been on AFDC all of their lives.
<p>
So he realized we had a problem and realized that we needed to work with 
these AFDC recipients. So what must we do?  Well, we asked the churches to 
become involved. We asked every church to adopt a family.  And in Mississippi,
we have the only state-church-family partnership right now in
the Nation.  The program is called Faith and Family.  We ask that
each and every church would adopt one family that has been referred
to that church by the state.  Each and every family is an AFDC
family.
<p>
We ask the church to adopt the family, determine the needs
of that family, and address those particular needs.  Each and
every church has some idea of how they are going to address a
particular need of a particular family because those families
are normally centered around that church.  Normally, the church
members are aware.  They know these particular individuals.  And
the churches are only interested that can provide that one-on-one
intervention.
<p>
In Mississippi we have case workers that work for the state. Each case 
worker has about 250 clients that they simply call up and say, &quot;How 
are you doing?&quot; and they hang up the telephone.  We want to reverse 
the ratio. Why not, instead of having one case worker to 250 welfare clients, 
give one church with 250 members one AFDC family?  And you have 250 people 
seeing about one family.
<p>
We have been able to change some things with
that, because we have jobs programs in our state that have spent
$300,000 to $400,000 and have yet to put anybody to work.  We
have other programs that have worked with the poor, that have
worked with the homeless, and we have seen no results of their
work, basically because they have been trying to work with individuals
from the outside, and the church is able to work with them from
within.
<p>
We don't want to change just the condition; we want to
change the person, because if you change the person, the person
can change their own conditions.  When you walk into housing complexes,
you can walk in some apartments, in one apartment, walk into three
others without ever going outside, because you have people who
live there who don't care.  They have no hope, they have no responsibility.
 Since there is no responsibility, there is no sense of accountability.
 So we realize that there has to be a great change.
<p>
So as the church adopts the family and begins the program to change the
life of this family, to upgrade this particular family, to change
their life from a life of dependence upon the government to a
life of self-sufficiency, they move through that with a series
of courses.
<p>
Each and every church has gone about doing this differently.
 Some of them have taught basic hygiene, grooming, preparing resumes.
 All of this is taught, however, from a Biblical perspective.
<p>
In the past, in our jobs programs, they have been able to go to
school, sit there for an hour to hear what the teacher has to
say, and leave.  They go back the next day and the next day, and
they are in the jobs program some 10, 15 years, and they never
find a job because no one has really met the total needs, or the
real need hasn't been met.  So we have been able to address the
real need of the family.
<p>
This has really upset a lot of people because they really don't 
understand the concept of what we are trying to do in Faith and 
Families. No one is trying to proselytize families.  We are trying to 
take them and ask the church to find out what their needs are, introduce 
them to a divine entity. Hopefully, they will accept that.  If not, teach 
them other life-coping skills that this family can leave a life of 
government dependence to a life of self-sufficiency.
<p>
And it is so simple.  It is simply going back to the basics, because, you 
know, you have young ladies who are on AFDC, who have never worked.  She 
becomes 18 or 19. She has a child.  She moves out of the home of her mother, 
moves into an apartment, and she is asked to take care of that apartment.
 She receives a welfare check of $96 a month, a utility voucher
of $86 a month.  She is given a Medicaid card and given $306 of
food stamps and said, &quot;Listen.  Live your life.&quot;
<p>
We put her in that apartment.  We expect her to take care of it.
 But she doesn't know how to wash dishes.  She doesn't know how
to comb a child's hair.  She doesn't know anything about proper
grooming.  She knows nothing about health and proper hygiene.
<p>
So, consequently, when that child leaves home, he goes to school
and he tears up the classroom.  Consequently, when she leaves
home, goes to try to find a job, she will go into the person's
office who is going to hire her or interview her with five or
six earrings in her ear, six or seven in the other ear, an earring
in her nose, with braids all in her hair, because she has no concept
of what proper grooming should be like.
<p>
So we are asking the churches, have asked the churches, and the churches 
are doing this.  We are just simply going back to basics.  We'll teach 
them how to say, &quot;Yes, ma'am&quot; and &quot;No, ma'am,&quot; 
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; &quot;No, sir,&quot; how to carry yourself, how to
dress properly, how to spend your food stamps.  And, finally and
hopefully, we try to get them to accept Christ or try to get them
to change their total concept of the religious community.  Hopefully,
they will join the church.  But we cannot proselytize.  If they
decide to, that's fine.  If not, we don't worry about that.
<p>
But the state, the church and family working together, we have been
able to take girls who have never worked in their lives, who have
been parts of other jobs programs, who have worked with those
programs who have not been able to find employment for them. 
We have been able to put each and every one of these families
to work.
<p>
In the state of Mississippi now, we have about 190 churches
involved in Faith and Families over this one-year period.  Out
of that 190 churches, we have a total of about 200 families involved.
 At this particular time, eight families have been moved totally
off of welfare; another 55 are about to come off of welfare. 
We have another 206 churches about to enter the program.
<p>
If we can take every church in Mississippi and adopt five families,
we would have half of our AFDC population off of welfare and into
a work environment within a one-year period.
<p>
And not only that; we are addressing the residual effect of what has 
happened, because when you train the mother to go home and train her 
children -- and, interesting enough, what is so good that our church 
members have been able to see, we have been able to see a young lady that
we have taken into the church and train her in life-coping skills,
teach her how to take care of herself, and go back home with her
and watch that young lady take Clorox, take detergent, and clean
up that filth that she had been living in for the last 10 or 15
years.  It is remarkable how, when that change takes effect in
her life, that she will go back,and instead of passing the telephone
from apartment to apartment, she'll take sheetrock and nail it
up to the wall, take masking tape and mask it, paint the house,
because she realizes, she has learned that she needs to be responsible,
that she has to be accountable; that if she wants to go up, she
is going to have to be able to change her attitude.  And we have
been able to do that with each and every family that we have adopted.
<p>
The state's role in this program is simply to refer families to
the churches and to offer the ongoing technical assistance.  The
case management entity stays involved, because they are the advocate
for that particular family.
<p>
Now, one problem with our program, and you might find this in your state. 
There is a huge welfare bureaucracy in Mississippi, and they have tried 
everything that they could do to tear down Faith and Families, because the 
case workers feel that they are going to lose their jobs and that the
churches are going to become case managers.  The social workers
feel the churches are going to become social work entities.
<p>
So, a few months ago, they started sending us families with sixth,
seventh, and eighth grade educations, and everybody was saying,
&quot;Listen.  There is no way you're going to be able to place
these people.  They can't do anything.  Most of them can't read,
they can't write, they don't know how to talk.  What are we going
to do with them?&quot; And our governor was a little worried about
that.
<p>
Within the last month, we put together a database of about
15,000 families in Mississippi.  Each of these 15,000 families
have a specific need, and that need is they need domestic workers.
 They need someone to come into those homes that can wash dishes,
that can clean floors, that can wash the windows, that can take
care of children, and we're going to refer these sixth and seventh
and eighth grade clients; we are going to train them and refer
them to those people who need domestic workers.  Domestic work
in Mississippi is not like it was 40 years ago.  Domestic workers
make $250 to $350 per week.  Most of them have medical and dental
coverage.
<p>
What I am simply saying is, every individual can find
work, and whenever they find work, there is a sense of dignity.
 It develops dignity, it develops accountability,   it develops
responsibility, and their moral and their ethical lives are changed,
and I am not talking about a temporary change; we are talking
about a permanent change.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MR. EVERLY: Very good.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: I just want to close by saying that I think, in
the end, we are going to adopt our answers by default, because
there is no alternative strategy, and at the moment we really
sort of have two competing alternatives.  Either we create an
underclass and we treat them as wards of a custodial state and
we just spend lavishly to keep them comfortable while we ask them
to leave us alone, or we can begin restoring functions to neighborhoods
and communities and to churches.
<p>
I think the fate of our experiment with self-government really depends on 
our capacity to begin renewing a sense of responsibility but across all 
income brackets, coupled with a renewed commitment to our founding fathers' 
faith that all men, every single one is created equal to live up to those
responsibilities.
<p>
[Applause.]

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight <i>Straight Talk</i> is celebrating Christmas with you, sharing 
the sights and sounds of the holiday season throughout our Nation's 
Capital. It's easy to forget sometimes that Washington, D.C., is a city
of many people with lives and families and special traditions
of their own.
<p>
We will be showing you how a very special organization
makes a difference in the lives of children who are not fortunate
enough to share Christmas with their parents.  These are the children
of adults who are incarcerated.
<p>
And we have a surprise guest, Dr. James Dobson, president and founder of 
Focus on the Family, a best-selling author and psychologist, and a man who 
has been a powerful voice for family, reaching millions every week.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Phil Olsen, the Family Research Council's
Vice President for Resource Development. In his many travels across
the United States, Phil has had the opportunity to talk to Americans
face to face, building relationships on behalf of FRC.  But his
career, like his brother, Merlin Olsen, began on the football
field as an award-winning athlete.  His work with children's sports
camps and charities led eventually to Family Research Council.
 So join me as Phil Olsen shares his experiences through the eyes
of a caring citizen, not a politician, as we take you behind the
headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are very excited that Phil could join us today on Behind 
the Headlines.  Phil, you and your staff travel around the country.
 You meet a lot of people, real Americans.  At this time of year,
what is uppermost on people's minds?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, Kristi, we do get the opportunity to travel quite a 
bit. As you know, we have a field staff that represents the Family Research 
Council, and we have the opportunity to travel around the country and meet
with our donors and our supporters, and it is truly a phenomenal
opportunity for us to get a chance to meet these people.  And
there are a number of things on their minds.  They are very concerned
about the direction that America is headed.  They are very concerned
about the impact that decisions that are being made here in Washington,
D.C., will have on their families.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, Family Research Council, under your staff, does a poll 
of the people who support us. What did they say were their top concerns in 
the poll that you all did this year?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Actually, we did a poll earlier this year, in January and February, 
and it is important to us as an organization that is representing families in 
America to find out what families in America think are important, the
issues that are important to them.
<p>
We were interested to discover that, this year, the most pressing issue on 
people's minds has been education, you know, what is going to happen in 
terms of the education of their children.  And parents are very concerned
about the Federal Government's intrusion into the education of
the young.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Any surprises in the poll as you were taking a look at it?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Not really. I think that issues that are important to America -- 
sanctity of life, abortion, pornography, health care -- a lot of these are 
near the top of that list, as well.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Phil, you have had a very broad career:
 one of nine; you were a football player with the L.A. Rams and
with the Broncos; you have worked for network television.  You
have spoken, you have worked with kids.  You have seen people
who are very wealthy, people who are very poor.
<p>
What common themes, though, do you see?  Are these people facing the same 
kinds of problems on the different ends of the spectrum?  What are people
really struggling with?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  I think we all face the same problems. I mean, some might have 
more money than others, and maybe the ability to buy some success or to buy 
some relief, but I think, in the final analysis, Kristi, we are all faced 
with the same challenges, and that no amount of money, no amount of
power or prestige or opportunity can really make up for failure
in the home.  No success really can make up for failure in the
home.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Is that what is driving people, a concern
over the success or failure of their homes?  Is that the kind
of common challenges you are seeing?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I think so, and I think that people -- unfortunately, too many 
people -- are listening to the messages of our culture, and our culture 
does not tell them the truth.  And I think that there is a lot of 
frustration there as people chase solutions that they think are going to 
provide them with the kind of happiness and satisfaction they seek, only
to find, when they get there, that there is nothing there but
an empty bag.
<p>
I think there is a lot of frustration, a lot of disappointment, in our 
society, and I think that that is another reason why people are coming back 
to issues that affect the family, because they realize that in the final 
analysis, they need to protect their family.  They need to protect their 
children. They need to try to create a situation and a circumstance where 
they can provide for the needs of their children without the fear of
intrusion from the outside.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There are a lot of people out there who may be in their 
sixties and seventies and eighties who would define themselves as liberals 
or moderates, or on all different sides of the political spectrum.  Are you 
finding that, though, the presence of children and people kind of grappling
with home failures are bringing them back more toward a conservative,
pro-family side?  As you look at our constituents, have they come
from a lot of backgrounds to a pro-family perspective, or have
they always been there?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  I think that's a good point. I think that our constituents 
are across the spectrum.  I mean, you find them in every walk of life 
and in every financial circumstance, and I think that is one of the 
things that excites me, that we don't represent a small group of 
constituents out there; we represent Americans who, across the board, 
believe in the same kinds of things that we do.
<p>
We are talking about traditional Judeo-Christian values. We are talking 
about the values that have proven themselves over time.
<p>
One of the things that excites me about being involved
here with the Family Research Council, Kristi, is the fact that
every time we embark upon a research project, or every time we
validate research that has been done by others, it tends to validate
Biblical principles, principles that have been proven over thousands
of years to work.  And that is an exciting thing for me.
<p>
I think that our constituents out there are coming to realize the very
same thing.  They know what works.  They know what doesn't work,
and too many times out of bad circumstances or bad experiences
where they have seen things that have happened either in their
family or in other families.  It only brings back even that much
harder the message of the importance of protecting their family
and their children and their future.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: If you would describe a pro-family American, how would you 
describe that person? What are they like?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Well, that's an excellent question. I think that to me a 
pro-family American is just that; he is pro-family. He is focused on 
the welfare of his family and of other families as well.  I think that 
these are people that we are seeing out there, and most of them are not 
only interested in what is best for their family but in trying to do 
things that would benefit other families, as well.  And so I think that 
that, maybe in a nutshell, would capture that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Phil, we thank you so much for being with us in Behind the 
Headlines and look forward to seeing you again.
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I thank you, Kristi. It has been great to be with you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, we will be taking you on a 
Washington, D.C., Christmas journey, and we will also be joined by Prison 
Fellowship's Mark Morgan, whose Angel Tree organization is brightening the
lives of many, many children, especially during this holiday season.
 Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Christmas scenes.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  All over the Nation, families celebrate Christmas
and the holiday season with their own unique traditions.  But
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> would like to 
share with you a glimpse into the many celebrations throughout 
Washington, D.C., as we take you on our own special tour of Christmas in 
the Capital.
<p>
[Christmas scenes.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Each year, the National Christmas tree lighting ceremony, 
which originated on December 24, 1913, draws people from around the world. 
<p>
Christmas and the holiday season have special meaning to each of us.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: Christmas is a time for me and my family to get together and
come across the oceans and see how everybody has grown over the
year.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas means a time of the year in which
everyone develops a sense of joy and happiness and finds pleasure
in doing for others to a degree to which afterwards you might
regret, but in any case, while Christmas is going on, it's a great
time.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Good will to your fellow human being and an
extra day off of work.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas means time with my family and my friends and just 
a moment to reflect on life and be thankful for what I got.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: Christmas means to me sharing time with my family, going to 
church, and buying lots of gifts for my kids.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas to me is a time of giving and have thanks. Christmas 
is every day.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: It means the spirit of giving, and we are celebrating the 
birth of Jesus Christ, and that is what it should be about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ministries and outreach programs throughout Washington, 
D.C., help create some extra special Christmas memories in many lives.
<p>
[From Angel Tree celebration segment]:
<p>
SPOKESMAN: Angel Tree is a wonderful ministry of Prison Fellowship 
Ministries. It gives moms and dads that just happen to be away from their 
boys and girls at Christmas and who are in prison, it gives them an 
opportunity to fill out an application and to ask nice people, like the 
Congressional wives, if they wouldn't please buy a present for you so that 
you know that your mom and dad that can't be with you love you very
much.
<p>
And so that is what Angel Tree is all about.  These presents
are from your father or your mother that can't be here today,
and it says that your mom or dad loves you very much and that
Jesus Christ loves you very much, and we hope that this makes
your Christmas just a little brighter.
<p>
[Gift-giving segment.]
<p>
SPEAKER: So who did Jesus come for?
<p>
AUDIENCE: Everybody.
<p>
SPEAKER: All people, everybody from every land.  And whose Son is he?
<p>
AUDIENCE: God's.
<p>
SPEAKER: The Son of God.  Very good.  And that is the true Christmas 
story.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  With us tonight is Mark Morgan, the National Project 
Coordinator for Angel Tree Ministries of Prison Fellowship,. We just caught 
a small glimpse of how this ministry is impacting children's lives, and
Mark is here to tell us more.  Welcome, Mark.  Thanks so much
for being with us.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Thanks, Kristi.  It is great to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I hope by now that everybody has seen this little triangle 
somewhere in their church or in their community. But in case they 
haven't, what is Angel Tree?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Angel Tree is a gift-giving program for the children of 
prisoners at Christmas time.  It is an inmate-initiated program, where 
our local staff people all over the country take applications into
federal and state institutions and in some places county jails
and give those applications to inmates who fill them out, give
us the name, age, birth date of their children, and we pass those
out by location, almost by ZIP code, even, to churches and groups
in the community where the children are living.  So even federal
inmates, say, in Washington State, their children living in Georgia
will be served by people living in Georgia in that area.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it got started -- inmate initiated.  Someone said at one 
time, &quot;Wow, I wish somebody could give a present to my child&quot;?
 How did it get started?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  It started 14 years ago by a lady named Mary Kay Beard who 
was herself an inmate in the Julia Tetwiler(?) prison in Alabama.  She and 
several other women were incarcerated, and she noticed that the women 
were stockpiling like little soaps and toiletries, shampoos and things, 
that churches and volunteers would bring into the prison, and these women 
would stockpile them and then at Christmas time gave those as Christmas
gifts to their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Wow.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: And when Mary Kay was out and now working as the Prison 
Fellowship area director in Alabama herself, she and another woman said, 
&quot;We've got to do something for the children of prisoners at 
Christmas time.&quot;
<p>
So in two malls, one in Montgomery, Alabama, and one in Birmingham, 
Alabama, they set up an angel tree and put paper angels, cut out in 
the shape of angels, on the tree with the names of about 500 children in 
the area, and then people, passers-by in the mall, would come and take the 
angel off. And so that year, over 14 years ago, 566 kids got gifts from 
their parents in prison on behalf of church volunteers and also passers-by 
in the mall.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Community and --
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Community members.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, today, though, you are serving up to a million?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  We think there are nearly a million children who
have parents in prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is amazing.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Prison Fellowship volunteers and churches and organizations 
across the country this year will minister to over 470,000 children,
we think, who have parents in prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I was very intrigued, reading a little bit about the program, 
that if your father was incarcerated or your mother was incarcerated, you 
have a six-times-more-likely chance to also go into a life of crime,
and often beginning in the third grade.
<p>
I hadn't thought of it like this before, but are you at Prison Fellowship 
looking at Project Angel Tree as a way to turn children from a certain path?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Definitely.  Angel Tree is merely just a present
-- it is more than just a present under the tree, but it starts
out as a present and it becomes a year-long involvement in the
life of that family through the volunteers in the community that
are getting involved through Angel Tree.
<p>
We see Angel Tree as being a foot in the door for year-round ministry to 
these families. Because the children are likely to end up in prison, many 
of the inmates who are in prison there now say that they also had
a parent or a sibling in prison.  And so we see a huge cycle of
crime, and we are trying to break that family cycle and get in
and close the gap that is caused by the incarceration; also make
an impact on the child's life.
<p>
We are doing more than just Christmas Angel Tree. We are now involving 
kids in other projects throughout the year to try to make an impact.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The first time I heard about Project Angel Tree was on a Dr. 
James Dobson -- and we get to meet him a little bit later in the program 
-- on a broadcast where they said, &quot;We need more presents.  We
have a tremendous shortage.  Mail little Walkmans to the Angel
Tree headquarters.&quot;
<p>
I mean, the coordination for prisoners and volunteers and delivery, that's 
a lot of people.  I mean, how have you guys handled the growth from 500 
presents in a mall to a million children today?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Well, it is a logistical challenge, and we --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Nightmare?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Not a nightmare totally, but it is a great challenge for us. 
If it were not for over 14,000 churches and some 75,000 volunteers that
get involved in this program -- we think it is the largest program
of its kind that is ministering to children of prisoners involving
so many people, nearly a million volunteers a year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How do you get hooked up, though, because you all -- now, 
do all the names come to Prison Fellowship?  You are the disseminators.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Right.  We have an office in almost every state,
and they receive the applications, and then they recruit churches
throughout the year, and volunteers, radio stations, businesses,
Christian Bible studies, and so there is a large group of people
that are offering throughout the year to get involved during the
Christmas season, and then we provide them with training materials,
a video tape about the program, the posters, and all the materials
that they need to run the program, and then they call -- 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Then do a lot of these people stay involved throughout
the year?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  They do.  They are now getting involved in the families 
throughout the year, not only just buying the gift and bringing it back 
and delivering it, by either having a party that we saw in the video or 
delivering door-to-door to the families.
<p>
When you deliver door-to-door or bring them into a church through a 
church party, you've got an instant contact and you have been face-to-face 
with them, and then it is easy to continue ministry by sending birthday 
cards or providing food to the families during the holiday times when it is 
tough.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I know some friends of mine, and I have heard this story
regularly.  They are getting in their car, and they are driving
to deliver some gifts, and it is getting a little scary.  And
then they get there, and the reception that they receive is so
amazing.  I mean, is it the kind of thing that some of the volunteers
are having some adventures in trying to deliver this?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: We see that a lot of times.  There are some children that 
live in areas of town that you normally wouldn't go into.  But we call
ahead to the families.  We ask our volunteers to check, to pick
a time that they know is going to be a lot better, maybe on a
Saturday morning when there is better daylight, and they go to
the families.  They are knocking on doors and they don't seem
to see any response.  But then you look up and see coming out
of the second-floor window all these faces peering out, looking
for you, waiting for you to show up, and then running down and
receiving you.
<p>
When you take gifts in to these families, often they have no tree. If 
they do, it's a Charlie Brown Christmas tree, you know, the typical very 
small tree, and rarely are there any gifts under the tree, and so we 
also try to provide care-giver gifts, whether it is just a food basket or 
something.  But we really see that these people want us to come into 
their homes. They don't trust anybody. Nothing has ever been done for 
them, many times.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  And so it is great to see somebody caring for them and actually 
smiling and saying that they love them and giving the gifts on behalf of 
the incarcerated parent and in the name of Christ.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you kind of had an experience like that.  You were trying 
to find a house, and it was a little bit tough.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What happened?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I was with a friend of mine from work with Prison Fellowship, 
and we had decided to deliver gifts in Southeast D.C.  We went across 
the bridge into Anacostia, and it was after a time that I had personally 
been a victim of crime, and I was a little wary of going into the area we 
always hear about being the crime capital.
<p>
And as I approached the house, there were four young guys standing there, 
but they were really strong looking and had their hoods pulled down over 
their heads and their coats really wrapped around tight, and they asked us
what we wanted and what we were doing there, and I said, &quot;Well,
we're here to deliver gifts to Robert's family.&quot;  And these
kids -- they looked like men -- they immediately melted into teenagers
and into children, and they said, &quot;That's us.&quot;  The
oldest kid said, &quot;That's me.  That's my family.&quot;  And
so they took us into the house and we sat around and passed out
the gifts and mentioned that we really wanted to come in at Christmas
time, and it was just an amazing story.
<p>
But you see these kids that are putting on a strong persona and are --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And they're kids at heart.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  They are truly kids, but because Dad is not there, they are 
having to defend the family, and they are watching their home front, and 
so it is something we have to be careful of.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is the 800 number, very quickly, for people who want to 
get involved?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: It is 1-800-398-HOPE.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  398-HOPE.  Great.  We are going to be looking forward to 
hearing more.  Please join us after the commercial break as we continue to 
hear about the Angel Tree program and Prison Fellowship.  We'll let you know 
what you can do to help touch the lives of those who are incarcerated and 
the families they left behind.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I am joined once again
by Mark Morgan of the Angel Tree Ministry of Prison Fellowship,
an organization which gives hope to prison inmates and their families.
 Welcome back.
<p>
We were talking a little bit through the break about Prison Fellowship, 
and frankly, you know, you look at Angel Tree.  It is a program that is going 
to give gifts to the children of prisoners.  But, you know, every year, there 
are so many people you could give to.  Why would you give to those families? 
Why target those children?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Well, a lot of times I, myself, wonder why would we want to 
do something for an inmate specifically. But these people are people who have 
been, whether it is circumstance or by choice, they have chosen to be part of 
crime, and they are now part of that, but their families are suffering, and 
there is a huge number of children in this young children demographic
now, this wave that is coming, and if these children fall in the
footsteps of their parents -- our prisons are overcrowded now
-- there is not going to be any place for these kids, and we want
to get involved before they get involved in hurting others who
are victims, you know, to victimize others, and we also want to
get in there and just share love with them to change them, to
get them involved in a better way of life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I think what is kind of ironic, statistically speaking, is 
just today in the <i>New York Times</i>, for example, they were talking 
about the ending of one crime wave, the beginning of another, as the baby
boomers have gotten older, and maybe they don't want to run and
climb in and out of windows so much.  The crime rate has gone
down, but they are predicting a massive increase of crime as the
children of the baby boomers hit the teen years, a 21 percent
increase among youth crime, which is frightening if you think
about children on street corners.
<p>
But my question is, have you seen through this project any of these children's 
lives changed? Are you seeing children getting involved in ministry, children
frankly having a relationship with the faith community and with
a personal faith that is changing their lives?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: There are churches and groups that have adopted their Angel Tree 
families and are involved with them year round.  They are now involved
in the churches, and we have quite a few Angel Tree recipients
now who are actually involved as Angel Tree volunteers themselves,
who are going out and ministering to others in their own peer
group to share how the ministry and how Prison Fellowship and
Angel Tree has touched their lives.
<p>
We even have -- one of my favorite stories is of a camp that has sponsored 
Angel Tree kids for the last five or six years now up in Maine.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  There are children from New England that
get to go each year, and one of the children's names is Bo Price.
 He was a camper for several years as an Angel Tree child.  He
got involved, volunteers were involved in his life.  His grandmother
and he were involved very heavily in the church they went to that
ministered to them, and he ended up being the top student in his
school and is probably going to be involved as a camp counselor
at this camp in the next year or so.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is fantastic.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: So he has turned his life around.  We got in at a
time where he was young enough and it was a time where we could
minister to him.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And vulnerable.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And ready to be reached out.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Definitely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What about to the people in prisons? I mean, I am
assuming it has to touch the children.  But does it make your
ministry into the prisons work better?  It certainly is a practical
step to show them that you care about them and their families.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I mentioned earlier that Angel Tree is a foot in
the door for year-round ministry for the families.  But it is
also a foot in the door in the prison systems for us as Prison
Fellowship, started by Chuck Colson over 17 or 18 years ago now --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Very impressive.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: -- has grown in the prison system.  But inmates are still 
wary of going into the chapel programs and into any volunteer-led programs 
sometimes. But when an inmate finds out that his kids have received gifts
from Prison Fellowship, that somebody has actually done something
for their family, has actually dared to go into the area where
they live, has dared to cross the threshold of their home, has
gone in and given gifts to the family and spent time with the
mother or the grandmother, whoever is taking care of the kids,
many inmates just say, &quot;I can't believe you actually did
something for me.&quot;  And they are more open and receptive
and will then go into the Prison Fellowship Bible studies or marriage
seminars where their marriages can be restored.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Is this one of the biggest doors that you have?  I mean, 
Prison Fellowship works certainly one on one in the prisons and in Bible
studies and in a lot of practical things to show people that there's
a life for them beyond the bars.  But are you finding that Angel
Tree is one of the better ways to get through to their own heart?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  It sure is.  In a sense, it is a cup of cold water
presented in Christ's name to the families, to the inmates.  Even
the volunteers that get involved really see how easy it is to
be involved in ministry.  And because of that, more and more inmates
are getting involved in the prisons, in the Bible studies.  The
church behind the walls of the prison is growing, and that is
great, because there needs to be a place of comfort and rest for
inmates behind the bars, because there is a lot of stress and
struggles for them.  But also for the families, it is a great
ministry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are seeing statistically -- at Family Research Council, 
we like statistics -- that father absence is one of the key sources of a 
problem in the child's life, not that they don't need their mother, but 
there generally is one care-giver, and the dad is missing.
<p>
How has Angel Tree helped fathers maybe re-engage in the child's life?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: We are working more and more to do that, because when 
inmates are released from prison, they go back into their homes, into 
their families, and want to immediately assume the role of father again. 
However, their children, if they have boys, those boys have assumed that 
responsibility and that role.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: And even the mother who is working and holding down two or 
three jobs is taking care of the family, and all of a sudden, the father 
wants to come back in and assume his responsibilities.  There is a lot that
they need to know, and through some of our other programs, through
Angel Tree and some of the communications we are getting -- we
have a booklet that we give to the prisoners when they fill out
their applications.  We are using those as tools to try to train
the parents, you know, to parent from prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ah, that is fascinating.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: So there is an area of parenting from prison that the inmates 
need to assume their responsibility, and Angel Tree is a chance for them 
to again be a steppingstone into the family again, to bridge that gap, to 
speak to their children through a gift and through a note written on their 
application saying that, &quot;Just wanted you to know that&quot; --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That I have been thinking about you.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: -- &quot;that I'm thinking of you, that I haven't forgotten 
you.&quot; And a lot of times the kids will say, &quot;I told you my daddy 
wouldn't forget me,&quot; or, &quot;I told you my mom wouldn't forget 
me.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, in addition, for those people who get involved,
a gospel message is given with each gift.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Right. Angel Tree is different than other Christmas gift-giving 
programs in that it is done in the name of Christ and in the name of an
incarcerated parent.  Some of the materials we have developed
through American Bible Society have been -- as a gift from them,
they gave us Scripture pieces to give to all of the Angel Tree
children, the care-givers, and also the inmates this past year,
both in English and in Spanish, to those families that we have,
and they have allowed us to print on the inside just an easy step-by-step
tool of what is Angel Tree. It is the Christmas story.  These
different pieces -- there are three of them for the kids that
are age-appropriate.
<p>
But it also gives us a chance to share the Christmas story and what is 
the Christmas gift and to lead them in a knowledge of what Christmas is all 
about, that Jesus was given as a Christmas gift, and that He is love, and we 
try to introduce love into those facilities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: These children don't get to see a lot of that, do they?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: No. As I said, the kids on the street that I ran into and other 
families that I have delivered to and that I have been involved with, even
the kids who come to some of the camps that we are having Angel
Tree kids at, there is such a solid, Don't mess with me, this
is who I am, this hard outer shell, but after just a couple of
kind words and a little trust-gaining, they just melt, and they
are so eager for love and eager for a positive role model, because,
as you mentioned, Dad or Mom is gone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: After five and seven years of working with this on the outside, 
on the inside, what has surprised you about this ministry?  What do you think
people need to know?  Maybe they didn't expect this.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I am amazed at how Angel Tree has grown on its own.  It is 
not a program that we can even really control or manage because the
word of mouth on the inside of the prisons has just grown that
this is a program you can trust in; they're going to work and
do something for your kids.  And also, on the outside, more and
more churches are getting involved.
<p>
But as we see the number of children rise, there are, as I said, nearly over 
a million children of prisoners, maybe 2 million, we think, that we need to 
minister to.  And so, more and more, we need more and more churches and
volunteers and groups and organizations to be involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It has got to be kind of scary for a guy -- he is in prison --
or a woman, thinking that his children are going to totally forget
him.  I would think the fear level would be high.  Just as a practical
matter, I was wondering, after Angel Tree, do you see more children
coming to the prisons?  Do you see a physical connection made
through the gift connection?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  We have, and a lot of churches are providing transportation for 
the family to the prisons to reconnect that group there so that they can do 
that, and also, you mentioned something else, if I can backtrack just a 
little. At Christmas time, the suicide rate is very high in prisons.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: It is a lonely time during the holidays for inmates.  And so 
Prison Fellowship and Angel Tree provides a link to their families and gives 
them a chance -- because a lot of inmates have expressed that they are 
worried about their families during the holidays.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And I can imagine why, yes.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: They are depressed and lonely, and then they are thinking 
of their families.  And so --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Let's make sure you give the 800 number one more time.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Sure. It's 1-800-398-HOPE.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Okay, 1-800-398-HOPE. Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Following this commercial break, 
we will hear from Dr.James Dobson, who, through his ministry, Focus on the 
Family, has impacted thousands of lives.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.
<p>
Just recently, I had the wonderful opportunity to speak with Dr. James 
Dobson of Focus on the Family.  Dr. Dobson and his staff are touching 
lives all over the United States through his ministry, which helps people 
strengthen their own families and deal with the struggles of family life.
<p>
Dr. Dobson is also making an effort to be a good influence on government, 
advocating a pro-family agenda through his daily radio show and 
publications. They reach millions every week.  Now let's hear what Dr. 
Dobson has to say to us.
<p>
Dr. Dobson, it is a privilege to be with you today. You come to 
Washington regularly, and I know you have been involved here for years, 
back in the 1970s and the 1980s in the foundation of Family Research 
Council. Why are you here in Washington, D.C.?  Why are you involved?
<p>
DR. DOBSON: Kristi, I come here because so much of what happens to the 
family is linked to what government does.  I wish that were not true. I 
really wish government would stay out of the family.  But they don't,
and as a result, the policies of government are very, very important
to the stability of the family, first of all, financially, of
course, through the way the family is taxed, but then now the
moral issues, you know, of abortion and the possibility of gay
marriage and other things.  All of those kinds of policies are
being discussed -- parental consent for abortion -- many, many
things that we care about, and there is only one way to influence
that system, and that is to come here.  So that's what brings
me to this city.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Some of the media elite are trying to insinuate that 
the family values issues in the next election have run aground a little, 
that it maybe is the economy. You look at the polls recently in terms of 
the numbers on the balanced budget, and they are saying, &quot;We want 
our programs more than our tax cuts.&quot;
<p>
Do you think people are losing interest in things like partial-birth 
abortion and the family tax cuts? You know, is the media elite correct?
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  No.  I think that is the message the media elite would like 
people to believe, and frankly, that is what both political parties would 
like people to believe, even the Republicans, if you listen to them. They
want to talk about money, as though that's the only thing that
Americans care about.  They want to talk about taxation and about
deficits and about reorganizing government and about long-term
debt and interest rates and that sort of thing.
<p>
Well, those things are important.  You know, the economy is important to 
the family, too.  But there's a whole lot more that's out there.
<p>
What this city does not know, Kristi -- and I know you are aware of this
-- but what this city doesn't know is that there are multiple
millions of people out there who are not represented by the <i>Washington
Post</i> and not represented by the <i>New York Times</i> and the media 
establishment, who are just good people trying to raise kids and trying to 
maintain family life, and they are very alarmed by what is happening to
their children, by the influences of Hollywood, by the rock music
industry, by the filth that's out there, by the violence that's
all around them, by the drugs, by the gangs, by abortion, by all
these moral issues that are there.  And they are really waiting
for politicians, somebody, to step forward and speak for them
and their concerns.
<p>
Their greatest concern is not the country. Their greatest concern is their 
own little family.  And so the larger financial issues are important, yes, 
but they don't represent all of the concerns that are out there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right now on Capitol Hill you have this clash of the Titans in 
the budget project.  We have soldiers possibly going to Bosnia any day now
and people shipping out all the time.  We have Medicare debates
going on with this whole discussion that we are trying to steal
from the elderly.  And it's Christmas time.  I mean, that's a
lot to be throwing at people at Christmas time.
<p>
What is your sense? You talk to more people probably than most of us in a 
year, in the mail and in your conversations.  Are people feeling overwhelmed
by all these crises in government?  Do they want to see resolution?
 Are they looking for something different at Christmas?
<p>
DR. DOBSON: I really believe that most people are not terribly concerned
about crises in government.  They are concerned about crises in
their private lives.  They are concerned about how to keep their
family together, how to get through tomorrow, how to pay the Christmas
bills, and how to keep their kids moral and how to protect their
family from the influences of a culture in the wake of a moral
free-fall.
<p>
That is what is on people's minds.  Yes, they watch to some degree what 
CNN says and what they hear from this city, but it is much more personal 
than that.  And I think, this Christmas, people feel the way they have -- 
I am generalizing, but the people I know and that I hear from feel the way 
they have for many, many years.  They are looking to put meaning into 
Christmas. They are looking to get in touch with their kids and their families
and to add the spiritual dimension.  And this city is sort of
important but sort of &quot;out there.&quot;  That is at least
my impression.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is out there, actually.
<p>
DR. DOBSON: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You've got a big schedule.  I just wanted to ask you one 
last question.  When you go home to Colorado Springs, what do you hope 
you were able to accomplish here today, during Christmas time?
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  Some of the meetings that I am having today are frankly 
confidential.  I have been asked not to talk about them, certainly not 
in advance. But I can just tell you there are some high-level meetings 
that deal with the pro-life agenda and how to advance it, how to protect 
that little unborn child.
<p>
Now, we just recently had a wonderful experience, of course, on Capitol 
Hill with the passage of the partial-birth abortion ban bill, which would 
ban that horrible procedure where little children, little babies, full-term, 
viable babies are killed in a horrible way, and we are very grateful that 
that legislation passed.  But that is only the beginning.  We've got a lot 
more work to do.  So that is the primary thing I am here working on
on this trip.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for standing up for life and thanks for being with 
us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  Thanks for having us.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> brings
you some holiday cheer from the Family Research Council staff.
 Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. FRC staff works very 
hard for today's families, and we very much value Christmas in this 
important family season.
<p>
Tonight let's hear from some of the Family Research Council staff
as they share the meaning of Christmas in their lives and some
of their own special holiday plans.  Please watch with me Home
Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
FRC STAFFER: What Christmas means to me?  Well, Christmas means to me a 
time of getting together with family, celebrating the holiday, spending 
time with your loved ones.  But most of all, Christmas is remembering why 
we have Christmas.  It's the birth of the Christ Child sent here
to save us from our sins and to take us to heaven.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Family, being together with the family and sharing and caring.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: To spend some time with my mother, which it has
been a long time since I've had Christmas with her, so I will
spend some time with my family and have fun.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: My family used to always get together, and my dad used to 
always read the Christmas story the night before, on Christmas Eve, and
we would always get together with our family on Christmas Day.
 So family is the main thing of Christmas for me, and snow, too.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Instead of doing gifts for each other, we're going
to go and -- and, as a matter of fact, our families, instead of
buying gifts for us, they're going to send us the money, and then
we're going to find a place that is really special, and that's
going to be our Christmas.  So that's kind of special.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Christmas means that I get to go home and spend time with 
my family, and it means that I can eat my grandmother's cooking,
and it means that I get to go to my home church and I get to visit
with the people there and hear my minister speak, which is something
that I have missed since I have moved here.
<p>
But Christmas also means that there is going to be peace that whole day, 
and that it is so quiet, and that maybe it will snow.  And what I'm going
to do that is really special this year is I'm just going to sit
down and enjoy my former home with my parents.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: I think the thing that comes instantly to mind is family, you 
know, being around family and having them near to you at that time of
the year.  It is particularly important to have them in a group,
and I think the other thing, the second thing that I think about,
obviously, is that it's to celebrate the birth of Christ, and
that's important to me.  So those are the two things that come
to mind.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Just to always remember the spirit behind
Christmas.  It is the birth of Christ.  It is not the sharing
of presents or the Christmas tree or the lights or the cookies.
 It's that Christ was born and it's a time to celebrate.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: I guess Christmas to me means, it definitely is the meaning 
of eternal life for me.  Without Christ coming to Earth, we wouldn't
have eternal life, and that is the meaning of Christmas to me.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  My family.  Going home and just being with my family.
 I mean, that is really what it means to me, and all of my cousins
getting together and everybody just hanging out, and that's it.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  It will be just a chance for everybody to get back
together from all over the country, from both coasts, and come
back to the heartland.  And I miss the snow.  It's going to be
a white Christmas there.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Christmas?  This Christmas I'm going to go to Tennessee and 
spend it with my family.  And, also, what Christmas means to me is I think 
about people in other countries that can't celebrate it because they don't 
Jesus and never heard of Him.  A lot of them are my friends on the other
side of Planet Earth.  So I think about them during Christmas.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Christmas is the coming of the Savior who saves
us from our sins, you know, and to save us all.  What does it
say in the carol?  To save us from Satan's power when we had gone
astray.  Tidings of comfort and joy.  Is there anything better
than that?
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Well, I will be celebrating Christmas
with my two little girls, Miosh(?) and Kianshay(?), and now since
my mother has passed, it means a lot, because I usually spent
Christmas with her.  But other than that, it's just a happy celebration
day for me.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  This Christmas I am going to visit my
family in the Middle East, so I will be much closer to where Jesus
was born, and I am really looking forward to being with them after
having not seen them for so long, and looking forward to being
in the kind of land that Christ was born in 2,000 years ago.
<p>

Dear Senator:

It would be a big mistake to vote for an increase in the 
minimum wage.  A minimum wage hike will hurt the economy 
and cost jobs.

Economists have found that minimum wage increases cost jobs.
Hiking the minimum wage will keep many young people, 
especially minorities and unskilled workers, out of job 
opportunities.  The drive to raise the minimum wage is 
largely politically-motivated and driven.  But many people 
fail to see the destructiveness of minimum wage increases. 
As a small business owner, I know how difficult it is to 
absorb the costs of unfunded mandates like the minimum wage.

The minimum wage is a starting wage, it's a good way for the 
entry-level employees to gain employment experience.  
Studies show that 63% of minimum wage workers earn higher 
wages within a year.  Small businesses are able to determine 
wage scales much better than Congressmen or bureaucrats.

With the implementation of welfare reform, there will be 
many low skilled people looking for jobs -- it will be much 
harder for these Americans to find employment if Congress 
raises the minimum wage.

Now is definitely not the time to raise the minimum wage.  
Leave wage increases for minimum wage workers to the 
employers, not politicians.

Sincerely,
</textarea>

Curdling the cream in the Clinton coffee
</FONT></center>
<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick. The front page of The Washington Times on the morning after New Hampshire was a caution correctly read in the White House, where, despite the hired bravado of the president's regiments of lawyers, the fog shrouding Bill Clinton's view of November grows thicker, the knot of fear in Miss Hillary's tummy expands to the size of an artichoke-y.
<br><dd>
<I>Buchanan wins New Hampshire vote/Stuns Dole;/Alexander a strong third</I>. This was the stuff of good cheer all around: dissension in the enemy's camp, a cracking coalition, rage in the ranks, mutiny at the officers' club. You couldn't blame the president and Miss Hillary for the smiles that sweetened their morning coffee.

<br><dd>
But here's the smaller headline that curdled the cream in that coffee: <I>Arkansas bankers indicted for loans/Fraud suspected in Clinton races</I>. The front page of The Washington Post, for once, offered scant solace: <I>Arkansas bankers indicted in scheme/to help fund 1990 Clinton campaign</I>.

<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

<br><dd>
The amnesia epidemic that has swept through the White House -- there's been nothing like it since the AIDS epidemic swept through San Francisco like Epsom salts -- continued Feb. 22 as Harold Ickes, with the rattled mien of a flustered Ichabod Crane, couldn't remember much about anything, beginning with why the White House only last week found another hundred pages of Whitewater documents it had said were lost. "Inadvertent," Mr. Ickes described it.

<br><dd>
One of the panelists noticed the notation, "DK Draft," and asked whether this meant that Donald Kendall, the president's lawyer for bank-robbery affairs, had written it. Mr. Ickes, in the White House refrain now so familiar to all, replied that he didn't remember. Of course.

<br><dd>
Mr. Ickes demonstrated the testiness and combativeness that White House aides cower before, particularly when he employs testiness and combativeness to protect Miss Hillary. Once he dropped his mask of toughness. Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina recalled that his father was known in FDR's Cabinet as "Honest Harold," and asked him, in the down-home vernacular: "If God had granted him to be in this room, would he say, 'Boy, you're doing a good job,' or, 'Son, you're with the wrong crowd, get out,'?"

<br><dd>
With an ever so slight crack in his voice, the son replied: "I think he would have approved of what I was doing, because we've done nothing wrong."

<br><dd>
Another panelist wondered about another passage in the notes which the White House has only now deigned to turn over to the Senate Whitewater committee: An investigation, said one notetaker, "may result in focus on friends and associates of the president, begin to 'squeeze' them, and some may be subject to indictment."

<br><dd>
Mr. Ickes, a labor lawyer in New York before he came down to help Hillary dismantle American medicine, insisted that not only did he not know who wrote the memo, he didn't even know what the term "squeezed" meant. How would a New York labor lawyer have ever heard about putting the "squeeze" on a witness?
<br><dd>
During a break in the testimony, Mr. Ickes' own pleader, the ubiquitous and expensive Uncle Bob Bennett, who is also the president's lawyer for bimbo eruptions, couldn't imagine why anyone would think his client had done anything wrong.
<br><dd>
&quot;I don't know what's wrong with that,&quot; he said of Mr. Ickes' answer. &quot;This is a big piece of cotton candy. You bite into it and there is nothing there.&quot;
<br><dd>
Expensive pleader or not, Mr. Bennett sounds as if he's having difficulty persuading himself. And over at the White House, the president's press agent, Mike McCurry, took pains to underscore the need for presidential aides to make sure they turn over all Whitewater documents. Leon Panetta, the White House chief of staff, &quot;doesn't want documents dribbling out. He wants everyone to turn everything upside down and produce whatever needs to be produced.&quot;
<br><dd>
Sure he does. But what he really doesn't want is anything to enhance the perception, now deeply ingrained in the Washington consciousness, that what the Clintons are producing is not documents but alibis, excuses, and yarns.
<br><dd>
This week the Senate must decide whether to extend the Whitewater committee's life and writ. Even Chris Dodd, the panelist from Connecticut and the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee (talk about your conflicts of interest) says he's &quot;troubled&quot; by the White House delays but naturally he sees &quot;nothing of substance&quot; to justify an extension. Says he, invoking an odd analogy: &quot;This has gone on longer than the O.J. Simpson trial.&quot; But everyone knows that if Bob Dole can't manage to win this one, he's outta here.
<br><dd>
Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

<h1>Cultural winds blow back to the future</h1>
<P> <HR WIDTH=50%>By Suzanne Fields<BR>
The Washington Times
<HR width = 30%>
 </CENTER>
 
<P>If Bob Dylan were to wet his finger and wave it above his head to measure which way the wind is blowing, he'd change the lyrics: &quot;The times, they are a'changin' - and changin' back.&quot;

<P>Cultural conservatives are finally feeling their influence at work in the mainstream culture. Cultural indicators for the boomers, now turning gray and 50, are changing, too.

<P>Not so long ago, a liberal was said to turn conservative when his daughter reached junior high. And why not? She enters a public junior high through a metal detector, and her boyfriend gets free condoms from the school nurse.

<P>Grade school has lesser but still troublesome risks. The younger kids might spend half the day learning their lessons in English and half of the day learning the lessons again in Spanish. The alternative, for those who can scrape up the money, is a private school at $12,000 a year, but even they have to be careful not to choose a private school where equally goofy ideas thrive.

<P>Neo-liberals often turn reactionary when their sons and daughters arrive at the elite campuses, such as Yale or Stanford, where &quot;gender&quot; and &quot;gay&quot; studies push out the great books. Chaucer, Milton and Shakespeare are too white, too male, and too dead. Columbus is demoted as a cultural hero because he set out for the New World without having filed an environmental-impact statement.

<P>Cultural conservatives still must climb several steep mountains, but they're on firmer footing than ever.

<P>Sponsors of several trashy daytime shows have cancelled their sponsorship, or are planning to, of the worst offenders. Crusaders William (&quot;Virtues&quot;) Bennett and Sens. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Sam Nunn of Georgia, both Democrats, cite Procter &amp; Gamble, Unilever, Sears and Mars as examples of sponsors taught to have a public conscience. The objects of their ire are shows &quot;that harm our country and our kids.&quot;

<P>The Lieberman/Bennett/Nunn coalition is taking out after the 16,000 buyers of local programming, who met last week in Las Vegas for the annual convention of the National Association of Television Programming Executives. They're especially targeting talk trash produced for broadcast during the after-school daytime hours.

<P>Although such cultural polluters are among the most damaging to our children, adults are getting a respite from some of the soft, gauzy &quot;gender&quot; liberalism spawned in the media. The New York Times Sunday magazine has cancelled its &quot;About Men&quot; and &quot;Hers&quot; columns which described emotions such as a mother's frustration in getting her son to play with teacups and her daughter to play with trucks (not guns, of course), or the embarrassment two lesbians felt at the raised eyebrows they provoked when they checked into a motel room for a night together.

<P>When feminists complained of a macho sensibility creeping into the &quot;About Men&quot; confessional columns, the editors moved into &quot;a tender phase,&quot; and published pieces in which men proclaimed: &quot;I do the dishes and love it.&quot; No equal time at the Times.

<P>We've come a long way from Alan Alda's oh-so-sensitive man now. (Alan who?) Even Phil Donahue, who once wore a skirt on his television talk show to show gender solidarity and introduced such sexually titillating topics as male strippers who performed live before his audience and mother-daughter strippers who didn't, is retiring from his show at the end of its 29th season in May.

<P>Even the first lady, a card-carrying liberal, looking for ways to express her tougher inner child, sounds like a cultural conservative - at least some of the time - in her book, &quot;It Takes a Village.&quot;

<P>She prescribes &quot;character education&quot; in the public schools, rejects &quot;permissiveness&quot; in raising children, rails against the lyrics of &quot;gangsta rap.&quot; She wants girls to remain chaste until 21, and celebrates the two-parent family over the &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; model.

<P>Whether the first lady is being disingenuous or hypocritical, she nevertheless senses what the maturing public wants to hear. You might say she knows which way the wind is blowing.

fugitive from justice last seen in Nepal, and Janet Reno has appointed a special prosecutor to
press charges that Socks the Cat has been hunting mice out of season.<BR><DD>But a new poll,
commissioned just in time for the Republican National Convention in San Diego, shows the
president 31 points up on you, and you're only 6 points ahead of Ross Perot.<BR><DD>Ordinarily,
this would curdle the cream in your coffee, but the cream had turned sour weeks earlier. You
decide to drink your coffee black, to match your mood. You sit there, staring at the trees on
Roosevelt Island across the Potomac (which looks particularly bleak), and your mind begins to
examine the possibilities:<BR><DD><I>Hmmmmmmmmm. George McGovern is a nice guy, a good friend,
but do I really want to be remembered as the man who made the Nixon-McGovern blowout look like a
cliff-hanger? And Fritz Mondale -- always liked him. Good man. Wrong on some stuff, not so bad
on other stuff. But do I really want to challenge his mark of winning only a single state? The
numbers from Kansas don't look so hot, either.</I><BR><DD><I>Got to do something. Maybe make
another speech. Start wearing a tie again. Put new pennies in my loafers. Take Katie Couric out
to lunch. Get a new bathing suit. Buy some jokes. Whatever. Nah, it wouldn't last. Been there,
done that. Maybe call Colin Powell one more time. Nah, been there, too. Besides, he's like all
the other generals, waiting for somebody to appoint him president. Got enough of generals in
Italy.</I><BR><DD><I>What if ... Nah, too bold. Better to lose it all in November. Except . . .
Nah, better wait 'til Liddy leaves the room even to think these thoughts. Ah, there she goes ...
What if . . . I call a press conference and announce that I'm stepping aside. Had some chest
pains, back pains. Pains in the neck. Whatever. Gonna throw the convention open. No endorsement.
Not from me. The ultimate act of loyalty and generosity from the ultimate party man. Who else
would be remembered as being so unselfish? Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid
of the party. Only I actually will. Let the right-to-lifers and the abortionists slug it out.
See how far Pat Buchanan gets in an open convention. Let's see who's got the uh, nerve, to get
in now. Jack Kemp won't. He's afraid he might run third. Or fourth. Never called fourth-and-one
in his life. I won't play any favorites, but I might get somebody to nominate Colin. We'll see
how the general who couldn't get to Baghdad fares with all those ex-privates and ex-corporals
out there in the convention hall. Whatever.</I><BR><DD>Well, of course it won't happen. Nobody
with a politician's ego would forego the moment of watching himself being nominated for
president of the United States, standing up there waving to a standing ovation big enough to
fill a stadium and loud enough to make a man's mother believe some of them actually mean it. But
it is a thought, and if such wistful musings ever occur to Bob Dole it doesn't take a Hollywood
scriptwriter to imagine what would happen.<BR><DD>The country would be electrified, and here,
finally, is the place to use that cliche. Direct current at 240 volts. The reporters and
commentators would go bonkers, finally getting to cover a nominating convention like they had in
those old black-and-white newsreels. The good, gray Republican Party, where a simple
disagreement over where to go for dinner is considered gauche, finally giving lessons to the
Democrats, who can start a floor fight over a resolution commending Mother Teresa for giving
milk to starving babies, about how to conduct a free-for-all.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama
is proud to cast its votes on the 29th ballot for . . . </I><BR><DD>ABC would pull its camera
crews from Bosnia, CBS would call back reporters from Tel Aviv, CNN would forsake its stakeout
of O.J. The newspapers would double their staffs in San Diego, with finally something to
actually write home about. <BR><DD>The delegates in San Diego would forget all about the beach,
the side trips to Tijuana, the cocktail parties aboard the yachts tied up in the
harbor.<BR><DD>Best of all, the race would be transformed overnight.<BR><DD>By waiting until
August to bequeath his great gift to the party, Bob Dole would guarantee an open convention.
Nobody would have time to raise the money to ruin it in the way that the primaries have ruined
the process, and at last the Republicans could tell little Virginia that yes, Virginia, there
really is a Republican National Convention, and this is how it's supposed to
be.<BR><DD><I>Mister Chairman, Alabama is proud to stand fast on the 44th ballot for . .

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Last week, we brought you some convention highlights,
Republican GOP convention highlights, from San Diego.  But 
there were a lot of pro-family events we didn't get a chance 
to show you, so please stay tuned for more convention 
highlights while we talk to you about what's going on Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

[Segment from behind the scenes at the Republican National 
Convention follows:]

<p>

INTERVIEWER: This is Gary Bauer, president of the 
Family Research Council.  Mr. Bauer, first of all, I guess, 
a comment on everything preceding the convention.  We're 
kind of rolling, we're kind of all on one page, it seems 
like, but are you satisfied with what happened in the
platform hearings?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think a broadly conservative 
message is emerging from the convention.  Certainly the 
platform is a Reaganesque platform:  low taxes, small 
government, family values, respect for life.  Those are the 
key issues that I think we can get 51 percent of the 
American people to rally around.  It's what worked for 
Ronald Reagan, and if Bob Dole and Jack Kemp run on that 
platform, I think we'll have a real competitive race.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Are you convinced that they will run 
on that platform?  Are you convinced that they will take the 
social issues to the people?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I'm hoping that they'll spend a 
lot of time at this convention actually getting to meet 
real-live delegates and finding out what they think, instead 
of listening to all those high-paid Washington consultants 
that often tell politicians what they're supposed to do.

<p>

I think Bob Dole and Jack Kemp are both bright
men.  I certainly think they understand -- I hope they do --
that this is a new Republican Party that believes in family
values, and I think if they spend some time with these
delegates, they will realize that that's the ticket for this
campaign and those are the issues they ought to emphasize,
along with economic growth and lower taxes.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * </center>

<p>

[Segments from FRC booth area of convention follow:]

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Thank you. Appreciate everything 
you're doing for the country.  Take care.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thanks a lot.  Thank you.  Good to 
meet you both.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: . . . the party of Lincoln ought to be 
arguing for the protections of our Constitution for our 
unborn children.  That seems to me to be a good and right 
thing to do, even if occasionally the polls may show that 
most Americans are either confused about the issues or can't 
make up their minds.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Speaking of Dole, he had some 
critical remarks about you not too long back.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Right.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: How's the situation now?  Have you 
spoken with him since that time?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Only through intermediaries.  You 
know, Bob Dole is an opinionated guy, and so am I, and it's 
not unusual in Washington that you occasionally get into the 
ring with somebody and spar a little bit.  But at the end of 
the day, I think it's going to be a pretty united team, and 
I certainly don't have any ill will.

<p>

INTERVIEWER: Dole's selection of Kemp.  Your comments about that?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, Jack's a personal friend of 
mine.  His daughter worked for me at the White House, so I 
guess I'm a little biased.  But he had a solid pro-life 
voting record when he was in Congress.  He brings the ticket 
some needed energy and optimism.

<p>

I suppose he is probably the biggest, most natural 
heir to the Reagan legacy.  So I think it's going to help a 
lot.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER [upon autographing a copy of his book, 
Our Hopes, Our Dreams]:  I hope they enjoy it.

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  They will.  Thanks a lot.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  It was really good to meet you.

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  Nice meeting you.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  . . . and our eight-year-old son says, 
"Because of our values."

<p>

MR. BAUER: Fantastic.  You're obviously already 
doing something real right at home.  That's fantastic.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

GENTLEMAN:  I think everybody will be leaving San 
Diego at the end of this week with a whole new situation.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

LADY:  . . . I really like Jack Kemp.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  He's a good man.

<p>

LADY:  Yes.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  He's a good man.

<p>

LADY:  He is.  Thank you very much.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  A lot of enthusiasm, which the ticket 
really needed.

<p>

LADY:  I know.  It really did.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  It's good to meet you, Gerri.

<p>

LADY:  Nice meeting you.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER [autographing his book]:  You said Richard?

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Richard.

<p>

LADY:  . . . really appreciate the fact that 
you're able to succinctly articulate the things we believe 
in.  It takes me half an hour to say what I want to say, and 
you say it so well.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be right back with more 
convention highlights here from San Diego, California.
Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we're bringing you some pro-family 
highlights of the GOP convention.  Let's take a look.

<p>

[Segment from Pro-Family Briefing held August 12, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. BAUER:  You know, for most American families, 
life isn't about executive decisions in Washington or 
judicial decrees and all the things in the headlines.  It's 
helping hands and good neighbors.  It's nighttime prayers 
and lovingly packed lunch boxes.  It's hard work and a 
little put away for the future.

<p>

This platform understands those things and stands 
for those things.  First of all, the platform has a solid 
commitment to economic growth and to economic opportunity.  
The platform writers understood that no American family has 
ever been held up by pulling another American family down.  
The platform writers knew that the idea is not to make the 
rich poor but to give the poor opportunity to accomplish 
everything that they can.

<p>

It calls for significant tax cuts across the board 
for all Americans.  It has specific tax cuts for American 
families with children.  Those are key points of differences 
between this ticket and the White House, and I think it will 
be a difference that will loom very large in this 
Presidential race.

<p>

The second key area in the platform is education 
reform.  The platform begins with the knowledge that parents 
are the first and most important teachers that a child has. 
It calls for a cutting back of the educational bureaucracy 
so that more of the money that the taxpayers give can get to 
the teachers and the children for whom it was intended.  And 
it makes a strong statement for educational choice so that 
all parents, not just suburban parents and well-off parents 
but inner city parents, can choose the schools they send 
their children to.

<p>

A third important area is the area of cultural 
renewal.  My hat goes off to Bob Dole for having the 
courage, in the last year or so, to take the message of 
cultural renewal to Hollywood and to say what all the 
American people instinctively know; that is that our culture 
in recent years has become debased, has emphasized violence 
and sexual exploitation, and that that culture is having an 
impact on our children.

<p>

Too many American families feel today as if they 
are surrounded by hostile territory, and this platform calls 
for a reinstitution of the idea of shame so that men and 
women that are making a fast buck, whether it's in Hollywood 
or Madison Avenue, will recognize their responsibilities as 
citizens to create a culture that is family-friendly.

<p>

And finally, this platform is, without shame or 
embarrassment, pro-life, and it should be, since this is the 
party of Abraham Lincoln.  Over 100 years ago, this party 
argued to the American people that the most defenseless 
members of our society then, African-American slaves, 
deserved the full protection and promise of our Declaration 
of Independence and Constitution; that they were in fact 
included in the words that said, "all men are created 
equal."

<p>

Today and over the last 20 years, the Republican 
Party has stood for the sanctity of human life, for the fact 
that today the most defenseless among us, our unborn 
children, are in fact included in those words, "all men are 
created equal."

<p>

I believe this platform is a noble and good 
platform, that it can inspire the American people to listen 
to the angels, the better angels of their nature, and I 
believe that if Bob Dole and Jack Kemp run on it, that we 
will all be at their inauguration in January 1997.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

SENATOR DON NICKLES: I want to thank everybody 
for their help, and I saw my friend Gary Bauer just spoke, 
and let me just say what a delight it has been to know and 
work with Gary and Family Research Council and other friends 
on really trying to help protect America's families.

<p>

I have heard lately Bill Clinton is talking about 
family values. I thought, well, wait a minute, is that Bill 
Bennett or is that Dan Quayle?  No, it's Bill Clinton.  One 
story did a kind of analysis that talked about the number of 
times he said "family values" and so on.  He mentions it now 
in his speeches. He knows it sells.

<p>

But, folks, you have to look to the facts.  Look 
at the history.  What about family values?  Bill Clinton's 
record doesn't comport with real family values.

<p>

You say, "What do you mean by that?"  Well, 
families are concerned about drug use.  And you look at the 
White House; they've been AWOL in the war on drugs, totally 
AWOL.  President Clinton takes off, he cuts off drug 
enforcement in the White House 80 percent.  Eighty percent. 
Makes jokes about, "Oh, well, yeah, I used -- well, I 
didn't break the drug laws of this country -- I did that in 
England -- and then I didn't inhale," and all this kind of 
cavalier attitude on drugs, and then we find out just 
recently, due to the fact that a couple of the FBI agents 
that were in charge of background investigations, that 
several people in the White House had used drugs fairly 
recently, some maybe as late as on inaugural day.

<p>

And yet this administration continues to push -- 
maybe that's the reason it took them so long.  They had over 
100 people that were a year late in having their FBI 
clearances done.

<p>

And then what did they do?  Well, they pulled out 
900 files of people who worked on cases years before in the 
Bush Administration, some even going back to the Reagan 
Administration, and they pulled out their files.  Why did 
they want to clear those files instead of the people that 
were working in the White House?  Those people had no reason 
whatsoever to be going into the White House, and this was 
for access purposes.  That's a real abuse of power.

<p>

And then you get into a real issue, too, and that 
is of character.  Who is telling the truth?  It bothers me. 
Mack McLarty -- I think very highly of the former chief of 
staff in the White House.  He said as recently, I think, or 
it just became public about eight or nine days ago that he 
was pressured into firing people in the travel office.

<p>

I remember David Watkins had a memo we found some 
time ago that said something about there would be hell to 
pay from Mrs. Clinton if they weren't fired.  Well, 
Mrs. Clinton said she didn't have anything to do with it.

<p>

Wait a minute. Truthfulness is an important 
family value. Family values are important.  Integrity is 
important. When you find people, either the President or 
Mrs. Clinton, not telling the truth, I think that undercuts 
family values. I think there is a real problem there, and 
we have seen scandal after scandal, almost a scandal a week, 
from this administration.  That undermines family values.  
That undermines discipline.

<p>

And then you look at some of the appointments this 
administration has, when they are talking about family 
values, and I remember leading the fight in the Senate 
against Dr. Elders, the surgeon general.  You know, if you 
believe in family values and then you look -- and no one can 
say that President Clinton didn't know Dr. Elders, because 
she came from Arkansas.  He appointed her originally in 
Arkansas, and then she was making comments, "Well, maybe we 
should legalize drugs."  He didn't fire her for that 
statement.  She made it once and then she made it again.  He 
didn't fire her again.  Finally he did fire her because she 
started talking about other things maybe even worse about 
what we should teach in school, and I didn't want Dr. Elders 
-- you know, she had one comment, "Well, we teach kids what 
to do in the front seat; maybe the government should teach 
them what to do in the back seat."  I don't want Dr. Elders 
teaching my kids what to do in the back seat.

<p>

But that's the kind of family values, and federal 
judges and so on, that you see that this administration has 
put in.  So their new allegiance to family values is 
rhetoric because some poster said we need to talk about 
this.  But it's not where their heart is.  It's not where 
they have been governing.

<p>

As a matter of fact, they don't have a surgeon 
general today.  They tried another one who was advocating 
abortion or had involvement in abortion, had actually 
performed them and so on -- he couldn't decide if it was one 
or 49 or 100 or what -- and so, well, now they just don't 
have one because they know it would be another hotly 
contested issue, my point being family issues are vitally 
important.  Families are the best level of government.  We 
need to protect the family structure.  We realize that when 
kids don't have two parents that those kids have a lot 
higher tendency to end up in trouble or on drugs or in 
broken families or maybe even in jail.  And so we owe it to 
America's society to protect American families, but this 
administration has almost declared war on families.

<p>

There is only one group that is really radical on 
abortion, and it's President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton, and the 
Democrats.  They are the ones that vetoed a bill that 
passed, a bipartisan bill, overwhelming majority, that would 
have banned partial-birth abortion.  It's as close to 
infanticide as anything you'll ever find, and an 
overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate said, 
let's stop it.  Let's stop it.  It is about the only bill, I 
think, I have ever voted that would actually ban some 
abortions, and this President vetoed it, and he was wrong.

<p>

This President, too, has made a lot of statements.
He is the one that is in favor of funding abortions,
funding the termination -- funding and actually subsidizing 
the termination of innocent, unborn human beings. The 
Republican Party and most Republicans say we don't think we 
should subsidize; we don't think taxpayers should have to 
pay for that type of activity.

<p>

So there is a big difference, and people should be 
aware of it, and I am very proud of the fact that our party 
and the American people are saying, we want to stand and 
protect the lives of innocent children.

<p>

Some people say, "Is that banning all abortion?"  
No, it doesn't to do that.  We just don't think the Federal 
Government should pay for it, and we feel pretty strongly, 
and we think the American people, by an overwhelming 
majority, 80 percent or more, agree with us on that issue.

<p>

We also think states should be able to have the 
right to pass laws such as parental notification or parental 
consent, and this administration doesn't agree with that, 
either, and they happen to be wrong.

<p>

So I just want to compliment you for your efforts. 
I thank you for your efforts.  Let's work very, very hard 
and have a great victory in November.  Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: More convention highlights coming up 
in just a moment.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to a look at the things 
you couldn't see on network television.  Let's take a look.

<p>

[Segment from National Federation of Republican 
Women's Salute to Elizabeth Dole follows:]

<p>

SENATOR DOLE:  . . . and I would just take a 
moment just to share a few memories that made a difference 
in my life.  It was the day we met.  It was on Tuesday, 
March 14, 1972.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Now, I am not one for horoscopes, but I brought 
the one along (from) that morning.  It's turning a little 
yellow, but otherwise it's all right.  And the horoscope 
said, and I quote:  "Find the right solution to governmental 
and other problems that face you."  End of quote.

<p>

[Laughter and applause.]

<p>

Well, at 11 o'clock that morning, the solution 
walked into my office.

<p>

[Laughter and extended applause.]

<p>

She was there with her boss, a great lady, 
Virginia Knauer, who had been alluded to before, for a 
meeting on consumer issues.

<p>

Now, normally, I don't like meetings -- normally.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But this was a pretty good meeting.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

It was so good, we're still meeting 24 years later.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I don't think Elizabeth knows this.  You don't 
surprise her very often, but I do have a little surprise for 
you, Elizabeth.  I initiated a search through the Senate 
archives last week and located the schedule for that week we 
met in 1972, and I brought it with me.  It says right here, 
"Eleven o'clock, Mrs. Virginia Knauer, appointment in Senate 
office.  If I have any questions, call Nora Joel(?), 
secretary, 456-2645."  I didn't have any questions before 
the meeting, but I had a number after the meeting.

<p>

[Laughter and extended applause.]

<p>

<p>

MS. BIZELL:  My name is Lisa Bizell, and I am 
somebody because of Elizabeth Hanford Dole and the Mary 
Cathy(?) Hanford Fund.  The Mary Cathy Hanford Fund was 
started by Mrs. Dole and her brother, John Hanford, as a way 
to honor their mother on her 90th birthday.  The fund has 
sponsored the Youth in Action group at the Elizabeth Hanford 
Dole Chapter of the American Red Cross in Salisbury, North 
Carolina, Mrs. Dole's home town.

<p>

Youth in Action is a program that helps teens 
develop self-esteem and learn more important skills like 
first aid, CPR, and HIV and AIDS prevention.  We also learn 
the importance of volunteering in our community.

<p>

I have been a part of Youth in Action for three 
years.  Everyone, like my family, my friends, and my 
teachers have said that being in Youth in Action has changed 
me, and I know that's true.  The things I've learned and the 
experiences I've had in Youth in Action changed my attitude, 
my willingness to accept responsibility, and my ability to 
work with others.  I have never been around so many people 
who really cared about what happens to me and my future.  
Thanks to those people, I am planning to continue my 
education by going to college.  Some day I hope to become a 
coach and teacher so I can help young people just as I have 
been helped.

<p>

I don't think Mrs. Dole realizes how many young 
people she has inspired.  All of us in Youth in Action look 
up to her, not because of the government positions she has 
held or the important people she knows but because of how 
she has shown that she cares about us.

<p>

Thank you, Mrs. Dole, for the difference you have 
made in my life and the lives of so many other young people, 
and you are the first lady to us.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

ROBIN DOLE: . . . and just as Dad and Elizabeth's 
love has grown stronger throughout their marriage, so, too, 
has my friendship with Elizabeth.  I will always remember 
the first Mother's Day after they were married.  I dropped 
by with a bouquet of flowers for Elizabeth, and her eyes 
filled with tears as she realized the special role she would 
play in my life.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Elizabeth, you are very special to me.  I am proud 
to call you my stepmother and my friend, and it is my great 
honor to introduce to all of you the next First Lady of the 
United States of America, Elizabeth Dole.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MRS. DOLE:  Oh, my.  Thank you so much, and Robin, 
thank you so much for your beautiful, beautiful 
introduction.  That really touched my heart.  In fact, the 
whole program has been incredible.  I sat there with tears 
welling in my eyes, and this is just a day that I will 
cherish the rest of my life.  I don't deserve it, but I 
certainly appreciate it very, very much, everything that has 
been said and done today.  Bless you all.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

In speaking of women and opportunities for women, 
I recall especially at the Department of Transportation, 
when I was very new as Secretary, and I must tell you it is 
sort of male bastion, you know, because you are involved in 
highway construction and shipbuilding and air traffic 
control, and I said, "How many women do we have at the 
Department of Transportation?"  And they said, "Nineteen 
percent are female."

<p>

And I said -- now, this is 1983 -- I said, "When 
the Department was established in 1967, how many women were 
there?"  Do you know what the answer was?  Eighteen and a 
half percent.  We had come up half a percentage point from 
1967 to 1983.

<p>

So we decided to set up a program to help women 
enter the field, move up the ladder, and receive 
opportunities in this important area of transportation, 
because, frankly, a lot of the higher paying jobs in the 
private sector are in this area.

<p>

So Jenna(?) was the one who helped put the program 
together, and it may not sound like a lot.  We got the 
percentage up four percentage points while we were there.  
But when you have 100,000 people in your work force, that's 
a lot of women, so we were kind of proud of that record.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I knew we were making progress when a pilot told 
me one day, he said, "Mrs. Dole, the strangest thing 
happened.  I was flying into a major city, and there were 
three different voices on the air traffic control system, 
and all three were female."  And I said, "Right!  The 
program is working!"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: More pro-family highlights from the 
GOP convention in just a moment.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from Christian Coalition's Faith and 
Freedom Celebration held August 14, 1996, follows:]

<p>

VICE PRESIDENT QUAYLE: Do you remember several 
years ago, like 1992, where I made a speech about the 
American family and where I talked about too many of our 
children were being born into fatherless homes?  Bill 
Clinton said that my speech about the family and family 
values was divisive.  Well, today he gives that speech.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And, friends, it shows, if you have the courage of 
your convictions, if you're willing to stand firm for 
principle, if you're willing to stay in the kitchen and take 
the heat, if you're willing to stand up for the family and 
stand up for what is right, we will prevail.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CAPT. SCOTT O'GRADY:  I will have to tell you what 
Scott O'Grady thinks a hero is.  A hero is somebody who 
helps somebody else.  The only thing I was doing was 
surviving, saving myself.  But I'll let you in on something. 
It doesn't take a 19-year-old Marine to go out there under 
hostile fire to save somebody's life to be considered a 
hero.  Every single person here in America can be a hero 
when you help somebody else.

<p>

The reward doesn't come from being recognized.  It 
should come from within, knowing that you did the right 
thing.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE J.C. WATTS:  Let me tell you 
something.  There is nothing more in all the world that I 
enjoy and appreciate talking about more, and that is my 
faith and my relationship with the true and the living God.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And, friends, let me tell you something.  I don't 
apologize for it.  I don't apologize for it if I'm in the 
halls of Congress.  I don't apologize if I'm on the football 
field, on the basketball court.  I don't apologize for it.

<p>

Back in 1994, when I decided that I was going to 
run for Congress, a guy called me from Washington, D.C., a 
reporter, and he asked me, and he talked to me about a lot 
of different things, and he finally, after about 30 minutes, 
got around to asking me the $64,000 question.

<p>

He asked me, he said, "Well, Commissioner" -- I 
was a corporation commissioner at the time -- he said, 
"Commissioner, let me ask you, are you going to accept the 
help from the radical Christian right in your party?"

<p>

I said, "Sir, since you put it like that, I'm a 
Baptist minister, so I am the radical Christian right in my 
party."

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It's so amazing to me that you would think that 
the society wants the Christian community, the faith 
community, to just kind of stand on the sidelines and 
twiddle their thumbs while the nation goes to pot.  I say 
no.  We've got a role to play in this country.  We love our 
country just as much as anyone else.  And I say, Keep your 
chin up.  You fight the good fight, accept the challenge to 
go out and be the very best that we can be and sustain the 
greatness of being the greatest, the freest, most 
prosperous, most wonderful country on the face of the Earth.

<p>

God bless you, and let's go get 'em on November 5. 
Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REV. PAT ROBERTSON:  . . . but we're not going to 
rest until the time comes when, once again, we are proud of 
the occupant of the White House and not ashamed.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And we're not going to rest until once again 
America is that bright, shining light set on a hill, when it 
is considered the hope of freedom of all the nations of the 
Earth, when that Statue of Liberty is once again held high, 
without the stain that has been placed upon it by certain 
occupants from Arkansas and others that need to go home.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

But beyond that, we're going to see a time, my 
friends, and if we continue to work and this organization 
continues to grow and people of the grass roots continue to 
come out of their churches and out of their pews and into 
the polls and into the precincts and into the political 
process, we're going to see a time in America when once 
again it can be said, "There is America.  We give her to our 
children and our grandchildren, free, strong, proud, and 
truly one nation under God."

<p>

God bless all of you, and thank you.  God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

HOUSE SPEAKER NEWT GINGRICH:  There is a moral 
basis for lower taxes, and it is the belief that parents are 
superior to bureaucrats as the source of a family -- 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It is the belief that if you get up and you go out 
and you work, you have a legitimate first claim on your own 
money, and the government has to earn the right to raise any 
of your money in taxes.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And it is the belief that in a healthy, free 
society, if America has been good to you, you have an 
obligation to be good to your fellow Americans by reaching 
out a helping hand.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When liberals say compassion, they mean write a 
check to the IRS so they can hire a bureaucrat.  When we say 
compassion, we mean find a neighbor or a friend or a family 
member who needs help, and you help a person who needs help 
in a direct way.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And this morning, we went to two houses where 
Habitat for Humanity, working with the family, had helped 
build a house, and we said a prayer of dedication, and a 
family which had earned the ability to be buying their own 
home had the proud moment of knowing that they and their 
children would become homeowners and citizens and involved 
in their community.  And that, not the government 
bureaucracy, is the right way to help America.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MRS. KEMP:  We are so honored and excited to have 
been given this awesome responsibility.  We thank you for 
your help.  We solicit your prayers.  We are so thrilled as 
a family to be behind Bob Dole, and we thank you for your 
support that is going to make this ticket a winning one.
Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for joining us on <i>Straight
Talk</i>. We have more highlights coming up.

<p>

[Segments from Dole/Kemp Kick Off Rally held 
August 16, 1996, follow:]

<p>

ANNOUNCER:  . . . the next President and Vice 
President of the United States, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I have a couple of jerseys that I would like to 
present to the "Dream Team" -- the Dream Team.  I have to 
tell you, and I want to start off with our next Vice 
President, Jack Kemp.  Jack?  There you are, number 15.  I 
want you to know, we got number 15 . . . number 96 for 
Victory '96.   Victory '96, the Dream Team.

<p>

MR. KEMP: I'm thrilled to be on Bob Dole's ticket.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I want you to know, it is with great humility, 
awesome responsibility, incredible excitement, that Joanne 
and I and our family join the Dole team.  Let me say it 
again today in front of our friends in the press, in front 
of our San Diego family and in front of all those 
Republicans with whom we feel such comradeship, it ain't for 
the Republican Party, with all due respect.  This is for 
America.  Bob Dole wants this country to be restored and the 
dream of America for all people.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I've got to tell you, if I had known when 
Spanos(?) gave me this jersey with 15 on it that that was 
going to be the tax cut for America, I wish I was Jim Brown 
and was 32.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I'll tell you what.  Fifteen is the down 
payment on a new code for America that Bob Dole and I will 
design with the family in mind, with growth and opportunity 
as our goal, and with that equality of opportunity for which 
we as a party -- and Bob Dole spoke last night, too, that 
Lincoln founded the Republican Party in 1860 on one simple 
yet profound predicate:  that all men are created equal; 
that there is a Creator, and He created us equal, and there 
is only one system designed on this Earth to unleash the 
potential of the human spirit to which I talked, and Bob, 
last night.  I want you to know with all my heart that's 
what Kemp, that's what Bob Dole, Elizabeth, Joanne, and this 
whole team are all about.

<p>

I'll close with this thought.  You can imagine, as 
I said earlier, my emotions coming back to San Diego as a 
candidate for the Vice Presidency of the United States.  I 
want to thank Bob for saying in his speech last night, we do 
not look at the other party or those in power today as 
enemies.  They are opponents.  I learned on the football 
field that you can be a good opponent and walk off that 
field, shake hands, and be friends, and I can tell you, my 
best friends in professional football are not just my 
teammates but the guys who used to try to knock my head off 
on Sunday.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I respect that.  I respect that.  It is going to 
be tough, it is going to be long, it is going to be 
incredibly competitive.  And I will just say this to close, 
my second closing -- 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

The Democratic Party, bless their hearts, are not 
democratic.  They are elitist.  That party of Roosevelt and 
Harry Truman and John F. Kennedy has turned into a party 
that wants to run our lives, run your business, manage your 
farm, tell you where to send your children to school.  They 
want to control your money.  They think that if Bob Dole 
cuts their taxes, that it's taking away from the government.

<p>

We are not going to deny the government the 
resources it needs to do what Bob Dole talked about last 
night, to provide a net, a safety net, under which people 
will not be allowed to fall.  There is no man in America who 
cares more about the disabled, the left behind, low income, 
than Bob Dole.  I just want you to know we are going to save 
the net, make it stronger, but we are going to build a 
ladder of opportunity out of poverty upon which all American 
men and women can climb, and that is the Dole-Kemp message.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. DOLE:  I think I did accept the nomination 
last night, so I am proud to be your nominee for President 
of the United States.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

How many think I made a good pick in choosing Jack Kemp?

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And Joanne, too, of course.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Fifteen percent tax cut.  Keep that in mind.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Jack and Joanne have 4 children and 11 
grandchildren, 15.  Fifteen, keep that in mind.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And let me say to my friends -- I know the press 
may not be listening, but let me just say to my friends -- 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I didn't mean it that way.  I mean, I just want to 
tell you a little secret.

<p>

AUDIENCE:  It was an A-plus.

<p>

MR. DOLE:  All right.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If I have anything at all in dealing with my 
colleagues in the Congress of the United States over the 
past many years, it has been credibility.  Democrats and 
Republicans -- the Democrats may have to take a little leave 
of absence here for a while -- but I would not propose a tax 
cut, and I would have not proposed the economic package had 
I not been certain that we could achieve it without hurting 
social security, without hurting Medicare.

<p>

But I really believe that we have an obligation to 
families with children and taxpayers all across America to 
make our tax code flatter and fairer and simpler, and we're 
going to get the job done.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

So we're excited.  I said when I arrived in San 
Diego it was getting exciting, and Elizabeth said, "Well, 
it's about time."

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And I'm now leaving full of excitement and full of 
enthusiasm and full of confidence.

<p>

I did call President Reagan yesterday about 4 
o'clock.  When I got him on the phone, I said, "Mr. 
President, tonight I will give my acceptance speech, and I 
want to say as I do that I have talked to you, and that out 
of great respect from all Americans for you, Mr. President, 
I want to be able to say that we're going to win because we 
have the right agenda, because we are the party of ideas, 
and because we want to complete the Reagan revolution."

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And he said, "That's fine."

<p>

And then I said to him what a great job Nancy 
Reagan had done in her tribute to him just two nights 
before.  And then Nancy came on the line and we had a good 
visit.

<p>

But the bottom line is, Ronald Reagan certainly 
was a man for his time.  He provided great leadership for 
all Americans regardless of party --

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

-- followed by my good friend, George Bush, who 
did the same and should have been reelected.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

So I want to make the same plea that Jack did.
When you go back home -- some of you are already home, but 
the message is the same.  Contact your neighbors, people you 
go to church with, people you go to service clubs with, 
people you work with, whether it is in the hotel, whether it 
is somewhere else.  Let them know about the Republican 
Party.  Let them know that we're looking ahead.

<p>

I see all these great young people here this 
morning.  That's the future of our party.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And if we don't keep our word, if you can't trust 
us, then throw us out.  But I trust the American people.  I 
believe you will trust us, and together we will make America 
a better place as we go into the next century.

<p>

Thank you.  God bless America.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I want to know why you're here, "Mr. President."

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  Apparently -- I don't 
know if you heard -- this is a late-breaking story -- but I 
believe the Republicans snuck into the White House and 
removed some personal effects, papers and things, from the 
top of the shredder in, I mean top of the file cabinet in 
Hillary's private quarters.  I don't know if you've seen 
this or not, but Hillary was never in Hanoi with Jane Fonda.
Never, ever was she in Hanoi with Jane Fonda.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of things were said, Mr. President.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  I was nowhere near 
Gary Hart and Miss Rice, Donna Rice -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I see.  It's all a lie.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: All a lie. And there 
is absolutely, positively no truth whatsoever to the rumor 
that Newt and I are in any way, shape, or form related, not 
even halfway.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I see.

<p>

Mr. President, what brings you to the Republican convention?

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: Well, what I'm trying 
to do is right this terrible injustice to myself and my 
administration and my family. I'm going to ask Bob Dole, 
Jack Kemp, and Newt Gingrich to 'fess up to this, basically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I see.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  And if need be, I will 
take it to the convention floor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Any thoughts about the fact that now 
they seem to be 9 points away from you instead of 20?

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  You know, any time you 
get somebody new on board, obviously, there's going to be a 
little bit of excitement.  And not only that; he's got nice 
hair.  We all know that the American public -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Nice hair sells.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR:  Nice hair sells.  So 
it'll wear off in a few weeks.  I'm not concerned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for your time, Mr. President.

<p>

BILL CLINTON IMPERSONATOR: Thank you very much. 
God bless you.  God bless America.  Don't forget, a party in 
the Presidential suite.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are taking a look at the 
Democratic National Convention and how the Democrats face 
the problems affecting American families.  We will talk 
about Family Research Council's role at the convention and 
how the pro-life and pro-family message plays to a key group 
within the Democratic Party.  You won't want to miss seeing 
some of these DNC highlights.

<p>

But first we bring you Robert Knight, FRC's 
director of cultural studies. Just yesterday, I spoke with
Bob about the historical Senate vote which protected 
marriage as it has been defined since the beginning of time:
as a union between one man and one woman.  In fact, the 
Family Research Council provided key information to those 
drafting the Defense of Marriage Act, also known as DOMA, 
and spearheaded an ad campaign to inform the public of the 
importance of protecting marriage.

<p>

Bob and I discussed the influence gay activists
asserted in their attempts to redefine marriage and to pass
a gay civil rights bill, also known as the Employment Non-Discrimination 
Act, or ENDA.  Let's hear what Bob had to say
as we bring you insights we're sure you didn't hear on the
national news, as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

As you well know, yesterday there were some very 
historic votes in the Senate, first on the Defense of 
Marriage Act and then on ENDA, the gay civil rights bill.  
It is amazing that we are talking about whether marriage is 
really a man and a woman.

<p>

We are going to talk in a couple moments about the 
implications of that, but first, could you tell us what was 
the chain of events that led us to actually debate what is 
marriage and how sex should be interjected in the workplace.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it all started several years 
ago in Hawaii when three homosexual couples came to the 
state and said, look, we want marriage licenses.  The state 
said no, you can't, because it is reserved for men and women 
together.  And they took their case to court, and it wound 
its way up to the Hawaiian Supreme Court, which sent it down 
to the lower court with instructions warning them that 
they're going to legalize same-sex unions as marriage if the
state can't find a compelling interest.

<p>

That case has wound its way back up to the 
Hawaiian circuit court level, where it began yesterday, on 
September 10.  That case could result in the legalization of 
gay marriage, so called.

<p>

Now, this presents a conflict for the rest of the 
states, because they are supposed to recognize each other's 
marriage licenses and driver's licenses, and so forth, under 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution.

<p>

And so people who are concerned about this being 
forced on other states drafted the Defense of Marriage Act 
at the federal level, which does two things.  It defines 
marriage as the union of a man and a woman as husband and 
wife, for federal purposes, because it is in the Federal 
Code hundreds of times -- you'd better know what it means -- 
and it gives the states protection against being forced by 
the Full Faith and Credit Clause from having their marriage 
laws radically redefined.

<p>

It doesn't impose a federal definition of 
marriage.  I mean, it would be nice if it did, but then 
again, that's not really the Federal Government's role.  But 
the Federal Government does have a role under the Full Faith 
and Credit Clause.  Congress is ordered to interpret the use 
of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

<p>

So this is entirely constitutional, and it is
necessary, because gay activists have said they plan to fly
couples from the 50 states to Honolulu, get the marriage
licenses, come back, and raise the issue in the courts. So
we needed this kind of protection.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the Defense of Marriage Act is an 
attempt to stop what the gay activists have said that they 
are going to do, which is break down the definition of 
marriage and the institution of marriage in all the 50 
states by forcing it through the courts rather than 
legislatively.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, exactly, and some of the gay 
activists have been very candid about this.  Michelangelo
Cignorilli(?), who writes for the <i>New York Times</i>
periodically, wrote in <i>Out</i> magazine that same-sex marriage 
-- quote, unquote -- was the final tool to get rid of the
rest of the sodomy laws -- and there are sodomy laws in 18
states -- teach children about homosexuality in the public
schools, and, in short, usher in a sea change about how the
public views homosexuality.

<p>

He also said gay activists should acquire "same-sex 
marriage" not as a way of living up to society's moral 
codes but as a way to destroy this "archaic institution" 
which, as it is, "serves to keep us down."  In other words, 
it's not about two people yearning to get a marriage license 
out there; it's about an organized group of very well-heeled, 
very aggressive homosexual activists who are trying 
to use marriage as a weapon in a larger struggle, which is 
to force society to affirm homosexuality as good and normal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you know, Bob, the polling 
numbers on marriage and support for the Defense of Marriage 
Act have risen volcanically.  In Hawaii, which is a liberal 
state, you've got numbers now close to 80 -- they have risen 
about 15 points or so -- and nationwide above 80 percent in 
favor of defense of marriage.

<p>

And so you take this really popular bill, and 
we've seen some gutting techniques and amendments added, in 
particular from Senator Kennedy.  Could you tell us a little 
bit about that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. This was interesting, the way 
the gay activists saw this coming as a steamroller and said, 
well, we have to throw something in front of it.  They got 
Senator Ted Kennedy to throw the Employment Non-
Discrimination Act in front of it, and that is what we call 
the gay jobs bill. It would be an historic restructuring of 
civil rights, because it would add a behavioral component 
for the first time. Sexual orientation would acquire the 
same status as race, gender, and religious rights.  It has 
never been accorded that at the federal level.

<p>

So they hoped that this would be what we call in
Washington here a poison pill, where you attach something to
a bill you don't like, hoping that people won't swallow it,
and thus you kill the whole bill.

<p>

In negotiations with the Senate leadership, Trent 
Lott and Don Nickles, who is the chief sponsor of DOMA, they 
agreed to bring up four amendments on each side.  One of 
them was this gay jobs bill. When Senator Kennedy saw the
Republicans' amendments, he didn't like them, canceled the 
whole deal, and they ended up with a deal allowing a 
straight vote on DOMA and ENDA separately. That cleared the
way for a clean vote on DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that is a little 
confusing, I think, is whether or not the Defense of 
Marriage Act can be canceled out by the gay civil rights 
bill, ENDA. Is that possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: ENDA would apply only to workplaces.
So it really wouldn't affect the marriage law that much.
What it would do is send a signal that the Republican-controlled 
Senate, in an election year, is talking about a 
national gay rights bill. I think the gays have to be happy 
about that, that they have gotten us to this point, that 
there hasn't been enough serious opposition among the 
leadership of the Republican Party, in particular -- because 
the Democratic Party is behind this -- and that is why it 
has become an issue.  If they had been steadfast, I don't 
think we ever would have seen this. We didn't even see this
under the Democratic Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to talk a couple of 
minutes, Bob, live about the implications of the two 
historic votes. But in terms of the gay civil rights bill,
would it inject sexuality into the workplace?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Right. It is supposed to reduce 
intolerance toward homosexuality and bisexuality; it is in 
the bill.  Actually, it would increase sexual tension in the 
workplace, because how would an employer know who is 
homosexual and who is not, unless the employee makes a point 
of it?  That has been the case all along.

<p>

I see a great threat to religious freedom, freedom 
of speech, freedom of association, because laws like this 
are not passed in a vacuum.  You've got the whole realm of 
sexual harassment laws to deal with that are kind of coupled 
to it.  What if a person has a Bible on his desk and a gay 
employee says, "Look, that book is homophobic and it says 
homosexuality is wrong.  That creates a hostile atmosphere 
to me, and I feel threatened."  What if the employer to do? 
Tell the guy to put the Bible away?  Now he's trampling on 
religious freedom.

<p>

How about the provision in ENDA which says there 
can be no consideration at all based on sexual orientation? 
So what if an employer prefers to hire a person that he 
thinks is morally straight, like a good boy scout would be? 
A homosexual would-be employee can say, "Well, you hired 
that person because he was heterosexual."  And the employer 
would say, "No, I didn't. I did it on qualification."  And 
the gay would-be employee will say, "Well, prove it."  And 
you could see where this can go. With a couple of activist 
lawyers and a couple of liberal judges, you've got a big gun 
aimed at American business' head.

<p>

So I cannot understand why more people who should 
know better don't see this as what it is, a massive 
expansion of federal power over America's workplaces.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Bob, we'll be back in just a 
couple moments to talk with you about the Defense of 
Marriage Act and the gay civil rights bill. Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are joined by Robert 
Knight, director of cultural studies for FRC.  Bob played a 
key role in relaying information pertinent to the Defense of 
Marriage Act and the gay civil rights bill.  Bob, thanks so 
much for being with us on the show.

<p>

Yesterday, before the vote, you and I were talking 
about how we got to this situation, the court case in 
Hawaii, in which arguments started yesterday, and all the 
different states getting concerned.  But now we've had the 
votes.  Why don't you quickly first tell us the results of 
the two votes, and then let's start talking implications.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, DOMA was a resounding victory.
The Defense of Marriage Act passed by a vote of 85-14.
There was one Senator missing, David Pryor, who was out of 
town because of a son's medical emergency.

<p>

What was most interesting, though, was the vote 
following that on what we call the gay jobs bill and Senator 
Kennedy calls the Employment Non-Discrimination Act.  What 
that act does is add sexual orientation to civil rights law 
in the workplace, therefore giving it the highest possible 
protection, right along with ethnicity or race.

<p>

We squeaked by.  They defeated ENDA by one vote, 
50 to 49.  Now, that's the first time the U.S. Senate has 
voted on a gay rights bill, and we just saw it go down by 
one vote, and I think that is very significant.  It shows 
that the homosexual activist lobby was very active in 
promoting that.  It is almost as if they gave up on DOMA 
because millions of people, frankly, were hammering the 
Senate on DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Calls and phone calls and letters 
and talk shows and -- 

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Oh, yes. Even many liberal -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of energy.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, a lot of energy on DOMA.  People 
just saw the threat to marriage and reacted.

<p>

ENDA wasn't on their radar screen.  It is almost 
as if the homosexuals did an end run.  In fact, ENDA 
originally was attached to DOMA as a killer amendment by 
Senate Kennedy, and then through a series of parliamentary 
maneuvers, it was stripped off DOMA so DOMA could have a 
clean vote.  But then the compromise that Kennedy extracted 
was to have a vote on ENDA straight up, which was 
unprecedented.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think one of the things that we 
have to mention is, even though the gay civil rights bill 
was defeated, Senator Pryor said that he intended to vote in 
favor of that, and in a 50-50 split, I think we have to 
anticipate that the Clinton Administration, with Vice 
President Al Gore having the tie-breaker, probably would 
have voted in favor of gay civil rights, given some of their 
other policies and their discussion of gay civil rights.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Every vote counted, and I 
didn't know whether ENDA would go through or not.  A very 
good sign was when Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas Republican, 
took the floor against it.  She is not exactly a big 
opponent of gay rights; in fact, she prefaced her remarks 
saying, "Well, I support rights for gay people," and so 
forth.

<p>

But this bill would shackle businesses with 
another layer of federal regulation.  It would be an 
unprecedented intrusion into the workplace.  And it would 
interfere with the beliefs of millions of Americans.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have to jump on that for a 
second, because everyone understands in their workplace EEOC 
regulations, equal opportunity regulations, that say perhaps 
we need a percentage of so many women or so many of a 
certain minority, or we are looking at a community; we have 
to have this kind of mixture to legally qualify for federal 
grants or even to avoid prosecution.

<p>

So to take a look at something that talks about 
sex in civil rights legislation, doesn't that mean we would 
have to ask every person, "How do you have sex?" when they 
are hired?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, that would protect an employer,
I suppose, under ENDA.  ENDA has a non-quotas provision in 
it. They say specifically you cannot base quotas on sexual 
orientation.  But we have seen similar promises before in 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act when Hubert Humphrey said, "Don't 
worry, this won't lead to quotas."  And we know what 
happened.  We got racial quotas, we got gender quotas, we 
got the whole ball of wax.

<p>

You know what would happen.  Employers would try 
to find out the sexual orientation of their employees so 
they could be seen to be complying with the act.  Quotas 
follow civil rights laws as naturally as day follows night. 
It is the only way they can prove they are complying.

<p>

And, as you said, it would inject sex into the 
workplace.  Right now most employers really don't care if 
their employees are homosexual or not.  There really isn't 
this great problem. In fact, Ed Mickens(?), a writer for 
<i>The Advocate</i> magazine, a gay national magazine, wrote two 
years ago that gays aren't being fired from their jobs in a 
big way.  In fact, because the Cracker Barrel had fired a 
lesbian, the fact that it was so sensational pointed out the 
larger fact that it just isn't happening.  You have a case 
here or there, but there is no great national upsurge in 
rooting out homosexuals from their jobs.

<p>

And so they have manufactured this issue.  And had 
they prevailed, we are talking about a threat to religious 
freedom, freedom of speech, freedom of association.  How 
about a Christian employee who puts a Bible on his desk, and 
a guy in the office who maybe he didn't know was gay says, 
"You know, that's a homophobic book.  I feel threatened.  
You have created an atmosphere of sexual harassment here."

<p>

What is the poor employer to do?  If he tells the 
guy to take the Bible out, he is just trampling on religious 
freedom.  If he leaves the Bible in, the gay goes to the 
EEOC and says, "Hey, I feel put upon; I feel harassed."  I 
mean, this is a lawyer's dream, this kind of legislation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems that the only way that you 
can deal with it is to talk openly about it.  In the Sunday 
<i>New York Times</i>, there was a fascinating article on the front 
of the national section about people who cross-dress and 
bisexuals saying that they are not, to use a phrase, 
"straight homosexuals," where they are not just all guys or 
just all girls; they like to be a mixture of all, so that 
they need their own separate classification.

<p>

So we are going to have, I guess, straight 
straight and straight homosexual or lesbian and then people 
who cross-dress, and it seems like the checkoff for man, 
woman, minority, sexual, occupation, is going to be pretty 
intense.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it has got to be.  And the 
whole problem with sexual orientation is, it's in the mind. 
And the law concerns human actions, not thoughts.  This 
would be an unprecedented attempt to inject fortune-telling 
into the law.  I mean, how would you know what is in 
somebody's mind unless they tell you?

<p>

A friend of mine, Paul Mirro(?), who works for Bob 
Dornan, wrote a funny piece just yesterday called <i>My
Favorite Martian</i>. It's about an employer who sits down with 
an employee, a long-time employee, and the employee says to 
the employer, "I need to talk to you.  I have to tell you 
something."  He says, "I'm a Martian."

<p>

The employer says, "Well, I didn't know you were a 
Martian."  The employee says, "Well, I've kept it secret."
It goes into a parody, and he uses all the language the gay 
activists use.  When it comes down to it, the employer says,
"Well, since nothing you have done is Martian and I didn't 
know you were Martian, why are you making it evident to me?" 
The employee says, "Because I want to be recognized for 
what I am."

<p>

The employer says, "Well, then, aren't you 
imposing your Martianness on the rest of us?"  And the 
employee says, "Well, yeah, but why not?  What's wrong with 
being a Martian?"  And again, he could never nail down 
exactly what a Martian was.  He said his parents weren't 
Martians, but he just knew he was a Martian.  I knows this 
sounds silly, but it shows how silly the whole thing is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that has been 
discussed is whether or not the gay civil rights bill might 
be attached to an appropriations bill, whether we might see 
it one more time before this Congress leaves.  Senator 
Kennedy has been a real champion of it.  Do you think that 
is possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It is possible. Our lobbyists have 
told us that there is scuttlebutt on the floor that they 
might try to attach it to another bill and hope Senator 
Pryor is back in town to break the tie.

<p>

I am not sure that is what the Clinton 
Administration would like to have happen, because then you 
would have Al Gore breaking the tie.  That would put the 
administration in a very visible position of supporting a 
gay rights bill on a national level.  They are already on 
record as doing so, but this would notch it up a few 
degrees.

<p>

I am not sure that any political campaign really 
wants to inject that element into a campaign.  The 
Republicans have been very quiet about it, and the Democrats 
haven't exactly made it a huge issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. The <i>Post</i> made a point this 
morning of talking about the rather subdued debate leading 
to a rather quick vote, which anyone who watches much C-SPAN 
knows that that is not very normal.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: No, it isn't. Both parties are 
uncomfortable with the issue.  They wanted to get it off 
their plates and on to other business, and they did do the 
right thing by rejecting ENDA and passing DOMA, in my 
estimation.

<p>

I think the DOMA victory should give a lot of 
people heart that there has been a realization that you can 
go too far.  You can knock at the stilts of civilization and 
perhaps bring it down, and this was a lot of Americans 
shoring up that foundation with DOMA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So where do the bills go from now?
Obviously, one -- Senator Kennedy is saying that the gay 
civil rights bill he will probably just reintroduce next 
time.  Where does DOMA go?  It has been passed by the 
Senate.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: DOMA goes right to President 
Clinton's desk, and in the words of our president, Gary
Bauer, "President, eat your spinach and sign the bill."
And, of course, that is Gary's reference to the fact that he 
suspects that Bill Clinton doesn't really want to sign the 
bill, but he said he will, so he expects him to do so.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That was a real point that the 
Republicans made on the floor: If the President likes it, 
why wouldn't you be for it?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Well, I don't think everybody 
is believing that the President really likes it.  After all, 
the President was on record as supporting ENDA while it was 
attached as an amendment to DOMA in an effort to kill DOMA. 
So it is kind of, on one hand he is saying, "Okay, I'm for 
marriage"; on the other hand, "I'm for all these guys 
attaching these things that everybody says might kill it."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you say, Bob, to people who 
think that it is only a matter of simple fairness?  We heard 
that phrase: "It's a matter of simple justice and a matter 
of simple fairness." Do we want someone who is homosexual 
or lesbian to be fired from their job for being homosexual? 
It's a matter of simple fairness.  What is your response to 
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, I think the polls are very 
revealing.  If you frame it that way, "Do you think gays 
ought to be fired just for being gay?" almost nobody says 
yes, because in a vacuum like that, it sounds unfair; it 
sounds un-American.  And it probably is, depending on the 
job and how the sexuality was made manifest.  You know, a 
lot of these concepts sound great until you try them in the 
real world.

<p>

What ENDA would have done was, instead of leveling 
the playing field, it would have added an entirely new 
component.  It would have allowed gay employees or would-be 
employees an enormous ability to litigate against an 
employer if they didn't get what they wanted.  And it is not 
as if they are not a litigious group.  I mean, they've got 
suits against the boy scouts, they've got suits about sexual 
harassment, they've got gay lawyers hammering this issue all 
over the country.  They were licking their chops at the 
prospect of having a federal law in place that said you must 
take sexual orientation into account, basically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But would the research indicate that 
homosexuals and lesbians are being fired and that they are 
suffering economically because of the way in which they have 
sex?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: There is no evidence that that is 
happening. There are probably a handful of cases where 
employers have said, "I'm not comfortable with this 
behavior; you'd better work someplace else."  Depending on 
the situation, that might be okay, it might not.  What if 
it's a day camp?  What if it's the boy scouts?  What if it's 
an organization that deals with children?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. It is easy to see in a case 
recently in Virginia where a teacher was in pornographic, 
homosexual films, working as a gym teacher with young boys. 
When this information was revealed, he was fired.  And 
would he not have an actionable case under the gay civil 
rights bill to come back and say, "Hey, they fired me for my 
sexual practices"?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, that is right, because the term 
is "sexual orientation" in the law, and real or perceived. 
That's the way they define it:  homosexuality, bisexuality, 
heterosexuality, whether real or perceived.

<p>

He could say, "Well, look.  Because I was in a gay 
porn film, an ordinary person might conclude I'm homosexual. 
Therefore, I am being fired on an outside activity, 
unrelated to work, has nothing to do with my job as a 
teacher, but it's the perception that I'm homosexual, that's 
my orientation, and you're firing me."  I think he would 
have a case under ENDA.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you go into the case, too, 
Bob, out of Canada where a mayor ran into an interesting 
circumstance, to help people understand how some of these 
things have broken out?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. The gays use the rhetoric of 
fairness:  gays just want to be left alone.  But I think the 
situation in an Ontario town, Hamilton, proves the opposite. 
The mayor was approached by gay rights groups and asked to 
create a gay pride week, and he said, "Well, this is a 
Catholic, blue-collar town.  I don't think so.  You know, I 
have nothing against you guys, but I'm not going to proclaim 
a pride in something most people think is wrong."

<p>

They hauled him before the Human Rights Commission 
in Ontario, and he was threatened with a fine of $5,000 
personally for hate-mongering and bigotry because he 
wouldn't celebrate homosexuality.  So that's not exactly 
asking to be left alone and just being tolerant.

<p>

This is a very aggressive agenda that is designed 
to harness the power of law to force affirmation of 
homosexuality on everybody else, because, as you asked, are 
gays doing okay in the workplace?  Yes, I would say so.  The 
surveys show they are among the top group in per capita 
income, disposable income, college degrees, advanced 
degrees, even frequent flyer miles.  I mean, they travel a 
lot.  The gay magazines are full of luxury items.  They're 
not hurting.  They're not hurting like blacks were after 
years of racism and Jim Crow laws.  They just don't meet the 
requirement for a put-upon minority group.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think one thing that we have to 
do, from the Family Research Council, we are always looking 
at what happens to children.  Looking at the DOMA and the 
gay civil rights bill, one of the things that we are all 
seeing a lot of is lesbian couples adopting -- this has 
become very vogue lately -- and a lot of controversy now 
that we are in the back-to-school time about human sexuality 
classes, and whether or not we say that homosexuality exists 
or whether we say that it is morally neutral and people are 
just as welcome to enter that as any other lifestyle.

<p>

How do you think a gay civil rights bill would 
affect lesbian or homosexual adoptions or the kinds of 
things that we teach in a sex education class?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, it would be a tremendous boost 
to the attempts by homosexuals to adopt children.  We saw 
that in a Florida case right after Amendment 2 was shot down 
by the Supreme Court.  That was the Colorado amendment that 
said you can't make sexual orientation a specially protected 
class.  A lesbian lawyer misinterpreted the ruling but used 
it in a case, an adoption case, saying the Supreme Court 
says you can't discriminate in any way against homosexuals, 
even in parenting.  And, of course, the Court never said any 
such thing, but that is the kind of thing that happens when 
you enshrine the concept of sexual orientation within the 
law.

<p>

There is a perception that if it ain't illegal, 
it's okay, and if you raise the bar even higher and say not 
only isn't it illegal but we're going to give it special 
benefits and privileges we don't give just any behavior, 
we're going to make --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Because we're celebrating it.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: We're celebrating, we're protecting 
it.  Society has a stake in making sure people continue to 
engage in homosexual behavior.  That's what they're saying.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to keep up with 
you, Bob, on what happens as I know this comes back, and 
when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you some highlights 
from the Democratic National Convention and we'll see how 
the Democrats addressed issues affecting you and your 
family. Stay tuned.

[Scenes from the Chicago Democratic National 
Convention, then segments from Celebration of Life rally 
held August 26, 1996, follow:]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RALPH HALL: Let me just say to 
you, to set the stage for brevity for the other Members of 
Congress and the other people who will speak, I served in 
the Texas Senate for 10 years, I served as a judge for 12 
years, I have been 16 years in the House of Representatives.
I have heard testimony from fathers and mothers.  I have 
heard testimony from pastors.  I have heard testimony from 
men and women of medicine.  I have heard testimony for all 
those years, and after hearing all of that from the word go, 
with rancor toward none but prayers for all, I come down on 
the side of life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE COLLIN PETERSON:  . . . and I think 
one of the good things about the fact that you're here at 
this convention and your presence is here is that you're 
getting at what we've been trying to do in the Congress, and 
that is to try to end some of the partisanship, to try to 
have some common-sense solutions to things, and try to end 
all this bickering and fighting that goes on between the 
parties.

<p>

We have worked hard to do that.  I hope that your 
organizations and your groups will look at Members of 
Congress based on what their beliefs are, what their voting 
records are, and where they stand on the issues, and not 
necessarily what party they belong to.

<p>

There are 43 members of the House of 
Representatives that vote pro-life 100 percent of the time. 
You can count on us to be there all the time. That's 
almost a fourth of the Democratic Caucus. There are a lot 
of people that are pro-life in the Democratic Party.  I am 
one of those people.  I am proud to be pro-life. . .

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE BART STUPAK: The issue before us 
today is not about the politics of choice but the deeply 
held principles of life and living.  The issue before us 
today is not about allowing the continuation of ghastly and 
objectionable procedures but of rededicating ourselves to 
the belief that all children should be protected.  They 
should live, and they should be allowed to grow.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. RALPH REED: Our message to President Clinton,
Al Gore, and Chris Dodd is, we will not allow you to drive 
pro-lifers out of the Democratic Party.  This party is going 
to continue to have pro-life activists.

<p>

[Conclusion of DNC segments.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It was wonderful to see the pro-life 
Democrats speaking out at rallies such as the one held by 
the Christian Coalition and the National Right to Life 
Committee.

<p>

Here to discuss the Democratic National Convention 
and its impact on America's families, we are joined by 
Maureen Roselli, executive director of the Catholic 
Alliance, and Cathy Deeds, deputy director of government 
relations for FRC.  Welcome to you both.

<p>

You all were both in Chicago taking a pro-family, 
pro-life message to the Democratic convention.  Whom did you 
find there that was willing to hear that message?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, we were very fortunate. As
you said, Christian Coalition hosted a rally called 
Celebration of Life on Monday.  We had that at the Field 
Museum.  It was attended by over 450 people, which was 
wonderful.  Collin Peterson and Representatives Stenholm, 
Stupak, and Volkmer all spoke at that rally.  So it was 
wonderful to see the Representatives come out, talk about 
the pro-life movement, and be so supported by such a large 
number of pro-life Democrats.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Who do you think represents the pro-family 
and pro-life constituency within the Democratic 
Party?  Certainly a lot of people talk about Reagan 
Democrats in terms of a lot of blue-collar family people and 
Catholics nationwide.  Do you think that still represents 
the group that really resonates with that message?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, certainly as Catholics we 
embrace the pro-life movement because it's a doctrinal issue 
with our faith. You cannot be anti-life and be a Catholic. 
So certainly those Catholics who are in the Democratic 
Party should be going toward the pro-life movement.
Certainly Governor Casey has been a wonderful example of 
that in the Democratic Party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: He now heads the American Families Organization.

<p>

And, Cathy, I know you were there for Family 
Research Council.  What did you find as you were looking for 
people to talk with about a pro-family message?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Well, of course, as you know, Kristi, 
Family Research Council is a nonpartisan organization, but 
we feel like our issues and our message transcend political 
parties, so FRC wanted to have a presence at both the 
Republican and the Democratic conventions.

<p>

Although it was a little more limited in the sense 
that we had to talk about maybe fewer issues that some 
Democratic people would be concerned about, we brought some 
messages to the various delegates, like -- we can get into 
those later on -- partial-birth abortion and family tax 
relief, the Defense of Marriage Act, which many of them 
should and do support.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about that in a moment.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i>
continues our discussion of the Democratic National 
Convention. Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking about the 
Democratic National Convention and the impact of policy 
discussed there on America's families.  I am joined by some 
key players in the fight for life, Maureen Roselli, 
executive director for the Catholic Alliance, and Cathy 
Deeds, the Family Research Council's deputy director of 
government relations.  Welcome back.

<p>

There were some issues that sent both of you to 
Chicago.  Maureen, what were you hoping to talk about?  What 
issues had the Catholic Alliance said, look, these are our 
key issues?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, the key issue that we wanted 
to bring for the Democratic Party was, of course, the pro-life 
issue.  We went to participate in the Celebration of 
Life that was hosted by Christian Coalition and National 
Right to Life, as I mentioned before.  Unfortunately, we 
found not as much tolerance for that discussion as we found 
in perhaps the other convention.

<p>

We, of course, are a nonpartisan organization. As 
a matter of fact, half of our advisory board is Democrat, 
and our membership is well represented by both Democrats and 
Republicans and even independents who join our organization.

<p>

But we basically found that the platform of the 
Democratic Party is so extreme, and it is only embraced by 
perhaps 5 to 10 percent of the population, and that platform 
is that abortion should be granted on demand and paid for by 
tax dollars.

<p>

So, really, as I said, it is only embraced by 5 to 
10 percent of the people, and we believe that, generally, 
Democrats are much more mainstream on this issue, and 
certainly Catholic Democrats are far more pro-life.  In a 
recent poll, it was discovered that 10 to 15 percent of 
Catholics would not vote for the Democratic Party because of 
the partial-birth abortion issue, even though they were 
Democrat.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Partial-birth abortion is a 
tremendous rallying cry right now.  Cathy, there is going to 
be an event tomorrow, Thursday, surrounding that.  Could you 
tell us a little bit more about that?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Yes, our listeners might be interested 
to know that. A very unprecedented event, really, that we 
expect about 100 Catholic bishops, and all of the Catholic 
cardinals in the United States are going to be here in 
Washington, and they are going to the Capitol to really 
plead with President Clinton one final time, or actually to 
Congress to override the President's veto of (the) partial-birth 
abortion (ban).

<p>

Partial-birth abortion is a good example when 
we are talking about pro-life Democrats, because, as 
everyone probably knows by now, it was such a bipartisan-supported 
bill, and more than 72 Democrats voted to ban this 
procedure.  And yet this President that says he wants to 
make abortion safe, legal, and rare, he could have done that 
by signing this bill, and he vetoed it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And to describe this horrible thing, 
a child, generally a child that could live outside the womb,
is delivered feet first into the birth canal, stabbed in the 
base of the skull, living brain tissue suctioned out, and 
then the dead child delivered, a child that the developer of 
that procedure said could live, that the majority of these 
horrible procedures are done on viable babies.

<p>

This has been a tremendous rallying cry for 
Republicans and Democrats.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes, absolutely, and it has been a 
really unifying issue for Catholics as well.  As Cathy said, 
the bishops have, in an unprecedented move this summer, 
asked people to participate in a postcard campaign on 
partial-birth abortion.  Even the Holy Father spoke out 
against this heinous crime, which is really, as Helen 
Alvarey(?) said, four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth 
abortion.

<p>

Catholic Alliance mailed out over 572,000 letters 
to Americans, Catholic Americans, educating them about this 
horrible procedure, and we have received tremendous response 
calling for the override of the President's veto.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What was your experience when you 
talked to the people at the Democratic National Convention 
about partial-birth abortion, which has been certainly a 
rallying cry, and then the life issue in general?  Were they 
interested in talking to you all about that?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Well, as a matter of fact, it was 
quite difficult in some sense, and I was reading a poll 
during the convention that said more than 60 percent of the 
convention delegates were pro-abortion, and in fact 77 
percent of the delegates supported the President's veto of 
the partial-birth abortion bill, clearly out of step with 
mainstream America and even Democrats, because we know about 
a third of self-identified Democrats are pro-life.

<p>

So we kind of had a difficult time breaking in to 
that particular audience, but we still tried, and what 
Family Research Council generally did was kind of just pass 
out our information on the partial-birth abortion.  People 
seemed thankful.  We had a few conversations.  But I don't 
know how well it really resonated.  We got a lot of paper 
out there.  Hopefully, people will be contacting us.
Hopefully, it dispelled some of the myths that they are 
hearing certainly from the White House, unfortunately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The myths on partial-birth abortions.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Did you find that people were 
generally uninformed about the realities?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, I think, like Family Research 
Council, Catholic Alliance, our contact at the Democratic 
convention was almost limited to those people who are 
already pro-life and pro-family.  We attended the Wednesday 
rally that was held outside of the actual convention.  There 
was a large rally; about 1,500 people attended.  Catholic 
Alliance was there and Family Research Council was there, as 
well, and they were passing out their fine information on 
the partial-birth abortion ban.

<p>

But I found that it was generally the people who 
were already pro-life who were taking that information, who 
were willing to talk to us about partial-birth abortion or 
any life issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Frustrating.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Yes.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: But that was another reason to be 
there, as well, to be of support for these pro-life 
Democratic heroes who really are in the minority and are 
oftentimes kind of punished or pushed to the side; nobody 
wants to hear from them.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: And we found that that was so, even 
though the Democratic Party talked about their "conscience 
clause" that is now in their platform, that they are 
supposed to be tolerant of the -- quote, unquote -- 
intolerant pro-lifers.

<p>

So even though that may be part of their platform 
now, our experience was still that we generally were only 
received by those people who were already, again, pro-life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There were some interesting 
contrasts in the two platforms, and we are going to have to 
talk about that in a moment.  More about the Democratic 
National Convention when we return.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are discussing the 
Democrats' role in the fight for America's families, and to 
help in that discussion, I am joined once again by Maureen 
Roselli and Cathy Deeds.  Maureen, I have to apologize in 
saying your name wrong the entire time.

<p>

It was interesting, though, to contrast -- Family 
Research Council was at San Diego and at Chicago, both, and 
the brouhaha over the way in which the Republicans weren't 
equally pro-abortion and pro-life seemed absent from the 
Democratic convention.  Did you find that the Democrats had 
more unanimity on this point and that is why it wasn't worth 
reporting?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, actually, I think it was 
really a media decision; at least that is what we found.  
There are the same number of pro-abortion Republicans as 
there are pro-life Democrats, and yet the pro-abortion 
Republicans received much more media attention than the pro-life 
Democrats did at their convention.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And how many is that?  That's 40?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: It's 40, roughly.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: It's roughly about the same number, 
because we lack -- we oftentimes rely on those pro-life 
Democrats to make up the votes that the pro-abortion 
Republicans -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which is kind of an untold story in 
a lot of pro-life votes -- 

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Yes, I don't think people realize -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- is that there is a solid voting 
bloc of pro-life Democrats.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And so, even though the numbers were 
the same, the coverage seemed very different then.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: It did, and there seemed to be much 
more attention drawn to the pro-abortion Republicans because 
there seemed to be more perhaps media pressure to change the 
platform of the Republican Party than there was to change 
the platform of the Democratic Party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Republican Party had a very 
strong pro-life plank, you know, very much a commitment to 
the unborn. And then they said, although we recognize that 
there are people with different views, and we want to be 
kind and respectful to each other.

<p>

And the Democrats.  Describe to us -- you said 
earlier a very extreme platform, but a lot of media 
attention was made about their so-called tolerance language, 
as well.  Was that reflected?  At the Republican convention, 
we saw a lot of pro-abortion speakers.  And at the 
Democratic convention, what did you all find?

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: Well, we know that Tony Hall was 
able to speak at the Democratic convention, but of course, 
what he was able to say was very limited.  When Cynthia 
McKinney of Georgia, who is a pro-abortionist, called for 
tolerance of the pro-life people in her party, she was met 
by silence at the convention.

<p>

So I think that certainly at the Republican Party, 
the Republicans seemed to go a little more out of their way 
to represent the pro-abortion side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What was your experience, Cathy?

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Just to add onto that, I think the 
Democrats were certainly more representative at their 
convention of their platform.  As we have been saying, their 
platform -- very extreme; it reaffirms the <i>Roe v. Wade</i>
decision, which is abortion on demand; no sort of call for 
any sort of restrictions; no support at all for the partial-
birth abortion (ban), which we said many, many Democrats 
supported, and then the speakers were consistently pro-
abortion.  Kate Michaelman(?) -- it was not shown on prime 
time, but the head of a national abortion rights group did 
talk about abortion and her own abortion.  I think that is 
very, very sad.

<p>

On the other hand, we saw in San Diego a very, 
very strong pro-life platform, very, very compassionate, 
wonderful language; and yet where were the pro-life speakers 
on the platform in San Diego?  We had wonderful heroes.  
Judiciary chairman Henry Hyde, who did chair the platform 
committee -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Republican platform.

<p>

MS. DEEDS: Right, the Republican platform -- he 
did speak at the convention, and he maybe had one line about 
the sanctity of human life.  But he was not able, it was my 
understanding, to give a specifically pro-life speech.  We 
certainly didn't have the president of National Right to 
Life giving any sort of speech, and in fact, it seems like 
the Republicans went out of their way to be tolerant of 
people like Colin Powell and Susan Molinari and other fairly 
prominent pro-abortion Republicans who reminded us of that 
of the platform.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: I think we have to say Governor 
Casey also experienced a repeat of four years ago.  He even 
went to Chicago to wait for the call so that he could go -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Governor Casey, the former governor of Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. ROSELLI: That is right, the former governor 
of Pennsylvania, a pro-life Democrat and really quite a 
sophisticated Democrat, was denied the right again this year 
to speak at his convention, the party that he has supported 
all of his life.  So again, he experienced that.  He went 
even to Chicago this time and waited for a phone call; still 
was not allowed to talk.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It wasn't quite the tolerant thing 
that we heard about in the news, it would seem.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you for sharing your 
stories and thank you even more so for going there to 
encourage the pro-life Democrats that we all know and work 
with.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you more 
information regarding topics affecting you and your family.
Stay with us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are discussing some solutions
to the current predicament of our education system.  It's
back-to-school time for children and parents across the
country, who face decisions ranging from school choice, or
lack of choice, to how to deal with controversial student
curriculum.

<p>

We will be talking to Congressman Lindsey Graham, 
who has proposed new steps toward education reform, and we 
will also be talking to a man who founded an organization 
which provides less privileged children and their parents 
with school choice.  You won't want to miss hearing what is 
happening in education on tonight's show.

<p>

But first, we will be taking you to an historical 
event that took place just last week.  Catholic cardinals 
and bishops, along with other religious leaders from across 
the country, gathered to lead prayer on the steps of our 
Nation's Capitol.  Their prayers were pleas for the lives of 
unborn children and appeals to our Congress as they vote to 
override the President's veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act, a vote that could come even tomorrow.

<p>

This is very timely because, just hours ago, the 
Clinton Administration successfully pushed the FDA approval 
of the abortion-causing drug, RU 486.  The Family Research 
Council is already targeting this historical decision, and 
we will keep you informed of that decision's consequences.

<p>

You may have caught a glimpse of the powerful day 
of prayer in your newspaper or on your local newscast, but 
we have much more to show you as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

[Segments from Prayer for Life at the Capitol, held September 
12, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. HELEN ALVARES: We come here today to pray at 
the place where life-and-death decisions are being made by 
lawmakers, decisions which affect the very most defenseless 
among us, the unborn.  We will pray for members of Congress, 
for mothers and fathers tempted to abortion, for all 
children -- born, unborn, nearly born -- for many others who 
are threatened in some way.

<p>

As you know, within a few weeks, the House and the 
Senate will vote on the override of the Presidential veto of 
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.  We therefore pray for 
members of Congress to act on their obligation to defend 
life and to reject the cruel destruction of infants only 
seconds away from taking their first breath.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL JAMES HICKEY: Brothers and sisters, you 
and I stand at the edge of a new century and a new 
millennium.  Either it will be an era of life or an era of 
death.  Either we will protect life or destroy it.  With all 
our hearts, with all that is within us, we pray this day and 
every day that our nation will choose to protect life, the 
life of the unborn child in the womb, the life of the child 
as he or she is being born, also the life of the frail 
elderly and the terminally ill.

<p>

We ask Almighty God to give us the wisdom to 
reject the culture of death and, instead, to embrace the 
culture of life.  We come here not as political leaders nor 
as lobbyists, but we come as men and women of different 
faiths who are united in prayer and united in a common 
cause, and our cause is life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL WILLIAM KEELER: Here today are those 
from other churches who support the culture of life.  
Together, we are bound by our support of life and by our 
opposition to partial-birth abortion.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

PASTOR GEORGE ANDERSON: Indeed, men and women of 
faith -- Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, Muslim 
people -- are one, are allies, as we stand in defense of 
children and the family.  We stand united against this 
hideous and inhuman abortion procedure.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL BERNARD LAW: We gather on the steps of 
our Nation's Capitol to pray.  Mindful of our obligation to 
the littlest, the weakest, and the most forgotten, we pray. 
Hopeful that those who work in this place will know the 
right and do it, we pray.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL JOSEPH BERNADIN: If you obey the 
commandments of the Lord your God, which I command on you 
this day, by loving the Lord your God, by walking in His 
ways, and by keeping His commandments and His statutes and 
His ordinances, then you shall live.  Therefore, choose 
life, that you and your descendants may live, loving the 
Lord your God, obeying His voice, and cleaving to Him, for 
that means life to you and length of days.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

REV. JEFFREY BROWN: If a man has 100 sheep and 
one of them goes astray, will he not leave the 99 in the 
hills and go in search of the stray?  And if he finds it, 
amen, I say to you, he rejoices more over it than over the 
99 that did not stray.  In just the same way, it is not the 
will of your heavenly Father that one of these little ones 
be lost.

<p>

[Conclusion of segments from Prayer for Life at the Capitol.]

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The sinking test scores of U.S. 
students over the course of the past few years have forced 
parents, teachers, and politicians alike to face a crisis 
which permeates our schools today.  Despite many attempts to 
fix our education system, the harsh reality remains:  poor 
student performance has many underlying causes and no easy 
solutions.

<p>

In 1994 Congress made its own attempt to improve 
student performance by passing legislation called Goals 
2000.  The bill set in place national curriculum standards. 
Controversial from its outset, Goals 2000 added to the 
power of the Department of Education by allowing the Federal 
Government to interfere with school curriculum.  Previously, 
such involvement was prohibited, and without this important 
restriction, parents have almost no voice against decisions 
made by Washington bureaucrats.

<p>

Like most things that come out of Washington, 
Goals 2000 also has a power game attached.  In exchange for 
federal money, school districts must conform to national 
attitudinal and behavioral standards.  These take away the 
emphasis on learning and place it on socialization.  In 
essence, Goals 2000 standards allow conflict resolution 
training and comprehensive sex education to overshadow 
instruction in basic skills like grammar and math, even at 
the elementary school level.

<p>

Goals 2000 proponents claim the program gives 
local parents and teachers important decision-making 
authority.  In fact, the only choice Goals 2000 leaves at 
the local level is whether or not to participate.  Several 
states, including Virginia, New Hampshire, Montana, and 
Alabama, rejected the Goals 2000 money, giving up access to 
the federal tax dollars in exchange for local control of 
schools.  But, whether or not a state participates in Goals 
2000, every taxpayer foots the bill.  And the battle over 
who defines good education rages on.

<p>

The controversy over Goals 2000 brought a recent 
flurry of activity on Capitol Hill.  To clear up confusion 
about some recent governmental decisions regarding Goals 
2000, I am joined by Congressman Lindsey Graham, who just 
this morning introduced a bill that would stop federal 
funding of Goals 2000.

<p>

We are also joined by Jennifer A. Marshall, FRC's 
education policy analyst.  Jennifer keeps families, 
educators, and legislators informed on all the hot education 
issues.

<p>

Welcome, both of you, to the show.

<p>

You know, Congressman, when I came to Washington 
in the 1980s -- I have actually been here now almost 10 
years -- we were going to get rid of the Department of 
Education.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: We're still talking about it, aren't we?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we're still talking about that.
And then Goals 2000 came up, and so we were just going to 
fix the Department of Education.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But why do you want to get rid of 
Goals 2000 and defund it?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, let's talk about 
what we are trying to do with this legislation.  Goals 2000 
was an idea that came out of the Bush Administration about 
having national standards to compete in a global economy.  
That sounds really good on paper, that we are going to have 
school districts pushing at the 21st century so our kids can 
compete with the Japanese and the Germans.

<p>

The problem is, when you start taking national 
standards and implementing them, the agenda of the 
bureaucracy gets put in place.  And, to be honest with you, 
the NEA owns the Democratic education agenda; they own the 
Department of Education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The National Education Association.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The teachers' unions.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: The teachers' unions, okay.

<p>

They are a very liberal group.  To deny that is to 
deny the obvious.  It is not a crime to be liberal; I just 
disagree.  If the conservatives take over the White House, 
which we will one day, I really don't believe it is good for 
America to have a conservative agenda coming out of the 
federal Department of Education.  I think these decisions 
need to be made at home.

<p>

So what we are doing is taking the $350 million 
that is allocated for Goals 2000 that would be run through 
the Department of Education and come home in dribbles; we 
are just going to bypass the Department of Education and the 
Federal Government and write the check to the states, who 
will in turn give it to the local school districts, and we 
are going to get the money home as quickly as possible.

<p>

There is a dynamic that has existed for a long 
time.  Six percent of the education funding in America comes 
from Washington.  Fifty percent of the mandates come out of 
Washington, D.C.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So for six pennies on the dollar, 
they are calling all the shots.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, in politics, the 
power is really the power of the purse.  If I can control 
your agenda by telling you what to do through legislation 
and mandates, I own you politically.  If I can tell a county 
council and a city council what they must do to comply with 
federal law, then I have taken a lot of their resources and 
directed how they spend it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: I don't give them the 
money, but I tell them what to do.  The same way in 
education.  If I can control the mandate part of education, 
how you teach, then I own your curriculum, I own you 
politically.  And I don't want to own anybody.  What I want 
to do is free up the parents, the teachers, and the local 
school officials and give them a shot at getting this money 
quickly and let them build a bridge to the 21st century that 
will be built on solid ground.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jennifer, are there any horror 
stories to come out of what we have seen of Goals 2000 so 
far, or are we just seeing people being asked to be sure 
that fifth graders can do algebra?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, it is certainly not the 
latter, and in fact, with the push for more and more social 
services to be offered in schools, we are seeing tragic 
cases like the one in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, 
where 60 young girls, adolescent girls, were told to strip 
down to their underwear, wait -- scared little girls; some 
were prevented from calling their mothers -- and they then 
proceeded to have genital exams.  That is just horrific, and 
there was no parental warning there.

<p>

This is the kind of thing that happens when 
schools think they play a bigger role in kids' health than 
the parents do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, I am sure you have 
heard this argument as many times as I have:  Well, the 
reason why we need federal standards is not for the good 
parents that would take their children to the doctor but all 
of those terrible parents out there that wouldn't.  Will 
Goals 2000 get at the liberal straw man of the terrible 
parents abandoning their kids?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: I think what we need to do 
in Washington is get behind labels.  Drug-free schools.  
That's a label that sounds great.  Goals 2000.  It sounds 
like a good program to move the country forward.  Let's look 
at education results over the last 30 years and see if it is 
rational to continue to turn to the Federal Government.

<p>

Since 1965, test scores in this country have 
plummeted.  They have gone literally downhill at a dramatic 
rate, all-time lows.  Dropout rates are up.  Schools are not 
safe to go to anymore.  And what we have realized is that 
every time we increase the power of the Federal Government, 
the best we do is become stagnant.

<p>

So the evidence is in pretty clearly that for the 
last 16 or 17 years, turning to an exclusive federal remedy 
is not working.  We are not improving test scores.  We are 
not enhancing learning.  We are not getting parents more 
involved; they are less involved.

<p>

So let's do something different.  Let's take the 
money that would be spent through federal bureaucracies with 
a federal stamp of approval and free up the resources at the 
local level, give people more money, and let parents and 
teachers and local school officials sit down and design a 
curriculum that they feel good about, that the good parents 
feel good about, and that really addresses the bad parents 
in a local community, because all bad parents are not alike.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, it is interesting.
Education Secretary Riley had this huge news conference 
about six months ago about how we know that if parents are 
involved, children do better, and in fact, the data was 
interesting that even if you had shown up at a PTA meeting, 
your children then were more likely to do well; that parents 
who were involved had children who did better.

<p>

And then we move all the curriculum decisions to 
Washington, D.C.  I mean, what have you seen, Jennifer, in 
terms of involved parents equalling better educated 
children?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, there are mounds and mounds 
of research that say parents are the single most important 
factor in their kids' educational achievement.  It has been 
proven by home schoolers, it has been proven by Christian 
schoolers, public schoolers.  Any environment, parents are 
the key factor.

<p>

So that just calls more and more for the decisions 
being made locally, by parents who care.  You know, the 
Washington bureaucrats -- Secretary Riley, Bill Clinton -- 
don't care more about our kids than we do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, I think one thing that 
is interesting in some of the debate is the discussion of 
the fact that Bill Clinton and Al Gore have their children 
in private, faith-based schools, as do the majority of the 
Washington elite.  And then you have Goals 2000, on the 
other hand, dictating what your children will learn, even 
though I wouldn't put my child in that school.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right. Well, let's agree 
on something.  Secretary Riley is from South Carolina; I am 
from South Carolina.  I know he cares about the kids in this 
country.  I am sure President Clinton does.  He cares about 
his daughter, and as a parent, he made a good decision.  He 
tried to put his daughter in the best educational 
environment he could find for her so she would be safe and 
she would learn.  He did what every parent in America should 
do.

<p>

What I am saying is, let's give the parents of 
America some of the resources that would filter through our 
bureaucracy; give it to them directly in conjunction with 
our local school officials and see if they can create an 
environment where they can send their kid to a public school 
or maybe a private school that they feel better about.

<p>

This idea that you can only have compassion if you 
spend money in Washington and you can only trust quality 
coming out of Washington is a dismal failure.  Just look at 
the evidence.  I don't have any children, but I am a 
taxpayer, and one day I hope to have a family.  But I can 
tell you from a taxpayer's point of view, we are spending 
$120 billion cycling through federal bureaucracies, not just 
the Department of Education -- it is only $32 billion -- so 
there is $120 billion being spent through Washington, D.C., 
bureaucracies, and the children and the teachers are getting 
about 26 cents of the dollar.  If you designed a business 
this way, you would go broke in a week.

<p>

So we are trying to get a new formula, what she 
just said.  You don't have to be a rocket scientist or a 
Ph.D. to figure out that the best way to have a quality 
school is have moms and dads showing up at PTA meetings, 
having kids go, with teachers who have the power to teach 
and are not micromanaged from afar.  This is simple, basic 
stuff that served our country well for 180 years.  Only 
since the Great Society have we seen a bottoming out of 
education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's interesting, isn't it?  I mean, 
I saw a chart just the other day -- I think it was from the 
Heritage Foundation, another conservative organization -- 
that was saying that they looked at the beginning of the 
Department of Education and tracked test scores with its 
inception and growth, and it was one of those things; it was 
almost an anti-chart, you know, a mirror image of, as the 
federal role has increased, the educational system has done 
much poorer.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, the dropout rates 
are at an all-time high.  The test scores, SAT quantitative 
test scores, have gone down a tremendous amount.  In 1965 
they were about 950.  They have really dropped, and they are 
just stagnant now.

<p>

All the money we spend in Washington and all the 
bureaucracies we have created in Washington have, at best, 
kept us stagnant.  I am looking for a different way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, has anything good come 
out of Goals 2000?  I mean, you were there to defund it 
today. Is there any good news with that bad news pill?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, everybody says it is 
a voluntary program and it has done a lot but we can't get 
-- well, if it is voluntary, why not just -- you know, 
what's the big deal about getting rid of it?  If there is no 
federal control, why is everybody so dead-set in the NEA and 
other liberals of hanging onto it?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what do they say to that?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, they just said,
Well, there is no micromanaging.  Well, why not just get rid 
of it?  There is.  Obviously, there is.  That is why they 
are fighting for it.

<p>

Their agenda can never survive at the local level.
You would never have homosexual awareness week in most 
school districts.  The only way you are going to have it is 
to have a power base in Washington, D.C., that mandates 
curriculum that goes the liberal way.  You cannot win these 
wars at the local level.  So if they can consolidate money 
and power in Washington, then they can control the 
curriculum, but only then.

<p>

So what we are trying to do is destroy a breeding 
ground that is going to lead to more federal intervention, 
is going to lead to more NEA-type doctrine, because this is 
surely the first step along a long road of more federal 
involvement.

<p>

Let's nip it in the bud now.  Let's take the money 
back home, send it directly with no carrying charges, and 
see in a few years from now if we have a better school 
system.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We know, Congressman, that you have 
to get back to the Hill.  It's a busy week.  Before you go, 
we have been talking a lot about partial-birth abortion, as 
I am sure you are aware of.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We appreciate your taking this quick 
moment out.  Any word as people are looking -- they are 
saying it might come up tomorrow, might come up next week.
How does that look, Congressman?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE GRAHAM: Well, it's a fluid 
situation right now.  Please get on the phones, write 
letters.  Don't send them to my office.  We are going to 
vote to override the veto.  Get involved.  I think this is 
one that we have a shot at winning.  The Catholic Church has 
gotten behind the issue.  There is a real faith-based 
coalition growing out there.

<p>

Pro-choice people voted against this procedure 
because it is so ghastly.  If you look at the facts, if you 
look at exactly what we do to children under this procedure, 
it is a blight on America.  And if we cannot come together 
and stop this, I am really very disappointed in my 
government right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Congressman, for being 
with us. Jennifer, we will see more of you in a moment.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will bring you more 
about America's education standards, and we will introduce 
you to a man who is helping give parents some new choices.  
Please stay with us.

<p>

[Segments from Washington Scholarship Fund FUNDay, 
held September 15, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MR. RANDALL BYRNES (Co-Chairman): We feel at the 
Washington Scholarship Fund, when we start these children in 
the programs, their age is kindergarten, they start in 
kindergarten and they go all the way up through the eighth 
grade, and at ages 5 through 14, those are the most 
formative ages in their lives, and we feel as though it is 
important that they get the kind of quality education and 
the nurturing that, unfortunately, they are not getting in 
the public school system.

<p>

So by virtue of having them go to whatever private 
school they deem desirable -- most of them are schools in 
their neighborhoods, Catholic schools and other independent 
schools -- then they can get a good start in life and 
receive the kind of attention and care and discipline and 
value system, as well as the education, that will put them 
in good stead for life.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. ROBERT THOMPSON (Co-Chairman): When we 
started it two and a half or three years ago, the Washington 
Times ran a full-page ad gratis for a couple of days.  Since 
that time, it has been all word of mouth.  We have 225 
children on scholarship, but we have 600 on the waiting 
list.

<p>

What Randy and I consider our main role is to 
figure out a way to raise enough money to take those 600 
kids off the waiting list.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. GEORGE JOCHUM (Board Member): Well, we first 
heard about the Washington Scholarship Fund through a 
friend, and we really liked the concept that you help young 
people get a better education.  What is extraordinary about 
this is it is just not a gift.  The parents, who are less 
affluent than most, have to pay half.  So you feel like you 
are truly making a contribution, not only for the children 
but also for the parents.  The parents are making great 
sacrifices.

<p>

MS. CRIS JOCHUM: And we certainly understand how 
important education is and also understand how important it 
is that the parents are committed to education.  And that is 
what is so great about this program, because the parents are 
as involved as the children are or they couldn't be in the 
program.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. LYNDON BILAL (Recipient Parent): I got the 
<i>Washington Times</i> newspaper on a Saturday evening and went in 
to work, and my concern was how am I going to be able to 
send these children to a school that I would like to send 
them to, which for me it's an Islamic school.  And so I was 
blessed to see that article in the <i>Washington Times</i>, and 
then I immediately filled it out and faxed it in that night.
I have three children that are being sponsored by 
Washington Scholarship Fund, and I have four children in the 
school, but only three of them are being sponsored, but that 
is a tremendous help.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: I found out about the program 
through my aunt at one of the libraries up in Georgetown, 
and I called and applied for the scholarship fund and 
waited, and I got the scholarship.  I have one child.  She 
is 5.  I want her to have a good foundation to start, and I 
think it's the best considering the public school situation 
that is around us.  And she is doing an excellent job, and I 
really, really want to thank the scholarship fund.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: Well, I wanted them to get a 
better education through Saint Augustine.

<p>

RECIPIENT PARENT: It's a little more disciplined 
attitudes, all of that,  It's different, the learning -- I 
don't know, it's more or less like they want to learn.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. THOMPSON: This is my way of trying to give 
something back to the community, and I believe it is the 
best return on a charitable dollar because we are giving 
these young kids an opportunity to get a very good education 
as well as the values that go with that.

<p>

[Conclusion of segments.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you just witnessed, the 
Washington Scholarship Fund is impacting the lives of 
parents and their children's education.

<p>

With us today is Doug Dewey, the founding 
president of the National Scholarship Center and the 
executive director of the Washington Scholarship Fund.  Also 
with us again is Jennifer A. Marshall, FRC's education 
policy analyst, who brings us education innovators such as 
Doug.

<p>

Welcome very much.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, your program is very unique, 
and we are going to hear a lot about it in these next couple 
of minutes.  But one of the key functions of it is to get 
parents involved in their children's education.  Why is 
that?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, as Jennifer said, the evidence 
is just overwhelming that that is the number one indicator 
of success for schooling, and that is no different for low-
income, underprivileged children in inner cities.

<p>

What our program does, it is kind of a tough-love 
scholarship program.  We provide half of the tuition for any 
non-government school that a family wishes to send their 
children to, up to a maximum of $1,500 a year, and the 
parents are responsible to pay the rest.

<p>

You have to understand that the average annual 
income of the parents in our program is $14,000.  So they 
are making an incommensurate sacrifice on behalf of their 
children.  We send the checks to the schools from September 
to June, and they are written out to the mother and to the 
school.  They have to be endorsed by the mother.  That keeps 
them involved, knowing that they have to pay -- some of them 
pay on a weekly basis and, we have even heard, in rolls of 
quarters.  Some of them pay on a monthly basis.  But all of 
them are owners of their education, and they take great 
pride in that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you have found it's not an 
income-level outcome, but it is an involvement outcome that 
has made a difference?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, definitely. As I say, our average 
income is very low.  But I think if I had to point to a 
single difference of why these people are doing so well -- 
in the private schools in the inner city, regardless of 
whether they are Catholic or Christian or non-denominational 
or non-sectarian, they all have about a 95 to 99 percent 
graduate rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. Compare that for us, 
Jennifer, quickly, with schools at large.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I think we are talking about 70s.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So 70 percent national average.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: And about 40 percent in the District 
of Columbia.  And not only that, the children go on to 
college at a rate of about 85 percent, and they complete 
college.

<p>

So they are the children from the same 
neighborhoods, from the same demographic facts, that you 
would look at them and all of those expectations that they 
would not succeed, and yet they do.

<p>

So again, if I had to point to one thing, apart 
from all of the faith and the discipline and the things that 
people talk about that exist in private schools, I think it 
is that ownership of education which comes with paying your 
own tuition.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, then, in a way, you must be 
excited about a recent headline out of New York City where 
the Catholic Church has offered to take the 1,000 children 
at the very lowest end of ability in the schools and put 
them into private school.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, indeed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you see that as an answer?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: I do. No one knows yet how the 
program there will be structured, but I think it is a 
courageous offer from Cardinal O'Connor to take the bottom, 
I guess they said 5 percent, but we won't know how they are 
going to structure it.  I would hope, and I would advise if 
I were asked, that they include a parental match component 
in their program.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To get people involved.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That is right, so that all those 
children, their families are paying something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to be coming back in a 
moment, Doug, but if you could tell us, are you concerned -- 
and we can talk more -- that as vouchers develop -- and 
there are experiments in Cleveland and around the country -- 
that that is going to mean federal control of the private 
schools that are doing well by the kids you are talking 
about?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, a lot of people have that 
concern; there's just no doubt about it.  Attempts to pass 
vouchers in different jurisdictions around the country have 
been going on for about 15 years now, and with each 
successive version, in order to try to secure passage and 
enactment, we find more and more compromises.  I think this 
is putting more and more conservatives and Christians and 
home schoolers and others on the alert.

<p>

One of the advantages of privately funded vouchers --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which you have.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That's right -- is that they sidestep 
this whole controversy because they don't use government 
funds.  And so, of course, they carry none of the risks.  If 
I wanted to regulate the schools in my program, I have no 
power to do so.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about that in just a moment. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we 
will continue our discussion on education and how parents 
can make the most of available resources.  Please stay with 
us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are discussing some 
alternative solutions to the decline of education standards.
I am joined by Doug Dewey, president of the National 
Scholarship Center and executive director of the Washington 
Scholarship Fund.  Also joining us is Jennifer A. Marshall, 
FRC's education policy analyst.  Welcome back, both of you.

<p>

You know, Jennifer, there is a lot of frustration 
on the part of parents with the role of government, and you 
see a program like this, in a way, doing an end run.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Oh, yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think about that?  We're 
cutting out the middle man.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, it's wonderful.  You know, we 
get so many questions about what would happen if we 
decreased the federal role in education.  What if we got rid 
of it?  It would be disaster for education.  Well, no, it 
wouldn't.  Things like this would happen.  Things like this 
are happening now.  And they are recapturing education.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: These are success stories, Doug, and 
we are excited to present your story.  How did you guys get 
started?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: I was working, I must confess, for 
Lamar Alexander, helping craft America 2000 -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now Goals 2000.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: -- which became Goals 2000, renamed 
and made worse, to be sure, when I came across a program 
started by a chairman of the Golden Rule Insurance Company, 
Patrick Rooney(?), who is in Indianapolis, Indiana.  He had 
made an attempt to get some vouchers for children in 
Indianapolis from the legislature there, failed, and 
somewhat on the rebound of that, decided, well, he will put 
his own money where his mouth is, and he earmarked 
$1.2 million in 1991, announced it in the radio and the 
newspapers in August, and had 1,000 kids in school that 
September.  Now he is entering his sixth year.

<p>

So I wrote about that while I was at the 
department, got very excited.  You may recall the results of 
the 1992 election.  Well, I was a Bush White House 
appointee, so I needed something to do, even if it wasn't 
gainful employment, and we needed this kind of opportunity 
for children in Washington, D.C.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And how long has this program been operating?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: We are going into our third year now. 
We started with 30 children in 1993 and went up to 100 and 
150.  Now we are at 225 children, and we have 600 children 
on the waiting list.

<p>

Our average grant, what we get for the money, is 
$1,000 for each child, and that sends a child to a private 
school for an entire year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know what is amazing about that 
is the District of Columbia's cost per child in education is 
the highest in the nation.  I think it is what, $9,000,
Jennifer?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The highest amount of money, $9,000, 
with violence and the drug problem and the dropout rate.  
And for $1,000, one-ninth of the cost, you are going to put 
a child in a safe and effective educational environment.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doesn't money make the difference?  
If we spent more on education, aren't we going to get more?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, I know of one economist in 
California who has done a study which actually shows an 
inverse relationship between spending and achievement.  But 
I do know that for a little bit of money, you can get a lot 
of impact from these programs.

<p.

After Pat Rooney started his program in 1991, we 
had copycat programs in Milwaukee, San Antonio, Atlanta, and 
now they have spread.  By 1996, right now, we have 28 
programs in 27 jurisdictions around the country, with about 
10,000 low-income children all going to private schools of 
their choosing -- Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Catholic, every 
variety -- and I think that is very exciting and very 
promising.

<p>

And for those who don't like publicly funded 
vouchers, either for conservative reasons or for liberal 
reasons, as it were, this is a great alternative.  This is 
something everybody can be involved in.  On our board we 
have Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and William Bennett as 
our two honorary co-chairmen.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Two different political ends.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Absolutely. And we can all agree, 
low-income parents who want this opportunity for their 
children, it is an appropriate thing for the private sector 
to step in and give them a shot at that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Jennifer, what has been the impact 
as programs like this have sprung up nationwide?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, they are the perfect example 
of what can be done and what is done by parents, by 
concerned neighborhood members, who want kids to have good 
education.

<p>

I think this is such a good example, and it is 
great to bring up in our legislative battles here, because 
there is such a mind-set in this beltway that problems can 
only be solved here, and if we don't do it here, those poor 
kids will just not get an education.  It is simply not true. 
There are parents, there are community members who care 
dearly about this and will provide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the District of Columbia 
is a great case study.  Even recently in the political 
realm, I have heard some criticism from one political camp 
to another, you know, if liberalism was so great, why wasn't 
the District doing better?  And it's very sad the way the 
District is often the bad example, and it is unfortunate.

<p>

How are the children doing, though, in your 
program?  How are they faring individually?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, they are doing remarkably well. 
We have about an 85 percent retaining rate, or I guess a 15 
percent attrition rate.  Five percent of that are just 
people that have moved to Prince George's County or another 
county outside of Washington.  We only serve Washington 
children for now.  So I think they are doing extraordinarily 
well.

<p>

We had one child at Saint Augustine School who was 
new to private school, and they were able to get a grant 
from us, and she became valedictorian and is going to attend 
one of the premier Catholic prep schools next year, or this 
year she is just starting.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Wow! That's great.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: We have another boy that we know who 
just got academic prize of the year, and he was also 
formerly in a government school.  So we know that we've got 
not only some superstars but just the fact that they are 
staying in there, that they are having to make an enormous 
discipline adjustment from really very little requirement of 
being disciplined in the government schools to having to sit 
still, not speak out, never fight.  There is a pretty 
dramatic difference between these schools.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How are the children in the 
neighborhood and the families in the neighborhood responding 
as some of these children leave, going to different schools, 
and certainly having a different academic experience?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Oh, that is an outstanding question, 
because I think -- and, again, I don't have a RAND study 
behind me on this so I can only say anecdotally -- I know 
that this program comes home with the child and has an 
effect in the neighborhood.  Mothers will call me and say 
how proud they are that their boy comes home in a uniform.
They tell their friends that they are paying for their 
children's education now; their boy is in private school, or 
their girl.  And then I get neighbors calling me saying, "I 
spoke to my neighbor who is doing this.  I want this for my 
child, too."

<p>

So this is real self-esteem, not the bogus 
injected kind that we sometimes hear about.  And so I think 
it has a great spillover effect to get people charged.

<p>

The other thing it is doing occasionally is it is 
bringing families that are broken apart back together.  
Grandmothers help out, sisters, and estranged fathers come 
back to help pay that tuition.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to hear more 
about private responses to public education.  More about 
your family's options when it comes to education and a 
special report from the Family Research Council.  Please 
stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are talking to some 
movers and shakers in the world of education.  With us are 
Doug Dewey and Jennifer A. Marshall.

<p>

Jennifer, you wrote about Doug's outstanding 
scholarship program in a really special report, the <i>Moms and
Dads' School Survival Guide</i>. We at the Family Research 
Council have been concerned about education for quite a 
while.  People may remember that Gary Bauer was Under 
Secretary of Education with Bill Bennett, one of your board 
members.

<p>

Jennifer, why did you write this publication?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Well, we hear maybe more than any 
other issue from parents and families about education, and 
we hope that this booklet will be just about everything you 
need to know about schooling and education and the concerns 
you should have.

<p>

One of the things you should know is that you have 
some options, and so we have included the listing of the 
private scholarship programs across the country.  You will 
find it in there, so if anybody is interested across the 
country, they can look to that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If you would like to hear more about 
Doug's program or programs available in your area, you are 
going to want to get one of these.  And, Jennifer, thanks 
for putting it together.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: Sure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of problems are people 
faced with in the education system that this might be of 
assistance to them?

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I would say the biggest problem -- 
just an overarching summary of it -- is that schools are 
moving more and more into the realms that families have 
filled for years and that are rightfully the role of 
families.  So we have a section in there on parental rights. 
We also have a discussion of current education trends, like 
outcome-based education and Goals 2000, easily 
understandable articles so that parents can be conversant in 
these issues, fight them in their schools.

<p>

We also have a section on education jargon that 
defines these terms that are just batted back and forth 
between education bureaucrats.

<p>

We have another section that describes students' 
religious freedoms in the public schools.  That is an 
important and very misunderstood area.  Many students could 
be exercising much more religious expression and religious 
freedom than they already are.

<p>

So we want students and families to know that and 
then to know about the options that they have if the public 
schools just aren't working for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Doug, as you are working 
with people often in the inner city, one of the things that 
we hear anecdotally, and I wonder if you agree, is that 
people are just intimidated to talk to school educators, 
sort of the tyranny of complexity.  How do I talk, what do I 
say? Will anybody even listen to me?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Yes. I would even go further and 
compare it to a kind of almost religious-type loyalty that a 
lot of parents that I deal with feel they should have for 
their public schools, their government schools, that they 
are not pleased with, clearly.  They are not happy.  They 
don't like their child failing and getting beaten up, and 
sometimes they want to tell me, "Well, the school's okay and 
all" -- they don't want to really confess how bad they 
really think the school is -- "but I just want to have more 
challenge or more foreign languages."  And, clearly, that is 
not at the forefront of their concern as I talk to them 
more.  So I do detect this from the parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We get a lot of calls, Jennifer, at 
Family Research Council.  What are sort of the top two, 
three, four calls that you get about education that we have 
really tried hard to work with here?

<p>

MR. MARSHALL: A lot of people are concerned about 
the content of their kids' curriculum, and this goes in all 
different directions, but sometimes it is just morbid, 
violent, horrible, dark stories that they are reading in 
literature; or in math they are simply not learning their 
times tables; or in reading they are in third grade and they 
don't know how to read yet because they are simply bypassing 
the simple method of phonics.

<p>

So many problems like that, then also problems 
where the school is simply not recognizing parents' rightful 
role in their children's lives and shutting them out of the 
educational process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When people have come to you, Doug, 
saying, "I want to get my children out of public school, 
government-run schools, to private schools," what are the 
reasons they give you?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, they give the whole gamut, from 
academics to discipline to wanting values taught to their 
children.  Most of the schools that we have are Catholic 
participating in our program because those are the most 
plentiful in the cities, but only a small minority of the 
families that are going to those Catholic schools are 
Catholic themselves.  So they want something that is usually 
Christian, but they want values, they want character.  They 
think that is important.

<p>

And they also want a greater responsiveness from 
the school, which they do not tend to get, I think, and that 
is probably the most common thing.  They say that I just 
can't make a difference.  There is nothing I can do.  I try. 
That's a word I hear all the time, that expression.  I 
tried but nothing happened, so I now feel I have to have 
this other option.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, as a person that helped work on 
Goals 2000 -- and we are not going to hold that against you 
too much --

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That was supposed to bring values 
into the classroom.  We are going to have the goal of 
values.  Why hasn't that worked?  Jennifer?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Maybe Jennifer should answer that.

<p>

MS. MARSHALL: I say simply that they are building 
bricks without straw.  There is not a solid basis, a 
consensus, about what these values even are.  Those are the 
solid virtues that should be taught in the home and clearly 
agreed upon among family members.

<p>

The public school, in trying to be accommodating 
to all different views, simply cannot even come up with the 
values that they want to teach, so they are not going to be 
successful in teaching them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, we have about a minute left, 
and I wanted to give you the last word.  As you look at the 
lives of the children in your program, why do you think this 
kind of endeavor is the way to go?

<p>

MR. DEWEY: Well, I think just hearing what 
Jennifer was saying about having the values being taught at 
home, and when people do send their child to a school, they 
want to have that school agreeing with their most basic 
values.  Whether they be Catholics or Muslims or whatever it 
is, they don't want to be in a kind of tug-of-war for the 
minds and hearts of their children.

<p>

What this program allows is for those parents who 
want something for their children, who have at least one 
person in their life that is crazy about them and is willing 
to sacrifice for them, this gives them a chance.  It's a ray 
of hope for the whole nation when we see 10,000 very low-
income children in very disadvantaged circumstances who are 
taking charge of their education in its entirety -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And going forward.

<p>

MR. DEWEY: That's right, and succeeding.  And I 
think that is a bright hope and a good sign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks so much for being with us, 
both of you.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll bring you 
more information regarding issues affecting you and your 
family.  Hope you'll write us, and stay with us.

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of 
popcorn.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Or if that strikes you as sensible, turn to Section 551 of the Freedom 
to Farm Act.  It creates the "National Kiwifruit Research, Promotion, 
and Consumer Information Act." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

</i>  <h2>  Unfunded Mandates:<br>
 Congress Is Targeting Business Instead of Governments 
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has made it illegal for the federal government to impose 
unfunded mandates - requirements to take certain actions or provide 
certain services without providing the federal funds to pay for those 
mandates - on state and local governments.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfunded mandates have been a real burden in the past, forcing state 
and local governments to spend millions and even billions of dollars 
while members of Congress took the political credit for good deeds.  
For example, Columbus, Ohio, complained in 1991 that Congress was 
forcing it to spend $62 million to fulfill environmental mandates.  
The National Association of Towns and Townships estimated that 
unfunded federal mandates cost local taxpayers about $6.5 billion in 
fiscal year 1993.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The new Republican Congress with great fanfare put a stop to it.  Or 
so it claimed.  But the fact is that Congress hasn't really repented 
of its past sins, it has just changed its focus - from local 
governments to private businesses.  Congress' new mandate addiction 
can best be seen with regard to the issue of health care reform.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; People without health insurance sometimes develop a medical condition 
and then have difficulty finding an insurer to provide health 
coverage.  Although this is a relatively small problem for the U.S. 
health care system - surveys show that less than 1 percent of the 
population has been denied health insurance because of an preexisting 
medical condition - it is nevertheless real.  And its solution - 
Congressional mandates to help the poor and the ill - has irresistible 
political appeal.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; But Congress does not have the money to solve the problem of the 
uninsurable, and under its new rule against unfunded mandates, it 
cannot tell the states to handle it.   So it has decided, through the 
Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Reform Act,  to tell health 
insurance companies - primarily those that write health insurance 
policies for individuals - that they must accept and pay the costs of 
medical care for the uninsurable.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; While everyone agrees this bill will increase the cost of health 
insurance - the difference of opinion is only how much - Congress is 
not required to provide the funds to businesses.  It just tells health 
insurers what to do, takes the credit for solving the problem of the 
uninsurable, and passes the costs of the unfunded mandate on to 
business, and ultimately consumers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A second example concerns mental health.  Health insurance companies 
often treat mental health problems differently than they do physical 
health care problems, primarily because mental health science is much 
more complex and less understood than physical health science, and 
mental health illnesses less specific.  It can also be much more 
difficult to tell when a patient is "cured" of a mental health problem 
than of a physical ailment.  A broken limb can be seen to mend.  
Mental uneasiness has no obvious limits and can linger indefinitely.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a result, insurers have been reluctant to give mental health care 
the blank check it has provided for traditional health care and 
insurance coverage for mental health services is much more limited.  
Some in Congress would like to solve that problem by telling insurers 
that their policies must cover mental health care needs to the same 
extent their  policies  cover other medical conditions. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Once again, Congress praises itself for its compassion and passes the 
unfunded mandate - the costs along with the economic chaos  - on to 
private-sector businesses.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Unfortunately, health insurance isn't the only place Congress is 
considering imposing unfunded mandates on business.  Consider the 
recent struggle over increasing the minimum wage.  Congress wants to 
raise the cost of labor to both state and local governments and 
private employers, requiring them to pay the cost.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; This is a perfect example of members of Congress appealing to the 
American public, explaining how concerned and compassionate they are 
about the plight of the low-income employee, and how Congress is going 
to solve the problem by raising their wages.  What they don't make so 
clear is that they intend to require business to pay for their 
compassion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Worse, the 23 Republican Congressmen pressing the Republican 
leadership to increase the minimum wage all voted for the unfunded 
mandates prohibition.  Most of them even voted against an amendment 
exempting the minimum wage from the unfunded mandate prohibition.  So 
much for candor in government. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Perhaps what we need is a Contract With America II, with a provision 
that would protect private companies from unfunded mandates the way 
the first Contract protected state and local governments.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Simply put, if Congress isn't willing to pay for something, it ought 
not require someone else to buy it.

<h2>
Eastern Europe and the Western Alliance
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil," Edmund Burke 
observed, "is for good men to do nothing."  While what has happened in 
Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 is hardly evil - 
communism was the evil - the fact is that good men have done very 
little to nourish the seeds of Western values in the freed nations of 
Eastern Europe.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
At a recent gathering of several hundred pro-democracy ministers and 
MPs from western and central European nations in Prague, Czech 
Republic President Vaclev Havel put it more bluntly:  "Six years have 
passed since the fall of the Iron Curtain.  It seems to me that little 
has happened during those six years and time is working against the 
Democrats.  Against those who want peace and peaceful cooperation.  
Unless Democrats proceed with greater vigor to build the European 
order, others will start to do so and we know who the 'others' 
are....The story of the former Yugoslavia should be a clear warning 
for  Europe and for the whole wor as to what can happen if there is 
too much hesitation."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The Congress of Prague, as the meeting was called, stressed the 
urgency of bringing Eastern European nations into the western 
alliance.  Its mission was "to reunite the family of western 
civilization, and so to ensure its future."  Lest this seem too 
pessimistic, consider that for 50 years, from 1939 to 1989, Central 
Europe was the battleground of our century's epic battle of freedom 
against tyranny.  With the flush of the victory of the west over 
communism, all seemed possible, and the integration of Russia's former 
satellites into the European community and its commerce seemed 
probable.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But it has not come to pass.  Instead, "Market reforms in the former 
communist countries are being slowed down or reversed.  Post-
communists now govern in all the former satellites except the  Czech 
Republic.  A former communist has replaced Lech Walesa as president of 
Poland.  The communists won 45 percent of the Russian Duma in the 
recent elections.  And Central Europe has seen its membership of both 
NATO and the EU postponed."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So what to do?  First, the economic base of western Europe must be 
expanded eastward.  The current strategy of European Union (EU) 
advocates - principally the French and Germans - is flawed.  A single, 
common-currency, Brussels-regulated European monolith, hard to join 
and with limited economic growth potential once admitted (the EU 
annual growth targets are the same anemic 2.5% as the U.S. Federal 
Reserve's), offers less hope for the future than a tariff-free trading 
group with harmonized procedures.  All the former European Soviet 
satellites should quickly become a part of such a group.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Second, NATO must be expanded eastward as well.  The Czech Republic 
and Hungary should be admitted now; Poland and the Baltic nations 
should follow.  The Russians, of course, are opposed, and have been 
saber-rattling against it ("Moscow plans pact with Belorussia if NATO 
expands" - May 15, 1996).  But as the London Times editorialized on 
May 14th, "The case for enlargement is one of principle:  that 
independent nations have the right to choose their own foreign and 
defense policies and allies."  Especially independent nations once 
enslaved by the very nation now objecting to their increased freedoms.  
Or in President Havel's words, we cannot allow "someone else [to] 
decide which countries should be allowed to join the Alliance and 
which should not."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Third, the United States and the newly enlarged memberships of the EU 
must move promptly to increase trade across the Atlantic.  A Trans-
Atlantic Free Trade Agreement (TAFTA) must be put on the agenda of the 
World Trading Organization.  If it does not receive favorable 
attention, the EU and NAFTA should begin direct discussions to further 
liberalize trade agreements.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
For seven years there has been a window of opportunity to bring 
stability to an area of the world that has spawned a century of wars.  
But it is closing rapidly; in fact, there is a chance that it may be  
slammed shut by the June elections in Russia.  The fears of central 
European nations of instability to the East are not groundless.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Lady Thatcher's address to the Congress of Prague provided a practical 
program:  "...to merge the North American Free Trade Area with the 
European community, including the countries of Central and perhaps in 
time Eastern Europe."  And a corresponding vision:  "We in the West 
won a great victory  the Cold War.  Let us not now forget why we 
fought.  The mission of this Congress is to recapture that sense of 
purpose and clothe it with practical action."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is an opportunity to bring the victims of this century the 
opportunities of the next one.  It must be seized before it slips 
away.

Two years later, what has happened?  Not much.  The budgets of the 
Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department are little 
changed from previous years.  The EPA's 1996 budget is only 1.5% less 
than its 1995 budget.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The flawed Endangered Species Act continues in force unchanged even 
though authorization for it has long since lapsed.  The Safe Drinking 
Water Act, among the least controversial of the nation's environmental 
laws, has not been re-authorized.  Wetlands reforms are still nothing 
but a promise.  Commitments to improve individual property rights 
protections and to give more control over environmental matters to the 
states have largely gone unfulfilled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Congress has even been unable to reform the one law widely cited by 
both Democrats and Republicans as perhaps the most flawed 
environmental program:  Superfund.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So why have the reformers failed? First, there was an image problem.  
Republicans focused on the cost to business of environmental 
regulation.  They talked about dollars and cents, efficiency, and 
decreased regulation, thus providing Democrats the opportunity to 
seize the moral high ground.  Defenders of the status quo frightened 
the public by painting reforms as the abandonment of basic 
environmental protection.  Talk about decreased business costs was no 
match for talk about threats to "children's health."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then there were election year politics. The President and 
Congressional Democrats calculated that it would be better for their 
election prospects to bash Republicans for their lack of compassion 
than to support positive bipartisan environmental reforms.  Democrats 
even refused to vote for environmental policies that they themselves 
had proposed and supported when they controlled the Congress.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Then came the pollsters.  Republican pollsters found that the vast 
majority of voters consider themselves to be environmentalists. They 
also found that even Republican voters trust Democrats more than their 
own party on environmental issues. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But people who vote based on environmental issues generally think 
either that environmental laws need basic reforms that balance human 
needs with environmental protection, or that we must protect the 
environment regardless of the costs.  The former group has largely 
supported reform efforts.  Backing off environmental reforms threatens 
to alienate them.  Voters in the latter group don't trust Republican 
efforts and attempting to gain their support is a losing proposition.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
But the main reason for the failure of Republican environmental reform 
goes much deeper.  It rests on the first rule of successful politics:  
you must present a positive vision for the outcome of your policies. 
While the reformers correctly pointed out the excesses associated with 
current environmental laws, they neither discussed environmentally 
appropriate goals nor provided a blueprint for attaining a better 
environment.  Simply put, they ignored the "vision thing."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
A positive environmental vision for the future is centered upon the 
solution to the tragedy of the Commons.  You remember the tale:  all 
the village cattle graze upon a jointly owned common.  It is in the 
interest of each villager to add more cattle to his herd, since he 
pays no price to use the common. Soon there is no grass left on the 
common, the cattle die, and the village economy fails.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The solution?  Give each villager an ownership stake in his portion of 
the common and he will graze only so many cattle as it will support.  
The village economy then prospers.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Instead of the government regulating the trout stream, let the trout 
fisherman manage the lands and trout will flourish.  Let nature 
conservancies manage the bird sanctuaries and reap the profits of 
drilling for oil beneath them, and oil and fowl will peacefully co-
exist.  When the government bans the killing of elephants, poachers 
take them and the herds dwindle.  Let the natives own the elephants, 
and hunters are permitted a share, but the herds will grow under the 
watchful eye of people who have a stake in their growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Free markets produce more wealth, and free people are the best 
environmental stewards.  Wealthier societies have healthier 
populations and commit more resources to environmental protection than 
do poorer nations.  Freedom of people and markets is not only 
compatible with environmental health, it is essential to it. 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
What the Republicans forgot is that beating up on regulators - no 
matter how well deserved - is no substitute for an environmental 
vision for the future.

<h2>
Cut Taxes, Help the Economy, Win the Presidency
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
As Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.  And sometimes 
very quickly.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Barely a month ago, on April 29th, Bruce Bartlett, formerly at the 
Treasury Department and now a Senior Fellow with the National Center 
for Policy Analysis,  put forth a simple idea:  cut personal income 
taxes 15% across the board.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Why a 15% cut?  Because that would bring the government's share of the 
nation's gross domestic product back to about what it was in 1992, 
before President Clinton took office.  In Bartlett's words, "In the 
first three years of the Clinton administration, Americans have paid 
$151.1 billion more in taxes than if federal receipts had remained at 
their 1992 level as a share of gross domestic product."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett had the inspiration after he saw recent Commerce Department 
figures that showed that more than one out of every three dollars 
produced by the American economy last year went to government.  At the 
federal, state and local levels combined, government consumed 31.3% of 
all national output - the largest share of GDP ever taken by 
government.  Even in 1945, with the country fighting and paying for 
World War II, total taxes only amounted to 30% of GDP.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Bartlett calculated that since Bill Clinton took office, personal 
income taxes have increased 1.6 times faster than the country's 
economic growth, as measured by GDP, and corporate taxes have 
increased 3.5 times faster.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Three weeks later, on May 20th, Bartlett could report that Bob Dole, 
soon to be the Republican nominee for president, was giving his idea 
serious consideration.  Dole has been a deficit hawk during his 
career, but history, politics and economic theory are all on the side 
of a tax cut - and that may be enough to sway him.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
There is historical justification for a tax cut now.  The increasing 
government share of output caused by bracket creep during the high 
inflation 1970s led to the Reagan tax cut.  For that matter, the high 
percentage of state output that was being taken by taxes in California 
was what prompted Proposition 13 in California in 1978 and the 
beginning of a nationwide revolt against state and local tax levels.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Political justification?   Well, there's the Reagan proposal in 1980 
for a 30% across-the-board reduction that helped him beat Jimmy 
Carter.   More recently, Christie Whitman came from behind to win 
election as governor of New Jersey in 1993 after she too pledged a 30% 
tax cut.  Further, that 15% figure represents a repeal of President 
Clinton's tax increases, so it should have some symbolic importance to 
Dole and the Republican Party.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
The magic of a tax cut pledge is that it gives a campaign a focal 
point.  (After 1988, it's pretty safe to say that just pledging "no 
new taxes" is not going to be a vote-getter.)  For Republicans, whose 
agenda is less regulation, smaller government, and increased personal 
responsibility, a tax reduction proposal provides philosophical 
underpinning for all their policies.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
Perhaps the most compelling justification, however, is economics.  
Because personal and corporate income taxes are graduated - the more 
money one makes, the higher tax percentage one pays - the tax burden 
increases as the economy grows.  To hold it steady as a percentage of 
the national economy requires periodic tax cuts.  Further, reducing 
marginal tax rates provides an incentive to earn more money, freeing 
up more dollars for saving and investment and stimulating economic 
growth.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
"But," as the liberals (and moderate Republicans) are fond of saying, 
"what about the deficit?"  That argument was dealt a body blow  by 
Democrat Felix Rohatyn in the April 11th Wall Street Journal:  After 
listing our most serious economic and social problems, Rohatyn wrote:  
"Even though all of these require different approaches, the single 
most important requirement to deal with all of them is the wealth and 
revenues generated by a higher rate of economic growth.  John Kennedy 
was right:  A rising tide lifts all boats.  Although it may not lift 
all of them at the same time and at the same rate, without more growth 
we are simply redistributing the same pie." 
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; One of the success stories of the Contract With America is that 
So how can Dole, as a deficit hawk, rationalize a tax cut? A 
successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing the 
growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic growth 
is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases take home 
pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax receipts. 
There aren't many problems that a 15% tax cut can cause that a 3.5% 
economic growth rate can't solve if you keep a handle on spending.  
Ideas do have consequences.  And Bob Dole's election could be the 
consequence of a proposal to cut taxes 15% across-the-board.

Chicken Little Lives
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Chicken Littles who had the last word on the International Panel 
on Climate Change tell us that the sky is falling again.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The panel of scientists comprising the IPCC recently reported on the 
state of, and potential outlook for, earth's climate.  Doubts, 
disagreements and contradictory data can be found in the body of the 
report.  But the group who wrote the executive summary, the only part 
that will be widely read, pretty flatly assert that humans are causing 
global warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Based on the executive summary and the policy options presented in it, 
environmentalists say the world's governments must take drastic action 
now to halt the cataclysmic consequences of such a change.  Analysts 
at the World Watch Institute, for example, call for an overhaul of our 
energy and transportation systems, ending the fossil fuel economy.  
Such policies would cost our nation billions of dollars.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Before we head for cover, let's consider whether the sky really is 
falling, or whether some Chicken Littles in the ranks of scientists 
have been led down the garden path by a figurative acorn, in the form 
of computer climate model data, falling on their heads.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Proponents of the theory of global warming, or, as is now fashionable, 
"global climate change," depend on two bits of evidence and computer 
models.  First,  ground-level measurements of global mean temperature 
indicate that earth has warmed between 0.3 and 0.6 degrees Celsius in 
the last century.  Second, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), a primary 
greenhouse gas (those gases without which most animal and plant life 
would not exist), has increased by approximately 25 percent in the 
last century and a half.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When you put these facts in the computer models, global climate change 
theory says that the earth's current warming is due to the increase of 
CO2 in the atmosphere, caused primarily by the use of fossil fuel.  
According to the models, absent a severe and immediate reduction in 
the level of CO2 put into the atmosphere, the earth will warm further, 
causing all manner of calamities from melting polar ice caps which 
would raise ocean levels, flooding small islands and coastal regions, 
to increased hurricane activity and severe droughts, which would cause 
massive crop failure.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The IPCC report's executive summary predicts that if no further action 
is taken to curb greenhouse gas emissions, we can expect an increase 
in temperature somewhere  between 0.8 and 3.5 degrees Celsius over 
the next 100 years.  Interestingly, this figure is well below the amount 
of warming forecast just four years ago.  In fact, with every new report, 
the range of warming falls.  At this pace, in a few years scientific 
doomsayers will be talking about the next ice age again.  (We haven't 
forgotten that that was this same group's doom and gloom scenario in 
the 1970s.)
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the current figure is correct, the increase is well within the 
natural range of known temperature variation over the last 15,000 
years.  Most of the earth's plant life evolved in a much warmer, CO2-
filled atmosphere.  In fact, the predicted warming would affect 
primarily night-time temperatures, lessening the number of frosty 
nights and extending the growing season.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, there is little evidence that increased CO2 has had more than 
a small part to play in this century's temperature increase.  Most of 
the warming occurred before the 1940s, before the widespread use of 
automobiles.  In fact, from 1938 to the present, we have actually 
experienced a cooling trend.  Indeed, satellite data, the most 
reliable climate evidence that we have, show no evidence of warming.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why do scientists agree that we must take drastic action now?  
Well, they don't.  Some scientists are proclaiming impending disaster, 
but others of at least equal repute say the evidence of global warming 
is questionable at best.  So this is not a question of proven science 
versus a bunch of know-nothings.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And why do they agree, as the executive summary says, that we should 
take drastic action now to curb fossil fuel use, limit economic growth 
in established countries, and condemn less-developed countries to 
continue in their less-developed circumstances, and increase 
unemployment and misery all around?  They don't agree with that 
either. Even some of climate change theory's foremost scientific 
advocates acknowledge that there is nothing we can do now to prevent 
global climate change that we won't be able to do 10 years from now.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A far better course of action is to keep studying, keep learning, and 
keep improving our data until we understand what, if anything, is 
really happening.  Then we can take action that will allow economic 
growth and a higher standard of living and keep our planet livable.  
Both must be accomplished together; we must not sacrifice one to 
achieve the other.

<h2>
The Best Campaign Finance Law: Repeal Spending and Contribution Limits
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>[Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis]</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Memo to true believers in campaign finance reform:  The only way to 
ensure fairer, freer elections is to get rid of the campaign spending 
laws.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Completely.  Require full disclosure of all contributors, but nothing 
else.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our present campaign finance laws are ridiculous.  As a case in point, 
Ross Perot, who spent $60 million of his own money running for 
president in 1992, can get $32 million of taxpayers' money for a race 
this year if he'll hold his personal spending to less than $50,000.  
But if Perot's Reform Party picks somebody else to run, that candidate 
may not get any taxpayers' money.  Or maybe he or she will get $32 
million after all.  The Federal Election Commission hasn't decided.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Or look at publisher Steve Forbes.  He can spend a million dollars of 
his own money to run himself, but is not allowed to contribute it to a 
candidate he believes in - like Jack Kemp.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Barbra Streisand or Whoopi Goldberg can make appearances worth tens of 
thousands of dollars to candidates, but a successful CEO cannot give 
the same amount to candidates of his or her choice.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The AFL-CIO can spend $35 million on advertising against incumbent 
Congressmen, but to defend themselves those candidates must raise 
money in $1,000 or $5,000 bites.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Our current campaign laws are a failed idea; complex, ineffective, and 
manipulated by a political bureaucracy called the Federal Elections 
Commission.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The reforms currently being touted include banning political action 
committees (PACs), restricting "bundling" (where individuals have one 
person deliver their contribution checks on behalf of a group), 
requiring Senatorial candidates to raise 60% of their funds inside 
their state, and outlawing "soft money."  Proponents recognize that 
banning PACs almost certainly is unconstitutional, so there's a 
fallback provision limiting their contribution to a candidate to 
$1,000.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The goal of all these proposals is to limit the influence of people 
and groups with money on the electoral process.  It might work if 
campaigns were conducted in a vacuum.  But they aren't.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Limiting the size of contributions works to the benefit of incumbents, 
or organization or party candidates, who already have in place the 
database and the organization for mass solicitation.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As Bradley A. Smith wrote in the January issue of the Yale Law 
Journal, "Reform proposals inherently favor certain political elites, 
support the status quo, and discourage grassroots political activity.  
Even if these proposals worked as intended, they would have an 
undemocratic effect on American elections."  To put it differently, 
campaign spending laws protect incumbents and special interests.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Besides, there really is no evidence that small contributions from 
large numbers lead to more representative government with less 
corruption, or that the numbers of small donors are an indication of 
the sentiment of the general electorate.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Eugene McCarthy would have found it difficult at best to conduct his 
antiwar campaign in 1968 without the six-figure individual 
contributions from backers Jack Dreyfus Jr. and Stewart Mott.  The two 
presidential candidates who have been most successful at raising money 
from small contributors were Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George 
McGovern in 1972.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Abolishing PACs may win cheers from reformers, but Francis Wilkinson, 
communications director for Democrat Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful 
Senate campaign, noted in a New York Times op-ed article "the impact 
on the 28,000 nurses who contribute an average of $46 a year to the 
American Nurses Association PAC to have a voice on issues like health 
care. ...For them, a PAC affords a convenient avenue of participation 
and a chance to exercise power they could not wield as individuals."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Campaign finance restrictions are a relatively recent development in 
American politics.  Is it coincidental that their growth parallels a 
decline in public confidence in government?  Maybe not, but certainly 
the campaign finance laws haven't done anything to raise confidence.  
And there is no evidence that we are better off because of them.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Instead of trying to fix campaign spending limitations, let's get rid 
of them.  Let people know how much money a candidate has received and 
who the big contributors are, and let them make up their  own minds 
about whether the candidate should get their vote.  One thing for 
sure, that approach would be an improvement over what we have now.

<h2>
Good Intentions and Bad Policy
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No matter what your sixth grade teacher or My Weekly Reader said, 
America is not running out of space to put its garbage, recycling is 
not always good, and the world is not running out of resources.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The well-financed cultural mantra that recycling is both desirable and 
environmentally necessary has nearly become as much a truth beyond 
critical examination as that murder is wrong and that the earth is 
round.  Our schools have been full of it.  Mothers didn't even want 
juice boxes in school lunches because of fears that they couldn't be 
recycled.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Still, it has become harder over the years to ignore the fact that 
sometimes simply throwing garbage away is more environmentally 
friendly, financially prudent - and safer for human health.  Now comes 
confirmation from an unlikely source - the New York Times Magazine.  
"Recycling is Garbage," writes John Tierney of the Times.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among other failings of recycling, it is frequently uneconomical. 
Tierney calculates that it costs more than $3,000 to recycle a ton of 
scrap metal, glass and plastic in New York City.  "For that price," he 
writes, "you could find a one-ton collection of those materials at a 
used-car lot - a Toyota Tercel, for instance - and drive home in it."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And, all things considered, you would need to use your ceramic coffee 
cup 1,000 times before it would be less environmentally expensive than 
a throw-away polystyrene cup.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For some materials, recycling is good, and businesses have long known 
this.  For instance, recycling aluminum cans requires 10% less energy 
than making them from virgin materials.   And more than 10 million 
automobile tires are recycled for retreads each year, reducing the 
energy used to produce tires by 30%.  But such success stories are not 
usually transferable to other forms of waste.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Now, it would not matter if the true believers in recycling recycled 
away to their heart's content - except that they have been able all 
too often to make their beliefs public policy.  In 1986, about 10% of 
solid waste was recycled at little cost to consumers or taxpayers.  
Today, with  statutory mandates  in many  communities, about 25% is 
recycled.  But achieving that level has been costly and the programs 
lose money.  Most states  initially  set even  higher  goals, such as  
50%  in  New York  and California,  60% in New Jersey, and 70% in 
Rhode Island - but none achieved them.  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani 
recently declared New York's legislated goals "absurd" and 
"impossible."
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At today's prices, curbside recycling programs typically add 15% to 
the cost of waste disposal.  One should remember that every dollar 
spent on inefficient recycling and waste reduction efforts is 
unavailable for other important social programs, including other 
environmental protection efforts.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the zeal to mandate recycling and the use of recycled 
products has created worse environmental and health hazards than the 
problems they were meant to solve.  For instance, government mandated 
recycling of newsprint requires de-inking - involving the use of 
toxics that create worse disposal problems.   In February, the 
Associated Press reported that a county road in Washington state was 
closed because smoke and fire kept bursting through its surface.  The 
roadway had been built with recycled tires that began to rust as rain 
seeped beneath the road's surface, causing heat, impenetrable clouds 
of steam and eventually fire.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By anointing recycling as the preferred method of disposal, 
environmentalists ignored technological, geographic, economic, and 
social limits to its usefulness.  In Wyoming, where transportation 
costs are high and land is cheap, it may make less sense to buy and 
use recycled paper than it does in New York.  
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Legislated mandates for the use and purchase of recycled products have 
wasted taxpayers' money, cost consumers both at the point of purchase 
and by limiting product options, dampened the development of resource-
saving technological innovations, and on occasion harmed the 
environment.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't we need to recycle because we're running out of scarce 
resources?  Hardly.  Technology makes it possible to use resources 
without exhausting them, which is why the prices of most natural 
resources, as well as food, have been falling for decades.  One 
example:  A fiberglass cable made with 25 kilograms of sand (about 55 
pounds) can carry 1,000 times as many messages today as a wire made 
with a ton of copper.  So copper prices are down, and its supply in no 
danger of depletion.
<BR>  &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And if throwing something away is the best choice, there is room to do 
that, too.  If we keep generating garbage at current rates for 1,000 
years, how big would a landfill 100 yards deep need to be to hold it?  
Just 35 miles square.

<h2>
The Information Warriors
</h2>  <a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"> Pete du Pont  </a>  <P> <i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>
<P>
The American Enterprise Institute, the Cato Institute, the Heritage 
Foundation, the Brookings Institution, the Urban Institute, and the 
National Center for Policy Analysis.  Who are they?  Some of America's 
"think tanks."  What are they?  In the battle of public policy ideas, 
they are the information warriors, and they are changing the way 
America thinks.
<P>
In times past legislators often relied on academics and industry-
supported researchers to supply them with information and answers 
about some of the leading public policy questions.  But increasingly 
both liberal and conservative legislators are turning to private, non-
profit research institutes, commonly known as think tanks, for the 
information they need to carry on the public policy debates.
<P>
Most of the public policy debates in Congress and in the state 
legislatures begin as ideas about what the "good society" should be 
like.  For example, should the government ensure that everyone has a 
right to health care, free education, and a good job?  Or should we be 
a society of limited government?  Should the government, through its 
economic policies, try to create an egalitarian society?  Or should it 
be indifferent as to who the winners and losers are, and just ensure 
that everyone plays by the rules?
<P>
The founders of most think tanks had some vision of that good society 
when they formed their organizations, and that vision usually pervades 
the institutes' policy recommendations.  So the analyses they produce 
have been well thought through.
<P>
As a result, the ideas behind public policy proposals and the debate 
over the social or economic impact of those proposals are increasingly 
being fought between these new centers of influence.
<P>
For example, the Clinton health care plan.  The legislative defeat of 
the Clinton health care plan came in September and October of 1994, 
but the ideological battle was fought for the two preceding years 
between liberal think tanks that supported the plan and free-market 
think tanks that opposed socializing the American health care system. 
<P>
On this issue, the free-market think tanks won a clear and decisive 
victory.  But for the longest time, they were the only troops in the 
field.  The media were absolutely convinced that some version of the 
Clinton plan would pass, and even some conservative Republicans 
thought they saw the handwriting on the wall.  National organizations 
such as the American Medical Association and the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce, which should have vehemently opposed the plan, cozied up to 
the administration in order to get a "seat at the table."
<P>
By contrast, the National Center for Policy Analysis (with which I am 
associated), the Cato Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and several 
other research institutes immediately raised questions about the plan 
and began to provide in-depth analysis of the economic problems that 
would arise if the Clinton plan were implemented.  Those educational 
efforts laid the groundwork for the American people's utter rejection 
of the Clinton plan.
<P>
Currently, Medical Savings Accounts are the most controversial  health 
care  issue before Congress.  MSAs are tax-free personal savings 
accounts used to pay for small and routine medical care, while a 
catastrophic health care policy pays for major expenses.  
<P>
While the battle rages today, the idea is not new.  As far back as 
1984, the National Center for Policy Analysis was promoting a 
variation of this idea, which was eventually endorsed by a number of 
think tanks across the country and passed into law by nearly 20 
states.  
<P>
In addition, the educational efforts about MSAs has resulted in 
perhaps 2,000 businesses adopting some version of an MSA plan.  As a 
result, a whole new market for health insurance has arisen, spurring 
the industry, especially the small-and medium-size insurance 
companies, to consider innovative ways to meet the demand. 
<P>
But these battles were small compared to what is coming.  Both 
liberal- and conservative-oriented think tanks are gearing up for two 
of the biggest public policy battles yet - privatizing Social Security 
before it becomes insolvent and reforming the income tax system to 
make it fairer, less complex, and more conducive to economic growth.
<P>
Both battles will make the past debates look mild by comparison.  It 
may be years before we are able to reform either system, but the 
debate is beginning now as the think tanks prepare their arguments.
<P>
In the '60s and '70s, the liberal think tanks were winning the public 
policy battles.  In the '80s and '90s, the conservative institutes 
have had the upper hand.
<P>
Now, more than ever, think tanks matter.  They are influencing our 
economy and our society as they develop the ideas behind the policies 
<P>
that drive the politics of America.

<title>Pete Du Pont--GOP CONVENTION--08/08/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/">
<img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p>
<i>Thursday, August 8, 1996</i><p>


<h2>GOP Convention</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

For the past year, the Republicans have been a fractious lot.  The 
Gingrich conservatives have argued with the liberal Senate 
Republicans.  The presidential primaries were nasty.  Abortion is an 
issue that splits the party into warring factions on a weekly basis.<p>

So it is none too soon that Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole 
has centered his campaign on an issue nearly all Republicans can agree 
on - tax cuts.<p>

Given the continuing debate between the party's supply-siders and 
deficit hawks, that may seem a strange statement.  But who better to 
preside over a tax-cutting administration than Bob Dole, the deficit 
hawk?  <p>

Supply-siders can be pleased with the prospect of new economic growth 
stimulated by the Dole tax cuts.  The deficit hawks can be pleased 
because Dole's own credentials offer them assurance that he will give 
equal attention to curbing government spending.  <p>

And the entire Republican party - supply-siders and deficit hawks 
alike - can stand on a plan for running government in the years ahead 
that combines the two most important elements of a stronger economy, 
lower taxes and the reduced growth of government spending.<p>

Both of those elements are also vital to another Republican goal:  a 
balanced budget by the year 2002.<p>

The Dole plan includes a 15% across-the-board personal income tax rate 
cut over three years, halving the capital gains tax rate, repealing 
the 1993 Social Security benefits tax increase, expanding the 
availability of Individual Retirement Accounts and giving families a 
$500 per child tax credit.  Altogether the cuts are projected to 
reduce government tax revenue by $548 billion over six years.<p>

Tax cuts are more than simply politically popular.  Dole doesn't have 
to be a supply-sider to be aware of what scholarly studies conclude 
and recent history confirms - that the right kinds of tax cuts 
stimulate economic growth.  The longest periods of sustained economic 
growth in the United States have followed tax cuts.  After the Kennedy 
tax cuts in the 1960s, the economy grew by 42% over seven years.  
After the Reagan cuts of the 1980s, the economy grew by 33% over seven 
years.<p>

Economist Gerald Scully, a Senior Fellow at the National Center for 
Policy Analysis who has done extensive analysis of taxes, has 
concluded that maximum economic growth occurs when government at all 
levels takes between 21.5% and 22.9 % of the nation's output of goods 
and services in taxes.  Currently, the federal government alone takes 
20.5 % - and the Congressional Budget Office expects the economy to 
grow by only 2.2% this year.  Real gross domestic product grew only 
1.3 % last year.<p>

President Clinton may see that kind of economy as "the soundest it's 
been in a generation," but it is not growing rapidly enough to provide 
Americans with economic opportunity.  <p>

Dole projects that the stimulation of enacting his tax cuts will push 
annual  economic growth to 3.5%, generating millions of jobs, a 
lasting expansion and more opportunities.  But the Dole proposal needs 
only a third of that increase to succeed.<p>

Clinton officials will likely jump on the bandwagon, arguing that they 
will now enact the middle class tax cut they promised four years ago.  
But for the moment, they are pushing the familiar theme of economic 
class-warfare.  Those who pay the most taxes will benefit the most 
from the tax cuts, they say.  True, of course, but that argument may 
not resonate so well with taxpayers who conclude that everybody is 
getting a fair share of the reductions.  Dole will touch some 
responsive chords with the theme he sounded last weekend when he said, 
"I was thinking of the husband and wife who both work, who have little 
money to save for their children's education after they pay their 
bills."<p>

Maybe Dole decided on tax cuts simply as a political tactic.  If so, 
this is one time when good politics is also good policy.  And a 
President Dole would be unlikely to lose sight for a moment of his 
goal of a balanced budget by 2002.  Given the tax cuts, this deficit 
hawk would of necessity have to go after government spending with a 
zeal that hasn't been seen in the White House since ... well, ever.<p>

<title>Pete Du Pont-- Silence of the Lamm -- 08/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/">
<img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p>
<i>Wednesday, August 14, 1996</i><p>


<h2>Silence of the Lamm</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

So, is America ready for a third-party?  Ross Perot thinks so.  So 
does David Broder of the Washington Post, who writes that by 2000, a 
third party will be a major political force in America.
<p>
But if there were a third party, what would it stand for?  What would 
its policies be?  These are the questions bothering the third party we 
already have - Ross Perot's Reform Party - because to date it is a 
party of one man, not a party of ideas.  If it is going to have any 
impact on the American political process, the Reform Party must become 
a party of ideas.
<p>
Take the case of former three-term Colorado Governor Dick Lamm, who is 
trying to get his message out to members of the Reform Party in a 
effort to win the party's nomination for president.  So far, he has 
had only moderate success
<p>
Lamm contends that the Reform Party, founded and largely funded by 
Perot, has hampered his campaign by refusing to let him have members' 
addresses so that he could reach them by mail.  In addition, his 
repeated requests to debate Perot were declined.  Reform Party 
officials deny having done anything to hinder Lamm's campaign or his 
ability to reach party members.
<p>
Lamm stepped into the Reform Party process for two reasons:  He wanted 
a national platform on which to discuss the problems American is 
facing and he apparently believed Perot when for months the Reform 
Party founder denied having any desire to be nominated and run for 
president of the United States.
<p>
Unfortunately, the national media have focused almost entirely on the 
internal struggle for power rather than the issues Lamm and the Reform 
Party have been pushing.  As a result, Lamm's message has been 
silenced.
<p>
But were he able to get his message out he would warn Americans of a 
number of impending problems.  For example:
<p>
<b>Social Security reform</b> - The Social Security system is going bankrupt.  
At its current rate of growth, the trust fund will begin drawing on 
reserves by the year 2013 and will be broke by 2030.  Since our 
elderly population is growing much more rapidly than workers, there 
simply won't be enough workers to keep Social Security solvent.  The 
later we wait, the worse it will be, so we must develop a solution 
now.
<p>
<b>Medicare reform</b> - Medicare is going bankrupt even faster than Social 
Security.  According to Medicare's trustees' report, Medicare Part A 
(which pays hospital bills) will go into the red by 2000 and be broke 
just a year or so later.  Republicans passed a Medicare reform 
proposal, only to have it viciously attacked by the Democrats.  As a 
result, the notion that Medicare is politically untouchable is 
prevailing once again.  That's an attitude we can't financially 
maintain for long.
<p>
<b>Fiscal responsibility</b> - Reagan-era tax cuts increased federal revenues 
between 1981 and 1989 by an average of 1.8 percent per year, after 
inflation.  Unfortunately, the Democrat-led Congress increased 
spending by 2.3 percent.  That disparity explains the increased 
deficit spending during the Reagan years.  Bob Dole wants to cut 
taxes, but keep the budget balanced.  Would Lamm do the same?
<p>
The problem is that Dick Lamm has spoken out on these and a number of 
other issues over the years, but the media have focused so much on 
Lamm's political struggles, they have failed to give due attention to 
his solutions to our problems.
<p>
That's too bad, because Lamm is a serious politician with a message 
Americans need to hear and consider.  His may indeed be a "root-canal" 
vision of our future - all cuts and no gains - but it is a very 
definite political message that may force the Republicans and 
Democrats to deal with politically difficult issues that candidates 
might otherwise sweep under the table.
<p>
I don't believe Lamm's message will resonate.  Americans are 
optimists, believing, in Steve Forbes' words, in "hope, growth, and 
opportunity."  Lamm's pessimism will be a hard sell.  Further, I would 
disagree with those who say there is a political longing unfulfilled 
by the Democratic and Republican parties.
<p>
To have an impact, third-party candidates will need to debate the 
message, not the man.  So far all we've heard is Ross Perot.  Maybe 
it's time to see what Dick Lamm has to say.  
<p>

<title>Pete Du Pont</title>

<center><h2>Pete Du Pont</h2></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
Pete du Pont has served as a state legislator, U.S. Congressman, Governor, and in l988 was a 
Republican candidate for President of the United States.  He writes a weekly column and is a featured 
columnist for CEO Magazine.  He hosts a weekly television program entitled FocusPoint for National 
Empowerment Television (NET) and various broadcast stations.
<p>
	Pete du Pont chairs the Strategic Advisory Committee, which advises Speaker Newt Gingrich on 
key strategic issues, and was appointed to the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, 
known as the Kemp Commission.  du Pont is currently Policy Chairman of the National Center for 
Policy Analysis and Chairman of the National Review Institute, public policy analysis organizations 
promoting free enterprise and conservative governmental policies.   He has served as Chairman of the 
Hudson Institute and was the founder of GOPAC, the Republican political action committee.
<p>
	Pete du Pont began his political career in l968 with his election to the Delaware General 
Assembly.  In l970, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served for six years.
<p>
	In l976, Pete du Pont won the race for Delaware Governor against the Democratic incumbent 
and was re-elected in l980 to a second term, winning a record 7l% of the vote.  During his tenure as 
Delaware's Governor, du Pont restored financial integrity to the state government.  Known for his fiscal 
conservatism, he signed into law two income tax reduction measures and a constitutional amendment that 
restrained future tax increases and limited government spending.  He balanced his state budget eight out of 
eight years.
<p>
	Throughout his public policy career, Pete du Pont has addressed a wide range of critical issues 
and has developed a reputation for taking on the toughest challenges and successfully meeting them.  In his 
campaign for the Presidency, his focus upon the central issues facing our country -- drugs, education, 
retirement income, poverty, defense and our relationship with the Soviet Union -- earned him a reputation 
as a man with a long-range vision and the courage to speak the truth about tomorrow.
<p>
	Columnist George Will said about du Pont's l988 campaign:<p>  "du Pont has the highest 
substance-to-blather ratio among candidates, even on subjects as sensitive as agriculture policy and Social 
Security."
<p>
	Upon his withdrawal from the 1988 race, Scripps Howard News Service noted, "More than any 
rival in either party, du Pont had the courage to tell specific interest groups what they least wanted to hear.
<p>
	Rush Limbaugh recently stated Pete du Pont...[is one of the] people who have paved the way 
for me to succeed.<p>

<h2>Smut assault forces return to censorship</h2>     
<br>By <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>I remember the first time I saw a dirty picture as a child. I was babysitting a neighbor's kids in the apartment building where I lived and spied a pin-up calendar hung inside an open closet door. I recall being scared to close the door, lest anyone remember it had been left ajar, and too timid to take a closer look, in case either parent returned unexpectedly. Little impression of the picture itself remains: a buxom blonde in Li'l Abner costume, breasts partially exposed.
<dd>Such innocent times. I thought of that picture again recently on a trip to Manhattan. I was tired after a long day of meetings and speeches and decided to spend the evening in my room at the Yale Club, ordering in room service and mindlessly watching TV. Unlike most hotels these days, the Yale Club offers no in-room movies, just basic cable service. 
<dd>Too lazy to cross the room and examine the TV Guide, I used the remote to move from channel to channel looking for something to watch. Shortly after 10:00 PM, my channel surfing swept me into unchartered waters. Suddenly I was staring at writhing, naked bodies: three young men, black and white, one wearing only a studded dog-collar; another, a gold cross hanging between his pectorals. 
<dd>I saw more. Simulated sex acts, close ups of tumescent genitals and other body parts and most memorably, the faces of the men, boys really, barely older than my children. After a few minutes, I switched the channel, unable to watch anymore, not even to try to learn what program it was I had happened upon. 
<dd>As shocking as the experience was, I'll survive this unwanted brush with gay pornography. But what about children or adolescents who happen to tune in? And they will, especially those who are already most vulnerable, whose parents aren't around or don't care what their kids are up to at 10 o'clock at night. What effect will those pictures have on the young? 
<dd>After this episode I learned that the cable franchise in New York City has tried unsuccessfully to limit this channel to those customers who send in postcards requesting it, free of charge. A federal district court judge considered this imposition too onerous, stigmatizing those with pornographic tastes. Apparently the judge did not feel it too burdensome to require parents to learn to program their cable boxes if they wished to keep images of sodomy off the family TV. He issued an injunction prohibiting the franchise from blocking the channel, which now remains part of the basic service that
comes into every cable subscriber's home. 
<dd>In his new book Slouching Toward Gomorrah: Modern Liberalism and American Decline, Robert Bork suggests that maybe it is time to re-instate censorship in America. "From the earliest colonies on this continent over 300 years ago, and for about 175 years of our existence as a nation, we endorsed and lived with censorship," Bork argues. That changed dramatically in 1973 when the Supreme Court in Miller vs. California established new standards to determine what may be banned. Courts since then have been reluctant to ban any sexual material as long as it involves "consenting adults." 
<dd>Barely 50 years ago, Bork reminds us, the Supreme Court unanimously wrote: "There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or 'fighting' words." 
<dd>How far we've come since then. Now the First Amendment is regularly invoked to protect as "speech" forms of expression that include "snuff" films that depict the sexual torture and murder of women and children, photographs and videos of men and women having sex with animals, and other abominations too numerous to mention. 
<dd>It is unimaginable that our Founders would have sanctioned this interpretation of the First Amendment, which after all was intended originally to protect political speech deemed necessary for democracy to function, indeed thrive. Are we a freer society today by virtue of being exposed to all manner of filth and smut? Are our children more likely to grow up good, informed citizens ready to perform their democratic duties because they have listened to a steady stream of misogynist and hedonist rock and rap lyrics on the public airwaves? 
<dd>Unless the Supreme Court can see its way out of the morass it has created, maybe it is time to consider amending the First Amendment. Twenty-five years of radical First Amendment jurisprudence on pornography has turned much of the popular culture into a Styxian cesspool. And those of us who would like to avoid being drowned there are told we are anti-democratic. 
<dd>Why must I carefully avoid scanning television channels, or pretend I don't hear the suggestive words emanating from the radio when I take a taxi? Why must I look at sneering, crotch-clutching models in their underwear on the side of city buses? And how am I expected to protect my children if I choose? 
<dd>Surely liberty is not synonymous with licentiousness. And if judges cannot tell the difference, the people will have to show them the way, which is what real democracy is all about.

<i>Commentary from America's Future, Inc.</i><br> 
<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplbio.html">F. R. Duplantier</a><br> 
 <i> September 4, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. II</h2><p>


<i>If you're sick and tired of judicial activism, take heart. It may not last much longer.</i><p>



"We are constrained by many rules and taxed for many costs that we as self-governing people did not choose for ourselves but were chosen for us by judges who thought they knew better," observes Richard Morgan, professor of Constitutional Law and Government at Bowdoin College. Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, Morgan argues that the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education "ushered in the modern era in constitutional law," an era in which the courts came to be viewed "as a source of governmental power that could force unpopular changes that could not be secured through representative institutions." Over the last three decades, the courts "have removed issue after issue from the arena of popular decision and subjected them to judicial control."<p>

Morgan laments the dramatic changes that have taken place in America since the 1960s, "when judicial social engineering based on the Brown model took hold. Huge new bodies of judge-made law constrain us on all sides," he observes. "New restrictions on what Americans can do in their communities, state legislatures, and the national Congress are being fabricated apace. It is no accident that this period of imperial expansion by the judiciary coincides with a period of precipitous increase in the American social problems and a decline in the quality of life, especially in our cities," says Morgan. "The courts did not cause the decline, but they often have made it more difficult for communities, through the processes of self-government, to cope with their problems. In the decades since Brown we have seen our churches and other voluntary institutions . . . increasingly isolated from the public square; we have seen our schools destabilized, our law enforcement enfeebled, the maintenance of order in our streets undermined, and major public-sector institutions taken over and run by judges."<p>

There was no popular support for such judicial abuse in the beginning, nor is there any now, and yet it continues. "After decades of conservative electoral outcomes and hundreds of state and federal judicial appointments intended to end 'judicial legislation,' and with public opinion sullenly resistant to much of the social engineering ordered from the bench, how is it that legally unjustified judicial interventions into policy making and administration still occur routinely?" asks Morgan. "Why does our sprawling 'rights industry' continue to grow and succeed so often in persuading judges to establish policies that cannot be put in place through the normal democratic processes of election and legislation?"<p>

Though leaving such questions unanswered, Richard Morgan insists that the days of judicial activism are numbered. He argues that "curtailing judicial legislation is an absolutely essential part of reinvigorating self-government and arresting social decline in America at the end of the century." The best way to begin, says Morgan, is by recognizing the error in Brown.<p>

<title>Fumento:Crime Rate Decline Calls for Introspection--and Caution</title>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>January 22, 1997</i><p>
<h2>Crime Rate Decline Calls for Introspection--and Caution</h2><p>     
<P>
<dd>
Hallelujah! Praise the lord and DON'T pass the ammunition!  Why?  Because across the
country, murder rates are plummeting. According to new FBI figures, the rate fell 7 percent
in the first half of 1996, continuing a three-year trend.
<br>
<dd>     
The down side of this is that next to other western countries, the United States is still 
comparable to a World War I battlefield. Whatever we may be doing right, we need to be doing
a lot more. But what ARE we doing, anyway?
<br>
<dd>     
First, let's make clear that anybody who says there's a simple or complete answer is either
lying to you or to themselves. That includes the claims of Sheriff Wild Bill Clinton that he
done rode them varmints outta town on a rail.
<br>
<dd>
"Crime has dropped in the last four years as we worked to put 100,000 police on the streets,"
he said in his January 4 radio address.  He has also repeatedly given credit to the Brady
Bill, which requires a waiting period and background check for handgun purchasers.
<br>
<dd>
But note Clinton's careful wording about those cops. He said he worked to put them there, not
that they actually exist. Indeed, for the most part they don't. Studies show that at most
the legislation has added about 17,000 new officers, and many of those would have been added
anyway but are now simply paid for out of federal funds instead of local ones.
<br>
<dd>
As to the Brady bill, Mrs. Brady humbly boasted at the Democratic National Convention that
her husband's namesake law "has helped keep more than 100,000 felons and other prohibited
purchasers from buying handguns."
<br>
<dd>     
Actually, the White House itself has only claimed 60,000, and a General Accounting Office
report last year found that half of those rejected were for administrative reasons--mostly
paperwork errors. Only 5 percent were rejected because of violent crime convictions and most
probably just proceeded to buy a gun on the streets.
<br>
<dd>
Thus, a University of Chicago study found recently that the Brady Bill was about as effective
as "The Brady Bunch" in preventing crime.
<br>
<dd>
The main way we know that neither Clinton nor anyone in the federal government deserves
credit for falling crime is that about 95 percent of crime is handled by state and local
agencies. That's easily measured, because about 95 percent of the criminals behind bars are
there on state charges, not federal ones.
<br>
<dd>
So what were some of those state and local initiatives that might have helped reduce violent
crime?
<br>
<dd>
One was pointed to in the aforementioned University of Chicago study, which found a direct
correlation between the increasing number of states allowing people to carry concealed
firearms and decreasing violent crimes in those states.  Apparently, many criminals start
rethinking their careers when they realize their next potential victim may exercise his or
her constitutional right to blow their attacker's head off.
<br>
<dd>
The Chicago study made gun control advocates so hot you could have fried eggs on their
heads. Nevertheless, they were unable to refute the data, which showed that when such laws
went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults
fell by 5 and 7 percent, respectively.
<br>
<dd>
On the other hand, the major city with the highest drop in murders, New York, has no such
provision for carrying concealed weapons.  New York may be reaping the benefits of what
criminologist James Q. Wilson has called the "broken glass" effect.
<br>
<dd>
Basically, this means officers take the time to follow up on and prevent even the little crimes
like vandalism that formerly they ignored in favor of concentrating on big crimes. By paying
attention to lesser infractions, the theory goes, the police instill respect for the law and
uphold values in neighborhoods. This then cuts down on the occurance of major crimes.
<br>
<dd>
Clearly something wonderful is happening in the Big Apple, and the broken glass theory
deserves continued application and observation.
<br>
<dd>     
A steady rise in prison capacity may also be helping to reduce violent crime rates.
Since 1980, the nation's prison population has tripled.  Just in the last two years, the
population of state and federal prisons has increased by almost 14 percent.  In the last
four years, the average time served for serious crimes increased by a half.
<br>
<dd>     
In 1994, of those seeking parole, almost 80 percent were denied.  By contrast, in 1990 80
percent who sought parole got it.
<br>
<dd>
But before we wear out our palms slapping ourselves on the back for the decreasing crime
rate, a little humility and caution are in order. Without doubt, one major factor has simply
been a decline in the portion of the populace that is at the age that commits violent
crimes.
<br>
<dd>
Further, to listen to highly respected criminologists like Dr. John Diulio at Princeton
University and David Kopel at the Independence Institute in Colorado, we may just be in the
eye of the storm.
<dd>
The reason?  "It's not just the age of the population, but the conditions under which
it was raised," Kopel explains.  And more and more of our kids are being raised without fathers. 
Without fathers, young men don't turn to Hillary Clinton's "village," to raise them; they
turn to gangs and criminal activity. 
<br>
<dd>
"In 2010 we may be reaping a whirlwind from the family-wrecking policies of the  70s, 80s,
and  90s," says Kopel.  I pray he's wrong.  I fear he may be right.

<h2>Setting an Example</h2> 
<i>Jan. 3, 1997</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

I usually refrain from commenting on people before they have been formally charged, but the recent news regarding Michael Irvin has me thinking -- Is there anyone in the public eye left that our children can look up too. 
<P>
It seems that wherever we look, another athlete or movie star has had another run-in with the law. Whether it is Irvin's cocaine problem and the latest rape incident, or the late Snoop Doggy-Dog with his gangster lifestyle, our children are witnessing the demoralization of America first hand.  Each time one of their favorite stars fall, a child must lose a bit of faith in humanity. It must be an incredibly confusing experience for a young child to see the man, who's image is plastered all over their bedroom walls, taken away in handcuffs.
<P>
Even I, as an adult, was affected a few years back, when I heard that Magic Johnson was living a lifestyle that exposed him to HIV.  Events such as these affect more than just the participants - they seem to cheapen our society piece by piece.  It has gotten so bad that most parents wouldn't want their children to grow up to be President.  For our society to be at the point where the office of the Presidency isn't highly respected is a sad commentary on our country.  
<P>
NBA player Charles Barkley, who often gets into trouble on the basketball court, likes to say that he doesn't have to be a role model.  Baloney.  Being a role model is not something one chooses, but being a good role model is.  As long as we inhabit this earth, children will look up to and emulate those they see on television.  Athletes and other celebrities must just accept this responsibility along with the millions that get paid by the parents of these children.
<P>
Some athletes have accepted this responsibility.  Jim Harbaugh, quarterback for the Indianapolis Colts, always starts every interview following a victory with the words "I want to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ."  This is something that my children should be respecting - a man who has succeeded in sports and still understands his priorities.  The opposite, once again is exemplified by our favorite good Samaritan, Michael Irvin.  After winning the Super Bowl, he was on national television swearing and using the f-word with frequency.   I was completely embarrassed to be watching such a disregard for common courtesy.
<P>
Parents already have a difficult task in raising their  children.  They don't need to compete with Michael Irvine and his flamboyant lifestyle. The sad thing is that Irvin and the Cowboys might just win it all again this year.  Wouldn't that be a great lesson to teach our children?

<h2>Who are the True Liberals?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
 The word is: the word "liberal" is out. It won't even
be heard at the Democrat convention. Hardly anyone will admit to
being a liberal anymore, meaning a tax-and-spend, 
guilt-manipulating, counter-cultural statist out of touch with
the regular guy. Even left-wing activists prefer the term 
"progressive."<P>
Of course, the Democrats are as liberal as ever, as we've 
come to understand the term. That is, they identify more with the 
government than with the governed. But this approach is an 
electoral loser.<P>
People believe they are being governed--taxed, regulated,
and otherwise pushed around--to death. Never in the history of
American polling has the federal government been so unpopular.
If "liberalism" is about supporting and expanding this
system, liberals will indeed have to find a new ideological cover. <p>

May they succeed! For the word liberal really belongs to those who favor the free economy and society: the sense in which the word is now used in Eastern Europe. The authentic liberal tradition, dating from the 17th century, is properly identified
with the intellectuals and popular movements who struggled against government power.<p>
Liberalism was born in Spain, when the followers of St. 
Thomas Aquinas discovered how economic freedom works to build
a prosperous society. The writings of the late-scholastics, 
centered around the School of Salamanca, bloomed into a worldwide
movement of "los liberales".<p>
In France, the liberals included A.R.J. Turgot, Jean 
Baptiste Say, and Frric Bastiat. In Britain,
Richard Cobden, John Bright, and Herbert Spencer. In Austria, Carl Menger, Eugen von Bhm-Bawerk, and Ludwig von Mises. In America, Patrick
Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and William Sumner. <p>
Liberals in this classical tradition understand the connection between welfarism and tyranny, big government and empire, central planning and poverty. Their goal is to establish the rule of law, decentralize government, and let capitalism flourish. <p>
How liberalism came to mean the opposite in this country is a twisted tale. Unlike the Old World, where being on the right meant supporting tyrannous regimes and empires, the New World was conceived in liberty. When the centralists and egalitarians began to undo this, beginning in 1861 and continuing to this day, they
purloined the name liberal for themselves. <P>
Yet even as late as the 1920s, some people who called themselves liberals had no beef with capitalism and self-government. They wanted to protect individual rights from
government power. They would never have countenanced a government
that taxed 40 cents on the dollar, promised cradle-to-grave security,
or forbad freedom of association. <p>
But the New Deal changed that. In the name of liberalism, a northeastern elite fastened a vast coercive apparatus on the country, and took us away from liberty and toward the very tyranny the constitution's framers were hoping to prevent.<p>
The term &quot;conservative&quot; didn't come into common use
for another generation. The opponents of the New Deal had no name
for themselves. They liked the name liberal, but with the term stolen
by their opponents, they resorted to cumbersome names like 
"anti-collectivist," "individualist," and
"America firster."<p>
In the post-war period, liberalism has meant consolidating 
and expanding the New Deal framework, while conservatism came
to mean fighting the Cold War, and preferring tradition to ideology. The really serious opponents of collectivism--those who favored capitalism and peace, economic freedom and civil liberties, property rights and states rights--had no name for themselves.<p>
The right term for these political views is "liberal."
But it ' s very difficult for the rightful owners of a word to take
back its meaning while their opponents are using it. After the American Revolution, for example, the centralizers adopted the term "federalists" and called their Jeffersonian opponents "anti-federalists". To this day, the meaning of "federalism"
is ideologically ambiguous. <p>
Rightly defined, liberalism is the view that society should not be centrally controlled, managed, or shaped by government.
Society manages itself, from the bottom up. Consumers, workers, investors, entrepreneurs, parents, and volunteers form 
communities of enterprise and mutual support, while the central
government is not seen, or heard, or felt. <p>
Today the American political landscape is dominated by two 
anti-liberal parties. One loves the welfare state, the other 
loves the warfare state. One wants to stamp out tobacco, the 
other would use the military in the war on drugs.  &lt;p&gt;<BR>
The fullest defense of the liberal society ever penned came 
from Ludwig von Mises in 1927 as  Liberalismus . Only this 
tradition, he said, can save civilization from Nazism, fascism,
communism, socialism, and social democracy. His warning wasn't
heeded, but when the term is reclaimed, Mises's book should be
the platform. <p>
<i>Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., is president of the Ludwig von Mises 
Institute in Auburn, Alabama.</i><p><br>

<h2>Why the District Is Different</h2>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
 <P>
Many taxpayers outside the District of Columbia are saying, "Why is D.C.
getting so much attention and what's all this talk about a flat rate
federal income tax of 15 percent?" After spending nearly two decades as a
District resident and half of that time as a critical observer of
government spending, I admit bias and more than a little pride in my
response, as well as good reasons to move ahead with D.C. Delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton's plan.
<P>
This is, after all, the nation's capitol. Instead of being the butt of
late-night talk show jokes, every patriotic American should be demanding
that the District be the crown jewel of U.S. cities, and the envy of every
world capitol.
<P>
Just try walking the nearly four-mile round trip from the Capitol to the
Washington Monument. It's safe, it's beautiful, and there's nothing like it
in any other city. Tourists marvel at the sights, and despite rumors that
make the District sound like the Wild West, they still visit in droves.
<P>
Even with its inability to address bloated and inefficient government, D.C.
is not particularly large, nor are its problems insurmountable. Bold and
decisive leadership would do the trick. But progress along these lines
still would not address a fundamental fact: The city's population is
declining rapidly. In the first five years of the 1990s, the population
dropped as much as it did in the entire decade from 1980 to 1990. And many
of those leaving were African-American and middle class.
<P>
The Norton plan is simple -- lure people back into the District by lowering
federal taxes. Support for the bill includes House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.), Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.). Bipartisan companion legislation has been introduced
in the Senate by Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Senate Joint
Economic Committee Chairman Connie Mack (R-Fla.). Members of the Maryland
and Virginia delegations are also supportive: Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.)
said it could help the entire region become more prosperous, and Rep. Tom
Davis (R-Va.) is moving forward quickly with hearings before his House
Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on the District of Columbia.
<P>
The opposition to the proposal comes from the traditional proponents of
class warfare (the plan benefits the rich more than the poor), and people
in other cities who want the same deal. House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, seeking a more comprehensive tax reform plan, is not
yet in favor of the Norton bill.
<P>
But Washington is different, and it's well worth the projected annual $700
million in lost revenue to the Treasury. We only need to look at a small
portion of the $160 billion in annual federal spending that my organization
-- Citizens Against Government Waste -- identifies as wasteful spending to
find the necessary offsets.
<P>
For example, Congress could eliminate the Market Access Program ($90
million), the Economic Development Administration ($348 million), the
Advanced Technology Program ($300 million), the Appalachian Regional
Commission ($140 million), and the Strategic Petroleum Reserves ($109
million) and the National Biological Survey ($115 million). These
half-dozen programs total $1.1 billion, more than enough to meet the cost
of this new program.
<P>
The issue is not finding the savings, it's convincing skeptics on Capitol
Hill that it's OK to lose control over hundreds of millions of dollars and
that people in D.C. and people who would want to live in the District --
nearly two-thirds of whom are African-American -- really will know how to
spend the money they save from the tax cut.
<P>
The class warfare argument is specious: Individual taxpayers making $15,000
or less; single head of households at $25,000 or less, and joint filers at
$30,000 or less will pay NO federal tax. That means more than half of D.C.
taxpayers will simply be taken off the rolls. Is there any more direct
manner in which to help and reward hardworking lower income people than to
strengthen their ties to their community?
<P>
For those who continue to pay taxes, but at lower rates, the potential for
creating or expanding business is phenomenal. There are 31,000 sole
proprietorships in the District, meaning they pay the individual income tax
rate. Assuming that a tax of $28,000 (28 percent) on business income of
$100,000 would be reduced to $15,000, that $13,000 would no longer be
diffused throughout the national economy, but would be largely directed at
local spending and investment. The resulting savings is enough to hire a
full-time employee, purchase new equipment, or retire outstanding debt that
will lead to additional business opportunities.
<P>
The kicker in the tax reduction scheme is the elimination of capital gains
taxes for investments in D.C. by District residents. So what would a
<P>
logical person do with their savings? Invest it in local businesses.
<P>
That's what I plan to do -- in fact, I pledge that one-third of the savings
I will obtain from lower taxes will be invested in D.C. businesses, either
directly, or through market opportunities. If every D.C. taxpayer followed
this lead, there would be approximately $233 million (assuming one-third of
the $700 million in revenue lost to the federal government) available for
investment in D.C. Or, if only the richest taxpayers (1994 figures) -- the
4,396 whose income exceeds $200,000 and who paid $600 million, or 35.2
percent of D.C.'s $1.7 billion in taxes -- did the same, there would still
be more than $82 million for city business. Or take the 15,313 returns for
people making more than $100,000 annually. They paid $900 million, or 52.9
percent of 1994 taxes, meaning if they pledged one-third of their savings,
there would be more than $123 million to increase the city's employment and
business base.
<P>
Best of all, that money would not flow through the inefficient hands of the
federal bureaucracy, and it would remain where people know best how to use
it. With what's left over, charitable Washingtonians could support local
nonprofits, the arts, schools, and religion, all of which will be more
direct help to the needy than the federal or local government could ever
provide. And let's not forget what it would mean for this city to have
people wanting to move in, rather than out, of the District. Beyond the
obvious greater tax base, we would enhance the support of institutions that
are key to long-term urban health -- our neighborhoods and our schools.
<P>
All of this may be too logical for the bean counters and those ready to
write off the city's future. But most Americans have a vision of our
nation's Capitol that is rooted in the past and looking to tomorrow. The
Norton plan is the best way to get us all on this hopeful path.

<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                    


     Now that women are attending law schools in greater numbers,
     feminists are turning up as law school professors, law review
     writers, state legislators, congressional staffers, prosecutors,
     law clerks, and even judges. The result is ominous for basic
     concepts of American law and justice, and an excellent policy
     analysis on "feminist jurisprudence" by the Cato Institute
     explains why.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminist goal is not fair treatment for women, but the
     redistribution of power from the "dominant class" (the male
     patriarchal system) to the "subordinate" class (nominally women,
     but actually only the feminists who know how to play by rules
     they have invented). They even want to establish a license for
     women to kill their allegedly abusive spouses.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They have peddled the fiction that men are engaged in a vast
     conspiracy against women, that something like 85 percent of
     employed women are sexually harassed in the workplace, and that
     something on the order of 50 to 70 percent of wives are beaten by
     their husbands. They want to establish the rule that offenses
     against women should be defined (not objectively, but
     subjectively) on the basis of how the woman felt instead of what
     the defendant did.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Before the feminist movement burst on the scene in the 1970s,
     there were literally hundreds of laws that gave advantages or
     protections to women based on society's common sense recognition
     of the facts of life and human nature. These included the
     prohibition against statutory rape, the Mann Act, the obligation
     of the husband to support his wife and provide her with a home,
     special protections for widows (e.g., one state gave widows a
     little property tax exemption, another prescribed triple
     penalties against anyone who cheated a widow), and laws that made
     it a misdemeanor to use obscene or profane language in the
     presence of a woman.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The premier feminist lawyer in the 1970s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
     argued that all such differences of treatment based on gender
     were sex discriminatory and, therefore, should be abolished. She
     won several Supreme Court cases on that theory, and, in state
     after state as well as in Congress, feminist lawyers persuaded
     legislators to gender-neutralize their laws.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In theory, Ginsburg appeared to demand a doctrinaire equality,
     opposing the Mann Act because it "was meant to protect weak women
     from bad men" and that was demeaning to women. But in practice,
     she demanded affirmative action for women even in the military.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists don't even pay lip service to a gender equality
     goal. They have launched a broadside attack on such basic
     precepts as equality under the law, judicial neutrality, a
     defendant is innocent until proven guilty, conviction requires
     proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and guilt or liability should be
     judged according to the traditional "reasonable man" theory.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Female plaintiffs had always been able to sue for unwanted sexual
     overtures in the workplace by using the common-law remedies of
     tort and contract. Feminists reject this remedy because they want
     sexual harassment cases to be based on the notion of a male
     conspiracy to victimize women and that a "hostile work
     environment" is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title
     VII of the Civil Rights Act.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Supreme Court adopted this feminist theory in the 1986 case
     of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, where the Court even went so
     far as to say that "'voluntariness' in the sense of consent" is
     not a defense. These notions had been invented by Michigan Law
     School professor Catharine MacKinnon, who was reported to have
     boasted, "What the decision means is that we made this law up
     from the beginning, and now we've won."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A 1991 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision replaced the
     common-law "reasonable man" standard with a "reasonable woman"
     test, embracing the feminist notion that men and women can't see
     the same events in the same way. The court declared that the old
     common-law standard "systematically ignores the experiences of
     women."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists are demanding the "unreasonable woman" rule.
     The feminists want the victim rather than the law to define the
     offense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In a 1991 Jacksonville, Florida case, a federal district court
     found an employer guilty of a "hostile work environment" even
     though there was no evidence of sexual language or demands
     directed at the plaintiff who claimed she felt sexually harassed.
     The other female workers said they did not feel sexually
     harassed, but the judge said that merely provided "additional
     evidence of victimization."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists are actively promoting college speech codes to
     prohibit what they call discriminatory or harassing speech. They
     argue that it's just as actionable for a man to call a woman
     "honey" or "baby" as to call her a "bitch"; and, of course, jokes
     are not allowed. Nearly 400 colleges and universities have these
     anti-First Amendment speech regulations, about a third of which
     target mere "advocacy of offensive or outrageous viewpoints or
     biased ideas."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists want the battered woman syndrome to free any woman
     from conviction of violent crime. The feminists are even pushing
     the Catharine MacKinnon notion that all heterosexual sex is rape
     unless an affirmative, sober, explicit verbal consent can be
     proven.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They want the action of a battered woman who kills her husband to
     be considered as normal, and that killing a man in his sleep can
     be called self-defense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     More lawyers, scholars and academics are badly needed to speak up
     and expose the feminist foolishness for what it is: a scurrilous
     attack on our Bill of Rights.

<p>
There is a strong tendency for such organizations to be run for the benefit
of those in charge. This has profound implications for those in the agency
and for those they are to serve.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A bureaucracy is a formal organization that derives all or a substantial
portion of its budget from transfers. When the bureaucracy is a government
agency, these exchanges are not made on the basis of mutual consent. I do
not, for example, willingly give the Forest Service money to subsidize
clearcutting in the Gallatin National Forest. It impairs my viewshed, silts
my irrigation system, assaults my ecological and economic sensitivities,
and lowers the value of my property. Unfortunately, we have no choice but
to pay for these programs that reduce both our welfare and our sense of
what is right.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's worse, the Forest Service cannot go bankrupt. Its programs pay off
too many politicians and special interests to prevent this economically
rational and environmentally preferable outcome. Unlike Apple Computer,
the Forest Service can lose money for 95 years and persist. So long as
their programs reward politicians and their political clientele, they can
mix good deeds with genuine plunder.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Governments have no monopoly on bureaucratic organization. Most
corporations have divisions that derive income from transfers within the
company, e.g. public affairs departments. These units, however, are rarely
if ever dominant. Rather, they are subordinate to the divisions that
generate income by selling products to willing buyers. While research and
public affairs departments are bureaucratic in structure, their pathologies
are smaller and their behavior far more responsive to the organization's
mission than that of government agencies. Deviations are constrained by
those who watch the bottom line.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This point is critical to understanding bureaucratic behavior; however
noble and inspired their genesis, bureaucracies are ultimately run for the
benefit of the head bureaucrats and the clientele upon whom they depend.
There is a historical, near gravitational, pull towards this outcome.
Resistance requires intelligence, integrity, and a continuously reinforced
sense of purpose. Few organizations have it.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When public surveillance is difficult, we can expect bureaucracies'
self-serving tendencies to become more pronounced. For instance, although
both have strayed from their alleged purpose, we would expect the CIA to be
more corrupt than the BIA. Fortunately for their leaders, we will never
know.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Returning to the theme of bureaucratic perversities, compare university
parking with that of shopping malls. In malls, employees, including
managers, park not near the entrance but rather in an out-of-the-way,
inconvenient location. The decision-makers who determine parking rules find
it beneficial to reserve the most convenient parking for customers.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, however, central administrators at universities and government
agencies have preferential, often specifically designated parking spots
marked with titles if not names. Even a former university president, driven
from office by gross improprieties if not criminal violations, retained his
preferential parking privileges. The perfidious president preserved his
privileges.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In general, bureaucrats make rules to maximize their convenience and
control over resources. This logic trumps the purpose justifying their
creation. What does it matter if mere professors, those who do the actual
teaching and research and students who pay the tuition, must park in the
dark and slog through seven months of Montana slush if those who
make the rules are spared these costs? A mall based on such privilege would
soon lose business, but rulemakers in universities are insulated from such
pressures.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
None of this is surprising. And it would be as naive to rail against as to
protest gravity, or the preferential treatment of contributors by
politicians. That is the way things work. While this behavior erodes morale
and causes no end of mischief, the costs take many years to accumulate. By
then, the culprits are often retired and on retainer.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In principle, the specific example is trivially easy to fix. Ration the
parking spaces by price. People who enjoy walking can also enjoy parking in
a cheap or free area. Those who are infirmed or busy, pack heavy loads, or
dislike exercise can allocate more of their scarce resources to
preferential parking spaces and cut back on other luxuries. Truly
handicapped individuals can have reserved parking. I've yet to hear a
reasonable objection to this.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this obvious reform be enacted at universities across the land? Such a
reform would require those who now receive preferential treatment at little
cost to pay for their privilege. It was indeed an aberration when Congress
made itself subject to the rules by which the rest of us must live. This
too will erode. For good or bad, it is one of the verities of life that
bureaucracies are run largely for the benefit of the bureaucrats in them.
To expect otherwise is to confuse hopes with expectations.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This essay is dedicated to the faculty and administration of Montana State
University in the hope that I never again have to sit through a dinner
party where conversation is dominated by the subject of on- and off-campus
parking.

Fostering a new west that respects old values
</h2>

John Baden

<p>
New demographics and cultures are defining the next American West.
Newcomers, urban and affluent, are escaping cities to build better lives.
They work with information and manipulate symbols rather than stuff, and
bring with them an utterly different value system for the land. A value
system based on a romantic notion of the West's ecosystems and communities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To them, it is not the commodity, but the amenity values of lands that
matter most-wilderness, open space, fish and wildlife, recreation. They
demand that theirs be the majority voice in protecting those values. Many
locals are resentful.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Change often generates more anger and frustration rather than adaptation
and cooperation. Few newcomers appreciate the skill, tenacity, and hard
labor that traditional Western jobs require. And long-time residents need
to honestly wrestle with the perspectives and ideas of newcomers. Both must
recognize that the West's metamorphosis requires compromise.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fundamental to this negotiation is respect for the underlying qualities and
values that have long defined the West. Here's a story from a recent trip
to Oregon State University, the Vatican of saw log forestry, that frames
the debate for me. I share it to illustrate that as we rush toward a new
West we're in danger of losing more than old-growth and open spaces.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I used to work in the woods. Mainly in the northern Rockies of Montana and
Idaho. I had always wanted to work in the big timber of the Pacific
Northwest, and in 1977, I finally got the chance. On sabbatical leave from
my regular university post, I taught a forest policy course at Oregon State
University. This left plenty of time to work in the woods.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly 20 years later I was back at O.S.U., with my wife Ramona, who had a
few days of meetings. Corvallis now sports Starbucks Coffee, Birkenstocks
and other signs of fundamental change. While Ramona worked with her fellow
academics, I rode my bike. One afternoon, I pedaled the 12 miles to
Lebanon, the town where I lived while working in the Oregon timber. I
wanted to visit the saw shop that kept timber fallers supplied and
maintained. In particular, I wanted to see Ken, the shop owner. Also, I
needed a new saw.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last saw from my days in the woods, my first Husqvarna, recently died.
I had bought it at the Lebanon Saw Shop. It spent its declining years on
our ranch near Bozeman, cutting fence posts and firewood. That's an easy
life for a pro saw, so it lasted a long time.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Peddling into town, I found the shop was in the same place, the storefront
more faded, the front windows more dusty and greasy. It's hard-core, a good
place to find recipes for spotted owl. My Lycra was on trespass in
corked-boot territory. Inside, the rich petroleum smell of 2-cycle exhaust
was the same. The owner, Ken, last saw me when I worked nearby bucking
old-growth Doug fir on Weyerhaeuser land for a contract cutter. He looked
up from his work as I entered.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hi, Ken," I said. "Remember a guy from Montana who came in here around
1977? Wanted leads on a job in the woods, but he could only work three days
a week? You found him a job and later said that you wouldn't have if you'd
known he was professor." I took off my Bolles.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Damn! Hi, John." He grinned and stuck out a calloused hand. We exchanged
news and he told me things were great for business, but for all the wrong
reasons. "With the federal lands shut down, we're selling saws to every
farmer and wood lot owner with a few second and third growth trees," he
said. "Less wood more saws. Not many pros in the woods anymore." He is
looking towards the future. When he gets out of the saw business he'll cut
his retirement, a wood lot he's owned for years. The changing values of the
new West aren't for Ken.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Ken, the last saw I got from you just wore out. Will you send me a new
one? I can't carry it on my bike, and I don't have cash with me," I said,
"but I have a Visa card."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Hell, don't bother. Just send me a check when you get home."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Husqvarna was there when I got back-a bright, new orange saw with an
extra chain, a 6-pack of oil and a black gimme cap that says:
<br>
<center>LEBANON
<center>Saw Shop Lebanon,
<center>Oregon
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I put it on to finish writing this essay. And I thought about trust-about
how relationships built of shared experiences yield trust. Twenty years and
a 900 miles away, I got my new saw on the promises implicit in work
honorably done.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I want to foster a new West that respects these values of the old. Trust
that comes from working together is high on my list. Its presence in my own
life is a recognition that those of us who now work with symbols instead of
stuff have no monopoly on what's worth preserving.

<center><h2>William F. Buckley Jr.</h2></center>
<p>
<p>
<b>Editor-at-Large, National Review</b>
<p>
<p>
William Buckley, the founder of National Review and its 
editor-in-chief until 1990, covers a wide range of political, 
cultural, and economic issues in his syndicated columns, 
which appear in NR, and in articles and reviews written 
specifically for the magazine.  Although he has handed over 
the editorial reins to John OSullivan, he continues as the 
magazines president and editor-at-large, and he produces 
his "Notes & Asides" column each issue.
<p>
Buckley served in the Army during World War II before 
matriculating at Yale University, from which he graduated 
in 1950.  He had published his first two books, "God and 
Man at Yale" and (with L. Brent Bozell) "McCarthy and 
His Enemies," before founding National Review in 1955.  
He began his syndicated column, "On the Right," in 1962, 
and launched his weekly television show, Firing Line, in 
1966; in between, he ran for mayor of New York City in 
1965, and received 13.4% of the vote on the Conservative 
Party ticket.  He has served on the Advisory Commission of 
the United States Information Agency (1969-72), and as 
Public Member of the U.S. Delegation to the UN General 
Assembly (1973).  His 31 books include political analyses, 
sailing books, and the Blackford Oakes spy novels.  He is 
the recipient of numerous awards, including Best Columnist 
of the Year (1967), a Television Emmy for Program 
Achievement (1969), the American Book Award for Best 
Mystery (paperback) for Stained Glass (1980), and the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom (1991).<p>

<h2>
You Figure It Out
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
The most recent objection to the Communications Decency Act was filed 
on Monday by Microsoft, the American Library Association, and the 
Society for Professional Journalists. Their arguments are much the 
same as those of the American Civil Liberties Union filed about eight 
minutes after the bill was signed by President Clinton. And days after 
that, the District Court in Philadelphia estopped enforcement of the 
Act on the grounds that the word &quot;decency&quot; was insufficiently defined. 
Argument will proceed. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here are points to consider in this rerun of the People v. Obscenity, 
in which Obscenity regularly wins.
<ol>
<li>The vote in the House was 414 to 16 in favor of the Act. In the 
Senate, 91 to 5. And of course, President Clinton signed it. That's 
506 out of 527 human beings all of whom swore to uphold the 
Constitution of the United States. Yet learned and experienced men and 
women who oppose the Act merely laugh at any suggestion that they 
actually did believe the Act to be constitutional. Specifically, Ira 
Glasser, the Executive Director of the ACLU, and Susan Estrich, 
Professor of Law at the University of Southern California, who eight 
years ago managed the presidential campaign of Michael Dukakis. What's 
going on here?

<li>By way of background, what sometimes is lumped in under obscenity 
is three categories of material. One is erotica: Literature or art 
intended to arouse sexual desire (American Heritage Dictionary). A 
second is pornography: Pictures, writing, or other material that is 
sexually explicit (AHD). A third is perversity. This is the stuff of 
the Marquis de Sade. 

<li>Perversity is every now and then stopped. A few weeks ago, the 
felony conviction of Robert and Carleen Thomas was upheld. Their gig 
was something called Amateur Action, a computer bulletin board that 
advertised itself as The Nastiest Place on Earth, and featured graphic 
images of children raped by their parents, and other stuff the fingers 
balk at even typing. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the ACLU takes the position that the First Amendment protects any 
&quot;speech.&quot; And indeed it does, but the great swindle of the century has 
been the transmutation of obscenity into &quot;speech.&quot; The absolutists go 
a long way: burning the American flag is a form of speech, they tell 
you. This would be understandable if the person protesting American 
policy were blind and dumb and had available to him to express himself 
on Capitol Hill only a box of matches and a few American flags. This 
is not to say that the lines between erotica and pornography or 
pornography and perversion are clearly drawn, but neither is the line 
clearly drawn that demands &quot;reasonable&quot; compliance with various 
provisions of the law. 

<li>Perspectives change, and they have changed during the past fifty 
years in the direction of promiscuity. In the early Sixties reasonable 
people differed on whether Fanny Hill was obscene (Answer: Of course 
it's obscene, and it's a delight). During the Sixties, Simone de 
Beauvoir was pleading the &quot;right&quot; to read the Marquis de Sade (&quot;Must 
We Burn de Sade?&quot;). So that the question became muddled: Ought works 
of obscenity and even perversion be permitted to exist (i.e., should 
they not be burned?); or, as was the case in France for 175 years, is 
the work of de Sade something that should be kept in the libraries for 
the edification of those whose business it is to probe the forlorn 
atolls of twisted minds?

<li>Leaving us with the Internet. There are obscenity laws that apply 
to television broadcasting, though they are lax; and to radio; and, as 
a matter of fact, to telephone lines. The philosophical postulate here 
is that the air is public property and government has custodial 
responsibilities over that which belongs to the people, who can 
through their representatives define toxicity as more merely than 
particulates emitted by asbestos, or whatever. The Communications 
Decency Act is aimed at protecting children, and prosecutions under it 
are supposed to bear the burden of proving that the smut-merchants had 
every reason to believe that children would be tapping in on their 
product. The lawyers call this scienter, knowingly. But the ACLU is 
correct here that whatever one's hopes for Internet-style V-chips that 
would block out noxious web sites, there can't be any assurance that 
the horny 16-year-old isn't going to succeed in tapping in on that 
stuff.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In which event you may have a law that is unenforceable, but does that 
make it unconstitutional?

<title>Linda Chavez: Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway -- December 11, 1996</title>

<i>December 11, 1996</i><br>     
<h2>Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd><I>BETHESDA, Md.</I> - Maybe California voters ought to stay home next election. In some quarters their votes don't count anyway. 
<P>
<dd>Two years ago, a federal judge stopped the state from enforcing a measure which denied welfare to illegal aliens approved by 60% of California's electorate.  This year on election night, the television networks declared the victor in the presidential election before the polls closed on the West Coast.  And last week, a federal judge overruled a majority of California voters who voted Nov. 5 to end race- and sex-based preferences in state programs. 
<P>
<dd>This latest affront is the most galling, however, because it so grossly insults the intelligence and the decency of the voters. At issue is a ballot measure adopted by 54.5% of the electorate, Proposition 209, which banned both discrimination and preference on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or ethnicity in state employment, education and contracting.  The initiative was modeled on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination. Proponents of race- and sex-based preferences filed suit the morning after the election, alleging that the measure placed an unfair burden on minorities and women and thus violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee that all persons receive equal protection of the laws. 
<P>
<dd>How could a measure that explicitly prohibits discrimination be discriminatory? 
<P>
<dd>How could language that explicitly forbids giving any group preference on the basis of race or sex unfairly disadvantage minorities and women?  Easy, according to the judge who issued a temporary restraining order barring the state from enforcing Proposition 209.  "Courts must look beyond the plain language of an enactment," Judge Thelton E. Henderson declared.  But if we can't trust that the words of our laws mean what they actually say, the whole basis of the rule of law falls apart. Suddenly we are in a world in which a judge can say, like Humpty Dumpty in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, "When I use a word . . . it means just what I choose it to mean, nothing more or less."  All that matters, as Humpty tartly informed Alice, is "(who) is to be master." And lately in our democracy, judges have become masters of us all. 
<P>
<dd>In this case, the judge's own background casts doubt about his impartiality. Before he was appointed by President Carter in 1980, Judge Henderson practiced civil rights law in California and was on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, along with California Rural Legal Assistance, Equal Rights Advocates and
other liberal advocacy organizations. These groups have long argued that it is not discrimination to give preference to some groups so long as they are minorities or women. 
<P>
<dd>By this logic it is not discrimination when Asian and white students must have higher test scores and grades than blacks or Hispanics in order to be admitted to a top university. Discrimination is just what affirmative action proponents say, no more or less. Judge Henderson claims that Proposition 209 places an unfair burden on minorities and women by denying them the right "to petition their state and local officials for race- and gender-conscious programs aimed at remedying discrimination." In fact, most such programs are the result of executive and court orders, not legislative action, anyway. Supporters of affirmative action have been unwilling even to admit that they want preferential, not equal, treatment, much less to put a proposal for those programs to a vote. 
<P>
<dd>Nothing prevents supporters of racial preferences from doing what opponents did: putting their own initiative on the ballot and letting the people decide. They are unlikely to do so, however, because most voters believe that racial preferences are wrong, period. Unlike liberal judges and civil rights groups, most people don't imagine you can end discrimination against one group of people by practicing discrimination against another. Judge Henderson may have trouble interpreting the plain meaning of the Constitution's guarantee that "no state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." 
<P>
<dd>But most of the rest of us, including a majority of California voters, understand that to mean no discrimination and no preferences, just as Proposition 209 promises.

<title>Linda Chavez: Editors, reporters should disclose votes -- November 22, 1996</title>
</head>

<i>November 22, 1996</i><br>     
<h2>Clinton should skip GOP, Arkansans and diversity</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>Administration officials are departing their jobs so rapidly since the election that you'd think the Republicans had won. 

Stepping down so far are the White House chief of staff and secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Energy and Transportation, plus the heads of the president's Council of Economic Advisers and the civil rights division in the Justice Department, to name only the most prominent. 
<dd>Second terms always produce turnover, often because the president wants it, but this mad rush for the door barely two weeks after the president won re-election is a bit unseemly. 
<dd>Whether motivated by fear that the administration will be bogged down in Whitewater and related investigations over the next couple of years or hamstrung in directing policy by the Republican Congress, the Clinton team started to bolt as soon as the ballots were counted. 
<dd>Now the president must spend the next few months trying to reassemble his players. 
<dd>Here are some tips for the president as he makes his picks: 
<ul>
<li>Forget bipartisanship. President Clinton has already announced he'd like to appoint a Republican to his Cabinet, but it's a bad idea for the president and any Republican who might be chosen.<p>Giving a post to a Republican would only further alienate congressional Democrats, and unless the president is thinking of switching parties himself, he'll need to hold his Democratic votes in the next Congress.<p>Besides, the public isn't really fooled when a president of one party picks political appointees of the other. Look at Ronald Reagan's most famous Democratic appointees: U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick and Education Secretary William Bennett.<p>Neither remained in the Democratic Party, and Kirkpatrick became most famous in political circles for referring to Democrats as the "blame-America-first" crowd. (I lasted almost two years as a Reagan Democrat while director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights but switched parties when I moved to the White House.)<p>
<li>Stop bean-counting. The president's obsession in 1993 with choosing a Cabinet that "looks like America" produced a series of embarrassing nominations that he had to abandon. Nonetheless, he's likely to repeat his mistakes if he listens to groups representing women and blacks, who have already been whining that the announced departures will leave the administration less diverse.<p>A coalition of women's organizations complained to Vice President Gore last week that although women gave the Clinton-Gore team a 17-point advantage in their votes, few women were being mentioned for top posts in the next term.<p>They were particularly exercised over remarks attributed to an "unnamed administration source" discounting Clinton U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright as a likely contender for Secretary of State.<p>But Albright probably isn't a good choice for State - and it has nothing to do with her sex. She's been a chief proponent of making U.N. peacekeeping/ peacemaking operations a priority for the Pentagon, as well as of expanding our efforts to include nation-building in places like Somalia and Haiti. With U.S. troops staying in Bosnia for at least another 18 months to promote more political stability, despite Clinton's original promises to have them out before the end of this year, the president would be well advised to avoid promoting to a senior foreign policy post someone who will focus attention on the mission creep in Bosnia. <p>
<li>Avoid naming anyone from Arkansas. Some of the president's most disastrous choices in his first term were political cronies and friends from Arkansas. Several of these left the administration in disgrace, including Hillary Clinton's former law partners Webster Hubbell (now serving time in federal prison for bilking clients) and William Kennedy. 
</ul>
<p>
The president can't afford any more scrutiny of his past dealings and relationships in Arkansas. He already has to worry about the likelihood of more indictments being handed down by the independent counsel investigating Whitewater, the pending Supreme Court hearing on Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit from his time as Arkansas governor, and new investigations into his Arkansas buddy John Huang, whose fund-raising efforts for the president may result in the appointment of yet another independent counsel. 
<dd>Good luck, Mr. President. You'll need it. So may the fools who rush into an administration where angels fear to tread.

<h2>Editors, reporters should disclose votes</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd>BETHESDA, Md. - Whether Tuesday's election results make you mad or glad, there's one thing that should make you worry. 
<dd>One small but immensely powerful group of Americans influenced this election more than all the contributors to all political parties and candidates combined, but they don't have to disclose their influence or make public their political preferences. 
<dd>They are the linchpin of every election, the very source of nearly all the public's information. 
<dd>They are the newspaper, magazine, TV and radio reporters, editors and producers who bring you "the news." They are also arguably the most politically homogenous and biased group in American politics today. 
<dd>If past behavior is any indication, 9 out of 10 reporters and editors probably cast their votes for Bill Clinton and other Democratic candidates Tuesday. 
<dd>At least that's what most studies of voting behavior among the national media suggest, including one by the Freedom Forum last year that showed 89% of national correspondents, editors and writers voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. 
<dd>But voting bias doesn't necessarily prove reporting bias. It's at least theoretically possible that liberal reporters and editors were scrupulous in preventing their own personal bias from affecting their coverage of political issues and candidates during the election. 
<dd>Unfortunately, recent content analysis of TV news coverage indicates otherwise. 
<dd>A study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, a nonpartisan Washington research group, shows that TV coverage overwhelmingly favored President Clinton this election season. 
<dd>In September, Clinton received 54% positive coverage on the networks' evening news programs, compared with only 30% for Bob Dole. 
<dd>The networks criticized Dole's economic views 81% of the time, his social policies 78%, and his conduct as a candidate 81%, according to the center. 
<dd>Ironically, Clinton's worst press in the early fall came when he signed the overwhelmingly popular welfare-reform bill, which the newscasts criticized in 90% of their stories, demonstrating that the media's liberal slant is even worse than their partisan prejudice. 
<dd>Perhaps that is one reason why, although voters think of the media as more liberal than conservative, they don't think the media are partisan Democrats. 
<dd>Can anything be done to curb such bias? 
<dd>Why not insist on full disclosure of the media's voting behavior? 
<dd>The public has a right to know how reporters, editors and others in positions to influence coverage actually vote, just as they already have the right to know who owns media outlets. 
<dd>It's possible to protect reporters' privacy while still informing the public by gathering the information and publishing it anonymously, much the way all survey data are reported. 
<dd>It could work like this: After each election, news organizations would voluntarily distribute surveys to their own staff asking them to identify their party affiliation and if and how they voted in the election. (Measures to protect individual privacy would be necessary, much as they are in mail-ballot elections.) The information then would be published or aired, allowing the public to make up its own mind about whether journalists' views may have influenced their coverage. 
<dd>Some voters might even clip and save the information, the better to judge the media's coverage during subsequent elections. 
<dd>Of course, some journalists would choose not to reveal party affiliation or voter preference, but that, too, could be measured and reported along with the overall results. Readers and viewers would be left to conclude for themselves why some news media staff did not want their political views known. 
<dd>I suspect some editors and producers might even be embarrassed by the political imbalance on their own staffs. A few might even try harder for more balanced coverage as a result. 
<dd>Who knows, a handful of editors and producers might be inspired to hire a conservative or two other than as commentators, the role to which most conservatives are now consigned. 
<dd>Is it really too much to expect members of the press to live up to the same standards of full disclosure they insist on for everyone else? 
<dd>Disclosure wouldn't necessarily eliminate media bias, but at least it would expose it so the public could be more discerning news consumers.

<h2>The clueless voter ought to stay home</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Next week's election is predicted to have one
of the lowest voter turnouts in modern history, which is good news for democracy in America. Oh,
I know it's my civic duty to bemoan voter apathy and urge everyone to vote. But many nonvoters
don't know or care enough about the democratic process to cast intelligent - that is, informed
- votes. Sadly, even some actual voters probably don't know enough about
the candidates or issues to be casting their votes astutely, either. And uninformed voters going
to the polls is even more dangerous than apathetic nonvoters staying home. 
<p>
Who are these uninformed Americans? Nearly half of all adults
can't answer basic questions about U.S. government, much less specifics about issues and officeholders
or candidates, according to a recent study conducted for The Washington Post by Harvard University
and the Kaiser Foundation. The survey, taken about a year ago, found that 40%
of adults couldn't name the vice president, and almost half failed to identify the speaker of the
House. I suspect fewer Americans would flunk these basic questions at the height of a national
election, but ignorance about government itself and policy issues no doubt is just as high.
<p>
For example, nearly half of those surveyed didn't know the U.S. Supreme Court can decide whether
a law is constitutional, and nearly 60% believe that the government spends more on foreign aid than
on Medicare. Although foreign aid is less than 2% of the budget, most Americans believe it accounts
for fully one-quarter of all federal spending. According to the survey, Republicans are better informed than
Democrats, but no group is exempt from ignorance. Traveling around the country, I've certainly encountered
my share of clueless citizens, including one likely Dole voter who probably shouldn't
be voting at all. Although the woman was pleasant, hard working and college educated, she literally
had no idea why she was voting. She told me she really &quot;liked&quot; President Bush and had voted
for him in '92, but she didn't have much of an opinion about either Bob Dole or Bill Clinton. She didn't seem
to know about Dole's tax proposals or where Clinton stood on anything. &quot;I'll probably
vote for Dole because Clinton beat Bush. And I really liked George Bush,&quot; she gushed. 
I've heard other would-be voters say they support Clinton because they like his looks, or the way he
hugs Chelsea, or because it's his generation's turn to govern.
<p>
And they are quite serious. Women seem more disposed to such nonsense than men in my own informal
surveys. And the Harvard/Kaiser study confirms that women - including college-educated
young women - know less about politics than men, but they are more likely to vote. Is
it really healthy for a democracy to encourage poorly informed persons to vote? I don't think so, but
mine seems to be a minority opinion - or at least so impolitic a view that few in public life
are willing to own up to it. Everywhere the next few days we will see and hear indiscriminate
pleas from politicians, the media and civic groups to &quot;get out and vote.&quot; These high-minded
folks would do a greater service by insisting that citizens not vote unless they learn something about
the issues. Democracy entails more than a willing electorate.
<p>
Those who do vote have a responsibility to understand the political process and know something about the issues and candidates before they enter the polling booth. Those who can't be bothered to educate themselves jeopardize democracy with
their ignorance. All of us would be better off if the ill-informed stayed home on Election Day.

<title>Linda Chavez: Belgian outrage, our silence -- October 25, 1996</title>

<h2>Belgian outrage, our silence</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - What would happen in this country if the next
time a child were starved to death or raped or murdered, we decided we weren't ever again going
to allow such a thing to occur without punishing every person who bore some responsibility? 
What if we were to stop working and take to the streets the next time a repeat offender snuffed out
some innocent life? What if hundreds of us were to descend on our local police stations, thousands
of us were to surround our courthouses, hundreds of thousands of us to march to our state capitols
demanding justice? It's hard to imagine, I know. But no harder than envisioning what's happened in
Belgium the past two weeks. 
<P>
In a population less than 5% our own, hundreds of thousands have
filled the streets of cities throughout the country to protest the handling of an investigation
into a child pornography ring that kidnapped, tortured and murdered young Belgian girls. 
In Liege, local firefighters turned their hoses on the courthouse when the Belgian Supreme Court removed the chief investigative magistrate in the case because he attended a dinner for the victims' families. 
Unions staged wildcat strikes throughout the tiny nation. Students occupied the Palace of Justice in Brussels, unfurling signs reading &quot;Justice for Sale.&quot; Even 2,000 rough-looking bikers blocked traffic with their motorcycles, demanding a reinstatement of the death penalty.  And this weekend, 300,000 Belgians gathered in peaceful protest of a justice system gone terribly wrong.  
<p>
What happened in Belgium to spark this massive civil disobedience was the murder of four young girls, two of whom were barely 8 years old, and the disappearance of at least seven more children. 
The man charged with the murders, Marc Dutroux, is a convicted child rapist who served only half
his previous 13-year sentence. He was let go in 1992 when prison social workers and psychiatrists
determined he was no longer a danger. Within one year, little girls started disappearing. Even Dutroux's own mother twice tried to turn him into the police, but he was not arrested until August when police rescued two young women who were being held in his cellar. Now, a dozen others have been arrested for their involvement in the child pornography ring, suspected of videotaping the girls' sexual abuse and torture. 
<p>
These revelations have been enough to bring Belgium to a standstill.
But can we Americans imagine any crime so heinous that we would respond similarly, with genuine
moral indignation at the failure of the U.S. justice system to punish criminals and protect the innocent?
Each year it seems some sadistic lunatic out on parole slaughters a child somewhere in
the United States. 
<p>
The list of recent atrocities is long; still, a few stand out: Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old
kidnapped, raped and murdered by an already convicted rapist. A 6-year-old boy in Washington
state kidnapped, sodomized and sexually mutilated by another demon let loose days earlier. Seven-year-old
Megan Kanka murdered by a convicted child molester who lived on her street. 
<p>
We have become inured to the kinds of horrors that have rallied
the Belgians. But who is to say whether we might put an end to such outrages here if we were to
follow the Belgians' example? Belgium's King Albert II said in a rare public speech last week
that the tragedy of the young girls' murders &quot;must become an occasion for moral renewal and for
profound change in the country.&quot; If only we would do the same. Yet we sit passively by as each new abomination unfolds. In New York, one child is starved, another beaten to death - both by their own mothers' hands. Social workers, obliged to visit these welfare mothers once a year, had failed in their duty, and twice
in barely one year babies died. Still others are murdered by their mothers' boyfriends, sometimes after years of sexual and physical abuse. 
<p>
The best we can muster by way of national examination is a Nightline episode. Most of the
time it's just an afternoon talk show.  
<p>
If tiny Belgium can turn out 300,000 people to mourn the deaths
of a dozen innocent children, why aren't there an equivalent 6 million Americans who would do the
same for the hundreds of children who die in similar circumstances here?

   BETHESDA, Md. -- A year ago, it looked like affirmative action
would be the hot topic of the '96 campaign. Today the issue has
disappeared from the radar screen, except in California where
voters will decide whether to ban state-sponsored preferences
in a ballot initiative known as Proposition 209. The pro-quota
side is nervous enough about the outcome to be running one of
the most dishonest campaigns in recent history, employing a bag
of dirty tricks more suited to an old Soviet KGB disinformation
operation than a democratic election.

<p>
In the most recent outrage, the anti-209 forces invited Klansman
David Duke to argue for the measure in a public debate today at
California State University in Northridge. The organizers said
they couldn't find anyone else to take the pro-209 position. The
real story is that once organizers had secured Duke's participation,
no reputable person would appear with him.
<p>
   Inviting Duke was a clever ploy meant to intimidate Proposition
209 supporters. Debate organizers want voters to believe anyone
who opposes race-based preferences must be a KKK sympathizer.
That's a lie, and they know it.
<p>
   But lies appear to be the stock in trade of the anti-209 campaign.
On Friday someone sent a fake "letter of appreciation" supposedly
from Duke to Ward Connerly, a businessman who chairs the group
that put Proposition 209 on the ballot. The letter thanks Connerly
for his "financial contribution" to Duke's losing Senate race
(he came in fifth in Saturday's primary in Louisiana). No doubt
the creeps who forged the phony Duke letter thought it was particularly
clever to send it to Connerly, who is black. Of course Connerly,
who abhors everything Duke stands for, has never made any political
contribution to Duke. In fact, the real money going to Duke comes
from Cal State Northridge, which is paying him $ 4,000 to participate
in today's debate.
<p>
   Another highlight of the anti-209 campaign is a graphic appearing
in fliers and some publications showing a burning cross with the
caption "Unidentified CCRI supporters celebrate the recent advances
in their struggle for civil rights."
<p>
   Why are the anti-209 groups using such dirty tactics? Because
they are desperate to deflect attention from the real issue of
preferences, which are overwhelmingly unpopular. Most polls show
more than two-thirds of Americans oppose racial quotas, set-asides
and preferences. Even with the nasty and well-funded campaign
against Proposition 209, the measure still holds a 17-point lead
among likely California voters.
<P>
   It's no wonder Proposition 209 remains popular. The measure bans
both discrimination and preferences on the basis of race, sex
or national origin in state employment, education and contracting.
What could be more fair?
<p>
It's too bad Republicans abandoned efforts to make race and gender
preferences a campaign issue nationwide. Barely more than a year
ago, Bob Dole was leading the fight to ban preferences in federal
programs, and even President Clinton was promising to "mend"
affirmative action. But Republicans got cold feet and have since
dropped their legislative efforts to ban preferences. And Clinton
has actually extended affirmative action programs, not "mended"
them as he pledged.
<P>
But perhaps politicians' reticence to take on preferences is understandable, 
given the tenor of the debate in California.
<p>
It's more difficult to intimidate millions of voters, however.
I'm betting that when Californians go to the polls Nov. 5, they
will remember the David Duke incident. We'll see then why such
chicanery rarely pays off in an election.<P><P>

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - The Spanish have a phrase for it: sin verguenza. It means without shame, and
it's no compliment. It could become the motto of our age, exemplified most recently by Dick Morris,
the president's strategist who resigned after a tabloid published pictures of him at a hotel with a
prostitute. <P>

Instead of retreating from the media spotlight when his antics with a $200-an-hour call girl became
public, Morris is actually looking for new ways to expose himself. And he's snared a breathless
media eager to help. Time magazine has already turned over its cover (for the second week in a
row) to a shameless Morris, pictured with his betrayed wife hovering grim-faced behind him. Inside,
Morris exploits the opportunity to take credit for Bill Clinton's political comeback. And Random
House has given Morris a $2.5 million book deal for more of the same. 
<P>
Expect no apology from Dick Morris. But then, why should he bother? Not even his wife seems to
expect one. After the story broke, the president called Morris to commiserate with his friend and
image maker, as did Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. A little moral outrage would have been more
appropriate - if not for Morris' indecent conduct, then for jeopardizing the Clinton campaign by
entertaining a prostitute in a hotel room paid for by campaign funds. 
<P>
But moral outrage is unfashionable today, reserved only for those who commit the last universally
recognized sin in our culture: hypocrisy. And Morris is no hypocrite, which requires at least a
semblance of adherence to some moral or ethical code. The lesson is you can get away with
anything, becoming richer and more famous in the process, so long as you are completely amoral to
begin with. 
<P>
It wasn't always so. There was a time when anyone in Morris' position would have been deeply
mortified at being caught in such a sordid liaison. And even if the miscreant felt no inward remorse,
he would still have been shunned by his peers. 
<P>
No such punishment awaits Morris, whose hubris reflects more than his own arrogance. As a
society, we've become inured to shame. Nothing shocks us. Millions tune in to an endless parade of
vice and weirdness on daytime television. The more salacious the details, the greater the celebrity.
We glorify violence in music and films. We idolize foul-mouthed entertainers and transvestite sports
figures. We re-elect public officials caught smoking crack cocaine and seducing boys. 
<P>
Is it any wonder so many social institutions are disintegrating and our streets are unsafe? Without a
sense of what is shameful in our own lives and others', we deny ourselves the capacity to make
social judgments. Deviancy has no meaning unless we can measure behavior against some common
standard. 
<P>
A few years ago, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) wrote a brilliant essay in The Public
Interest which described the social deterioration occurring, from rising out-of-wedlock births to
skyrocketing crime. Much of the problem stemmed, he said, from a phenomenon he dubbed
"defining deviancy down." In other words, so lowering our standards about what is proper that what
once would have been considered deviant behavior has become merely individual choice. 
<P>
In fact, the situation is worse than Moynihan described. We've not only done away with concepts of
right and wrong, but we've also begun to heap huge rewards on those whose actions would once
have made them pariahs. Why should Dick Morris be ashamed of himself when so many of us are
eager to shower him with fame and fortune?<P><P>

<h2>Promises Don't Help Kids Read</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. - Four years ago when running for president the first 
time, Bill Clinton promised to overhaul the nation's education system 
from kindergarten through 12th grade in his campaign manifesto, 
Putting People First. Given his disastrous attempt at overhauling the 
country's health-care system, perhaps we can be thankful he didn't 
manage to come up with an education plan once he assumed office. But 
it's re-election time, and once again candidate Clinton is an 
education reformer. <p>

Last week, the president promised an assault on illiteracy, pledging 
$1.75 billion for new programs to ensure that every American child can 
read by third grade. Sounds great, but aren't public schools supposed 
to teach kids to read already? The United States spends more on public 
education than almost any other nation - more than $240 billion a year 
for elementary and secondary schools in 1994. That's $5,300 per 
student. If schools have failed to teach kids how to read by third 
grade, how will adding less than 1% more money solve the problem? <p>

By the president's own admission, 40% of fourth-grade students fail to 
meet basic reading standards. And money isn't the problem. In 1980, 
the U.S. was spending less than $3,900 per student. Yet the reading 
proficiency of average 9-year-olds was actually higher than it is now, 
according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress. <p>

What happened? Bob Dole blames the teachers unions, and they certainly 
share a good deal of blame. The 2.2 million-member National Education 
Association has supported every education fad that has come down the 
pike, so long as it was sufficiently multicultural and politically 
correct. The much smaller American Federation of Teachers, with only 
about 900,000 members, has a far better record on education issues, 
and its president, Albert Shanker, has been a thoughtful exponent of 
education reform. <p>

Nonetheless, both the NEA and the AFT have become well-financed 
political lobbies for liberal causes. The NEA alone raised $6.5 
million in 1992 and spent $2.3 million on congressional candidates, 
almost all Democrats. The only thing that really matters to the 
teachers unions is whether candidates support increased spending on 
education. <p>

Much of that money doesn't even go to teachers' salaries, much less 
directly into the classroom. American public education has become a 
giant, bloated bureaucracy, with school systems top-heavy with 
administrative staff who never set foot in a classroom. <p>

By contrast, Catholic schools, which educate 2.6 million students a 
year, produce better results with a fraction of the money. Catholic 
schools spend about $2,800 per pupil, around half what public schools 
do, but Catholic students outperform their public school peers, 
especially in comparisons between poor minority students from both 
groups. <p>

If Clinton were really interested in improving reading levels of 
America's poor children, he'd give them the same opportunity he gives 
his own: the chance to go to the school of her choice, in Chelsea's 
case the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington, D.C. The 
Clintons can afford Sidwell Friends' pricey tuition, but most middle-
class, much less poor, parents can't pay private-school tuition and 
pay taxes for public school, too. <p>

During the last election, Peter Brimelow reported in Forbes, candidate 
Clinton told the NEA, "If I become president, you'll be my partners. I 
won't forget who brought me to the White House." That's one promise 
President Clinton has kept, but it won't help kids learn how to read. <p>

<title>Linda Chavez: Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces -- August 28, 1996</title>

<h2>Dems' Use Of 'E-Word' Flies In Their Faces</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>

BETHESDA, Md. - The Democrats are using the "e-word" a lot this week, 
trying to paint Bob Dole and the Republican Congress as extremists. 
But a close look at the Democrats' platform and the delegates 
themselves suggests it's the Democratic Party that represents some 
political extremes. From a balanced-budget amendment to welfare 
reform, the Democrats in Chicago are out of step with the American 
public. <p>

According to a Washington Post/ABC poll, 82% of registered voters 
favor a balanced-budget amendment, but only 32% of Democratic 
delegates agree. Perhaps that's why the Democratic platform is silent 
on the issue. After all, it might be embarrassing to mention a measure 
that 162 Democrats in Congress voted against in 1995, dooming the 
amendment in the 104th Congress. <p>

The survey also showed that 82% of Democratic delegates favor 
affirmative action programs that give preferences to minorities and 
women. But most other Americans oppose race or gender preferences. The 
Washington Post/ABC poll showed registered voters as a whole oppose 
race and gender preferences by a margin of 52% to 45%, but polls of 
the general public show even greater opposition. A 1995 poll by the 
Los Angeles Times showed 73% of Americans favor legislation to outlaw 
preferential hiring by race or sex. <p>

But it's not surprising the Democratic delegates favor preferences and 
quotas, since they were chosen under party rules that set strict 
racial and gender quotas. Each state delegation must reflect the 
racial and ethnic breakdown of Democratic voters in the last election 
and include equal numbers of men and women. <p>

President Clinton just signed the Republican welfare-reform bill last 
week, but his own delegates don't think much of "ending welfare as we 
know it." The Washington Post/ABC poll shows only 38% of delegates 
support a five-year limit on welfare benefits, something 73% of all 
registered voters favor. The Democratic platform doesn't mention 
specific time limits, except to say who should be exempted from them. <p>

Speaking of exemptions, apparently the Clinton administration has a 
lot of welfare-reform exemptions up its sleeve if Clinton is re-
elected. Vice President Gore suggested Sunday on This Week with David 
Brinkley that the president doesn't really intend to implement the 
bill he just signed. Gore said the president will use whatever means 
available - including the line-item veto - to excise parts of the 
welfare-reform bill he doesn't like. So much for democratic process. <p>

Even on abortion, an issue that seems to plague Republicans every four 
years, the Democrats are hardly in the mainstream of public opinion - 
though you won't hear the media talk much about it this week. Democrat 
delegates are overwhelmingly pro-choice, and the party platform spells 
out an unrestricted "right of every woman to choose, consistent with 
Roe vs. Wade, and regardless of ability to pay." <p>

But Americans favor a much more limited right to choose abortion than 
the Democrats' position. Most Americans favor some legal restrictions 
on abortion: 74% favor mandatory 24-hour waiting periods, and 74% 
support parental consent and 70% spousal notification laws. Although 
the president recently vetoed a bill to ban partial-birth abortions 
except to save a mother's life, 71% of Americans oppose the procedure, 
which involves partially delivering a 20- to 26-week fetus feet first 
and inserting a surgical scissors into the skull to remove the brain. 
One of the most comprehensive surveys of American opinion on abortion 
and moral beliefs, done by the Gallup organization in 1991, showed 
that 73% of Americans support a prohibition of abortion after the 
first three months of pregnancy for any reason except to save the life 
of the mother. And more than 80% oppose government funding of 
abortion. <p>

The Democrats will continue to try to paint themselves as moderates 
and the Republicans as extremists through the election. They think if 
they say it often enough, maybe the country will believe them. I'm 
betting Americans are a lot smarter than that.<p>

<title>Linda Chavez: Perot's Legacy May Be Helping To Elect Clinton Twice -- August 21, 1996</title>

<h2>Perot's Legacy May Be Helping To Elect Clinton Twice</h2>     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>


BETHESDA, Md. - Despite his quirkiness, Ross Perot has done some 
pretty impressive things in his lifetime, not the least winning nearly 
20 million votes in the 1992 presidential election. But if he persists 
in his quixotic quest for the White House this year, he may well be 
remembered only as the man responsible for twice electing Bill Clinton 
president. <p>

Polls suggest Perot won't garner nearly as many votes this time 
around. But if Perot pulls even 2% or 3% of the vote, his role could 
be decisive in a close election, as this one promises to be. White 
House aides claim they believe Perot hurts President Clinton as much 
as he does Bob Dole. (And if you believe that one, they have some land 
parcels on the Whitewater River they'd like to sell you.) <p>

In fact, Perot draws his support mostly from independent and 
Republican voters. In 1992, Perot won only 13% of Democrats' votes but 
30% of independents' and 17% of Republicans' votes. And 20% of his 
1992 voters had voted for George Bush in 1988. Maybe it's time Ross 
Perot - and his remaining supporters - rethink what they want to 
accomplish in 1996. <p>

Here are a few questions they should ask themselves. <p>

Do you really want to balance the budget? Republicans have already 
proved they can balance the budget - they passed a five-year balanced 
budget last December. But President Clinton vetoed it. And Clinton 
still can't decide when he'll produce a balanced budget. One day it's 
nine years, another day it's seven, and still another he says maybe he 
can do it in five. <p>

Do you believe the country needs to rein in entitlements? The 
Republicans offered genuine entitlement reform last year, but the 
Democrats did their best to nix it. First, Democrats - including the 
president - demagogued Medicare reform, needlessly and recklessly 
trying to scare the elderly. Then the president twice vetoed welfare 
reform despite having promised "to end welfare as we know it." The 
president is expected to sign a Republican-passed welfare-reform bill 
this week, but only because he knows he can't possibly be re-elected 
if he doesn't. <p>

lDo you still care about reforming government? Republicans in the 
104th Congress passed the most sweeping government-reform legislation 
since the civil service reforms 100 years ago. For the first time, 
laws that apply to ordinary citizens and employers now apply to 
members of Congress. The Democrats controlled Congress for more than 
40 years, exempting themselves from all the employment laws they were 
happy to inflict on others. The Republicans quickly ended that 
practice once they gained control of both houses of Congress in 1994. <p>

Which is the real reform party in America? The Democrats have said 
"no" to Medicare reform, Medicaid reform, welfare reform, lawsuit 
reform, and term limits. Meanwhile, the Reform Party can't even get 
its own members to participate in choosing the party's presidential 
nominee. Fewer than 5% cast ballots either in the nominating process 
or in selecting the candidate. Perhaps the Reform Party ought to get 
its own house in order before it tries tackling the whole government. <p>

That leaves one party and one presidential nominee for reform-minded 
voters: Republican Bob Dole. If Ross Perot and his supporters truly 
want change this year, they'll stop playing spoilers. Last time 
around, Perot spent $60 million on his campaign. This time he's not 
even willing to risk his own money, asking his supporters to pony up 
so he can receive $30 million in federal campaign funds instead. <p>

Re-electing Bill Clinton won't change politics as usual, won't end 
gridlock, won't make government work more efficiently - all reasons 
Perot says he's running. But the numbers just aren't there. Perot 
can't win, and surely even he knows it this time. It's hard to believe 
Perot wants his legacy to be a second term for Bill Clinton. But if he 
insists on staying in the race until November, he may succeed in 
ensuring just that.<p>

<title>Chavez: GOP Gender Gap Simply "Hogwash"  -- 8/14/96 </title>

GOP Gender Gap Simply "Hogwash"
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
SAN DIEGO - Here's a political quiz: Which political party has 
suffered from a "gender gap" in voting during the last several 
presidential elections? If you answered "the Republicans," you get an 
"A" for reading the newspapers and watching the evening news -- but 
you flunk the test.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, in three out of the last four elections, it has been the 
Democrats who have actually been hurt by the gender gap. Democrats 
lost those elections because they did so poorly among male voters. In 
1984, Democrat Walter Mondale trailed Republican President Ronald 
Reagan by 25 points among men. And in 1988, Democrat Michael Dukakis 
got 16% fewer male votes than Republican George Bush. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Their losses had little to do with female voters. But the media have 
been relatively uninterested over the years in why men are less likely 
to vote Democratic, while they've been obsessed with the supposed GOP 
gender gap among women.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year is no different. Expect to read countless stories and hear 
endless explanations this election season why Bob Dole can't win 
women's votes. And most of it will be hogwash -- or wishful thinking 
on the part of reporters and pundits, most of whom w ill probably be 
voting Democratic themselves in November. (In 1992, 89% of Washington-
based reporters and editors voted for Bill Clinton, according to a 
poll by the Freedom Forum, a media think tank.)
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the favorite explanations of why women won't vote Republican 
this year is the party's position on abortion. The Republican Party's 
strong anti-abortion stance is supposed to be a huge barrier to 
winning women's votes. But, in fact, polls show that  abortion has 
little to do with how women cast their votes.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/Gallup Poll showed only 1 in 5 female voters 
say the candidate they support must share exactly their own position 
on abortion. And of these women, slightly more than half are actually 
pro-life, so at best it's a wash. Abortion ranke d 10th out of the top 
12 most important issues to women in this poll, and about one-third 
said abortion was not at all important in determining how they would 
vote.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Like men, women care most about the economy when it comes time to pick 
a president. Which is good news for Bob Dole. He has certainly shown 
this past week that he intends to make the economy his No. 1 issue -- 
first with his tax-cut proposal and then with  his selection of Jack 
Kemp to be his running mate.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both actions should have real appeal for female voters. Kemp's brand 
of compassionate conservatism and his exuberant political style will 
resonate with women who may be turned off by doom-and-gloom talk of 
budget deficits and harsh rhetoric about slashing government spending.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most importantly, Dole's proposed 15% across-the-board tax cut, 
coupled with an extra $500 tax deduction for each child under 18, will 
mean real savings to families. Many middle-income voters with young 
children would see their federal income-tax bill red uced by half if 
Dole has his way. Most opinion polls show that working mothers would 
prefer to work fewer hours outside the home. Allowing families to keep 
more of their earnings could give many mothers the option to work less 
or to use their tax savings  to buy a home, put toward their 
children's college education, or save for their own retirement. Dole 
is proposing real choice for women -- the choice to determine their 
own economic futures. 
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the Democrats who want to limit women's choices. The Democrats 
would rather let government decide how to spend working women's money 
than allow women to choose how to spend it themselves.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The last time Americans got a tax break -- when President Reagan twice 
reduced tax rates, in 1981 and 1986 -- the economy boomed. Growth 
averaged about 4% a year during Reagan's tenure, resulting in the 
longest period of economic expansion since World War  II. What's more, 
women's earnings grew faster during the 1980s than at any time in 
recent history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But don't expect the media to remind voters of these economic facts 
between now and Election Day. They'll be too busy reporting the so-
called GOP gender gap.

<h2>
We're Becoming A Nation Of Crybabies
</h2>

</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- Working for the federal government, which has never 
been a barrel of laughs, is about to get even less humorous. Last 
month, a Social Security Administration official told a sexist joke at 
an agency conference, and now charges are flying that the agency is 
riddled with sex discrimination. The only twist in this increasingly 
familiar charge is that the joke-teller was a woman and the butt of 
the joke was men. Now several men at the agency are claiming that a 
"hostile work environment" exists -- code words for sexual harassment 
-- which could signal discrimination complaints, lawsuits and wasted 
taxpayer dollars ahead.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many charges involving sexual harassment, the facts of this 
case aren't in dispute. Ruth Pierce, deputy commissioner for human 
resources and director of equal employment opportunity at the Social 
Security Administration, told the joke to participants in a diversity 
workshop in Miami.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to The Washington Post, which reported the story on its 
front page, the joke involved a mermaid and a fisherman whose wish was 
to become five times smarter. The mermaid granted the fisherman's wish 
by turning him into a woman. Not exactly a knee slapper as jokes go, 
but it elicited enough laughs from the mostly female listeners to send 
audience member John Boyer into quite a snit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer heads an informal group called Government Men for Equality Now 
(GMEN) and alleges the Social Security Administration is dominated by 
women and rife with anti-male prejudice. Now he's hoping to turn 
Pierce's joke into a federal case, demanding that Pierce apologize to 
all 65,000 agency employees and be demoted from her current post.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boyer's complaint itself might be laughable if the federal government 
weren't such a bastion of the double standard. If Pierce were a man 
telling a predominantly male audience a joke poking fun at women's 
intelligence, the government's political-correctness squad would 
already be on the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar circumstances at a Coast Guard dinner in 1995 led not only to 
months of investigation, but also to enormous human suffering. Capt. 
Ernie Blanchard, a career veteran of the Coast Guard with an 
impeccable record, told a few barely off-color jokes at a dinner 
honoring cadets and became the focus of an official investigation that 
ultimately resulted in an 800-page report. Informed that his career 
was in jeopardy and that he might lose his pension, spelling financial 
ruin for his family, Blanchard killed himself before the investigation 
was complete.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even if the Coast Guard incident had not ended so tragically with 
Blanchard's death, it would still be a travesty. No government career 
should be extinguished for a one-time lapse in taste before an adult 
audience.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But ever since the courts started interpreting a "hostile work 
environment" to constitute sexual harassment, bad taste has become a 
federal offense. With men so often the targets of such witch hunts, 
it's no surprise a few, like John Boyer, strike back.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the answer to this nonsense is not for more men to claim that 
they, too, are victims of sexual harassment because someone tells a 
meaningless joke. We are becoming a nation of crybabies who can 
respond to others' ridiculous behavior only by engaging in more of the 
same.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1994, the last year for which figures are available, federal 
workers filed nearly 12,000 harassment complaints -- more than in any 
other single category of alleged discrimination.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With warm-up jokes and after-dinner entertainment now fair game for 
such charges, that number will no doubt climb. American taxpayers, who 
foot the bill for such silliness, surely aren't laughing.

<p>
SAPELLO, N.M. -- The night is cool atop Star Hill, east of the Sangre 
de Cristo mountains in northern New Mexico. Nearby a herd of longhorn 
cattle and a few scattered buffalo have settled in for the night. 
Earlier in the day, I observed a coyote stalking the cattle from the 
crest of a hill, and a Swainson's hawk perched on the barbed-wire 
fence.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the thrill of seeing these creatures will soon pale as Phil Mahon, 
our host at Star Hill resort, introduces my husband and me to his 
celestial delights.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Until now, neither of us has anything but a passing interest in 
astronomy. As lifelong city residents, we rarely enjoy star-studded 
nights apart from an occasional country get-away where we can escape 
both the city lights that obscure the stars from view and the 
preoccupations that cause us not to look. Now, on an impulse we're 
here at this amateur astronomers' retreat, hoping to expand our 
horizons.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mahon, a somewhat taciturn guide, types instructions into a laptop 
computer attached to a 14-inch Compustar telescope, and the machine 
whirs into action, rotating on its pedestal until it comes to rest 
pointed at the Southern sky. Through the lens we see not only Jupiter 
and its red bands, but also four of its 16 moons. For the next hour, 
Mahon treats us to stars, pulsars, nebulae and galaxies, objects as 
close as 21/2 or as distant as 150 million light years away.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nearly all of the dozen sites we view have been familiar territory to 
astronomers for more than 200 years, since the French astronomer 
Charles Messier (1730-1817) first cataloged 68 celestial objects, 
including our neighboring galaxy, Andromeda. Still, the experience is 
awe-inspiring, putting daily obsessions into perspective. For a while 
at least, public policy, the culture wars, the federal deficit and 
politics fade.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not for long. As I look through the telescope, I wonder whether as 
a nation we will continue to explore this vast universe. Even as our 
knowledge increases at almost exponential rates, it seems our national 
desire and will to learn more are on the wane. NASA's budget is $ 14 
billion this year but will drop to a projected $ 11 billion by 2000.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1990s have seen dramatic swings in our space commitments. The 
decade was ushered in with great fanfare in 1991 with the announcement 
of Project Columbus, a $ 100 million joint venture between NASA and a 
private astronomy institute to search for intelligent life in the 
universe. One year later, the Senate canceled funding with derisive 
comments about little green men.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, funding for the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or 
SETI as it is known, has been fickle throughout the history of the 
program. Since 1960, SETI has involved some 50 separate programs, 
initially with federal backing but more recently privately funded.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This year, interest is up again with the discovery in January by 
astronomers Paul Butler and Geoffrey Marcy of the first two planets 
outside our solar system. Announced earlier this year, NASA's new 
Origins project will build powerful new telescopes over the next 30 
years capable of actually seeing planets such as those discovered by 
Butler and Marcy. They could only infer the planets' existence from 
complex measurements of light emissions of the stars 47 Ursae and 70 
Virginis, around which the planets orbit.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least that's NASA's hope, if the project receives full federal 
backing. It's a big if. With so many earthly demands on the federal 
budget, the exploration of our universe sometimes seems a luxury we 
can't afford.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This starry night, from my vantage point in New Mexico's hills, the 
investment is worth it.

<h2>
New Citizens Getting Off Too Easily
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>BETHESDA, Md. -- This July Fourth, 1.2 million more new citizens will 
be celebrating Independence Day than last year. Naturalization was way 
up in 1995, more than double the 1994 rate and five times the rate 
experienced throughout the 1980s.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As an unabashed admirer of immigrants' initiative and grit, I'd 
normally welcome this surge in new citizenship. But unfortunately, 
politics -- not patriotism -- may explain this sudden spurt in 
naturalization. The Clinton administration has been quietly moving to 
water down citizenship requirements in ways that could ultimately 
damage the Americanization process.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike many nations that jealously guard access to citizenship, the 
United States makes it relatively easy. Permanent residents must wait 
five years before they apply for naturalization. By law, they must 
demonstrate they can speak, read and write simple words and phrases in 
English and that they know basics about American history and 
government. They must also be law-abiding and of good character.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Though the modest commitments are hardly onerous, the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service is considering exempting whole classes of 
immigrants from them. Among the proposals the INS is reportedly 
weighing is one to exempt immigrants who've completed high school in 
the U.S. from being tested on American history and government or from 
having to demonstrate knowledge of English.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, a high school degree today is no guarantee that a 
student knows much U.S. history or government. It isn't even an 
assurance that a student knows English. Foreign-born high school 
students in New York, for example, can take state graduation exams in 
their native language if they entered American public school after 
eighth grade. And many public school systems across the country seem 
more concerned about preserving immigrants' native language and 
culture than about helping them learn English or American history.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's behind the administration's efforts to weaken naturalization 
requirements? Some critics suspect politics. Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., 
has pointedly asked INS Commissioner Doris Meissner whether the 
administration is trying to increase the number of potential 
Democratic voters before the November presidential election.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But partisan politics isn't the most serious concern. The real threat 
is weakening national identity. As John J. Miller points out in a 
recent article in Policy Review, "Naturalization is the only legal 
instrument that allows the United States -- a 'nation of immigrants' -
- to decide who is an American and who is not. Without it, the 
cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Founding Fathers understood the potential for mischief if 
citizenship were obtained too easily, Miller notes. Alexander Hamilton 
urged that immigrants be drawn gradually into American civil society 
"to enable aliens to get rid of foreign and acquire American 
attachments." Indeed, the oath of citizenship pledges the naturalized 
citizen to "renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any 
foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty" and to "support and 
defend the Constitution and the laws o
f the United States of America."
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Miller suggests what's needed now is a modern-day Americanization 
Movement. During the last great wave of immigration, from 1900 to 
1924, both public schools and private philanthropic organizations, 
such as Jane Addams' famous settlement houses, helped acculturate 
millions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This commitment is sorely lacking today. Immigrant advocacy groups 
focus almost exclusively on immigrant rights, with little attention to 
immigrant responsibilities. If America is to continue to be an 
immigrant nation, there must be a covenant between America and its 
newcomers. Learning the national language and the nation's history and 
form of government are the least we should require from those who wish 
to become Americans.

FBI Files: Look What I Found in Mine

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Wonder what all the fuss over the Clinton White House 
requisitioning FBI files on former Republican officials is about? As 
someone who has seen my own FBI file, I can tell you there's plenty of 
cause for alarm. FBI files contain not only private and sometimes 
embarrassing information, but also some things that are downright 
false.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1983, President Reagan appointed me staff director of the U.S. 
Commission on Civil Rights, a post that required what's called a full-
field investigation in preparation for Senate confirmation. The 
investigation took many weeks to complete and included interviews with 
my employers, colleagues, friends, neighbors, schoolmates and 
virtually anyone else who might have known me over the years. Most of 
the information the FBI obtained was innocuous and accurate. But not 
everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Years later, when I obtained my file through a Freedom of Information 
request, I was surprised to learn the document contained not only an 
occasional unflattering description but also outright misinformation 
about me and my family. In one case, a former neighbor said she 
couldn't say whether I might be a national security risk, an answer 
bound to provoke greater scrutiny. The FBI had no way of knowing I had 
reported this woman for leaving her young child locked out of the 
house alone and unfed until 1 a.m., which no doubt accounted for her 
opinion of my trustworthiness.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In another interview, a former supervisor claimed to have fired me 
from a Democratic National Committee (DNC) job I held in my early 20s. 
Being fired from the DNC could be considered a badge of honor for a 
Republican nominee, but the charge was untrue. My supervisor, a 
political rival, may have wanted to fire me, but she actually left her 
job slightly before I quit mine.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The most outrageous material in my file, however, had nothing to do 
with me.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the name itself was blacked out to protect the person's 
identity, one series of entries contained information that appeared 
from their context to be about my father. I nearly fainted when I read 
the entry, which referred to an arrest for a violent crime. Then I 
noticed the date of arrest was after my father's death, and shock 
turned into anger. Derogatory information about someone who happened 
to share my father's name found its way into my FBI file, violating 
that person's privacy and besmirching my father's reputation.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As far as I know, my file was not among those the Clinton White House 
requested. Nonetheless, I'm outraged to learn that friends, colleagues 
and at least one person who worked for me in the Reagan White House 
are among those whose files were obtained.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton operatives -- no one yet knows exactly how many - procured and 
read at least 408 Republican appointees' files. How many of these 
files had egregious errors in them? How many more had malicious 
gossip? How many simply contained embarrassing private
 information that should remain secret? And what did these Clinton 
appointees do with that information?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton has dismissed this incredible invasion of privacy as 
a "bureaucratic snafu" and has declined to punish the known 
perpetrators. Craig Livingstone, the former director of White House 
security under whose direction the FBI files were obtained, remains on 
the White House payroll. Anthony Marceca, whom Livingstone recruited

protected from immediate firing by civil service laws -- but 
Livingstone, a presidential appointee, is not. Even Democrats have 
asked Clinton to fire Livingstone, but the president refuses.

Such total arrogance of power should give Americans pause.

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Want proof we've abandoned all pretense of a civil 
society? Forget name-calling politicians and rancorous talk radio -- 
take a look inside sports arenas and in the city streets after 
championship games. It's not just boorish megalomaniacs like Bulls 
forward Dennis Rodman turning games into a Roman spectacle. Some fans 
are worse. Chicago police and the National Guard are bracing for 
widespread lawlessness during the Bulls' victory celebration.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And the crowd can be a real factor in the final score. Bulls star 
Michael Jordan acknowledged as much. "We wanted to come out and take 
their crowd out of the game," Jordan told reporters, describing his 
team's aggressive start in Sunday night's game with the Seattle 
Supersonics. By racking up a big lead early, the Bulls hoped to 
depress the Seattle fans' notorious fervor.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not content to cheer their team to victory, fans everywhere shout 
insults, throw things and do their best to distract opposing players. 
During the Sonics' own victory game over the Utah Jazz for the Western 
Conference Finals, Seattle spectators showed just how nasty they could 
be. With seconds left and the Jazz down by three points, power forward 
Karl Malone endured a deafening countdown before he took his foul 
shots. Between the verbal taunts and the sea of undulating white 
balloons, Malone -- who makes 70% of his free throws -- missed both, 
ending any chance for a Jazz win.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those annoying white balloons wielded by fans are deployed to throw 
off a player's aim in the free throw. The balloons wiggle like maggots 
behind the basket. But some fans have gotten even more creative. 
Boosters at Florida Panther hockey games throw rubber rats on the ice 
after their team scores a goal. Detroit Red Wings fans throw 
octopuses. The ice is beginning to look like a bouillabaisse of 
rubbery critters.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes the action is more than offensive -- it's downright 
dangerous. Last year, fans pelted the field at Dodger Stadium with so 
many baseballs that the game had to be halted, and the Dodgers 
forfeited a game they were winning.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There was a time when sportsmanship was synonymous with gentlemanly 
behavior. Being called "unsportsmanlike" used to be a real insult, and 
unsportsmanlike conduct actually carried penalties on the field and 
off.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
My most vivid memory of a high school game is not of some last-second 
victory but of Sister Jean Patrice, my high school principal, down on 
the basketball court scolding those of us in the stands for booing our 
opponents. "Another outburst like that and we'll forfeit the game," 
she warned -- no idle threat. She was an enthusiastic team supporter 
and a tough competitor, but she believed winning wasn't everything.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In today's billion-dollar sports business, winning is the only thing. 
If players act like freaks or worse on the court or off, no one seems 
to care. Least of all those in the stands whose own behavior emulates 
their idols'. Fans are supposed to boost the morale of the players, 
not become sideline guerrillas.
<BR>

<title>Devine: Get Political, GOP -- 5/8/96 - ACU

<h2> 
Get Political, GOP
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html">

</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Democratic threats have thrown Republicans into a panic. A
plan to add an amendment increasing the minimum wage from $4.25 to
$5.15, has now derailed a second major bill in the Senate. Fifteen
moderate Republicans promptly followed and introduced their own
even higher minimum wage increase bill in the House, leading the
GOP leadership to predict 40 eventual disaffections from their
ranks and passage of a minimum wage bill this year. So far have
things deteriorated in the bastion of the 1994 revolution that the
House will pass a New Deal law that Bill Clinton was afraid even to
introduce before the Republican took control of Congress.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Happened? A cynic might note that the news of the AFL-CIO
ad campaign supporting a minimum wage increase broke just before
the Democrats hit the floor of the Senate with their plan. The fact
that big labor was willing to spend $35 million above its normal
$42 million to target vulnerable Republicans got the attention of
Republicans in districts with high union membership and among the
vulnerable, especially the freshmen. This is about politics, not
economics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, every economist knows that minimum wage laws cost
jobs. It is not necessary to repeat the facts because they are not
at issue. As reported here by Bruce Bartlett, as recently as
January 14, 1987, the New York Times ran an editorial headed, "The
Right Minimum Wage: $0.00."  Two years later they still were
correctly saying minimum wages help middle income families because
most people who get the increase are second or third income
earners, not the poor, and because employers hire fewer low wage
workers when their wage costs go up. Somehow, in a Democratic
Administration, the Times decided it was fine to increase the
minimum wage; but that does not repeal the law of supply and
demand. Fewer jobs will exist at an artificially higher wage, even
if it is only a small number--and even economists with President
Clinton know it.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On "This Week With David Brinkley" columnist George Will asked
Clinton Labor Secretary Robert Reich why, if an increase in the
minimum to $5.15 was good, why not raise it to $10? Reich admitted
$10 would have a "negative effect" but $5.15 would have only a
"negligible effect on jobs." A "negligible effect" is an effect. It
is critical to note that even the minimum wage's number one
supporter admits a higher minimum wage will cost some people their
jobs. Only he does not care. Too bad for them. It's only
politics.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why cannot the Republicans learn to play politics? It has been
the constant, sad refrain of this space for a year of bungled
activity, trying to rule from Congress when the President holds the
veto. It is not too late to begin learning. The Democrats are
clearly playing politics on the minimum wage legislation. The
Republicans should accept the challenge and offer an amendment to
increase the minimum wage to $100 per hour. If increasing rates by
law works, why be pikers? Ten dollars is too little. Increase it to
100 an hour and make everyone rich. Get on record supporting a
minimum higher than the Democrats would approve.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If that is too high, how about $66.66 an hour. That would make
all Americans as rich as Congressmen. But that brings up a sore
subject, so $100 is better. At that rate, all workers would be at
a high enough income to be under President Clinton's surtax. That
is the right message. It would also be possible to balance the
Budget if everyone could earn that rate. Of course, they will not
because supply and demand work. But that is the point the GOP
should want to make. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am serious. All Republicans should vote to support "a real
increase in the minimum wage" and let the President and the
Democrats sort it all out (or clean it up in a conference committee
after the point is made). Politics must be played by two or it just
is not fair, nor even interesting. There is nothing wrong with
playing politics in government, certainly not when the other side
is having all of the fun.

<title>Devine: Real  Campaign Reform -- 5/9/96 - ACU

<h2> 
Real  Campaign Reform
</h2> 

<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Common Cause has spent a quarter-century of campaign reform  
zeal on the passion that money is evil; and the job of reform is to  
chase its specter out of politics. Yet, the fruit of their reform  
fetish has been ever greater dominance of campaigns by  
millionaires, business sharpies and union bosses, and ever less  
public confidence in the political process. Still, their only  
answer is, more laws to wipe out filthy lucre.  
  <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Finally, someone is saying stop. Curtis Gans of the Committee  
for the Study of the American Electorate has organized 30  
organizations from across the ideological and political spectrum  
under the "unifying principle" that the "approaches that have been  
pushed by Common Cause and Public Citizen are wrong." Finally. From  
the American Conservative Union to the National Women's Political  
Caucus, the AFL-CIO to the National Association of Business  
Political Action Committees, the other side is stirring. Although  
ACU and former liberal senator Gene McCarthy did fight the original  
court test, the field has generally been conceded since the "get  
money out" school prevailed in the Supreme Court.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
A Republican Congressional "reformer" welcomed the debate by  
calling the response "a deceitful campaign to protect their raw  
power and personal profit, garnered in a corrupt system of money."  
The unions and business are hardly altruistic but the inclusion of  
think tanks suggests name-calling will not be enough. The counter  
argument begins with the unfortunate fact that everything costs  
money and, without it, there can be no free speech or right to  
association. The only other goo-goo idea is to have the government  
fund the whole process. Yet--partially as a result of reform--the  
people simply do not trust government to do it.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Because the whole idea of reform was to eliminate the  
corrupting effects of filthy lucre, the Supreme Court reasonably  
ruled that one could not corrupt oneself--so it is an  
unconstitutional limit of speech to limit what a candidate can  
spend on his own election. Voila, we have Ross Perot, Steve Forbes,  
the rise of the multi-millionaire Senate, and even the Michael  
Huffingtons buying House seats with their small change in the  
millions. The one certainty in the uncertain future of Common Cause  
political "reform," is more Richy Rich candidates. After the yacht,  
the airplane, the football club and the young spouse, what else is  
there to do?  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
All the $1,000 individual contribution limit has done is  
replace the sometimes-altruistic, big contributor Henry Salvatori's  
and Stuart Mott's with the always-investing sharpies who bundle  
$1,000 contributions into large batches. As the value of a thousand  
declines from inflation, the number of payers needed multiplies.  
Today, the only people who can round-up big sums are those with  
wide contacts among likeminded self-interested fellow seekers of  
influence. All of the onerous reporting only hides who is the real  
influence peddler among the scores and more of thousand dollar  
givers. Meanwhile, the Congressman is constantly on the phone  
"dialing for dollars" to call the larger number of contributors now  
needed, leaving little time for average citizens or simple  
reflection on issues or even reading about issues.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It took great courage for Speaker Newt Gingrich to question  
the central Common Cause assumption by arguing that we do not spend  
enough on politics--we actually spend less debating than on soap  
advertising. Senator Mitch McConnell and Congressman John Doolittle  
have spoken out too. The fact is, if all money comes from the  
government bureaucrats who run it, the lawyers who write the laws,  
the media who sensationalize it and the sharpies who hustle it, the  
people will be frozen out. Not everyone can participate equally,  
but there must be some citizen participation. In the real world,  
that means relying upon the political parties and citizen groups  
that allow people indirect participation and influence.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
David Broder is correct that the Ralph Nader-Common Cause plan  
to limit so-called soft money for party-building and volunteer  
activities would further erode the role of parties to represent  
citizens and control interests. But Broder does not go far enough.  
If political parties are the only means for effective influence,  
they will multiply. In a free society, groups always multiply.  
Either political action groups will proliferate or parties will. As  
political action committees become more hedged by law, it is no  
coincidence that Ross Perot organizes a third party.  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Real reform would: (1) eliminate limits on contributions to  
citizen-ideological political action committees (PACs) and extend  
the third-class mailing rates now granted to political parties to  
them, so they can compete in representing citizens within a two-  
party system; (2) end individual or corporate limits on  
contributions to a political party as a limit upon free speech; (3)  
continue the current $5,000 limit on contributions to candidates by  
corporate or union PACs, so they do not dominate the field; (4)  
void the $25,000 yearly total and $1,000 per candidate contribution  
limit for individuals, to allow a Steve Forbes to contribute to a  
Jack Kemp rather than force the rich to run themselves, placing  
others on a more equal footing with the Richys; (5) continue record  
keeping and reporting requirements but, to save average people from  
paperwork, only require reporting of significant amounts; (6), if  
one cannot corrupt oneself, immediately remove all limits and  
restrictions for contributions by spouses, parents, children, and  
first degree blood relatives and in-laws of candidates; (7) index  
for inflation any dollar limits; and, (9) increase the penalty for  
failing to source any unidentified campaign communication (such as  
in so-called push polls defaming opposing candidates).  
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
It may be pie-in-the-sky to wish for real reform with  
demagogues like Perot and Nader exploiting public anxiety; but it  
should not be an impossible case to make. If Mr. Perot gets rid of  
all other money, he will be the only person who can compete for  
President.

<title>Devine: The Right's Confused by the Left is Dead -- 5/7/96

<h2> 
The Right's Confused But the Left is Dead
</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/devine.html"> 
Donald Devine
</a> 

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While the media are busting with pleasure that Pat Buchanan is
sundering conservatism, the leading intellectual of the left is
forced to publish a book on progressives titled, "They Only Look
Dead." In fact, he proves they are moribund. Still, a book by the
man who invented the New Democrat and called forth Bill Clinton
obviously is an expert on levitation.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
E.J. Dionne, Jr. of the Washington Post follows his award-
winning <i>Why Americans Hate Politics</i> by shedding his earlier cover
of ideological neutrality to brag that he is a progressive
dedicated to its restoration as the ruling philosophy in the United
States. In the earlier volume, Dionne granted that liberalism had
failed and that conservatives were the ones providing answers.
Traditionalists had answers on value questions and libertarians had
them on economic ones. He even recognized the "fusionist" attempt
to harmonize both, although he ultimately said the contradictions
between the two wings would lead to failure. He proposed a vaguely-
defined New Democrat alternative to liberalism that would fill the
void, and Bill Clinton appeared to claim its mantle.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With the disappearance of the New Democrat, the world has
changed for Dionne. Now he calls the conservative formula that
places liberty as the highest value in the political sphere and
virtue as the highest in the social realm, "ingenious"--making one
wonder whether he understood conservatism as well as it seemed in
the earlier book. In any case, he ignores it and invents a New
Conservatism this time. Both "new's" are misleading. We now
discover that a New Democrat really is an old progressive, both
from Bill Clinton's performance--with constant cheering from Dionne
in the Post--and from the author's present forthrightness. New
Conservatism is more mischievous. It is a caricature. Since the
thesis of his book is that the new progressivism will arise from
opposition to the New Conservatism, it would seem to follow that
the later cannot rise from what does not exist.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given Newt Gingrich's present standing in the polls, it should
not surprise that New Conservatism is identified with him. But this
is not a Gingrichism that the Speaker would recognize. It "harks
back not to Ronald Reagan but to the Gilded Age of the 1890's." It
is created by collecting some ideas Gingrich does have about the
future and the communications revolution and transforming them to
his entire philosophy. New Conservatism simply means "accelerating
the economic transition" and embracing the dog-eats-dog social
Darwinism of William Graham Sumner and the Gilded Age.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not only is this an outrageous simplification but it borders
on the dishonest. This is most easily seen in the author's
treatment of Marvin Olasky. He is pictured both as part of the
"ingenious" (but failed) new fusionism and as part of the Gilded
Age because he says 1890's volunteer charity should be the model
for modern reform. Now reflect on that for a moment. A man who
advocates more reliance upon private charity is deemed a social
Darwinist, a philosophy that disapproves of social work because it
helps the less fit to survive--quite a slight-of-hand!
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne even has the gaul to resurrect old Robert McCloskey's
xenophobic simplification of the period as objective proof. He
admits that Gingrich does "bow" to traditional values, institutions
and to Olasky but shrugs it off. He will not make the obvious
conclusion that Gingrich is following the traditional formula, if
in somewhat idiosyncratic terms. Rather, Dionne needs a strawman to
demonstrate that where there is a Gilded Age, there must follow a
Progressive one. After all, that is how it all progressed once
before. So has historical determinism degenerated for the modern
liberal.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The contortion of progressivism is just as bizarre. After
doting on John Dewey, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Croly and the rest of
the progressive pantheon, he does admit that "Progressivism's
critics have identified critical flaws in Progressive thought that
have haunted the liberal project through to the Great Society and
the present day," especially the problem that its elitist-experts
manipulate central bureaucracies rather than trust ordinary people.
The solution to Dionne is a more reasonable progressive power that
will be more sensitive to the needs of private organizations. Yet,
of his seventeen proposals, only one is not straight old-time
centralized government bureaucracy. Two of Dionne's major proposals
are a national health system and improved pensions. He ignores that
the existing national health programs of Medicare and Medicaid and
the Social Security pension programs are at the center of the
crisis even he must admit now is facing liberalism. After all,
these were the ultimate progressive creations and now they are in
absolute bankruptcy.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dionne admits that conservatives have been correct to
emphasize private mediating institutions like family, church and
associations as superior to expert bureaucrats for many social
tasks. But he still requires that the experts must direct them.
Besides, he says, they do not operate under the "logic" of the
market. But it is Dionne who identifies the market with social
Darwinism, not understanding that the real logic of both business
and private welfare institutions is freedom to operate without too
many restrictions from experts wielding government power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No, the only way to give the private, voluntary organizations
vitality is to get the centralized bureaucracy's experts off their
backs. Send the programs back to the states and the people, which
is the real new and old conservative program. Dionne cannot
resurrect progressivism on these grounds. He contrasts a strawman
conservatism to what progressivism would be if everything worked
perfectly, as if there were no fruits of its ideals. But the show
is over as the progressive programs fall one-by-one, recognized
bankruptcies one and all. Conservatism may have its Buchanan schism
but, if Dionne is the best and the brightest, progressivism not
"only looks dead;" it is.<p><br><p>

 <i>September 3, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. I </h2><p>

<i>We're told that the era of big government is over, but what about the era of judicial activism? When will that end?</i><p>



Constitutional law expert Richard Morgan predicts that the era of judicial activism is almost over -- and that, when the end comes, it will come rapidly. He likens this imminent, swift demise of an outworn orthodoxy to the sudden fall of the Soviet empire. "Just as political and social institutions that appear as durable as the mountains can collapse almost overnight," Morgan explains, "so, too, seemingly impregnable intellectual orthodoxies can suddenly stand revealed as so flawed that we're abashed at having accepted them for so long." Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, the Bowdoin College professor contends that "America is on the edge of such a collapse of orthodoxy in our thinking about the proper role of judges and judge-made law in our governmental process. Central to this change," he says, "is the demythologizing of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, Brown v. Board of Education."<p>

Before we can lay judicial activism to rest, we must first acknowledge the flawed nature of the Brown decision. "The collapse of Brown as a model for judicial behavior will resonate through many of the most contentious areas of American public policy," says Morgan, "from criminal justice and affirmative action to education and welfare reform: for Brown is the mother of contemporary judicial activism -- policy making by judges acting essentially as legislators, without any real justification from such ordinary legal authorities as statutory and constitutional texts, history, and precedent." Morgan charges that the Supreme Court decision that "overruled the people of Colorado in May with respect to homosexual rights, without any serious attempt to offer a constitutional reason for doing so, is only the latest example of the Brown style of judging."<p>

Morgan notes that "arguments undermining the authority of Brown as a model for judging have long been piling up. Right from the beginning, some of the country's most distinguished constitutional lawyers criticized Brown -and especially Chief Justice Earl Warren's opinion, which relied on essentially sociological reasoning to brush aside 70 years of precedent and settled understanding as to the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment." The Chief Justice relied "neither on text, nor history, nor precedent," says Morgan, and "was, in effect, claiming for the Court the authority to revise the meaning of the Constitution."<p>

Richard Morgan maintains that the Court "attempted to dismantle segregation (a profoundly important end) by means that were profoundly wrong. Not only did this judicial fiat traduce democracy, substituting the will of the judges for decision by the people and their representatives; it disregarded fundamental constitutional forms (federalism, separation of powers, and the procedures for amending the Constitution prescribed by Article V)." The Brown decision "launched the modern era of judicial 'reform,' in which purportedly noble ends can justify even the most constitutionally suspect means." It's time, says Morgan, to admit the error in Brown.<p>

<title>Duplantier: NAFTA & Narcotics  -- 9/02/96</title>

 <i>September 2, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> NAFTA & Narcotics </h2><p>

<i>"The impact of NAFTA on the sale and distribution of narcotics within the U.S. was felt immediately. In the very first month after the treaty took effect in January l 994, there was a sharp rise in marijuana, cocaine, and crack in the streets and schoolyards of our towns and cities. "</i><p>

Former Mexican president Carlos Salinas "joined Bill Clinton in bulldozing NAFTA through," recalls William Gill of the American Coalition for Competitive Trade. NAFTA made perfect sense to Salinas, who with his family was "deeply involved in the drug trade and other criminal activities. Salinas is now hiding in exile," reports Gill; "his brother, Raul Salinas, is in prison, and Raul's wife was arrested in Switzerland for attempting to withdraw some of their laundered money from a Swiss bank." In addition, "several of Mexico's most prominent businessmen were linked to the Salinas family's crime ring."<p>

Gill charges that "the lucrative narcotics industry" has corrupted public officials south -- and north -- of the border. "Three former high U.S. Justice Department lawyers were indicted last year for helping the Cali drug cartel ship literally tons of cocaine into our country, most of it via Mexico," he reports. High officials in both the U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service were "allegedly involved in drug and immigrant smuggling from Mexico." Drug trafficking generates an estimated "$30 billion in income for our neighbors to the south," says Gill. "Drug money is financing all kinds of businesses in Mexico and, no doubt, in the United States as well."<p>

The crime explosion NAFTA caused in Mexico is spilling over into the U.S. "Last year, there were 1000 slayings in the larger cities on the Mexican side of the border, most of them drug-related and unsolved," says Gill. "No one could possibly know how many murders in the United States are caused by the NAFTA-spurred increase in the drug trade. But they are bound to be in the hundreds, if not thousands, by now. Indeed, there is deep and growing interaction between the drug gangs in Los Angeles and other American cities and the drug lords and gangs in Mexico and Central America."<p>

Gill argues that "free trade is the primary driving force behind the crime wave that is sweeping the globe." Calling this crime wave "a crisis that threatens the very foundations of all civilization," he predicts that "the chaos emanating from Mexico now will sweep in stronger from China tomorrow. Already we are getting a foretaste of what Communist China and others in the East have in store for the U.S.A.," says Gill. "In May, Customs officers seized 2000 AK-47 assault rifles in California." Chinese agents had sought to sell these weapons to L.A. street gangs.<p>

"China is also exporting thousands of illegal aliens to this country," Williarn Gill reports. "Many come into Central American mini-states and are smuggled into the U.S. via Mexico." Gill warns that "the invasion from China could easily surpass the present 1 million or so Mexican illegals entering each year."<p>

<title>Duplantier: Special Ed: Kids go in, Don't come out -- 8/28/96</title>

<h2> SPECIAL ED: KIDS GO IN, DON'T COME OUT</h2><p>                           


     The budget for special education in New York City schools exceeds
     $2 billion, for just 135,000 students!<p>

     There's a lesson to be learned when "a school system that has
     made a fetish out of testing, counting, and record-keeping
     ignores the most important tests and statistics of them all: the
     ordinary measures of whether children are learning anything." So
     observes Kay Hymowitz in a distressing article entitled "Special
     Ed: Kids Go In, But They Don't Come Out," in the Summer issue of
     the Manhattan Institute's City Journal. "Two-thirds of special-ed
     students officially exiting in 1995," she observes, "dropped out
     instead of graduating."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that "only 5 percent of special-ed kids are ever
     'decertified' into general education." In other words, from the
     perspective of the students, the program is a colossal failure.
     It has, however, created enormous opportunity for the bureaucrats
     and attorneys responsible for complying with "a mammoth federal
     mandate and a 17-year-old consent decree." It has succeeded in
     "providing employment for members of the United Federation of
     Teachers." It has given poor parents an incentive for having
     their children misdiagnosed in order to obtain Supplemental
     Security Income. It has furnished a way for conniving
     middle-class parents to provide their children with "a private
     education at public expense." It's also proven to be a boon for
     those private agencies that "evaluate potential special-ed
     preschool students, and then, in 75 to 80 percent of cases . . .
     refer them to their own schools."<p>

     Hymowitz argues that "both the federal law and the apparatus
     dedicated to its enforcement rest on a largely worthless
     scientific model. The federal law asserts that such great
     progress in 'diagnostic and instructional procedures and methods'
     has taken place that, given enough money, all handicapped
     children can be educated effectively. Like a team of doctors,
     experts are supposed to 'diagnose' a child's malady and then
     recommend the proper course of treatment." Hymowitz reports that
     "the criteria for referrals and placement in New York City
     schools were far from uniform." There is no telling how many
     students have been misclassified. "A child might be called
     learning disabled in one school, emotionally disturbed in
     another, or not be referred at all in a third."<p>

     Hymowitz reports that learning-disabled, or L.D., kids "are
     overwhelmingly minority, poor achievers, and often behaviorally
     disruptive. Many have moved and changed schools often; many are
     chronically late for school. All this suggests chaotic home lives
     that clash with the ordered processes of learning," says
     Hymowitz. "Though both state and federal law clearly specify that
     the category 'learning disabled' should 'not include children who
     have learning problems which are primarily the result of . . .
     environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage,' those are
     precisely the children who are included."<p>

     Kay Hymowitz concedes that "we must do something for these
     children," but insists that special education "does almost no
     noticeable good for perhaps half the pupils it serves . . . and
     is forbidden by law to include them in the first place."<p>

<title>Duplantier: FDA is Stifling Medical Innovation -- 8/27/96</title>

 <i>August 27, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2> FDA IS STIFLING MEDICAL INNOVATION</h2><p>                    





     Society offers numerous safeguards against unsafe medical
     devices, including: consumer awareness, free competition, private
     testing laboratories, and tort law.<P>

     "Today, in what used to be the Land of the Free, someone with an
     idea for a new medical device that might help alleviate a human
     health problem can't just test the device and market it (and
     accept responsibility for any adverse effects)," observes Dr.
     Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of American
     Physicians and Surgeons. "First the people with the idea have to
     invest tens of millions of dollars . . . in government paperwork.
     Then they have to submit their idea to a Czar. A few years later
     their dream may lie in ruins because of the Czar's arbitrary
     decision. If they complain, the Czar might also impound other
     products they happen to have on the market."<p>

     Why isn't there more of a public outcry over this tragic abuse of
     government power? "The people who might benefit from the proposed
     new device will never hear about it," explains Dr. Orient. "The
     public might learn about an FDA error in approving something, but
     it's almost always safe for a bureaucrat to disapprove
     something."?<p>

     Writing in a recent issue of Priorities, a publication of the
     American Council on Science and Health, Dr. Orient notes that
     "devices subjected to this maddening approval system could save
     lives . . . or could mitigate serious disability." Nevertheless,
     the FDA denies access to them "for months, for years, or
     forever." There were roughly 5,000 such devices waiting to be
     approved in 1994, and there's no telling how many ideas were
     never even submitted "because their inventors were deterred,
     perhaps for lack of money, from even trying for approval. Often
     inventors just take their ideas abroad," says Dr. Orient. "The
     American lead in medicine," she concludes from this ominous
     trend, "may soon be a distant memory."<p>

     The FDA was originally established "to assure that drugs were
     properly labeled and not adulterated," recalls Dr. Orient. "Then
     its role expanded into proving the safety, and then the efficacy,
     of drugs. Now the FDA is into medical devices. Soon it will be
     dictating the practice of medicine."<p>

     The U.S. Constitution, needless to say, makes no provision for
     the FDA. "As with most of the ever-expanding powers of the
     federal leviathan, the pretext lies in the constitutionally
     mandated power of Congress to 'regulate commerce,'" observes Dr.
     Jane Orient. "This is surely not what the Founders had in mind.
     They thought of government as a necessary evil, a system needed
     to restrain evildoers; they definitely did not envision
     government as a do-gooder." Well-intentioned or not, governmental
     intervention has inevitable consequences. "As the power of
     government agencies grows, other protections wither or are choked
     off," Dr. Orient explains. "Consumers don't bother to think for
     themselves; they just trust the government to look out for them."<p><br>

<h2> TREATY THREATENS AMERICAN SECURITY</h2><p>                    

                  




     Why would anyone object to the banning of chemical weapons? Good
     question! Here's the answer.<p>

     The United States Senate is scheduled to vote soon on
     ratification of a treaty called the Chemical Weapons Convention.
     This Treaty purports to ban the production and stockpiling of
     chemical weapons, which would seem to be a laudable goal. A good
     case can be made, however, that the Treaty will not achieve its
     expressed objective and that certain unintended effects could
     undermine our nation's security and threaten the personal liberty
     of American citizens. Analyst Baker Spring of the Heritage
     Foundation charges that the Treaty "contains serious
     shortcomings. It is neither reliably verifiable nor enforceable.
     But the potential damage," says Spring, "is not limited merely to
     national security. It also will impose a costly regulatory burden
     on American businesses and thus harm America's economy."<p>

     The Treaty would require American businesses to "prove to the
     U.S. government and international inspectors that they are not
     producing or stockpiling chemical weapons," Spring explains.
     "Failure to comply with these regulations could result in
     companies being fined as much as $50,000 per incident." But
     following the rules isn't cheap either. Complying with the terms
     of the Treaty could cost American businesses as much as $200
     million a year, says Spring. That doesn't include "potential
     indirect costs to businesses, such as those stemming from the
     loss of confidential information." Spring stresses that the
     Treaty would apply not just to chemical companies, but to almost
     any business that uses chemicals, including "food processors,
     brewers, distillers, pharmaceutical companies, paint companies,
     petroleum companies, and rubber companies."<p>

     "If the Chemical Weapons Convention served the national security
     interests of the U.S., it would be reasonable to ask American
     businesses to assume some portion of the burden imposed by the
     inspection regime," concedes Baker Spring. "But to ask American
     businesses to assume the excessive cost burden imposed by
     implementing a treaty that actually harms U.S. national security
     makes neither economic nor security sense."<p>

     Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy agrees that the
     Chemical Weapons Convention will "seriously damage United States
     national security interests and impose a massive, new regulatory
     burden upon thousands of U.S. businesses." The Treaty, he says,
     "will do nothing to reduce the arsenals of terrorist countries
     and other nations hostile to the United States." Several such
     countries "have neither signed nor ratified" the treaty, observes
     Gaffney, citing Libya, Syria, Iraq, and North Korea as examples.
     China has not yet ratified the Treaty; nor has Russia, "the
     country with the largest chemical weapons arsenal in the world."<p>

     Gaffney also consider the Treaty unverifiable. He worries that it
     "will forbid United States commanders from using tear gas and
     other riot-control agents to protect our soldiers in the field
     and minimize civilian casualties." And he argues that it "will
     create yet another international bureaucracy costing millions of
     U.S. taxpayer dollars every year to impose costly new regulatory
     burdens on thousands of U.S. companies."<p>

<title>Duplantier: SCHOOL ABUSE -- 8/16/96</title>

 <i>August 16, 1996</i><p> 
 
<h2>SCHOOL ABUSE</h2><p> 

[On March 19th of this year, 59 sixth-grade girls at a middle school in  
East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania were subjected to gynecological exams  
against their will and without the permission of their parents.]<p> 
 
"This whole unsavory incident provides us with one more reason why  
parents ought not to put their children in public schools, and another  
reason why the government ought to be kicked out of the education  
business," concludes education expert Samuel Blumenfeld in the June  
issue of his Blumenfeld Education Letter. "This is probably the worst  
case of public educators violating the privacy rights of students and  
parents that we have seen to date."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld warns that "the totalitarians among the education  
establishment are becoming bolder and bolder in their assertion that they  
own the children." Heretofore, it was "unheard of in this country for  
perfectly healthy individuals to be forcibly herded into a nurse's room,  
and told to strip and lie down on a table for an examination." Blurnenfeld  
associates such practices with Nazi Germany. "During World War II,  
when the Jews were rounded up and sent to concentration camps," he  
recalls, "the first thing their captors forced them to do was strip. The  
purpose of the stripping was to deprive these captives of any notion of  
privacy or personal dignity. The stripping meant that they were now the  
property of their captors, who could do anything they wanted to them."<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that the 59 grade-school girls in East Stroudsberg  
were similarly dehumanized. "The psychological damage done to these  
girls by the government of Pennsylvania cannot be undone," he contends.  
"They shall have to live with the traumatic consequences for the rest of  
their lives." Some good may come of the incident, however, if parents  
learn "that the educators cannot be trusted and that they will continue to  
deceive the public. The cavalier manner in which the school authorities  
say that parents were supposedly 'informed' of the planned exam, and the  
fact that the school cannot provide any evidence that such prior  
notification was indeed given, is an example of the contempt that school  
authorities now have for parents," says Blumenfeld. "It's as if they were  
telling them, 'We own your kids and we don't need your approval for  
anything we want to do with them."'<p> 
 
Blumenfeld argues that "this trend toward totalitarian enslavement will  
continue until such time as the American people put a stop to it. They can  
do so tomorrow by simply withdrawing their children from the  
government's national socialist schools and educating them at home or in  
private schools they can trust." He warns that public school officials now  
"feel so confident of their power to impose their will" on schoolchildren  
that they think they no longer have to obtain parental permission for  
anything. Samuel Blumenfeld urges all Americans to assert their parental  
rights before they lose their children entirely to the totalitarian state.<p>

<title>Duplantier:  FREON -- 08/15/96</title>

 <i>August 15, 1996</i><p>

<h2>FREON</h2><p>
 
[Twenty million American drivers will pay four times as much for air  
conditioning repairs this summer, and it won't make any difference to the  
ozone layer.]<p> 
 
"Federal law has banned production of Freon, the refrigerant used in  
more than 100 million automotive air-conditioners, in response to  
concerns about depletion of the ozone layer," says Ben Lieberman of the  
Competitive Enterprise Institute in a recent Washington Times  
commentary. "America's first post-phaseout summer is now upon us,"  
notes Lieberman, "and the news for consumers is not good. The price of  
existing Freon stocks is rising, and with it the cost of auto A/C repairs.  
Millions of car owners who will need A/C service are going to get very  
angry, especially when they realize that the excessive costs are both  
unnecessary and unfair."<p> 
 
The wholesale price of Freon was less than a dollar a pound five years  
ago, Lieberman recalls. Nowadays, that same pound of refreshing Freon  
costs upwards of $20. That's wholesale, too. The retail price is roughly  
double, and you'll probably need three pounds to fill your car's A/C.  
"Nearly all pre-1994 vehicles use Freon," Lieberman observes. "In  
addition to higher Freon costs, EPA regulations on the handling of  
refrigerants are time-consuming and require expensive equipment, adding  
to labor costs. In total, the bill for a typical automobile A/C repair has  
gone up by $100 or more."<p> 
 
Ironically, none of this extra cost or effort will have any real impact on  
the ozone layer. Most scientists have concluded that "ozone depletion is  
not nearly as serious nor immediate a threat as once predicted," observes  
Lieberman. "In fact, virtually every scary sounding prediction about the  
consequences of ozone depletion . . . has been qualified or abandoned by  
scientists." According to Lieberman, "The abrupt phaseout does not make  
sense. A few more years of limited Freon production to meet the needs of  
the existing fleet of Freon-using vehicles would have made little  
difference to the ozone layer, but a big difference to consumers."<p> 
 
Banning an efficient coolant may be a mania in America, but very few  
foreign countries are suffering from Freon phobia. "Although more than  
100 nations have signed an international treaty banning the production of  
Freon and other compounds," observes Lieberman, "developing nations  
have been given a 10-year extension, and few other developed countries  
are taking the phaseout as seriously as the United States. For example,  
illegal Freon is readily available throughout much of Europe, at a fraction  
of the U.S. price. Further, most countries have nothing like our  
Environmental Protection Agency's costly Freon-handling regulations."<p> 
 
But facts won't phase the phaseout. "Rather than trying to reduce the  
ban's costs, the EPA is loudly denying their existence," says Lieberman.  
"Most car owners have no idea how expensive their next A/C breakdown  
will be -- until it happens," he adds. The Freon phaseout is an  
unnecessary and unfair tax on everyone with a car made before 1994.<p>

<title>Duplantier: Corporate Welfare -- 08/13/96</title>

 <i>August 13, 1996</i><p>

<h2> CORPORATE WELFARE</h2><p>

<i>"Business research and development should be paid for by stockholders, 
not U.S. taxpayers."</i><p>

"When it comes to attacking the federal deficit," says Stephen Moore of 
the Cato Institute, "there is one area of the budget that both parties have 
come to regard as politically untouchable: corporate welfare." Moore 
reports that a recent Cato study "shows that Uncle Sam currently spends 
$75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Eliminating those 
subsidies would cut the budget deficit in half," he contends. "If Congress 
were willing to stop the giveaways, the feds would save enough money to 
make up for the complete elimination of the capital gains tax and the 
estate tax. Reducing the deficit or eliminating the anti-growth taxes 
would do far more to benefit American industry and U.S. global 
competitiveness than asking Congress to pick industrial winners and 
losers."<p>

Moore tells us who the lucky "winners" are. "About $10 billion to $15 
billion a year is spent on agriculture subsidies -- not to small family 
farmers, but to large agribusinesses, such as Archer Daniels Midland. The 
federal sugar program provides the owners ofthe 33 largest sugar 
plantations in America more than $1 million each per year and doubles 
the price of sugar to U.S. consumers." Who else is on the gravy train? 
"Another $8 billion to $10 billion a year subsidizes U.S. exporters," says 
Moore, "including such impoverished companies as Boeing, General 
Electric, and Westinghouse." And that's just a sampling.<p>

Moore chides the Congress for failing to make any significant reductions 
in corporate welfare, then takes the executive branch to task. "With few 
exceptions, the administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest 
corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress," he observes. "In fact, 
the administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in 
spending on business subsidies." Noting that "Republicans made a valiant 
effort to close down the Commerce Department, but the Clinton 
administration allied itself with lobbyists to fend off the budget cutters," 
Moore concludes that "the Clinton administration has proved itself to be 
corporate welfare's best friend."<p>

Moore contends that corporate welfare "corrupts both our free market 
system and our representative form of government. Corporate welfare 
converts the industrialist into a statist businessman, whose market is the 
political arena in DC, not consumers." Corporate welfare also "creates a 
bidding war for preferential treatment among businesses and industries," 
a process not conducive to high ethical standards among lawmakers. 
Corporate welfare appears to be counterproductive no matter how you 
look at it. "There is no evidence that business subsidies and industrial 
policy programs are at all successful in creating jobs or wealth," says 
Moore. "Even if they did, those benefits would almost never offset the 
efficiency loss from large tax burdens imposed on workers and 
businesses to fund the programs."<p>

Successful businesses do not require the financial assistance of American 
taxpayers. One of these days we're going to have to dismantle the welfare 
system, and we might as well start with the least needy.<p>

<h2>
Trade Revolution 1996
</h2>

<i>"Most Americans are still living and laboring under the illusion of 
freedom. But more and more of us know that our freedom has been sold 
out from under us by a totally corrupt government. "</i>
<P>
"America is frittering away the last shreds of its once inviolable and 
cherished sovereignty," says William Gill of the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade. The mechanisms for ceding our nation's sovereignty 
to a global authority were established in the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (known as 
NAFTA and GATT) "and a host of subsidiary actions via the UN and 
other international agencies," says Gill. "The list of actual and potential 
infringements -- and worse -- upon U.S. laws and the rights of our 
citizens ," he warns, "is literally endless."
<P>
Gill laments the ease with which a foreign country can "invade the United 
States with its exports and agents, with its products and services -- even 
with its own plants and equipment -- and skim off American capital and 
technology with the help of its American wage slaves." Under the 
circumstances, the United States can no longer "call itself a free and 
independent nation," he concludes. "Any nation that permits foreign 
interests to take over its plants and production, its farmland, and even its 
banks is no longer truly independent. Any nation that sacrifices the jobs 
and livelihood of millions of its citizens in order to absorb billions upon 
billions of dollars in imported goods from Third World countries . . . has 
already surrendered its claim to nationhood. Any nation that has already 
openly acknowledged that its own laws are subject to interpretation -- and 
even cancellation -- by an international tribunal such as the World Trade 
Organization or the United Nations . . . is no longer free."
<P>
Gill points out that our Founding Fathers did not labor under illusions as 
we do today. "In 1776 all Americans knew that King George III and his 
Parliament were the rulers of this country," he observes. "Today we are 
not even permitted to know who the real rulers of the supposedly 
independent USA are, let alone what they are up to in leading us toward 
world government. Along the way toward this goal, they have already 
surrendered our sovereignty in the unholy name of 'free trade.' They have 
also surrendered millions of our best-paying and most secure jobs -no 
less than nine million in the downsizings since 1990." Gill charges that 
our nation's self-destructive trade policy "has been fostered by such 
esoteric groups as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateralists, and 
the super-secret Bilderbergers."
<P>
If we want to save our country, William Gill advises, we must "stop the 
New World Order now -- before the Bilderbergers and other plotters have 
transferred the last vestiges of our sovereignty and independence to the 
United Nations via its subsidiary World Trade Organization." To protect 
American sovereignty, Gill's group, the American Coalition for 
Competitive Trade, will soon file lawsuits seeking to nullify NAFTA and 
GATT.

August 2, 1996<br><p></i>
<h2>
Good Business
</h2>

<i>The revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the 
everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century are rarely 
recognized.</i>
<p>
"Most businesses exist to make or sell things, not to engage in political or 
social commentary, act as a philanthropic foundation, or even . . . to 
employ people," observes John Hood of the Heritage Foundation. 
"Focusing solely on the means by which businesses carry out their basic 
mission -- such as their employment practices, their participation in 
community or cultural life, or their waste management -- distracts us 
from the benefits that businesses confer on society." Writing in the 
August issue of Policy Review, Hood explains that businesses benefit 
society by inventing "new products, new services, new ways of doing 
business more efficiently. This they do better than other social 
institutions, such as governments or charities. And the impact of such 
innovations on our society is massive, often far exceeding the benefits of 
governmental or charitable action."
<p>
Why do so many Americans fail to recognize the enormous contribution 
that businesses make to our individual and general welfare? The 
prejudice of the press and the demagoguery of Democrats deserve much 
of the blame. Hood argues that "journalists and politicians thrive on bad 
news. They continue, for example, to decry the inequality of men and 
women in the workplace, and blast American companies for unfair hiring 
and compensation practices." In doing so, says Hood, they consciously or 
unconsciously ignore the fact that "business innovation historically has 
helped liberate American women. Technological advances have 
promoted greater equity in pay by reducing the value of physical strength 
and increasing the value of mental acuity and social skills, which are 
distributed more evenly between men and women. At the same time, 
labor-saving devices in the home have given married women more 
freedom to pursue education and employment."
<p>
Technological advances have also made the workplace safer, for both 
sexes. Hood notes that "automation and computers have improved 
workplace safety far more than has government regulation or union 
activists. Computers allow employers to track accidents carefully and 
devise solutions to systemic problems."
<p>
For reasons of their own, professional agitators "spend a lot of time 
talking about what they perceive to be the wasteful or destructive 
properties of goods and services, while ignoring their value to 
consumers," Hood charges. He cites one of the more telling examples of 
anti-business bias. "Critics of free enterprise denigrate plastic for being 
nonbiodegradable and polluting," he observes. "Yet, plastic is the 
essential ingredient of many of the products and services that make our 
standard of living possible, such as medical devices, telecommunications, 
wastewater treatment, transportation, safe and tasty food, and computers."
<p>
John Hood laments the fact that, "with few exceptions, those who create 
the amenities we enjoy and the innovations that make our lives safer, 
healthier, and happier toil in relative obscurity." He argues that "the real 
heroes of our age are the innovators who raise our standard of living and 
overcome the fundamental problems of humanity."

<h2>
Positives Of Pesticides
</h2>

<i>As usual, the mass media have gotten the story completely backwards. 
Far from threatening our health, the pesticides that control bugs, rodents, 
and plant disease have proven to be a boon to mankind.</i>
<p>
"Pesticides are not scary; they're wonderful. They rank equal to 
pharmaceuticals in saving and extending life. They save the environment, 
they save wildlife, they give the American housewife a roach- and rat-
free home," contends Pat Tigges of the Pacific Northwest Aerial 
Application Education Foundation. Tigges says she is "sick and tired of 
agriculture being on the defensive. We don't have to defend; we should 
be on the offensive," she insists. "Crop production technology has made 
our quality of life the envy of the world."
<p>
Radical environmentalists are winning the propaganda war, however, 
primarily because they've been the only ones waging battle. "The focused 
concerns of a few will take precedence over the unfocused concerns of 
the majority," Tigges warns, unless farmers -- and the American 
consumers whose larders they fill with inexpensive, unspoiled food -- 
fight back. Of particular concern, she says, is "new EPA-recommended 
legislation that would phase out consideration of benefits when 
establishing food-use pesticide tolerances." The net effect would be to 
raise the cost of the food we eat, while lowering its quality.
<p>
"The 'pesticide scare' is not about pesticides," Tigges insists, "it's about 
fear and control." She charges that radical environmentalists "use 
pesticide misinformation to create fear, from which they create a crisis, 
and a crisis generates funds. These funds are not spent saving anything. 
They are spent furthering a political and social agenda. The pseudo-
environmentalist leaders don't want to solve problems. They love 
problems. Problems give them more press, create more fear, and gain 
them credibility and money."
<p>
Fear mongers capitalize on the agricultural ignorance of the average 
American, but that ignorance can be overcome. "We can fight fear in 
children with education," says Tigges. "Children are afraid of the 
unknown. Farm pesticides are an unknown," she observes, "but 
household pesticides are not." Tigges fights fear in children by showing 
them that farm chemicals are similar to "things they touch and use every 
day in their homes. They aren't afraid of mom's shower cleaner; they just 
don't know it's a fungicide. They aren't afraid of pool chlorine; they just 
don't know it's a bactericide."
<p>
It's not just children who are afraid, but their teachers too. That's where 
Pat Tigges and the Pacific Northwest Aerial Application Education 
Foundation come in. "We teach teachers the truth," she explains. "We 
refute all the lies and misinformation that, for the past 30 years, have 
been repeated so often they are taken as truth." The foundation offers 
"continuing education classes, teacher conferences, in-service workshops, 
and structured farm fairs." Tigges and her colleagues come prepared to 
discuss "the history of the environmental movement, man-made vs. 
'natural' biochemistry, organic farming, Alar, and anything else a class 
wants to talk about." They know that minds, like farmland, need to be 
cultivated.

<title>Crime Can Be Whipped -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3> Crime Can Be Whipped </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 19, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The federal government has invested billions of dollars in so-called crime-fighting programs -- remember "midnight basketball" and (an alleged) 100,000 more cops on the beat? -- with little or no tangible results. But what can local officials with limited resources do to fight crime in their own neighborhoods?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Plenty, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">recent study</a> by former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese III and Heritage Foundation Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies Robert Moffit. The two have outlined a common-sense management plan that puts local officials in charge of their own reforms. For starters, Meese and Moffit say, hire the best qualified police officers and then have them patrol the high crime neighborhoods. Sound too simple? It worked in crime-ravaged New York City.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since 1993, the "Big Apple" saw a 36 percent drop in serious crimes, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45 percent drop in murder. <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/lect573.html">William Bratton</a>, the New York City police commissioner and architect of the improvements, insisted on simple, relatively inexpensive reforms such as police officers walking the beat in their patrol areas instead of sitting in a station house filling out paperwork, and a zero-tolerance policy for graffiti and public drunkenness.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"You don't need to have a bigger policy budget and more overtime to fight crime, just a commitment to the community," Moffit says. Every policy department -- large or small -- can: 
<P>
<ul>
<li>	Target "hot spots" of crime and career criminals. Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in a city. Most crimes also are committed by a small criminal class: just 6 percent of the male population is responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime.
<p>
<li>Raise the recruitment standards of police officers. Communities must demand the highest physical, intellectual and character standards within the police force and not accept anything less in the name of "diversity." Initial standardized screenings for psychological and physical requirements are essential. Poor personnel practices result in bad, brutal or incompetent police officers.

<p>
<li>	Have police officers walk a beat, getting to know neighbors and a neighborhood instead of sitting behind a desk or cruising the streets in a police car. Administrative duties should be performed by clerical or support staff to free up officers.
<p>
<li>	Recruit police from the ranks of the military. In addition to getting a "sure thing," in terms of discipline and training, hiring former military personnel increases the pool of qualified minority applicants.
	</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, it doesn't help matters when courts practice "revolving door" justice, allowing criminals back on the streets. Meese and Moffit say lawmakers at the local, state and federal levels should block the appointment of judges who place the rights of criminals over the rights of victims.
For state and local officials the heart of police reform is personnel management: knowing where to assign extra police officers, providing adequate training and hiring only the best and the brightest. "These back-to-basics reforms rely on innovative policing -- not more federal money -- and will have a real affect on fighting crime," Moffit says.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The amazing thing is not that the war on crime can be won by such common-sense measures. The amazing thing is that communities -- large and small -- haven't been doing these things all along.

<title>A Celebration of Indoctrination - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>A Celebration of Indoctrination</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Okay Sherman, set the Way Back Machine for 1984. President Reagan is running for re-election against Walter Mondale, and he's way ahead in the polls. Sort of like Clinton v. Dole, only the other way around politically.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So one day, one of Reagan's chief economists -- David Stockman, let's say -- represents the White House at a ceremony honoring a couple of teachers from Sacramento, Calif., where Reagan served as governor. What have the teachers done to merit this recognition?  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They have taught their elementary school pupils the wonders of supply-side economics! Public school children are enrolled in a program where they learn the story of "Boom Town" where taxes are low enough so people can invest in the economy. The economy booms, bringing more revenue into government coffers than ever could have come in had taxes been raised. The program is run by the public schools. As Mr. Stockman beams and the network cameras roll, the school kids recite such ditties as "Taxes Are Bad, Taxes Hurt, Don't Let the Feds Take Our Shirts." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, we know how the headlines will read the next day. Front page, full scream in the <i>Washington Post</i>: "REAGAN ADMINISTRATION APPLAUDS INDOCTRINATION OF KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS," with a sub-head: "Children Recite Supply-Side Dogma For OMB Director."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Is this fictitious scenario hard to believe? Not at all. Just move that dial Sherman, up to 1996 and the Clinton administration, and switch the politics around. Almost everything else is the same: On the 21st of October, Joseph Stiglitz, President Clinton's chief economist, represented the White House at an awards ceremony honoring two elementary school teachers, Deborah Shearer and Geanie Davis, from Little Rock, Ark. What had the teachers done to merit this recognition?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They had taught their pupils to spout a message the current administration would love to hear from school children -- and parents -- across the land: Don't cut taxes. Using the taxpayers' money, the teachers had taken it upon themselves to teach children the story of "Ginger Town," "using cookies to drive home the concepts of scarcity and wants," as one account put it. The children had learned ditties like "Oh Scarcity, Oh Scarcity! We Cannot Have It All. We Really Want A Lot Of Stuff, But Sometimes There's Just Not Enough." "We have unlimited wants for goods and services," explained little Kelsie Brown, who learned the term "wants" -- along with other economic jargon -- in kindergarten last year!
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"The main message of the program, funded by the school, was that taxes aren't so bad," one report said. "They learned that there are many things that are important that are publicly provided," said Ms. Shearer, who seems to have no idea that government funding is not something ordained by God in the scheme of things. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nor does she seem to bat an eye at the idea of using public funds to teach one side of an issue to students whose parents may totally disagree with her position. Ms. Shearer, of course, would be outraged -- and justifiably so -- were the situation reversed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"I wish you teachers had been more active 50 years ago, because then we would not now be faced with the Dole economic plan," Mr. Stiglitz beamed as reporters scribbled at the pre-election ceremony. No kidding!
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And speaking of reporters, there is, of course, one thing different about the two scenarios presented above: If President Reagan's White House had been party to such a stunt, the news media would never have let them hear the end of it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The media reaction to Mr. Stiglitz's celebration of indoctrination? You guessed it.

<title> Why It's So Hard To Save -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3>Why It's So Hard To Save</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As any economist can tell you, when you subsidize something, you get more of it. Give welfare checks to people who don't work, for example, and the number of people who don't work increases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The flip side is equally clear: If you tax something, you get less of it. For example, a few years back the government slapped a "luxury" tax on cabin cruisers and yachts costing more than $100,000. The result: Boat buyers decided not to buy new boats, and several U.S. boat builders went belly up --  throwing their workers into the unemployment line. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Which brings me to the point: Just as taxes on new boats kill demand for new boats, taxes on savings lead Americans to save less. Go ahead, try to squirrel away a few dollars for a rainy day (or a sunny day in Florida or Arizona when you retire). The government will thwart you at every turn, taxing your savings more heavily than just about anything else in the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Think about it: Assume you take $1,000 and put it in a certificate of deposit earning 5 percent. After one year, you've earned $50. Now, you already paid steep federal income taxes on that original $1,000 (between 15 percent and 39 percent) when you earned it. But that's not enough. The government taxes your modest $50 gain too, leaving only $30.50 in your pocket if you're in the highest tax bracket.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Welcome to the tax code: You're taxed when you work for your money, and you're taxed again when your money works for you. It's one of the worst features of our tax system, taxing people twice on money they're trying to save.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	About the only way to get some relief from this double tax burden is through Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), which let you sock away a few dollars and have the money earn interest tax-free.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But IRAs have their limits, the worst being that the government only lets you contribute $2,000 per year. The government also slaps you with a steep penalty if you withdraw the money before Uncle Sam says you can (currently age 59-and-a-half), so forget about using the money to buy a home or cope with a financial emergency. And don't think you can pass the money in your IRA on to your children without going another few rounds with the tax man. The government forces you to start withdrawing the money at age 70-and-a-half so it can collect income taxes again. Then when you die, the money falls prey to estate taxes and, when your children finally receive what's leftover, inheritance taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, that's Washington: It takes a good idea like saving money -- which provides the capital to grow the economy and create jobs -- and piles on so many regulations, penalties, and layers of taxation that saving hardly becomes worth the effort. If there's so little reward for thriftiness, why not spend, spend, spend?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's a better way. A proposal by Tom Kelly, president of the <a href="http://www.savers.org">Savers & Investors League</a> of Villanova, Pa., would eliminate the red tape and double taxation that makes saving so hard. IRAs? In Kelly's view, they're at best a good start. He proposes Individual Investment Accounts, a more muscular savings tool that would let you deposit as much of your money as you want tax free (no $2,000 limit), withdraw it for any purpose (hello new house), withdraw it at any age (early retirement anyone?), and let you pass it on to your children with no inheritance or estate taxes (sorry Uncle Sam, my kids come first).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's not a hard concept to grasp: If you want people to save more, you have to tax their savings less. So no more preaching from politicians about our low national savings rate until they do for savers what they've already done for yacht buyers.

<title>Wasting Your Money -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>Wasting Your Money </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 22, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With all the talk in Washington about slashing budgets, cutting deficits and axing federal programs, you'd think it would be hard (or at least harder) to come up with stories about government waste, fraud and abuse. After all, these are the first things Congress and the White House would do something about ... right?	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Wrong. Despite Congress' best efforts to trim the pork, big government is alive and well. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider:<ul>
	<li> Auditors for the U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) recently discovered that the Baltimore Public Housing Authority had purchased eight new Chevy Blazers as take-home cars for its top managers; hired a security firm that employed 29 convicted felons; and sold more than $25 million-worth of contracts for building repairs to contractors, some of whom were friends or relatives of Authority employees, without allowing competitive bidding. In spite of these irregularities, HUD recently awarded the housing authority $115 million more to construct 338 new apartment units.<p>
	<li> According to the General Accounting Office, the official auditing arm of Congress, the U.S. Export-Import Bank gave large bonuses to 200 of its 448 employees -- even though only 10 were eligible. Of five federal agencies reviewed for such "bonus abuse," the Ex-Im Bank had the smallest work force -- but accounted for one-quarter of all bonuses government-wide! <p>
	<li> The brothers Alfonso Jr. (Alfie) and Jose (Pepe) Fanjul, citizens of Spain, are two of America's richest sugar barons. Their fortune is estimated at $500 million. Because they are considered "domestic growers," the Fanjul brothers also are "entitled" to a government-enforced import-protection subsidy that adds about eight cents per pound to the cost of the sugar we buy. How much of our money are the Fanjul brothers pulling in from this subsidy each year? A cool $65 million.<p>
	<li> Financial mismanagement in the District of Columbia is legendary. In 1994, for example, Lloyd Arrington Jr., president of the city-funded Economic Development Finance Corporation (EDFC), collected a $17,000 bonus on top of his $70,000 salary, another $1,650 for parking and $600 for rented formal wear, dinners and entertainment. By the time his now nine-year old EDFC -- created to loan money to promising businesses 3/4 was audited in 1994, it had made only 17 loans, or less than two per year.<p>
	<li> HUD (again) funded and sponsored a "training session" for 260 public housing tenants and HUD employees in 1995 -- at the San Juan, Puerto Rico, Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort! "We promise you a vacation that will be unforgettable!! Casinos for Dads. Beaches, Swimming, Snorkeling, Dancing & Touring etc. ... for youths. Exotic Shopping, Beauty Salon for complete pampering for Moms. Appetizing, Savory, Delicious foods for the Family Meals," read the invitation. Cost to taxpayers for a "training session" later found by the HUD Inspector General to lack "programmatic substance" (in other words, it was a boondoggle)? $325,000.<p>
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's more -- much more. Like the new $373 million air-traffic-control system -- installed at 16 airports and destined for 47 -- that has suffered frequent shutdowns and failures. It has failed nearly once a week at Washington's National Airport. Or the Public Health Service physician who complained recently to <i>The Washington Post</i> that he is being paid $117,000 per year, plus a $15,000 bonus, to do absolutely no work at all. He made the front page. Or the $280,000 taxpayer-funded study now getting underway in Seattle to determine if a chemical widely used in sexual lubricants makes sex safer for homosexuals. Yes, you read that correctly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maybe now you can understand why Congress was willing to go to the mat with the administration -- to the point of allowing the government to shut down temporarily -- over federal spending. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	These horror stories are just a few of the boondoggles that have been uncovered. Just think what remains hidden from view. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is it that only liberals care about children and the needy, while conservatives seem more concerned about the well-being of defense contractors? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I ask this loaded question because it says a lot about the advocacy game as it is now played across America.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While many groups and organizations do essential, valuable work in communities across the nation -- often without credit or notice -- many national "charity" groups have their hands in the pockets of taxpayers. But this is okay because they "care." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider the recent "Stand for Children" rally in Washington, organized by the Children's Defense Fund and led by Marian Wright Edelman,  a good friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and a leading proponent of the spend-more school of social welfare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The CDF's idea was flawless. By using the theme "Stand for Children," CDF made it almost impossible for anyone to question its agenda: more government spending. To do so would appear, "against children." By dubbing this approach "non-partisan," the stage was set for a liberal welfare establishment-media lovefest, with conservatives as the main course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives didn't roll over and accept defeat. Instead we showed that the liberals' motives are not always as pure as they would have us believe. In the case of the "Stand for Children" rally, many of the organizations pushing the rally are on the public take -- receiving a grand total of at least $392 million in taxpayer funding in fiscal year 1994. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	No wonder these groups argue so passionately about the need for greater federal funding and are so vicious in attacking anyone who might question it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, these are the very same groups that line up to testify whenever Congress holds hearings on whether welfare spending should be cut. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If that sounds like a conflict of interest, that's because it is.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What makes the scam possible is that these groups are not required to reveal the fact that they are feasting at the public trough. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An organization might be getting 90 percent of its money directly from the federal government, and it can still go before Congress -- and the TV cameras -- and argue for more money for this program or that, without ever revealing that it is a recipient of federal funds. No wonder the welfare states keeps expanding. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There's no need for a new law, no need for the president to sign legislation to rectify this situation. All the Senate and House of Representatives have to do is change their own rules so that all advocates before Congress must state how much money they receive from the government. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under such a "Truth in Testimony" rule, representatives of, say, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) appearing before House and Senate committees would be required to disclose that their organization received $76 million from the federal government in 1993. This just might tend to shed a new light on AARP's heart-rending requests for more spending on programs for the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Similarly, union officials testifying on behalf of federal job training programs would have to reveal that their unions receive millions of dollars each year to administer these very programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Maybe some day the media might even catch on and report on the vested interests of many who regale Congress with pitiful tales of welfare woe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Until then, taxpayers should demand that lawmakers ask tax-funded "charities" two simple questions: "What's in it for you?" and "How much is it going to cost the taxpayers?" These are two questions Congress and the media have ignored, at least so far.

<h3> Socially Responsible Business </h3>

	The tragic ValuJet crash this spring, according to critics of corporate America, shows once again how the profit motive devalues and debases our society. If only ValuJet management hadn't cut corners to squeeze every possible nickel out of the system, the critics argue, the tragedy never would have happened. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Against this backdrop, let me recommend a new book to you: John Hood's "The Heroic Enterprise: Business and the Common Good," published a few weeks ago by the Free Press. Hood's book continues an important discussion launched some 35 years ago by the late John Chamberlain in "The Enterprising Americans." Chamberlain's book was a portrait of the towering figures of American enterprise -- the "robber barons," some called them -- who made America the great innovative industrial power it remains today: Eli Whitney, Samuel Morse, Cyrus McCormack, Cornelius Vanderbilt, Henry Ford, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, J. P. Morgan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Chamberlain's point was simple: That the achievements of American business should inspire all of us, as he put it, "not because the pursuit of business is a sanctified end in itself but because it palpably makes the achievements of higher ends possible." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But do GM, Hewlett-Packard, K- Mart, TWA, Wendy's and other U.S. corporations have a responsibility to society beyond providing goods and services and generating profits?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Advocates of corporate "social responsibility" -- popular on college campuses, in Ben & Jerry's ice cream parlors, at Grateful Dead smoke-ins, and in government regulatory agencies -- argue that companies have an obligation to fight injustice, promote the public's health, diversify the workplace, eradicate poverty and save the planet, either directly, through corporate philanthropy or (most typically) by order of Big Brother. 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While most of these are worthy goals, Hood demonstrates, as Chamberlain did before him, that business does more good for more people in more ways simply by sticking to business. In a Policy Review article previewing his book, Hood put it like this: "The corporate social-responsibility movement harbors an unrealistic, ahistorical view of commercial activity," focusing on disasters and villains, while ignoring "the revolutionary ways in which corporations have improved the everyday lives of Americans over the past half-century."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider just one small example: the U.S. gold-mining industry. As economist Michael Evans of Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management noted in a recent Las Vegas Review-Journal article, "private investment, new technologies and enlightened management" have turned the state of Nevada into the world's fourth-largest gold producer over the past 15 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The industry now provides nearly 60,000 high-paying jobs in the state, is known for its "unmatched educational, health and other benefits," and  pays some $120 million per year in state and county taxes. The industry also has spent billions of dollars on equipment built by other U.S. companies, generating additional jobs in other states. With the world demand for gold soaring, even better days could lie ahead.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Except for one fact: Washington doesn't appreciate the contributions of this "heroic enterprise." The government has restricted exploration, discouraged investment and placed a variety of other regulatory burdens on the industry. The net result: If current policies are not reversed, 40,000 mining-related jobs will disappear over the next decade. In two decades, the industry itself will disappear, according to Evans' research.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In many ways, the corporate social-responsibility movement is a red herring. As Hood notes, the best corporate citizens are those who create the jobs and amenities we enjoy and "the innovations that make our lives safer, healthier and happier."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I hope you will read Hood's "Heroic Enterprise." It will restore your faith in our system.
<p>

<h3> Dumb And Dumber</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A certain Mr. Wade Miller of  New Mexico recently called Atlanta's Olympic committee to buy tickets for the Summer Olympics.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"I'm sorry, sir," the voice on the other line replied. "I can't sell tickets to someone outside the United States."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yep -- you heard correctly. The sales office of the U. S. Olympic Committee didn't know that "New Mexico" isn't part of old Mexico. Though he tried, Mr. Miller could convince neither the operator -- nor her supervisor! -- that New Mexico is one of the 50 United States of America. The supervisor, getting on the line when Mr. Miller insisted, told him (you can just hear her tone), "Sir, new Mexico, old Mexico -- it doesn't matter. You still have to go through your country's Olympic Committee." 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When reporters from a Santa Fe newspaper asked for tickets, they were told -- once again -- to contact the Mexican consulate.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When I hear stories like this, I don't know whether to laugh or cry. At first, of course, I laugh -- I mean, it is funny after all. But then I start thinking about why it's funny. And then, I become a little more pensive. If people with so little basic knowledge are able to get jobs with the U.S. Olympic Committee -- as supervisors no less! -- it makes me wonder how many other people like this there are out there, and where they work. A nuclear reactor, maybe? 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason we laugh, of course, is because something we all secretly know has been exposed without warning, in all its irony: Our "education system" is now so bad it no longer transmits even the most basic knowledge to a great many people. And those people are becoming such a large proportion of the population that they now show up as employees of organizations as prestigious as the U.S. Olympic Committee.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm not exaggerating or overreacting here. I have a friend who used to be a television news reporter, who once took his camera and crew to the University of Maryland. He wanted to ask university students simple, basic knowledge questions in categories like geography, history, math and science to see whether they knew things anyone at that educational level ought to know. Some of the answers he got will make a believer out of anyone.
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two female students tried for a full minute to come up with the formula for finding the area of a rectangle, and finally gave up with embarrassed giggles. One young man couldn't say what part of the world Poland is in. Another simply walked away when asked what, for him, was apparently the stump question: Who was president of the United States during the Civil War?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"What three powers did we fight against in World War II?" was one question. To be fair, my friend says a few came up with the correct answer, with a few hints along the way: Germany, Italy and Japan. Then there was the young man who said, in a confident tone (my friend tells me this is a direct quote): "Well, the first one, I know, is Russia. The second one is Korea. And the third one, I understand, is Pearl Harbor."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pearl Harbor? What on earth is going on here? 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A student at a major U.S. university, and he not only can't answer a simple history question every American should be able to answer -- he doesn't even understand what is said to him? Pearl Harbor isn't a "power." It's a little country in the middle of the Atlantic; everybody knows that!
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have to wonder who signed a certificate of graduation from high school for this young man. What "educator" admitted him to a university? And how did he stay there, after he got there?
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The answer is simple, and not funny: He's a product of the same politically correct, "socially conscious" educators who have presided over the decline in American education during the past three decades. The reason they have resisted all change in their approach to education is also their great secret: they see this decline as a positive good. After all, academic excellence is just a form of elitism. It will be a great stride forward for social equality when everyone is on the same, dumbed down intellectual level. 	 
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What I want to know is: Who should District of Columbia residents call to get tickets to the Olympics? Atlanta -- or Bogota?

<h3> Politicking On The Workers' Dime</h3>
By Edwin Feulner<br>
President,  <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 27, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The silly season, otherwise known as the fall elections, is fast approaching.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And once again, one of the greatest travesties in American politics will be played out: Millions of Americans will be forced to help candidates and promote political positions they don't agree with. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How can such a thing happen in modern-day America? After all, isn't this the land of the free? Not if you're a rank-and-file union member in most states.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For years, big labor has engaged in one of the most undemocratic practices imaginable: using the dues workers must pay to the union as a condition of employment for partisan politicking. This year, with a friend of big labor in the White House, union officials are being more open about it. AFL-CIO President John Sweeney announced a few months ago that his organization would pump $35 million (seven times the amount unions usually spend on elections) into a nationwide campaign to unseat Republican congressmen he considers hostile to organized labor. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two-thirds of the $35 million Sweeney plans to spend defeating Republican officeholders will come from a special "tax" that was imposed on union members in March. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia do not have right-to-work laws. This means working people can be forced to pay union dues as a condition of employment. If they don't like the political choices of union officials, they're out of luck.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The money that organized labor admits spending on partisan politics is vastly overshadowed by various "in-kind" expenditures unions make on behalf of candidates or causes. The late, great labor reporter Victor Riesel several years ago estimated that big labor spends $10 on political mailings, phone banks and other "in-kind" services for every dollar it openly spends on elections. You do the math.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Virtually all this money goes to Democratic candidates and incumbents. Yet, in 1994, exit polls found that 40 percent of union members voted Republican, for the very pro-family, tax-cutting, budget-balancing Republicans Sweeney and his colleagues have targeted for defeat. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So what's  a union member to do? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For starters he or she may seek inspiration from a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision. In  the case of <i>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</i>, union member Harry Beck objected to the fact that his union dues were being used to fund political activities he didn't support. Beck challenged his union and won. The court ruled that union members can get refunds on that portion of their dues not devoted to costs associated with collective bargaining. In Beck's case, "that portion" was found to be 80 cents out of every dollar. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfortunately, when President Clinton took office, he weakened the impact of the Beck decision by rescinding former President Bush's order that required notices be posted in the workplaces of federal contractors, notifying workers of their rights under Beck. Clinton ordered the notices be torn down. So much for being on the side of workers!
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 	Union politicking is nothing new and unions have a right to participate in the electoral process. However, fair-minded citizens should ask whether it is just to force union members to pay for political activities--including helping candidates--with which they may not agree. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is not a partisan issue. If you're a liberal or a Democrat, all you have to ask yourself is how you would react if the tables were turned: How would you feel if John Sweeney planned to spend $35 million in coerced union dues to help Newt Gingrich and his allies? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	You'd be pretty angry.<p>

<h3>Tune in to Talk Radio</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 27, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Americans who think there's a liberal lilt to the news reporting they hear and read every day no longer have to rely on us cranky conservatives for affirmation. The evidence is now overwhelming. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When asked their political philosophy in a recent survey, 61 percent of 139 Washington bureau chiefs and congressional correspondents said "liberal" or "moderate to liberal." Just 9 percent said "conservative" or "moderate to conservative." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Almost nine out of 10--89 percent--said they voted for Bill Clinton in 1992. This compares to just 7 percent for George Bush and 2 percent for Ross Perot. As for party affiliation, 50 percent said they were Democrats, just 4 percent Republicans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As for journalists nationwide, 56 percent of the 2,703 surveyed in a huge Los Angeles Times poll conducted in 1985 called themselves "very liberal" or "somewhat liberal." Just 18 percent said they were "very conservative" or "somewhat conservative." Several other studies by media analysts Robert and Linda Lichter, among others, have shown substantially the same. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Does this necessarily mean journalists allow their political beliefs to bias their news coverage? Of course not. But it sure raises certain suspicions when these cool, detached "professionals" get things wrong in a way that makes the conservative Congress look bad and the liberal White House look good. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Take just one example: the debate last year over reforming Medicare, the health-care system for America's 37 million senior citizens. Everyone by now knows that Medicare is rapidly going bankrupt and has to be reformed: There is no choice in the matter. But when conservatives <I>tried to slow down the built-in rate of increase</I> in Medicare spending--not cut spending, mind you, just slow down the rate at which costs are going up--congressional liberals accused them of making mean-spirited "cuts" that would hurt the elderly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	How did the media respond? Although reporters were shown repeatedly that over seven years Medicare spending would increase by $100 billion over and above current levels--from $4,900 to $7,100 per person--the vast majority of media reports told readers and viewers that the conservative plan would "cut" Medicare. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Backtrack three years, to the debate over President Clinton's liberal health-care reform scheme. That plan would have increased Medicare spending at the same rate as the 1995 congressional plan. Yet, the media didn't assail the president for "cutting" Medicare. Like congressional conservatives, President Clinton took pains to make it clear his administration wasn't "cutting" the program, saying: "Medicare [is] going up at three times the rate of inflation. We propose to let it go up at two times the rate of inflation. That is not a Medicare cut." The media took the president's explanation at face value. Two years later, they pounced on Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The double standard has become so obvious few bother to deny it. In fact, many observers are beginning to recognize that the "talk radio" phenomenon has come about precisely because there is such a wide gulf between what people know to be true and what the media frequently tell us is true. Would Rush Limbaugh have 20 million listeners if Americans had been hearing both sides of the issues for the past several decades? I doubt it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Talk radio is the steam valve for political discourse in contemporary America. Liberals--not consciously, but effectively nonetheless--have been holding down the lid for decades. But the pressure became too great. Liberals stopped paying attention to one little outlet--AM radio--and all the steam came blasting out in a "rush" (sorry, I couldn't resist).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	 So next time a news report gives you the sneaking suspicion that the reporter is spending too much time chatting with Kennedy clones at liberal cocktail parties, you're probably right. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<h3>"It's The Economy, Stupid," Circa 1996</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Presidential advisor James Carville, the highly regarded Democratic political operative from Louisiana's bayou country, helped keep the 1992 Clinton campaign in focus and "on message" with a simple four-word phrase, "It's the economy, stupid."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the White House is smart, this will not be its theme in 1996. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Though the White House and national media have been trumpeting the economy's "unexpectedly strong" (as The Washington Post put it) 2.8 percent first-quarter gain, this is modest growth by normal standards -- and voters remain uneasy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Flash back four years: With the American economy just emerging from a two-year recession in the fall of 1992 and many Americans nervous about their economic prospects, Carville's one-note samba -- played over and over again throughout the campaign -- clearly helped propel Bill Clinton into the White House, forcing George Bush to retire to his beloved Texas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now it's Bill Clinton's turn to run for re-election. And though the economy is not moving backward (the definition of a recession), it's not setting any speed records either. Fifty percent of major U.S. companies trimmed their payrolls in the 12 months ending June 1995, some of them significantly. Indeed, from March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The public -- especially the nearly 8 million people who are working two or more jobs to make ends meet -- know something is amiss. And they are concerned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration's initial response was a mix of denial and cheerleading: the silly claim that the economy is the healthiest it's been in 30 years. The White House has had the good sense to back off a bit from this claim.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A new study shows why.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">study</a> was conducted by economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> using a highly reliable computer model of the U.S. economy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What the model does is simulate economic activity. By feeding the many "variables" that affect the economy into the model -- from changes in tax and budget policy to data on population growth and other demographic factors -- a seasoned economic forecaster can predict future economic activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Beach and Hodge turned the clock back to January 1993, before the new administration pushed the $241 billion tax hike through the 103rd Congress. Without getting into all of the mind-numbing technical details, they then ran the model on "fast-forward," asking it to tell them what the economy would look like today if tax and budget policy had not been changed in 1993.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What they found was not good news for the White House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They found that another 1.2 million Americans would have jobs today if the economy hadn't been saddled with the tax increase. They learned that the U.S. auto industry would have built and sold an additional 1.1 million new cars and light trucks. And they learned that the typical U.S. wage-earner would have taken home an additional $2,600 in after-tax income.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The big numbers are equally disturbing. For example: The overall U.S. economy would have grown an additional $208 billion between 1993 and 1996. And business investment -- the key factor in creating jobs -- would have been $42.5 billion higher.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While there has been some quibbling about the exact details of the Beach/Hodge findings, the overall thrust of their work remains unchallenged: Tax hikes hurt, and the huge 1993 tax hike hurt big time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If the Clinton administration wonders why American workers are still uneasy about the economy, they should tell the White House: "It's the tax hike, stupid!"
<p>

<h3>Your Right To Know</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a>
<br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 16, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. 	Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government  --  and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called "The Right To Know Payroll Form."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The "Right To Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans With Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security.        
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. 	Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look moneywise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out  --  in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right To Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Then, all the rest is taken out  --  Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92.  	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government  --  much of it before they even know about it  --  they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Are Conservatives Winning Or Losing? -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>ARE CONSERVATIVES WINNING OR LOSING?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	When Ronald Reagan won the presidency in 1980, many Americans thought it was time to dance on the grave of big government. Instead, conservatives themselves bogged down in a bitter eight-year political war with dozens of special interests -- from farmers to welfare workers -- who depend on big government for their livelihoods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When conservatives took control of Congress in 1994, many of us again thought we had scored a victory for smaller government. Wrong again. President Clinton gave as good -- or better -- than he got from the new Congress. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, over the past year big government has continued to get bigger. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't until the president's 1996 State of the Union declaration that "the era of big government is over," that I truly began to believe conservatives finally had won. After all, when an opponent is forced to mouth words he doesn't believe, words that go 180 degrees in the direction opposite his political leanings, in short, the very words his opponents have been saying, this is when he has lost the war -- at least the rhetorical war -- the war of ideas. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But conservatives will have to fight tooth and nail for every inch of territory they gain in the next few years. Liberalism has not surrendered; and we'd be naive to expect it to. After all, it's just too much fun spending other people's money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In fact, those Americans who were really paying attention had a rude awakening following President Clinton's grand declaration about big government's demise. Untrue to his word, the president's first request to the returning Congress was for $8 billion in new spending for the current fiscal year. His fiscal year 1997 budget offered more of the same: a $358 billion increase over the levels proposed in Congress' seven-year balanced budget plan. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All these efforts will have to be strenuously opposed, and in years to come, gleefully overturned. In the meantime, conservatives will have to buckle down and think about what it means to govern. After all, the Republican Congress has encountered some rough going of late. Is this any surprise? Legislative governance -- that is, passing laws that do what you want them to do -- is not easy. It's like trying to herd cats.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatives are unaccustomed to running Congress; they've been backbenchers for decades. This requires an adjustment. It requires a period of learning. There is nothing inherently disgraceful in the failure that comes from such learning -- except not learning.  	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Yes, the conservative agenda articulated in the House GOP's Contract with America remains largely unfulfilled. Perhaps too much was attempted. Perhaps compromise was dismissed too easily in the fervent desire for real change. Perhaps the message became too unfocused and thus susceptible to redefinition by the special interests and the media. These are understandable, forgivable mistakes. I say learn and move on.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What do conservatives need to learn? For starters, when they campaign against each other in primaries, they have to stop attacking other conservatives for espousing great conservative ideas. For example, the defining issue of the 1996 presidential campaign should have been -- and still could be -- the <a href="/heritage/taxsite">flat tax</a>. One candidate, so intent upon defeating flat-tax candidate Steve Forbes that he was willing to say practically anything, called the flat tax idea "nonsense." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tell that to Hong Kong, whose flat-tax economy has been the most consistently expanding in the world for the last 30 years! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax is one of the most marketable, most urgently needed -- by Americans of all income levels -- ideas conservatives have proposed in decades. Yet, in their pursuit of political gain, conservative candidates obscured the issue in a flurry of flying fur. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Conservatism's message has been confused in the past year, by the rough and tumble of Washington politics. But that can be remedied. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberalism's message, on the other hand, has become utterly irrelevant to America's aspirations and values. It is beyond redemption. That's why liberals have to cloak themselves in conservative rhetoric just to get a hearing. This bodes well for the future of America. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The principles of conservatism -- free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values and a strong national defense -- don't change in the middle of a presidential election or a budget battle. They don't change whether Republicans are in power or Democrats are in power or whether that power is shared, as is presently the case.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	I am optimistic about conservatism because what we believe is enduring. I am optimistic because liberalism is a disaster that can no longer be disguised. I am optimistic because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not wishful thinking. And I am optimistic because people genuinely want to get this country back on the right track. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America.

<title>Clinton's War on the Armed Forces - Heritage Commentary
</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Clinton's War on the Armed Forces</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	President Clinton has said, "the era of big government is over." But so far, it looks like it's over for only one area of government -- national defense. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The administration is looking for a 6 percent cut in the 1997 defense budget. While that may not seem like much, it will further starve an already hungry armed forces wizened by nearly a decade of consecutive budget cuts.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider this: The president wants to cut procurement  -- purchasing of parts, machinery and equipment our troops use in the field on a daily basis -- by $3.4 billion. Yet, when adjusted for inflation, procurement is at its lowest level since the beginning of the Korean War. It hasn't been trimmed -- it's been hacked with a meat cleaver, by more than two-thirds in the last 10 years.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now some of you may be thinking, "Hey, the Cold War is over. Communists are now nothing more than cabana boys in third rate dictator-run countries like Cuba. What could be wrong with a major downsizing of our military? The United States doesn't need to be a super power when there is no other super power to worry about."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The only problem with this line of thinking is that while the magnitude of danger may be less -- no one threatens us with total annihilation the way the Soviet Union once did -- the volatility of danger is much greater. Rogue nations working to obtain nuclear and chemical weapons -- Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Libya -- don't care if the United States is a super power. All they care about is bullying their way onto the world stage -- and they're getting the weapons to do it.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In recognition of this, the Clinton administration itself has said that the United States needs to be able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously. Yet, the White House has failed to provide the funding that would enable the Pentagon to meet this goal. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In addition to procurement, the Pentagon's "operations and maintenance" budget is being bled to death -- siphoned off into areas not related to combat readiness. Peacekeeping operations in Bosnia, Haiti, Rwanda and Somalia between 1992 and 1995 have cost American taxpayers some $6.6 billion. None of these missions contributed one iota to U.S. security.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the American military is being weakened by starvation. Consider: In 1995 the Pentagon was not allowed to buy a single new tank. By the year 2005, every tank in the Army will be older than the soldiers driving them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It wasn't too long ago taxpayers were told that Pentagon chiefs favored hammers costing hundreds of dollars and toilet seats that should have been gold plated for what we paid for them. There was no excuse, of course, for such excess. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But essential investments in the day-to-day operations of our fighting men and women --  and combat readiness -- should not be confused with the waste of the past.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	President Clinton does the armed forces a disservice when our soldiers and sailors go without essential training because equipment is broken and there are no parts to fix it. Pentagon chiefs are now regaled with stories of maintenance crews "cannibalizing" other pieces of equipment to make Band-Aid repairs on equipment that has worn out.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Clinton administration wouldn't have committed the United States to being able to fight and win two regional wars simultaneously if military planners didn't consider such a scenario -- say in Korea and the Middle East, for example -- a distinct possibility. But if the Pentagon isn't given the training, equipment, spare parts and supplies it needs, it can't fulfill this mission.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Or, our fighting men and women can be thrown into the middle of a conflict without the proper support, and we can just hope for the best.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Is this the administration's military strategy?   <P>

<title>Environmental Flip Flops - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3> Environmental Flip Flops </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>April 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Liberal activists once again have used the occasion of Earth Day to scare people into believing the environment is in such bad shape that more government programs are needed to "protect" us. One favorite theme is the alleged global population explosion.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the last five years alone, U.S. newspapers and magazines have published more than 7,200 articles on this subject. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now, the latest rave in environmental circles is a new book claiming a devastating drop in male fertility over the past half-century, threatening our very ability to reproduce. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
OK, so which is it? Are we about to overpopulate ourselves to death, or die out as a species? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As most Americans realize, environmentalists are constantly sounding the alarm about something or other. Fortunately, most of us know instinctively that a healthy dose of skepticism is in order -- that the doomsday stories are a bunch of baloney (itself alleged to be a health hazard, because of the chemical preservatives in the meat).  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all of the stories involve highly complex scientific issues that a nonscientist can't possibly understand. Which is why its so important to put things in perspective. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The newest "danger" on the horizon involves a somewhat racy subject: sperm. According to the new book, various chemicals in our diets and environment are wrecking havoc with our genetic material, lowering global sperm counts to dangerously low levels and threatening the future of life itself -- man and animal alike.   
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to the overheated publicity materials being sent out by the New York publisher, studies have documented "as much as a 50 percent drop in human sperm counts over the last 50 years." Oh really?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Predictably, supporting the book's claims (here's where perspective is important) are some of the same people who have been hollering the loudest about global overpopulation, urging the United States to support United Nations and Planned Parenthood birth-control efforts. Now, instead of financing condoms for Chile and Chad, America is supposed to do something about the fertility deficit in Fiji and France.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This is precisely the kind of contradictory flip-flop confusion that raises skepticism about the entire environmental movement.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, the agenda of environmental alarmists is the same as it has always been: Convince the American people that modern chemicals are deadly and evil and stampede the government into spending more money on more programs that will further restrict our choices and freedom.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The bottom line, of course, is that environmentalists can't have it both ways. We can't have a global population explosion and a fertility crisis at the same time. As Mr. Spock of "Star Trek" might put it, "It doesn't compute."

<title>A Tax Code To Love? -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3> A Tax Code To Love?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>March 25, 1996
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Don't look now but it's that time of the year again. The dreaded tax season is here. To say that most Americans don't like the current tax system understates the obvious. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's because it truly is a mess. Americans struggle to comply with a tax system that has more than 400 different forms. The amount of time individuals and businesses spend collecting all the needed data and filling out all the required forms: an estimated 5 billion hours each year.  What a waste!
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	And compliance isn't cheap. Individuals, families and businesses spend an estimated $200 billion per year on accountants and lawyers to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service. Just think how crazy that is: The government will throw you in jail if you don't pay taxes according to a scheme it has made so confusing you have to hire a lawyer to figure it out! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There has to be a better way. And there is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By now I'm sure you've heard all sorts of claims about an idea that is frequently discussed by economists, realtors, policy-makers and presidential contenders alike: the flat tax.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Just so you know, the reason so many people in high places want you to reject the flat tax is because they are the ones leeching benefits from the current system, and they don't want anybody messing with their cash cow.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The flat tax works like this: All taxpayers would pay the same tax rate, for example, 17 percent. No confusing tax schedules, no steep accountants fees; just one form, the size of a postcard. The rich would pay far more in taxes than the everybody else -- contrary to critics' claims -- since, after all, 17 percent of a million dollars is a lot more money than 17 percent of $35,000. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">study</a> by my colleagues at The Heritage Foundation recently showed that the flat tax <a href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/0waisdocid%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th.src%3ATEXT%3A79219%3A1%3Ddiamond%3A210%3B2%3DUSHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th%3B3%3D5136314%2079219%20/usr/wais/data/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th/tl04.house.jul95.wais.data%3B4%3Ddiamond%3A210%3B5%3DUSHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th%3B6%3D5136314%2079219%20/usr/wais/data/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th/tl04.house.jul95.wais.data%3B7%3D%2500%3B">proposed</a> by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., -- one of several proposals under consideration -- would lower taxes on all income groups, especially the poor and middle class. The plan's generous deduction, $33,000 for a family of four, would exempt most low-income households from any federal income tax. Some 24 million families that pay taxes now would pay none under the plan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Also, unlike the current system, which may tax the same dollar up to four different times (the personal income tax, the corporate income tax, the capital gains tax, and the estate tax), dividend and interest earnings from savings and investment would not be taxed. In other words, instead of being penalized for investing your money, you would be taxed just once 3/4 when you earn the money. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This would encourage more Americans to put their money to work in the economy -- and instead of dragging the economy down, the tax system would start revving it up.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Of course, one of the most attractive features of a flat tax is its simplicity. Everyone who has wrestled with a Schedule C or a 1040 form or has had to collect receipts for every charitable contribution in the mad rush to get everything in the mail by April 15 could simply -- and quickly -- fill out a postcard-sized form. What literally once required hours could be done in a few minutes during your lunch hour! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But before you get too excited, remember: A lot of special interests don't want to part with the advantages (a tax break for this, a loophole for that, a deduction here, an allowance there) that the current tax system gives them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Practically everyone agrees that America's tax system needs a major overhaul. Instead of spending precious time cursing the tax code, perhaps our lawmakers will soon replace it with one that everyone (except the special interests, of course) can love.

<title>Lower Education --  Heritage Commentary</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h2>Lower Education</h2>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ever wonder why most young people -- even those who have attended prestige colleges or universities -- don't seem to know a whole lot about life or the world around them? 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It could be because in the headlong pursuit of top-rated sports teams, expensive, over-specialized research facilities, and -- let's be frank -- money, America's most prestigious colleges and universities have forgotten their basic task: to teach students something about history, literature, mathematics, the natural sciences, foreign language, philosophy and English. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason most "Generation Xers" don't come away from college with such a "bottom-line" education is simple: It's no longer required of them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I don't make this accusation lightly. According to a study just released by the National Association of Scholars (NAS), America's leading schools of "higher" education have eliminated most of the core academic requirements once considered essential to a liberal-arts education. At the 50 colleges and universities identified by U.S. News & World Report as "America's best," the commitment to a structured general education "has largely vanished" over the past 30 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, there has been "a purging from the curriculum of many of the required basic survey courses that used to familiarize students with the historical, cultural, political and scientific foundations of their society," the NAS study shows.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Of course, the study merely quantifies what many of us have been observing about American education for decades: U.S. educators have forgotten what education is all about. According to NAS President Stephen Balch, America is "in danger of losing the common frame of cultural reference that for many generations has sustained our liberal, democratic society."  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to the NAS study, the number of top schools that require what we used to call "freshman English" has dropped to just over one-third. Only 12 percent still require math; only 34 percent require students to study science; only 2 percent require the study of history; only 4 percent have required courses in philosophy; and not a single one of the top schools requires students to study great literature.    
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even the school year has been shortened, from an average of 191 days in 1964 to only 156 classroom days in 1993. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	"To a considerable extent, the structured curriculum was dashed to pieces during the late 1960s and early 1970s when the rage in higher education was a radical libertarianism based on notions of `relevance' and the assumption that a special insight belonged to youth," the NAS study states. As a result, colleges and universities today "can no longer guarantee that students acquire a basic knowledge of their civilization and its heritage." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The product of all this, in the words of my late friend, philosopher <a href="/heritage/kirk/kirklink.html">Russell Kirk</a>, is "lax institutions at which every lad and lass can succeed, because all standards for entrance or graduation have been swept away." We end up with students "able to ascertain the price of everything -- but the value of nothing." 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	That's what you get, dear parent, for $10,000 to $25,000 per year and rising, when you send your son or daughter to America's most prestigious colleges and universities.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	If I were you, before I spent that kind of money, I'd get my hands on the NAS study, send it to the president of the college or university your child has chosen, and demand a response.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Drifting Toward a Taiwan Crisis - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>DRIFTING TOWARD A TAIWAN CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 8, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a blatant show of intimidation, the People's Republic of China (PRC) is now firing missiles at targets just miles from Taiwan's largest cities.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The missiles are intended to undermine the Republic of China on Taiwan's democratic government -- which will hold its first-ever presidential election on March 23.  
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;And why shouldn't the PRC feel perfectly free to bully one of America's best friends in Asia and its 7th-largest trading partner? After all, the Clinton administration has done little to give China pause as to the consequences of such acts. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, instead of clearly spelling out what America's response would be if the communist Chinese attack Taiwan -- thus discouraging such aggressive acts -- the blundering Clinton foreign policy team has lent encouragement to the Chinese. For example, an unnamed State Department official told U.S. News & World Report last October that U.S. military action was unlikely. "We would not be in a position to react with force," the official was quoted as saying. "We would not elect to do that, I'm sure," he added.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Certainly not. Of course, a 12-year-old could figure out that even if this were true -- which it shouldn't be -- you don't go telling a potential adversary about it. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration not only shouldn't be saying such things, this should not be its policy either. The administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan, period. Nor should it rule out the use of force if the Chinese decide on such a reckless course. In fact, instead of standing by while the PRC lobs missiles in Taiwan's direction, the United States should be holding naval exercises in the region: to send a message of our own. Instead, when the U.S. aircraft carrier Nimitz made a run through the Taiwan Strait in December, administration officials -- who could have just kept their mouths shut! -- were quick to assure all parties that the move was due to inclement weather in the Pacific. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By failing to tell China's leaders where America stands, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could enslave the citizens of Free China, place every U.S. ally in Asia at risk, and wipe out what little confidence our Asian allies might still have in our reliability in a crisis. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Before it's too late, President Clinton must make sure Beijing understands that America feels a moral obligation to defend Taiwan, and that it will do so, come what may. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After all, the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act -- U.S. law -- states that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States." The president should reaffirm that it will regard violations of Taiwan's rights as a threat to U.S. security and will act accordingly. He should tell China it could face not only severe economic sanctions -- ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo -- but also the full military might of the United States.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Such steps should be taken now, before the real shooting starts. After it starts, America can only lose. Even if a PRC-initiated attack on Taiwan didn't spread any further -- and there's no guarantee that it wouldn't -- China would have successfully challenged America's ability to protect its allies. Other challenges would follow, in Asia and elsewhere.      
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, the reason China is threatening to come to blows is that it's scared of tiny Taiwan. Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States last June -- to speak at a class reunion at his alma mater, Cornell University -- China has been rattling its saber. Chinese amphibious and airborne military assault exercises involving 20,000 troops, 40 ships and 100 aircraft -- designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan -- preceded the island's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway now. China fears that Taiwan will be seen as a model for political reform on the mainland, and is resentful of Taiwan's growing economic prosperity, based on a Western-style free market. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most portentous of all, the PRC may be preparing for a more decisive confrontation with Taiwan in the future. In a speech Jan. 30, Premiere Li Peng said that "During the period [1996-2000] ... settling the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese people." Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that "the important role to be played by the Army in taking back Taiwan," was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the face of such challenges, President Clinton so far has chosen to hide his head in the sand. This makes America appear weak, not just to China, but to Taiwan and our other Asian allies as well. If America doesn't even have the nerve to talk tough to China before a crisis erupts, why should anyone believe we would defend Taiwan with force in the event of an attack? 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There need not be a military crisis over Taiwan. All it would take to insure that it doesn't come would be some tough talk and a little saber rattling of our own. 
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What's so hard about that?

<title>Liberalism's Last Stand -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<font size=6>Liberalism's Last Stand</font><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>February 23, 1996<BR>
</FONT>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals are making a big deal out of President
Clinton's rebounding poll numbers, seeing in them a repudiation
of Congress' conservatism. Nice try, but the budget battle between
Congress and the White House - the occasion for the president's
popularity spike - is actually liberalism's last stand.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Traditionally three pillars have propped up the
liberal nanny state: the federal tax system, entitlement programs
and special-interest pork. The budget debate, by placing the national
focus squarely on fiscal sanity and common sense, has dealt a
severe blow to all three.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Start with entitlements. Even after the 1994 elections
gave conservatives control of Congress for the first time in a
generation, nobody expected lawmakers to tackle the No. 1 enemy
of fiscal restraint: entitlement spending. Yet one year later,
serious efforts are underway to reform three of the four largest
entitlement programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and cash welfare (known
as Aid to Families with Dependent Children).  </FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals are willing to go to incredible lengths
to defend the status quo -- for example, by lying about Medicare
&quot;cuts&quot; when spending would rise from $4,800 to $7,100
per beneficiary. Entitlements used to be the liberals' ace in
the hole when Americans thought the &quot;rich&quot; were funding
them. But now that we know who's really paying -- our children
- even Americans who believe strongly in the entitlement programs
concede we have to make reforms.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Further frustrating liberals is the fact that the
days of freewheeling pork-barrel spending are coming to an end.
While Congress' 1996 spending bills contain their share of pork,
there's a lot less than in the past. The transportation appropriations
bill, for example, eliminated all &quot;highway demonstration
projects,&quot; which cost taxpayers millions of dollars a year.
As the traditional beneficiaries of the pork-barrel system liberals
are grieving its impending demise.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Finally, there's taxes. It is inconceivable that
anyone but the most hidebound liberal would argue that America
needs a tax hike. On the contrary, the debate today is not over
whether to cut taxes, but by how much. This is true even though
Congress is in the midst of a historic effort to balance the budget.
Liberals hoped the need to eliminate the deficit would compel
Americans to accept high taxes as a necessary evil, at least for
the time being. Not so. Most Americans want both a balanced budget
and tax cuts. If that means cutting spending more, so be it.</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Moreover, the budget debate is only the first round
in the larger fight over taxes.  As those of us who served on
the Kemp Commission on tax reform (which recently came out in
support of a flat tax) know full well, the current system has
virtually no defenders. Not only is it too costly, forcing Americans
to send an average of one-fourth of their income to Washington,
but it is unfair, overly complex, anti-investment and punitive.
 How in the world are liberals going to defend such a system?</FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Liberals love to point out that the 104th Congress
has accomplished only a small part of its agenda. Yet from a conservative
standpoint this is a huge victory. By simply changing the terms
of the debate, conservatives both in and out of Congress have
seen to it that the country's inexorable march toward bigger government
has been halted in its tracks.  </FONT>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> On the issues that matter -- taxes, entitlements,
and the corrupt and costly pork-barrel system -- the conservative
philosophy has routed liberalism. That's why the budget debate
 which is really a proxy for the larger battle over the size and
scope and government -- is liberalism's last stand.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=6>FDA: The Smoking Police<BR>
</FONT>

February 23, 1996<BR>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Is the government supposed to protect us from everything
that could possibly harm us? Or are there some areas where we
should be responsible for taking care of ourselves?</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Take teenagers and smoking. The Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and its Commissioner David Kessler are getting ready to
pounce on America with a litany of new regulations aimed at stopping
teens from smoking. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> The FDA's proposed restrictions include:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning cigarette vending machines and self-service
displays in stores;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Requiring tobacco companies to launch a $150
million-per-year nationwide TV ad campaign to discourage underage
smoking;</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning the use of tobacco brand names on T-shirts,
hats, keychains and lighters; and</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>Banning brand-name sponsorship of sporting events,
such as the Virginia Slims tennis tournament.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Of course, we all agree underage teenagers shouldn't
smoke; that's not the issue. The issue is whether the FDA should
launch yet another extravagant regulatory crusade whose nuisance
value will likely outweigh any benefits. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Remember: this is the FDA that conducted the 1991
raid that captured 24,000 half-gallons of Citrus Hill &quot;fresh
choice&quot; orange juice, all because the agency didn't like
the way the o.j. was labeled! Are the food and drug police now
going to swoop down on every mom and pop grocery store to make
sure teen employees aren't smoking in the boy's room? </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Apparently so. Since 1990, the FDA's staff has grown
from 7,600 to 8,700, and its budget has ballooned from $598 million
to $760 million. They've got to do something with all that extra
manpower and money.</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> So, now they're going to send out an army of regulators
whose job will be to make sure mom and pop conceal cigarettes
from view - as if this ever stopped a teenager from doing something
he or she was determined to do. Store workers will have to take
time out to deal with every tobacco transaction, since cigarettes
will only be sold from behind the counter and not from self-service
displays. The watchdogs will probably even send in teenagers paid
to test the system. If something slips through the cracks, out
come the handcuffs!</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Come on. American University student and former
Heritage Foundation intern Jennifer Murray may have said it best
in a recent essay when she accused President Clinton of forgetting
what it's like to be a teenager. &quot;Formula-One racing cars
painted with tobacco company logos, billboards at sports events,
advertisements in magazines (particulary of those men on horseback)
- none of these had anything to do with my [former] tendency to
light up,&quot; Jennifer confessed. &quot;The main contributor
was something President Clinton's 'solutions' would only encourage:
rebellion.&quot; The new federal regulations, far from preventing
teens from smoking, &quot;by focusing additional attention on
the forbidden, could actually entice them,&quot; Jennifer warns.
 </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Isn't there someone more qualified than the FDA
orange juice police to address this issue? Such as parents?</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Let's get real. As Jennifer pointed out, &quot;Banning
cigarette ads and vending machines will do more for President
Clinton's wavering image than it will for teens.&quot; Does anyone
really believe the president is lying awake at night worrying
about teen smoking? I kinda doubt it. But he is worried about
being popular in an election year. </FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> Smoking sure isn't as popular as it used to be.
And everybody cares about kids.</FONT>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <FONT SIZE=2> You do the math.<BR>

<h3>WHY THE BUDGET DEBATE MATTERS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 15, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	CBO, OMB, baseline budgeting, reductions in the rate of 
growth.  To most Americans the budget battle between Congress and the White House has been 
impenetrable, a duel over accounting methods "explained" in acronyms only the initiated can 
understand.  No wonder many Americans are tuning out, or worse, focusing on the only part of 
the debate they can grasp -- the partisan sniping.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a shame. The budget debate is the most important 
political discussion this nation has had in a generation -- a debate over what kind of country we 
want the United States to be.  On one side are those who want the federal government to possess 
unlimited resources, the better to fix every conceivable social problem the country might face.  
For debate purposes, these are the liberals. On the other side are those who believe the federal 
government's power should be strictly limited, the better to preserve personal freedom and allow 
individuals to keep what they earn.  These are the conservatives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The budget is the battlefield on which these two visions for 
America clash, and no issue highlights the divide between these two camps more boldly than 
taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For conservatives, the tax issue boils down to one simple 
question: Whose money is it anyway? If, as conservatives believe, the money people earn 
belongs to them, then taxes should be kept as low as possible.  Which means current tax rates 
need to be cut.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Liberals focus on a different question: How will tax cuts 
affect Treasury receipts?  The measure of tax "fairness" is not whether Americans are forced to 
pay too much, but whether the government has all the "revenue" it needs to run its myriad social 
programs. In this view, the American people not only have a duty to pay steep taxes, but should 
feel honored for the opportunity to help create utopia right here in the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Or take another hot-button issue: welfare.  The debate is not 
about "ending welfare as we know it," as the president vowed to do during the 1992 campaign.  
In truth, we all want to end welfare as we know it: liberals, by increasing spending on a variety 
of programs that, after the Great Society's many failures, will finally (they hope) replace welfare 
with work;  conservatives, by spending less and weaning people off their dependence on 
"compassionate" government.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On foreign policy,  the budget debate casts into stark relief 
serious differences over America's role in the world. It's probably true, as liberals claim, that they 
do not view America as the world's policeman.  In reality it's worse: They view America as an 
international welfare agency whose social workers (read: soldiers) can and should criss-cross the 
globe doing good deeds like keeping peace and building nations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	None of this is said to disparage liberals as people.  With 
the best intentions they have guided -- or misguided -- our national policies for the better part of 
the 20th century.  But now liberalism is choking on its own political success.  It's overarching 
goal -- a vast federal government mobilized to redress all social ills -- has been achieved, but at 
the cost of almost $80,000 in public debt for every family in America. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite its continuing failure at the polls, liberalism refuses 
to go quietly.  In the current budget battle,  liberals have ruthlessly employed the only weapons 
remaining in their arsenal: fear and distortion.  For example, the proposed Republican balanced 
budget calls for a 7 percent annual increase in Medicare spending; liberals portray this as a 
"cruel" cut.  GOP efforts to return power and responsibility to the states are portrayed as a secret 
scheme to kill school lunches or hurt the poor.  And plans to rein in the spiraling costs of 
Medicare, which is heading for bankruptcy as sure as this is 1996, is depicted as an attempt to 
deny health-care benefits to the elderly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is that kind of misrepresentation that betrays the fatigue 
liberalism is feeling these days.  It has no new ideas to offer, no agenda other than preserving the 
status quo.  For this reason the current budget battle may very well be one of the last debates in 
which 1960s-style liberalism even has a voice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Note: This essay by <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a>, president of <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, a Washington-based think tank, is adapted from his latest annual essay 
on "The State of Conservatism."

We were 35 minutes ahead of TWA Flight 800 on the runway at John F. Kennedy International Airport.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But for a whim, we would have been on the later plane. A TWA flight to Rome, departing within minutes of ours, was cancelled. The Rome passengers were put aboard TWA Flight 800, to make connections in Paris. We were not aboard TWA because, at the last minute, our travel agent found a bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Close friends and family knew of our destination, but few knew whether we were flying with Delta or TWA. When we arrived in Todi, our hostess had been up most of the night, fielding calls from our friends in America -- wanting to know what she knew.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She had verified with a kindly Italian airline clerk that we were indeed on the Delta flight, that our names were on the manifest, that we probably watched "Grumpier Old Men" on the inflight movie. He reassured her and she relayed the news to America. We didn't learn of the TWA crash until we arrived in Todi.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We settled into the enchanting stone house overlooking the Umbrian hills, and called home. We thought our family would like to hear our voices. We knew we wanted to hear theirs. We spent the next few days and nights swinging helplessly between polarities of alternating emotions, haunted by images of a plane exploding, plunging through the night into the dark sea, taking with it 230 men, women and children -- fathers, mothers, daughters, sons who would never see another day.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Frugality saved our lives. At least that's what we told ourselves. But we could not escape the eternal question, a soulful and frightening version of the tragic challenge: Why us? Or more to the point, why not us? Frugality is not a virtue that spares lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Indeed, the night after we arrived in Todi we went out to an especially fine, and expensive Italian restaurant and there we spent far more on food than we saved with the bargain on Delta.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Whatever we do now suddenly feels strange and precious. We are like children tasting a fresh fig for the first time, discovering the extraordinary in a blade of grass, a clay cup, a barking dog, the crunching sound made by the tires against the stones in the dirt road, the shapes of the white clouds scurrying across the sky as they begin to turn a beautiful shade of gray.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Everything is beautiful. Everything counts. We can't settle for the commonplace experience of a vacation. This vacation must mean something more. We feel compelled to testify to life, to our senses, to our appreciation of the world in all the wondrous variety of God's infinite gifts to man.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We celebrate with fresh bread and old wine, the trivial and the contemplative. Whatever we look upon and listen to is nourishment for the soul, linking us with others through succor and sustenance.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Umbria is a special place to think about the inexplicable. Its earthy colors, punctuated by acres of sunflowers and threaded with cypress trees, is a region of gentle, verdant, undulating hills and valleys where St. Francis of Assisi fed the birds. He was a man of prayer and penitence whose poetry in praise of all living things is a lesson to us still.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We rediscover the Sistine Chapel at St. Peter's. We look at Michelangelo's glorious fresco of God giving life to man. God barely touches man's fingertips and the spirit is suddenly tangible. We stand in awe of the vividness of the image, now illuminated in a gorgeous restoration of color. We ask again the eternal questions that haunt every thoughtful man and woman tormented for the answers to the questions about the meaning of life and death.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We do not find the answers. We say a silent prayer for the passengers aboard TWA Flight 800 and mourn with their families. We leave the Sistine Chapel chastened and uplifted, sobered if not wiser. The forces of evil and terror wound deeply and destroy with enormous power, but such dark forces ultimately have no power to smash the human spirit. <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=6>The shattered fairy tale<BR>
of Charles and Diana</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><DD>The marriage and divorce of Princess Di and Prince Charles
is a fairy tale for our time. Their story has all the appropriate literary
ingredients.<BR><DD>Prince Charming may not be as gallant as we like our princes to be, and we
don't know whether Cinderella turned out to be so terrific either. We only know that the shoe
fit.<BR><DD>Royal watchers chatter about the many ways Prince Charles and Princess Di were
mismatched, but the original Sleeping Beauty was mismatched with her prince, too. She slept
through the last 100 years. At least Di was awake in the 1980s.<BR><DD>There's also a jealous
Other Woman in the Di and Charles fairy tale triangle. Camilla Parker Bowles is a mistress of
the prince, not the mean stepmother, but she gets no sympathy from the rest of us and deepens
our empathy for the hardships endured by Di. The princess once remarked with bitter wit: "There
were three of us in this marriage so it was a bit crowded."<BR><DD>An angry Queen Mother also
pulls her weight against the princess, not letting her keep the title "Her Royal Highness."
That's a little like giving her back the glass slipper after it's broken, but at least she gets
to live in a palace.<BR><DD>Lots of fairy tales include dwarfs and rogues, unpleasant little
people who try to put something over on the princess and who frequently disguise themselves as
something finer. Does anyone doubt that Capt. James Hewitt, who kissed the princess and told the
world about it, and more, is such a stunted human being? The princess describes his "handsome
physique," but everyone thinks that such physical perfection must camouflage an ugly character
inside.<BR><DD>People in disguises in fairy tales are free to say outrageous things, half-truths
and lies, because the princess cannot see the wickedness within. Capt. Hewitt may later turn
into an ass, literally, reflecting his nature in outward form, but even without the tall ears we
can see that he's a donkey. When his tell-all book was published in London, Tory Member of
Parliament Sir Nicholas Bonsor said, "I cannot comprehend how he can still look at himself in
the mirror." Mirrors tell the truth. Snow White's royal stepmother discovered that to her
dismay.<BR><DD>I've been reading fairy tales (that's what happens when a grandson comes into the
family). Fairy tales are more illuminating and insightful during this pre-election season than
Bob Dole's inexplicable gaffes and Bill Clinton's "conservative" conversion pronouncements. One
man on the road to ruin, the other on the road to Damascus. (Read your Bible.)<BR><DD>I've
discovered what John Updike saw in a collection of Italian fairy tales: "They were the
television and pornography of their day, the life-lightening trash of a preliterate
peoples."<BR><DD>We're fascinated by the stories of Princess Di and Prince Charles for the same
reasons medieval men and women repeated fairy tales and for reasons these stories remain
popular. They're rooted in the reality of human emotion, both conscious and unconscious, an
awareness of wishes and desires that make us do strange and irrational things. They also grow
out of the culture and history of their time, at the upper reaches of society as well as what we
would now call the underclass.<BR><DD>No one -- certainly no one who has ever been part of a
couple -- believes any couple lives happily ever after, but it's fun to imagine they do. That's
no longer possible as newspapers, zoom lenses and an increasingly permissive society bring the
philanderings of the prince and the promiscuousness of a princess into our living rooms. You
might call this "defining deviancy up."<BR><DD>We no longer need to pretend that royal
personages act any different than commoners. But the British, unlike their American cousins,
must consider whether it's worth it to them to continue to support in such a lavish fashion a
modern royal family which creates such a cultural embarrassment. Americans may pay thousands of
dollars for faux pearls to turn Jackie Kennedy into faux royalty, but at least we don't pay
taxes to invent happy fairy tales we know aren't so.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times

<BR><DD>We get the leaders we deserve. Such cliche may be glib but it's not without insight.<BR><DD>The character issue is dismissed as irrelevant and hence unimportant, and Bill Clinton holds a large lead over Bob Dole. Explanations, such as they are, abound.<BR><DD>First, Bill Clinton has been through a trial by fire and is no longer burned. We knew that he was no angel, but 43 percent of the voters gave him a plurality to win in 1992. So who cares?<BR><DD>"Filegate" may change the polls in ways that the conviction of his business buddies in Arkansas did not. But that's certainly not clear yet.<BR><DD>Character and politics seem to have little to do with one another. The Democrats have succeeded in sticking unfair descriptions of "extremism" on the Republicans. Bill Clinton knows how to read the polls and promise the American people exactly what they want, which is what a lot of the extremists promised first.<BR><DD>The rap on Bob Dole, who nearly everyone agrees is a man of character and integrity, is that he cannot turn his virtues into victory. He hasn't persuaded the American people why he wants to be president. Besides, "he's too old." That may be inaccurate, but it's a powerful perception nonetheless.<BR><DD>Hence, better to elect a deeply flawed young man than a decent "old" man. Sophisticated Europeans understand this amoral approach. They could never understand how a successful president like Richard Nixon could be brought down by the clumsy cover-up of a third-rate burglary.<BR><DD>But Americans have been a deeply moral people in matters of money, sex and power. When a leader shows lapses in any one of these categories, we react by electing someone who is dramatically deficient in those vices.<BR><DD>Gerald Ford, a stolid congressman, conspicuous for his ordinariness, restored a measure of confidence to the office of vice president after Spiro Agnew disgraced it by taking money under the table. Jimmy Carter had lust in his heart, but he kept it there, and he was upright and virtuous in his personal habits, a sharp departure from Jack Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson, leaders whose private behavior was unscrupulous, promiscuous or unprincipled, or all of the above.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton has surmounted scandals of sex, money, and power, at least so far. No one cares about Gennifer Flowers any longer and Paula Jones has been relegated to the wrong side of the tracks, beyond feminist concern. The Little Rock trials demonstrated that as governor Bill Clinton had criminal associates, but he has not yet been found guilty of anything illegal. Not yet.<BR><DD>In fact, the public appears to be extremely forgiving of Mr. Clinton. He could promise a middle-class tax cut in his campaign in 1992 and drop it completely after he won the election. He could seek the lifting of the arms embargo on the Croats in Bosnia, and once elected drop it. The voters don't care. Not yet.<BR><DD>Bob Dole supporters, down in the dumps about his poll ratings, insist that his ultimate integrity will win out if he's able to connect with powerful conservative issues that he has not yet articulated with any force -- slower growth in Medicare and Medicaid, balancing the budget, school choice, English as our binding language and a foreign policy that won't suffer from "misguided romanticism." But they seem to be trying to persuade themselves first.<BR><DD>A fascinating book called "Character Above All" measures 10 presidents from Franklin Roosevelt to George Bush on elements of character. The most provocative essay is by David McCullough, Harry Truman's biographer. He reckons that "character counts in the presidency more than any other single quality."<BR><DD>Could we find another president like Harry Truman? "Who knows?" he replies. "Maybe somewhere in Texas she's growing up right now."<I><BR>

<font size=7>The rising tide of 'Wifewater'</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Hillary Rodham Clinton has done more for educating the public in the principles of modern feminism than Gloria Steinem or Betty Friedan, the early superstars of the movement.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>She climbed to the nexus of power using everything it takes. Like many male wheeler-dealers before her, she took ethical risks which, now that they have come to light, are like curses. Chickens coming home to roost.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No wonder that she's taking a solo trip to Eastern Europe to celebrate the Fourth of July in Prague. Wicked wags in Washington say, unkindly, that she's looking for a country that doesn't have an extradition treaty with the United States.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For anyone who doesn't yet know her offenses, a quick read of the majority report on the Whitewater hearings will fill in most of the blanks. Many ethical lapses lead in and out of Vincent Foster's office and continue to fuel speculation not only about why he committed suicide, and where, but how his files mysteriously disappeared from his office with the help of Hillary's staff: "From the moment that she was notified of Mr. Foster's death," the committee says, "Mrs. Clinton and her key agents -- Margaret Williams and Susan Thomases --were engaged in the subsequent handling of documents in Mr. Foster's office."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That means they dealt with papers about Whitewater and Travelgate that were -- and are -- potentially damaging to the First Couple, which the first lady knew were in Vince Foster's possession.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What we have here is a pre-White House/post-White House scandal in which Hillary Clinton is accused of hiding or destroying documents from her law firm, and for holding on to files when they were subpoenaed by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, two years earlier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"At every important turn, crucial files and documents 'disappeared' or were withheld from scrutiny whenever questions were raised," the committee charges. One of the most damaging bits of evidence are her fingerprints on the late-recovered billing records of the Rose Law Firm found in the White House residence last August. Although other fingerprints were found as well, the others are not those of anyone who was in that part of the White House the day the files were found.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's more, the billing records -- which Mrs. Clinton says she's "happy" were finally found -- reveal that Hillary lied about the amount of time she spent on the shady side of the Whitewater and Castle Grande land investments. She had the most to lose if the billing records were made public.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Naturally, the Democrats are trying to diminish the importance of her activities, attacking the committee report as blindly partisan. They'll have lots of time during the campaign to make their side of the argument. What may be more fascinating for the rest of us is to consider is how Hillary has played the cards handed to her, and its implications for the future course of feminism.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What's abundantly clear is something many feminists are loath to accept. A woman in power -- however that power is obtained -- is little different from a man in power. She can use it for better or for worse, but being a woman has very little to do with it. Lord Acton's famous dictum applies to her, too: "Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mrs. Clinton gingerly slides back and forth into mini-feminine dramas, putting on pink and granting interviews with favorite reporters to talk about menus and White House decor. Such appearances are carefully orchestrated for maximum political impact. Just as a man will occasionally use his "sensitive" side to highlight how much compassion he has, he knows that really power resides in his tough positions. No man knows better how this works than Hillary.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>A chorus of friendly critics has frequently suggested that if only Hillary Clinton had come clean about Whitewater and Travelgate she could have quickly put it all behind her. This overlooks the possibility that maybe there was something to hide. You can only come clean if you are clean.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The First Feminist doesn't get the First Man off the hook, either. No matter what his wife did, Mr. Clinton as governor and then as president is responsible for her semi-official actions affecting the public good and bad, whether by arranging to have employees in the White House travel office cashiered, or in causing elderly blue-collar Arkansans to lose their savings in bad land investments.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The late, great Satchel Paige, who had a curve ball that could go around a mountain, used to say that it's dangerous to look back because "somethin' might be gainin' on you." If Hillary is brave enough to look back, she might recognize it.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BODY>
</center><DIV ALIGN=Right><FONT SIZE=2><B>LONDON</B></DIV></FONT><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've always enjoyed the comfort and easy convenience of the London underground. The tunnels and cars lack the grime, grunge and menacing quality we associate with most big city transportation. New York this is not. Not yet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But today the London subway is emblematic of the cultural changes that reflect a deterioration in manners, morals and civility that we've always associated with our ever-so-polite English cousins. Graffiti is everywhere. Litter is more prominent than it used to be. Rudeness is commonplace. A fear of violence lurks in spontaneous discourtesy.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I boarded a subway car on June 8 with dozens of young men heading for an important soccer match at Wembley. They wore the black leather jackets of hooligans, swigging beer from cans, unshaven and loudmouthed, singing rowdy drinking songs.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>When two English bobbies boarded the same car, these young men switched to verses of "Old MacDonald's Farm," drawing attention to "the pigs" with a boisterous "oink oink here, and an oink oink there." The bobbies showed their customary patience and forbearance, holding steady lest a riot break out. But it was scary as well as shocking to feel adolescent intimidation kept in check only by police firmness.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Brits worry about violence breaking out whenever their soccer team plays, and commentators are much in demand to lend historical perspective to bad behavior. But England is wary this month as it hosts "Euro 96," the soccer championships of Europe.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One professor, who directs the soccer research unit at Liverpool University, traces the roots for modern hooliganism back hundreds of years, when young English working men went abroad to fight. This is to explain how the fighting spirit lives on in the shrunken psyche of a small island nation. But soccer as the Crusades? Others argue that violence and aggression among the lower classes are psychological compensation both for Britain's poor athletes and bruising social realities. Wobbly legs made me do it. Or maybe it was Lady Thatcher.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>After this mindless drivel how can it hurt for a foreigner to offer her instant analysis? What seems to be at work is a growing tolerance for anti-social behavior such as we thought was rampant only at home.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I lived in London in the "Swinging Sixties"; I have no illusions about the coarsening of manners in the city once identified with propriety. But remembrances of the Beatles and Carnaby Street, miniskirts, mod ties and Chelsea mornings evoke a nostalgic high of innocence. We're talking about the loutish rebellion that has followed them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Behaving badly, loud swearing and filthy insults, drinking and fighting in what the stylish English critics have dubbed the "New Lad" culture has been elevated to a lifestyle of perverse glamour that's begun to upset even the cultural elites that created the monster.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The defenders of nastiness and the violent underpinnings of the "New Lads" are in cowardly retreat, hiding behind the feeble defense that they never expected their irony and wit to be drunk straight up as it was "democratized down."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"The New Lad style was taken up by a mass of young men who had little in common with their counterparts in Medialand," writes Cosmo Landesman, a critic bewailing the decline of civil standards in London's Sunday Times. "These were the prole-lad-tariat, and they had no interest in irony. Here was loutishness without the alibi of quotation marks. Now the middle class of Medialand are horrified by what they've unleashed."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sound familiar?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first to speak out against moral decline in London, are, like their American counterparts, conservatives who were derided as "right wing" squares, cranks and old fogies. But old fogies have a way of cranking up influence over time. The starting point for most cultural and political debates in England -- as in the United States -- is right of center.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Recently Bill Clinton, ripping off another conservative issue, called for curfews for American children as a means to control violence by youngsters. The British Labor Party was inspired to quickly follow. But Tony Blair, head of the Labor Party, suffers the same problem (without the character issue) afflicting Bill Clinton. The farther he runs to the right, neglecting his core support, the more he risks becoming merely a bleached imitation of the political opposition.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Lefties in England face the same dilemma that lefties in the United States confront with our president. Can they trust their leader to run right and govern left? If not, why vote for watered-down conservatism? Good question.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>The hip young man in khaki Dockers and the striped Henley has a problem. He's just met a young woman he thinks he might like a lot. But before he can unreel his line she tells him: "I'm into abstinence."<BR><DD>He's heard this lady's line before, at cocktail parties where nothing stronger than sparkling water of expensive vintage is served, on or off the rocks. Should he take it personally, or put it down to the luck of the draw? The third or fourth time he hears it he might wonder, is something else going on here?<BR><DD>Sometimes such a woman sounds like the incredible tease that every boy's mother has warned him about. But who, male or female, needs this or any other come-on in our sex-drenched age, when every man can be a libertine without even trying.<BR><DD>But wait: from almost anyone's circle of acquaintances among single women in their 20s and 30s comes a repeated refrain: They're tired of a man's great sexual expectations. In this game even liberty has its limits. A woman wants to get to know her man before she knows him.<BR><DD>Since the dawn of the sexual revolution, which was supposed to have put all aright, sex and not love has preceded intimacy, and the intellectual and emotional titillation that a man and a woman find in the first thrill of a romance has been reduced to days, sometimes hours. Some women, determined to regard themselves as gifts to the men they expect to love, call themselves recycled virgins. They're transformed in mind if not precisely in every aspect of body.<BR><DD>Premature mating, they believe, puts at risk the delicious journey of discovery that courtship provided for generations upon generations of young adults before them.<BR><DD>Few of us want to return to boy-meets-girl conversations on a front-porch swing with Mom, Dad, two brothers, three sisters and the neighbors looking on and listening in. (Nobody has a front porch, anyway.) Nevertheless, the easy flirtation of style over substance, with no guarantee of even a call the next day, may be becoming yesterday's weapon, the discarded Gatling gun in the war between the sexes.<BR><DD>The men in the trenches of this warfare want something better than a casual hayride, too. David Klinghoffer, who writes the "token man" column in Women's Quarterly, understood just how times had changed one Sunday morning when, on a Hamptons weekend with several other eligible young men, he found himself in the usual fight over the newspaper. Everyone reached not for the arts or book review sections, or even the sports pages, but for the wedding announcements. Who among their friends was lucky enough to be on the latest casualty lists from the front?<BR><DD>Many unattached young women so despair of finding Mr. Right they suspect themselves of the commitment-phobia they accuse young men of. How else to account for always choosing the wrong man, which ultimately keeps them free from a lasting attachment? Of course, with wrong men as plentiful as the mosquitoes on a summer's night at the lake, sometimes a girl can't help herself.<BR><DD>The Victorians, whose manners and morals are not always any longer a source of merriment for the sophisticates of our age, raised romantic love to elevated heights by introducing an element of the sacred into the pursuit of pleasure. They linked sensuality with divinity, sexuality with divine approval. A man regarded a woman as "saint-like," or "heavenly," an angel of light sent to restore his faith in life, love and marriage. Or tried to. Instead of sleeping together, courting Victorians attended church together. This required an appreciation of sexual abstinence and chastity, even if occasionally observed in the breach. They understood that romantic love without opposing resistance could have all the flavor of Juicy Fruit left overnight on the bedpost.<BR><DD>Julia in Byron's "Don Juan" linked remorse with temptation:<BR><DD>"A little still she strove, and much repented,<BR><DD>And, whispering 'I will ne'er consent' -- consented."<P><I><BR></I><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR></I> <FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<BR><DD>Big Bob Dole and little Billy Clinton are strapping on the shootin' iron for the shootout at Gender Gap. Like the Clantons and Wyatt Earp at the O.K. Corral, they're itchin' to show the wimmen just who the real man is.

<BR><DD>Neither of these men strike any resemblance to Gary Cooper, to stretch the metaphor, but each is desperate to convince the ladies that he's a man who knows how to protect women, children and the community from bad guys in black hats.

<BR><DD>Women ought to find it offensive that any candidate thinks he can woo a woman on the basis of her &quot;gender&quot; (what in our pre-euphemistic days we called simply, sex.) But in a world where voting blocs are about differences, and women make up a majority of voters in almost every economic category, it can't hurt to target women. Picking up their votes is another matter.

<BR><DD>Bob Dole, who is looking for a quick fix for his depressing poll numbers, decides that women's issues might help him cross the finish line first. He cites day-care funding in the Republican welfare-reform bill, which Bill Clinton vetoed twice, as well as the balanced budget and regulatory reform, which are Republican initiatives that provide strong reasons why women should vote Republican in November.

<BR><DD>Bill Clinton, who is better at seducing women with his sensitive and puckered lower lip, is aggressively wooing blue-collar women, who voted in the presidential elections in 1992 but who stayed home in the 1994. Some women are harder to seduce than others.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women in focus groups describe the president as a &quot;wussy&quot; and a &quot;pantywaist,&quot; according to Hanna Rosin in the New Republic magazine. They're not charmed by his boyishness or his chameleon-like changes. They're familiar with untrustworthy men who promise them moonshine at midnight and disappear in the harsh light of morning.

<BR><DD>These women, who have been described by pollsters as Angry White Women, do not have a college degree, and they're too smart to be impressed by Hillary Rodham Clinton trading on her husband's position to achieve the perks of power. High-powered patronizing women like the first lady are the nemesis of women who would rather stay home with their children than put their children in day care, if only they could afford it. Feminists who scorn men as white male devils make them uncomfortable; some of those men with pitchforks and forked tails happen to be their husbands.

<BR><DD>Blue-collar women are the biggest losers when public schools decline and they can't afford an expensive private school, like, for example, Bill and Hillary Clinton. They're a natural voting bloc for such conservative temptations as school vouchers, dumping affirmative action (which hasn't much benefitted them and certainly not their husbands), and illegal immigration which sometimes takes theirs and their husbands' jobs.

<BR><DD>Abortion is often not an emotional issue for these women, but most are appalled (like most of the rest of us) that Bill Clinton vetoed a bill banning partial-birth abortion (nothing short of infanticide), which liberal feminists railed at in China, but accept in our own country.

<BR><DD>If blue-collar women are angry and disconnected from feminism, middle-class mothers feel like Rodney Dangerfield, who &quot;don't get no respect.&quot; They're stressed to the max.

<BR><DD>A survey of more than 18,000 women for Parents magazine turned up some surprises. Sixty-eight percent of the working moms say they work for money, not emotional or intellectual satisfaction, up 12 points in seven years. Big majorities of mothers prefer part-time work to full-time work when their children are young. A mere 4 percent say they would choose full-time work. Though 49 percent of working mothers say they envy at-home moms, only 11 percent of at-home moms envy working mothers.

<BR><DD>Readers of Parents magazine make up a special sampling because nearly all of them live with their husbands, have been married only once, and more than half are college graduates. They are especially open to listen to Bob Dole's critique of the president for vetoing balanced budget proposals and welfare-reform bills. This would have put more money in their pocketbooks, to spend or save as they see fit.

<BR><DD>Most startling of all is the majority - the majority - of young mothers under 25 who say they prefer the lifestyle of the 1950s, the decade the feminists love to hate; 43 percent of these mothers say they long for the security and less pressured lives of that decade. A 24-year old mom captured their sentiment succinctly, describing herself as a &quot;June Cleaver Wanna-be.&quot;

<BR><DD>Neither Bill Clinton nor Bob Dole will woo their votes. These women vote very much like their husbands, and aren't interested in life in Gender Gap.

<title>Fumento: New Gun Law Penalizes Cops - 1/8/97</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>January 8, 1997</i><p>
<h2>Cops Pay the Price for New Gun Law</h2><p>
<P>  
	Lt. Dale Barsness was truly one of Minneapolis's finest. A 28-year veteran of the police
force, he had just been promoted to head the homicide department. But now he may lose
everything, courtesy of our national lawmakers.
<P>
	A month before the election, Congress approved and President Clinton signed a law
proposed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D.-N.J.) forbidding anyone who has committed a misdemeanor 
act of domestic abuse from possessing a handgun.
<P>     
	In Barsness's case, the act in question (details are unknown) occurred back in 1991. He
pleaded guilty and served his punishment. Yet he is now on a six-month administrative leave
while the department decides whether it has any choice but to fire him.
<P>     
	If he loses his job, his ex-wife told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, "it hurts the people
who were hurt in the first place: his children and his ex-wife."  
<P>     
	Lautenberg and Clinton championed the bill as necessary to protect women, children, and
other living things, but it was essentially a ball of fluff--99.9 percent substance free. 
Already persons who commit domestic felonies are forced to turn in their guns, so by
definition the bill only targeted lesser offenders.
<P>     
	In support of the proposal, the White House cited a Justice Department figure that of 
the 1.7 million incidents of domestic violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  But
that comes out to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot or even
that bullets were fired. Considering that almost half of all Americans own guns, guns and
domestic violence hardly go hand in hand.
<P>
	But nobody in Congress had the guts to point this out, the law passed, and now it's 
time to pay the piper.  Officers across the country like Dale Barsness are doing the 
paying--as are the citizens that such police serve and protect.
<P>     
	Police departments are now scouring their files to see if any of their officers were
ever convicted of misdemeanor domestic abuse--10 years ago, 20, 30, it doesn't matter. Once a
conviction is found, the officer may be fired or reassigned to a permanent desk job.
<P>     
	It hardly seems fair to take away a cop's livelihood because of something he did a
decade ago, even as the average time served for murder in this country is about six years. It is
even more unfair to slap him or her with penalties that were unforeseeable when the officer
pleaded guilty.
<P>      
	How would you feel if a new law mandated that the speeding ticket you pleaded guilty
to 15 years ago now results in your license being revoked, your car impounded, or your
first-born sold into slavery?  You might wish you'd gone to court and fought that ticket,
huh? Picture Bill Clinton saying: "Ah feel your pain--but it's too late, sucker!"    
<P>     
	The Constitution clearly forbids laws which make something a crime after the act has
already been committed.  But for some reason, penalties slapped on after a crime has been
committed is a shadier area. Thus, while the gun law may still be legal.
<P>     
	Further, though the law was billed as a crime-fighting measure, in practice it may
impact only crimefighters themselves. (It might also be applied to soldiers.)
<P>     
	"It's being unfairly applied to our people since we're the only ones with the capacity
to check our people and take our guns away," said Sgt. Bill Clayton, a Denver cop and head of
the Denver County Police Protection Association. "For us, it's the tools of the trade, like
taking a hammer away from a carpenter," he told me.   For other persons who have committed
past acts of misdemeanor abuse, he says, "There's just no way to enforce it."
<P>     
	Exactly. The new law can be used to take away guns from all persons convicted from now
on.  But even the most ardent gun-control advocates wouldn't dare call for making lists of
domestic abuse violators and systematically ransacking their homes looking for firearms--not
that the idea of it doesn't make them feel warm and tingly all over.
<P>     
	In Denver, two cops with 37 years' experience between them are in danger of losing
their jobs because of the new law. Meanwhile, Clayton points out, "In the state of Colorado, a
convicted felon can get a gun after ten years but if convicted of a misdemeanor domestic
abuse, you get a life sentence [preventing your from] carrying a gun."
<P>     
	"I don't know how they got this [law] through," said Barsness's ex-wife.  "I think
there were a million people sleeping."
<P>     
	Maybe, but the lawmakers were wide awake.  Clinton fervently backed the bill, and the
Senate twice voted for it by a margin of 97-2. House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave it his
explicit support.
<P>     
	This truly was a bipartisan act of cowardice and foolishness.</P>

<title>Fumento: Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation - 12/18/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 18, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation</h2><p>     
<P>
     They're mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore.  For almost seven years
environmentalists have had to put up with people (like me) crying, "Remember Alar!" as
shorthand for bogus science and health scares. But now, they're striking back.
<P>
     For those who don't recall, the Alar scare began in February, 1989 when reporter Ed
Bradley began a 60 Minutes segment by calling Alar "the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food
supply." Alar, manufactured by Uniroyal Chemical Co., was sprayed on apples to keep them on
trees longer so that fewer would fall to the ground and rot before they could be picked.
<P>
     It was this substance that the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) decided to
scapegoat to illustrate the horrors of man-made chemicals. The 60 Minutes segment was part
of a campaign by a PR firm the NRDC had hired, called Fenton Communications.  The rest of
the campaign consisted of helping reporters write scary articles, enlisting the support of
actress Meryl Streep, and creating an NRDC front group called Mothers and Others for
Pesticide Limits.
<P>
     In short order, terrified people were dumping their applesauce into the trash, apple
juice down the sink, and swearing off apples entirely for "healthier" foods.  (You know, like Hostess
Twinkies.) Soon Uniroyal felt it had no choice but to stop selling its product to apple
growers, some of whom then went bankrupt.
<P>
     In the ensuing months, though, articles, monographs, and even whole books by myself and
many others revealed that the NRDC-Fention effort was, as I put it, "one of the slickest,
most cynical fear campaigns in recent American history."  Few people dispute this nowadays,
and it drives the environmentalists bonkers.
<P>
          Thus author and long-time environmental doomsayer Paul Ehrlich, in his new book
<U>Betrayal of Science and Reason</U>, calls the Alar debunking a "fable." A recent article in the Columbia
Journalism Review (CJR), published at the nation's most prestigious journalism school, was
entitled: "Myths," with the subtitle informing us "The Alar `Scare' Was Real."
<P>
     Their evidence, however, is embarrasingly flimsy and often downright false.  For one,
the NRDC and other environmental groups claim the EPA banned the chemical. CJR writer Elliot
Negin gives a date for the ban, saying the decision was "in late 1989." Ehrlich informs us
that three years late, "the EPA issued a statement reaffirming the sound scientific basis
for banning Alar."
<P>
     Sorry Charlies, but the EPA never banned it in the first place, much less reaffirming
any ban. Once Uniroyal withdrew the product for use by fruit growers, the EPA considered the issue
moot. Further, to this day Alar continues to be used on plants which don't produce food.
<P>
     A simple phone call to the EPA would have revealed this.  But apparently
environmentalist crusaders have better things to do with their time.
<P>
     Any other evidence?  Well, Negin makes much of the fact that Washington State apple
growers lost their suit against 60 Minutes alleging their products were wrongly disparaged.
<P>
     In the wake of the decision in the O.J. Simpson criminal trial, such utter confidence
in the court system is truly touching.  But in any case, the courts didn't rule that Alar is
carcinogenic or evil or anything like that. They simply said the apple growers had failed to
meet the extremely high standards needed to win a suit against a media outlet.
<P>
     Finally, both Negin and Ehrlich and other revisionists remind us that both the EPA and
the International Agency for Research on Cancer had labeled Alar "a probable human carcinogen."
Neither writer points out that the studies these agencies had relied upon to make this
classification later proved to have been terribly sloppy. That's why the EPA had
commissioned several new ones. But the NRDC, rather than await the outcome, decided to
launch its scare campaign instead.
<P>
     Neither writer points out--nor do any other environmentalists--that all the evidence
against Alar was always based on the findings of tumors in mice, while the same doses of chemical
caused no tumors in rats. The EPA had simply arbitrarily decided that mice in this case were
a better surrogate for humans. Had the rats developed the tumors and not the mice, they
could well have decided that mice were the better surrogates.
<P>
     All of this is explained in detail in my book Science Under Siege.  Ehrlich, for one,
quotes from that book repeatedly, in an attempt to refute it.  But rather than meet its arguments
head on, he simply ignores them.
<P>
     This, alas, is all too typical of environmentalists.  Evidence that challenges their
world view is inadmissable to them. All that matters is that their myths live on forever. 
Alar-as-deadly-poison was a myth in the making that was cut off at the knees--and deservedly so.

<title>Fumento: Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda - 12/11/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 11, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Women's Magazines Are Pink Propaganda</h2><p>     
<P>
 I don't know about you, but when I want a real scare I don't pick up a Stephen King novel
 or rent a movie like Curse of the Demon.  No, when I want a real bone-chilling I go to my
 neighborhood news stand and look at the covers of the women's and family magazines. Where
 else, I ask you, can you find such headlines plastered over the face of Kathie Lee Gifford
 or Claudia Schiffer:  "Schools That Make Kids Sick," "The Foods That Are Poisoning Your
 Child," "Are Pesticides Poisoning Our Children?" "The Woman Who Stole 5,000 Babies,"
 "Stranger Danger," "The Infidelity Epidemic," and "EPA Warning: How the Sun Can Kill Your
 Kids."
<P>
 My favorite?  Hmm . . . That would probably have to be: "Shocking Report: 
 Babysitters who Maim and Kill."  Boy, that'll keep a parent up at night, won't it?  Or at
 least keep the parent from ever going out again until the children are old enough to stay
 home alone. 
<P>
Professor John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis did a poll in
which he found that women were far more likely to buy into the latest fad scare than were
men.  While he wasn't sure of the reason, I'll bet these magazines have something to do
with it. The Washington, D.C. watchdog groups Consumer Alert and Media Research Center
appear to agree.  Indeed, their recent study, "Women's Magazine's: A Liberal Pipeline to
Soccer Moms," found that in addition to lipstick and tampons, what these magazines
specialize in selling is fear--and the notion that Big Government is almost always the
solution. Looking at a year of offerings from 13 such magazines, with a combined
circulation of over 66 million, the organizations found most stories on science and risk
issues served no other purpose than scaring the skirts off readers--outnumberingd balanced
articles by two-to-one.
<P>
Among them:
<ul>
<LI>Family Circle in last August's article, "Danger in the House," warned of a "chemical invasion" from cleaning solutions and garden pesticides.  The evidence?  Well, there's this spooky anecdote about a mother who blamed a neighbor's pesticide spraying for her daughters' stomach aches and vomiting.  That's enough for you, isn't it?  After all, mother knows best. 
<LI>McCall's and Better Homes & Gardens warned of pesticide residues in baby food.  The McCall's article warned that babies and children are more sensitive to pesticides than adults (a supposition, not a fact), but never let readers know that government sets pesticide standards to account for individuals who are 1,000 times more sensitive than average. 
<LI>Articles in Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Weight Watchers reported the alleged link between chemicals and breast cancer, without noting that the largest study ever conducted on the subject looked at two of the most often-mentioned culprits -- the insecticide DDT and the insulating liquid PCB -- and found no connections.  Weight Watchers even condemned scientific studies that pointed to such causes as genetics and diet as sexist because they "suggested it was a woman's fault if she developed breast cancer." Next thing you know, even saying the words "breast cancer" will be politically incorrect because it suggests that it's a woman's fault that she has breasts.  And what all this has to do with watching your weight I just can't figure out. 
</ul>
<P>
 Once these magazines have you
 hyperventilating into a paper bag, they then spring upon you the solution to these terrible
 problems. Yes, it's Uncle Sam, or more specifically Uncle Bill and Aunt Hillary.  The
 Consumer Alert/Media Research Center survey found 115 articles with positive portrayals of
 government activism and/or calls for more activism.  There were only 18 negative portrayals
 or calls for less government action.  Of these, 23 stories also asked readers to lobby
 government officials on behalf of expanded government programs. 
<P>
 Having made their readers
 feel bad about the way mankind is treating the environment (when you're describing
 something bad, like polluting, using "mankind" isn't sexist), they then go on to promote
 feel-good environmentalism.  Never mind that even the New York Times magazine recently did
 a cover article affirming what free-market environmentalists have been saying for over a
 decade--that most recycling is a waste of time, energy, and money.  Out of the 15 articles
 in the women's magazines on recycling, each and every one was solidly in favor of it.
 (Actually, probably the last 14 articles were simply recycled versions of the first one.)
<P>
 "Story after story," in these magazines, says Consumer Alert Executive Director Fran Smith,
 "outlines a problem and proposes that a new law be enacted and that women should lobby for
  it."
<P>
   Not for nothing did the Clinton team label its re-election campaign aimed at young
   mothers and women in general as its "Redbook strategy."  The Redbooks of the nation had
   already paved the way for his second term.

 "Killer Airbag" Hysteria is the Real Killer
</h2>     
<p>
<dd>
 For all the news lately about the threat that airbags pose to children, you'd think it's
 the Slaughter of the Innocents all over again.  You'd believe you could look out your
 window at any time and see an airbag chasing some poor little boy or girl down the street.
 But no, such is not the case.  The scariest thing about this whole airbag thing is not the
 threat to children but that the media has taken its cue from USA Today, the paper that
 prides itself on promoting hysteria.
<p>
<dd>
 It was USA Today that led the coverage of the missing
 children epidemic in the early 1980s, telling us, "estimates of lost children [per year]
 run as high as 2 million," and asking "how could it happen?"  It also said, "More than
 100,000 children are abducted each year." How could it happen?  It couldn't and didn't. 
 The newspaper was later forced to admit that the two million figure was probably about
 30,000, of which (according to the FBI) only 67 were kidnapped.  Oops.
<p>
<dd>
 More recently, it
 was the first newspaper to inform us of an "epidemic" of  black churches being torched by
 racists.  After six months of incendiary reporting it finally admitted that of over 70
 black church burnings it looked at, only three were clearly done by racists and a third of
 the churches were burned by blacks.  Oops. No matter, there's always a new hysteria to be
 created.
<p>
<dd>
 And so it was that USA Today crack reporters in May kicked off the airbag mania
 with an article running under the inch-high headline, "DEADLY AIR BAGS."  An accompanying
 story was titled, "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children."  If your trembling hand turned to
 the next page you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags Are Claiming the Lives of Children," while
 yet another page blared, "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly." The rest of the media then
 followed USA Today, which is about as wise as letting Stevie Wonder pilot your plane. 
 Suddenly it's worthy of a headline when a child is so much as injured by an airbag. It's
 gotten to the point where volunteers at busy freeway rest areas spent their Thanksgiving
 handing out fliers warning parents of the danger of these pneumatic beasts.  (USA Today
 proudly displayed a story on this on page one.)
<p>
<dd>
 I've always been a big seat belt fan,
 myself.  They've saved my rear (and the rest of me) twice.  But it's clear that even if you
 do wear a seat belt and especially if you don't, airbags are far more likely to save you
 than to kill you.
<p>
<dd>
 Department of Transportation (DOT) figures show that since 1987, airbags
 have probably kept 1,136 people from being crushed to death, with the life-saving rate
 accelerating rapidly as more and more cars are equipped with them.  In 1995 alone, airbags
 prevented 462 deaths. The trade-off?  Since 1990, DOT says, they have caused 52 deaths,
 including those of 32 children.  You needn't dig out that misplaced pocket calculator to
 see that this comes out to a net savings of a lot of lives. As to those 32 children, in a
 real sense that is 32 too many.  But other than being mauled by a Siberian tiger in New
 York City, there is practically nothing less likely to kill your child than an airbag. 
<p>
<dd>
 Indeed, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, during the time those 32
 children were killed by airbags, over 15,000 children age 11 or under were killed in car
 accidents for reasons having nothing to do with the devices. But hard facts like these are
 the first casualty of panics. And so, reacting to the hysteria, DOT has decided to relax
 the law making it illegal for a mechanic to disconnect a vehicle owner's airbag.  The
 utterly unavoidable result is that people will die in crashes whose lives would otherwise
 have been saved by the devices. And for what?  As tiny as your child's risk of being killed
 or injured by an airbag currently is, you can reduce it even further by simply by sliding
 the passenger seat all the way back, and by making sure your child is wearing a seat belt. 
<p>
<dd>
 Last year, over half the children killed by airbags were not wearing seat belts.  The
 one-year-old girl who just died from an airbag was, according to the coroner, not properly
 restrained. To reduce your child's near-zero risk from airbags to absolutely zero, just put
 him or her in the back seat. Unfortunately, panicky people don't think about such things. 
 So it's off to the auto shop to have both the passenger and driver side bags disconnected.
 The first time a person is impaled on a steering wheel or squished by a dashboard because
 of a disconnected airbag, I hope we read about THAT in the papers.  But don't expect to
 hear about it from USA Today.

<title>Fumento:Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile - 9/05/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>  September 5, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  Bill Clinton's Domestic Abuse Cruise Missile</h2><p>     
Bill Clinton has made it clear yet again that he likes cruise 
missiles, with their ability to slip under radar screens and do damage 
without endangering the guy who launched them.  No, I'm not talking 
about Iraq, but rather Clintons' advocacy of a federal law prohibiting 
those convicted of domestic abuse misdemeanors from ever again being 
able to legally obtain a gun.  I've counted at least five things it 
accomplishes: <p>
<ul>
<li> It appeals to feminists. 

<li> It appeals to Americans' natural desire to protect women and 
children. 

<li> It promotes "gun law creep," whereby inch by inch we make fewer and 
fewer people able to legally obtain and keep guns. 

<li> It promotes "federal power creep."  See above. 

<li> It leaves the public with the impression that Clinton is a no-
nonsense "law and order" president. 
</ul>
If you're thinking that none of this has anything to do with making 
anybody safer, you're missing the point--there's an election hard upon 
us, and as Clinton taught Bush there's no such thing as a safe lead. <p>

But let's hear out Cruise Clinton. <p>

Said the president, "if you're stalking or harassing women or 
children, you shouldn't have a gun."  Can he not know that the 1994 
Violence Against Women Act which he signed already forbids the sale of 
guns to stalkers and harassers who are under court restraining orders? <p>

"The problem is there is one class of misdemeanors that tend to be 
particularly violent, where we know there's a potential for future 
violence," said Clinton.  "And that is the painful area of domestic 
violence." <p>

In fact, as Woman's Freedom Network Vice-President Cathy Young notes, 
"There is no evidence that domestic violence misdemeanor offenses are 
more violent than non-domestic misdemeanor assaults."  We'll just 
chalk that one up to presidential puffery. <p>

With domestic violence, says Clinton, "often there's a plea bargain 
which goes from a felony to a misdemeanor. " <p>

Sure, but that's true of all felonies. "Virtually all available 
research shows that when the levels of injury are the same, domestic 
assaults are no less likely than non-family assaults to be prosecuted 
as felonies," Young told me.  <p>

To the extent such plea-bargaining is a problem, it can be dealt with 
"three strikes and you're out" or other mandatory sentencing laws.  
Increasingly, states are passing just such laws.  Our purpose should 
be to try to make sure those guilty of felonies are punished with laws 
meant for felons, not to apply felony laws to persons who commit 
misdemeanors. <p>

"If you commit an act of violence against your wife or child, you 
shouldn't have a gun," thunders Clinton, who is such a fatherly type 
that he plans to adopt a child if the polls show Dole getting to 
close. <p>

But it's not that simple because the definition of "violence" can 
stretch from all the way from an unwanted grab to strangling your 
spouse and tossing the body into a meat grinder. <p>0

In most states, misdemeanor assault is any intentional touching 
without consent.  That includes such things as poking someone with 
your finger. In a New Jersey case, a man was convicted of misdemeanor 
assault not for punching his girlfriend but rather the couch she was 
sitting on.  Some states allow misdemeanor assault convictions for 
yelling at someone.  Los Angeles hero Rodney King accused his wife of 
assault because she yelled at him in the car for not being able to 
read a map.  (Rather than press charges, he promptly ran her down.) <p>

All of these are wrong, which is why the law covers them.  You can 
serve "hard time" for misdemeanor domestic violence.  But take away a 
person's right to own a gun for life because of an arm grab or heated 
words?  Slap that person in the same category as a brute who blackens 
his wife's eyes because she burned the toast?    <p>

Ironically, one outcome of this might be that many prosecutors and 
judges would feel sorry for the defendant faced with a 
disproportionate penalty, and be tempted to let him or her go scott-
free.  <p>

Conceivably Clinton's proposal could keep guns out of the hands of 
some violent people, if we make the shaky assumption that violent 
people when turned away from stores won't just go out and buy their 
guns on the street.  It's also true that we would keep guns out of the 
hands of some violent people if we forbade them for other arbitrary 
reasons, such as having blow-dryed gray hair and a bulbous nose. <p>

But the point of any law that denies somebody the right to own a gun 
should be to match as closely as possible that denial to persons most 
likely to use them for violence. There's no evidence that this is the 
case here. <p>

One figure cited in support of Clinton's proposal is that according to 
the Justice Department, of the 1.7 million incidents of domestic 
violence reported each year, 88,000 involve firearms.  That comes out 
to 5 percent of such incidents, and it doesn't mean anybody was shot 
or even that bullets were fired.  Considering that almost half of all 
Americans own guns, guns and domestic violence hardly go hand in hand. <p>

Like most gun control measures, this proposal is essentially 
irrelevent to crime control.  If you think reelecting Clinton and 
piling on more federal laws are worthy goals, you may not mind.  
Otherwise you'll see this as the harmful distraction and campaign 
stunt that it is. <p>

<title>Fumento:"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope - 8/28/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 28, 1996</i><p>
<h2>"Dr. Death" Takes Us Down the Slippery Slope</h2><p>
       


He's the sickest American cult figure since Charles Manson, with two 
major differences. First, he's killed almost eight times as many 
people. Second, he's still walking around, free to kill again. And 
kill he will. Some call him an Angel of Mercy, but he's better known 
as Dr. Death. <p>

As I write this, Dr. Jack Kevorkian has put down/put to 
sleep/euthanized persons 35, 36, 37, and 38, though lately he's been 
killing faster than I can type. None of the people appear to have been 
imminently close to death. One had Lou Gehrig's disease, the same 
illness that Dr. Steven Hawkings had for decades when he penned a 
best-selling book and became world famous. Two had multiple sclerosis, 
the disease Annette Funicello had (and has) when she starred in her 
film autobiography. <p>

The fourth, 42-year-old Judith Curren, was a nurse and a mother of two 
young children. She was overweight and depressed and believed she 
suffered from a vague (though sometimes real) malady called chronic 
fatigue syndrome (CFS). None of these are terminal, and the woman's 
belief she had CFS may well have been a manifestation of depression. <p>

Further, severe depression is often accompanied by a desire to commit 
suicide. But this is a highly treatable condition, and in any case a 
severely depressed person no more has the capacity to "elect" to die 
than a five-year-old girl can "elect" to engage in sex. <p>

But no matter, for Dr. Death continues to be treated like some gallant 
crusader. "Dr. Jack Kevorkian stepped up his campaign for doctor-
assisted suicide," began a recent Associated Press article. <p>

Wrong. Kevorkian no more kills in the name of any higher cause, 
including doctor-assisted suicide, than a lion rips out an antelope's 
throat in the name of balancing the eco-system. The lion is driven by 
instinct; Kevorkian by something we used to call evil.  <p>

The man is a ghoul. Some of us like to watch female volleyball; 
Kevorkian likes to watch people die. A much-ignored 1993 Newsweek 
article documented that in the 1950s, while studying to be a 
pathologist, Kevorkian made regular visits to terminally ill patients 
and peered deeply into their eyes. He wanted to watch the sparkle of 
life disappear. "There was no practical application," he admitted 
later. "I was curious, that's all." <p>

Later he advocated surgical experimentation on the bodies--
particularly the brains--of live death row prisoners. Later still he 
expanded his idea to encompass other persons, including "comatose, 
mentally incompetent or otherwise completely uncommunicative 
individuals . . . " <p>

Earlier this year, thinking he was making some salient point, 
Kevorkian invoked Christ's death, saying "Do you think it's dignified 
to hang from wood with nails through your hands and feet?" He said, 
"Had Christ died in my van . . . it would have been far more 
dignified." <p>

Look Jack, it's not just that a van would look rather bizarre hanging 
above the altar of my church. When Christ sacrificed his life, he knew 
he was setting himself up for crucifixion, the most painful and 
undignified mode of execution in use. Again, Kevorkian shows he is 
devoid of understanding of humanity. And it speaks volumes about the 
pro-euthanasia movement that it pretends that this man is a crusader 
for a larger cause, rather than a grown-up version of the little boy 
who pulls wings off flies.<p>

Not that some euthanasia supporters aren't just a bit queasy after 
this latest round of killings. "Sooner or later, someone will die for 
the wrong reasons," conceded a USA Today editorial, not specifying 
what the right reasons are. <p>

Others warned that if we don't watch it, we'll slide down the slippery 
slope. As if we haven't already? Jack Kevorkian IS a one-man slippery 
slope. He keeps loosening the definition of who "deserves" to die. 
Originally he saw the need to pretend that his 
clients/patients/victims were in great pain and on death's doorstep. 
But after the latest killings he admitted, "It had nothing do with 
lethality. It's quality of life . . . . Quality of life." <p>

This evolution was utterly predictable. It's called the "camel's nose" 
effect. The camel puts his nose into the tent to see if he can get 
away with it. If so, he keeps moving in until he's fully inside, hump 
and hooves. <p>

Those on both sides of the euthanasia debate in the United States are 
fully aware of the history of legal euthanasia in the Netherlands. It 
began with a doctor responding to the wishes of her terminally ill 
mother who was in much pain. Within a few decades it encompassed 
killing infants born with non-fatal diseases--Down's syndrome and 
spina bifida. Patients in persistent vegetative states, often 
incorrectly referred to as "comatose," are also now legally killable 
in Holland. <p>

According to a Dutch government survey, doctors there kill some 20,000 
patients a year, most without the patients' consent. The difference is 
that the Dutch took decades to get to that point, while Kevorkian is 
trying to bring the whole camel in within a matter of years. And 
damned if he isn't getting away with it. <p>

We need to ask ourselves right now if we want to follow Dr. Death down 
the Dutch path or if we're going to treat human life as sacred. In 
other words, we tell our doctors that they are to follow the 
Hippocratic Oath they took and "first do no harm." Executioners kill; 
doctors are supposed to heal. And "Dr. Death" is a contradiction in 
terms. <p>

<title>Fumento:The EPA vs. Clean Air - 8/22/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 22, 1996</i><p>
<h2>  The EPA vs. Clean Air</h2><p>



                    

DENVER, COLORADO  "Make a better mousetrap and the world will beat a 
path to your door," goes an old saying. Well, not always.  In some 
cases you just may find a 300-pound government gorilla obstructing the 
way. Such has been the experience of University of Denver chemistry 
professor Donald Stedman. <p>

Stedman has developed a machine which, when hidden by the side of the 
road, can detect how much exhaust a car puts out as it drives by. High 
emissions trigger a video camera which films both the car and its 
license plate.  This allows the municipality using the device to send 
a letter (perhaps backed by a fine) to the violator informing him that 
his car must be repaired. <p>

As present, the standard practice in high-pollution areas is to 
subject cars to regular inspection and maintenance programs. The 
problem is that drivers with the dirtiest cars can pass the test by 
pouring a commercial additive into their gas tank. (Since they refused 
to pay me a product placement fee, I won't tell you the name.) Or they 
can pass by tampering with the exhaust system.  <p>

Studies with remote sensors have shown that such cheating is rampant. <p>

But drivers who happen upon remote sensors have no ability to cheat. 
The effectiveness of such devices has been demonstrated repeatedly in 
the U.S. as well as in Canada and Great Britain.  Indeed, they have 
now been put into regular use in various parts of California; Phoenix; 
Ontario, and Stedman's hometown of Denver. <p>

"If we want to have any success in reducing emissions from autos, we 
must employ remote sensing technology" says Buzz Breedlove, the 
assistant director for the California Research Bureau. <p>

But the EPA, whose mission is supposed to be preserving the 
environment, doesn't like remote sensing. <p>

Why?  Breedlove told me that "the staunchest opponent of remote 
sensing" he knows once said, "The problem with remote sensing is that 
it will clean up all the cars  and we won't be able to justify a 
centralized program on a cost-effective basis." <p>

For over a decade now, the EPA has put all its eggs in one basket: the 
inspection and maintenance program. In part, this is because such 
testing requires a large centralized bureaucracy to administer it. <p>

This involves--surprise--lots of money!  The tests cost about $25 per 
car.  Remote sensing, by contrast, is about 50 cents per test. <p>

Although the EPA has improved the efficiency of its testing devices, 
they will never be truly cost efficient. "It's not a mechanical 
engineering problem," Stedman observes, "It's a human behavior 
problem. The driver's interest isn't in reducing emissions; it's in 
passing the test." <p>

Hence, if the driver thinks he'll fail and be liable for perhaps 
hundreds of dollars in repairs, he'll cheat. And the EPA's equipment 
can't stop him. <p>

But pride, reputations, and bureaucratic inertia refuse to allow the 
EPA to admit this.  And so, while remote sensors work to clean up the 
air, the EPA is working against remote sensors. <p>

First, the agency actively discriminates against state and local 
governments that want to use remote sensors. Under the Clean Air Act, 
governments are not given credit for actually cleaning up the air. 
Rather, they're given credit for running programs that the EPA says 
SHOULD BE cleaning up the air. And in its credit formula, remote 
sensing counts for very little.   <p>

Second, EPA has now cut off further funding for Stedman's lab, 
hampering his efforts to enable it to detect more types of pollutants. 
For six years he got a fairly small but, to him, vital amount of his 
research money from the EPA. No more. <p>

But hey, things are tough all over, right? Money is tight these days. 
But not for things that suit the EPA's  agenda--namely more government 
regulation. <p>

Competitive Enterprise Institute scholar Jonathan Adler has documented 
that from 1993 to 1995 alone, the radical environmental group the 
Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) received almost $2 million of 
your and my tax dollars funneled through the EPA. That's 20 times what 
Stedman's shop was receiving annually. <p>

The American Lung Association (ALA) received almost as much from the 
EPA. Unlike the NRDC, the ALA does some good work.  But part of what 
it does with all that cash is to lobby for EPA-proposed mandates.  It 
even sues the EPA to make regulations stricter.  Since by law the EPA 
can't lobby itself, it throws money at organizations who will do it 
for them.   <p>

In fact, the EPA even gives cash to a group called the Consumer 
Federation of America, which publishes literature disparaging remote 
sensing. <p>

The EPA's mandate isn't to promote bureaucratic self-interest and 
political lobbying, but to clean up the environment. Supporting remote 
sensing would do just that. <p>

<title>Fumento: Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study - 8/15/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i> August 15, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Gun Control Advocates Shoot Blanks At Study</h2><p>

A new report on the impact of laws allowing persons to carry concealed 
guns has gun control advocates shooting wildly and missing their 
target by a mile. <p>

The report, co-authored by law professor John Lott and economist John 
Mustard, both of the University of Chicago, concluded  "allowing 
citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it 
appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths.  If those states 
which did not have right-to-carry concealed gun provisions had adopted 
them in 1992, approximately 1,570 murders; 4,177 rapes; and over 
60,000 aggravated assaults would have been avoided yearly."    <p>

Think of it; that's more murders than the combined total of 21 states 
last year.  That's over 4,000 women last year alone who were violently 
sexually assaulted. <p>

In percentage terms, the authors found that when state concealed 
handgun laws went into effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 
percent, and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent, 
respectively.  (Thirty-one states now have such laws). <p>

Lott and Mustard, however, probably feel like they've been assaulted 
after the smearing they received in much of the press. <p>

For example, director of the Illinois Council Against Handgun Violence 
Dan Kotowski blasted the study as biased because it was funded by the 
Olin Corporation, which owns Winchester, Inc., a firearms 
manufacturer.  An <i>Associated Press</i> (AP) story and that of individual 
newspapers aired the Kotowski allegations as fact, but they were wrong 
several times over. <p>

Lott, as the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics at Chicago, 
is paid by the Olin FOUNDATION, which funds guest academic positions 
at institutions throughout the country.  It does not choose the 
scholars who fill these slots, but leaves it up to the institution.  
Nor does it choose their research projects.  John Olin did make money 
in firearms, but died in 1982, endowing the foundation that bears his 
name.  Since then there has been no connection between the Olin 
Corporation and the Olin Foundation. <p>

AP has now issued a retraction of the allegations.   <p>

On the other hand, Kotowski gets ALL his money from advocating handgun 
control. <p>

Meanwhile, Douglas Weil--who as research director at the Center to 
Prevent Handgun Violence also makes all his money from advocating 
handgun laws--claimed the Chicago study "goes against well-established 
evidence," citing specifically a University of Maryland report from 
last year which claimed to show that concealed weapons laws cause 
homicides to go up. <p>

Really?  The Chicago report looked at the entire nation over the last 
15 years for which data were available.  The authors of the University 
of Maryland study, conversely, picked out just five cities to report 
on out of the hundreds it could have chosen.  They didn't even use the 
same sample period for the cities, but the periods they did choose 
were just a few years each. <p>

So somehow a study that uses specially-picked cities and specially-
picked periods of time is better than one covering the whole nation 
over a decade and a half.  It makes sense to the gun control 
advocates. <p>

The nation's top law enforcement official also weighed in.  Asked 
about the Chicago report at a press conference, Attorney General Janet 
Reno avoided giving direct comment, saying she hadn't yet read it.  
But Reno, the former chief state prosecutor in Florida's Dade County, 
added her impression that Florida's concealed weapons law "didn't seem 
to be effective." <p>

Oh no?  When that law was passed in 1987, Florida had the nation's 
highest murder rate and it was going up.  Immediately it began 
dropping steadily year by year, falling almost 30 percent by 1994 and 
putting Florida under the national average in homicides.  Of over 
320,000 licenses issued between the time the law passed and the end of 
January of this year, only 58 have been revoked because the owner 
committed a crime. <p>	

So why does Miss Reno think the law wasn't effective?  Maybe it has 
something to do with the view she stated to a B'nai B'rith gathering 
in Ft. Lauderdale in 1991 that, "The most effective means of fighting 
crime in the United States is to outlaw the possession of any type of 
firearm by the civilian populace." <P>

Naturally, some gun control advocates would rather avoid the need to 
use data at all.  "It defies common sense," said Kotowski at his press 
conference, "to think that putting more guns on the streets is going 
to make us safer." <p>

Actually it makes perfect sense.  If a criminal thinks you might be 
packing something more powerful than a tiny canister of pepper spray, 
he might be just a bit more hesitant to rape, rob, or kill you.  
That's common sense, and the Chicago study simply backs it up. <p>

Common sense also suggests that if this were happening, criminals 
might compensate somewhat by committing more property crimes.  And the 
Chicago study found just that.  Criminals respond "to the threat of 
being shot" by substituting "less risky crimes," state the Chicago 
authors.  One example is burglaries in which the criminal has "cased" 
the house to make sure no one will be home. <p>

That seems a small price to pay.  I don't know about you, but I'd 
rather have my home or car broken into than be smashed over the head 
for my wallet or have my girlfriend raped.  I'll bet even most handgun 
control advocates feel the same way.   <p>

<title>Fumento:  Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish - 8/07/96</title>

   <h2>
         Ignored Study Finds Pollution Program Costly and Fuelish</h2>
<P>
(DENVER, COLORADO) Oxygenated fuels started here in Denver and took 
the nation by storm--sort of like the Denver Boot, a nasty contraption 
they clamp onto your wheel when you don't pay your tickets.  But 
unlike the boot, which works all too well (don't ask me how I know!), 
it turns out that oxy fuels may be virtually worthless, yet cost 
motorists across the country billions of dollars. 
<P>
That's the conclusion of a recently-released report by the National 
Research Council (NRC), an arm of the National Academy of Sciences. 
The report has been utterly ignored outside of the Denver area, yet it 
concerns municipalities--and drivers--across the country. 
<P>
Oxygenated fuels, generally shortened to "oxy fuels", are made by 
putting an additive into gasoline, usually either ethanol made from 
corn or a chemical derived from natural gas called MTBE. These 
additives put more oxygen into the gasoline, and in theory make your 
car burn more cleanly. Allegedly they especially reduce the production 
of carbon monoxide, which reaches relatively high levels in many 
places during the winter. 
<P>
About 27 areas around the country are using oxy fuels during the 
winter months.  They are not provided as options, but rather forced 
into your gas tank by law.  Which is the only way local governments 
can get motorists to use them, since they not only cost as much as 
seven cents a gallon more than regular gasoline but also decrease 
mileage by at least 2-3 percent. 
<P>
As to how much this is costing the nation as a whole, bizarrely enough 
the EPA says it doesn't know.  "That should be one of the easiest 
things to identify," says Carleton Howard, an atmospheric scientist at 
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, 
Colorado. 
<P>
In any case, the Colorado Health Department says the program has cost 
the Denver area alone about $14 million a year since 1988 and critics 
say it could be twice that.  It could therefore easily be setting back 
the nation over half a billion a year. 
<P>
And for what?  We don't know, says the NRC.  Nobody knows. 
<P>
The Colorado Department of Health (CDH) instituted the oxy fuels 
program back in 1988 under pressure from lobbyists funded in great 
part by the huge grain conglomerate, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).  
ADM is the biggest producer of the oxy-fuel additive ethanol.  It has 
also been supporting an activist who goes around saying that ethanol's 
chief rival, MTBE, makes people sick. 
<P>
  The CDH concluded the oxy-fuels program was a resounding success and 
made it permanent in Denver.  Mayor Federico Pena (now Secretary of 
Transportation) crowed about it, the Environmental Protection Agency 
crowed about it, and next thing you know, Congress was requiring it 
around the country. 
<P>
But CDH had based its approval on two findings.  First, it said that 
carbon monoxide levels in Denver's air had gone down significantly 
since the program was instituted.  Actually the city's carbon monoxide 
levels had been dropping yearly since the 1970s, primarily due to the 
installation of catalytic converters on cars.  Ah!  Details, details, 
said the CDH.  Don't bother us with details! 
<P>
Second, it put together a nice computer model that it claimed showed 
that an area-wide oxy-fuels program would reduced carbon monoxide by 
29 percent. 
<P>
But while computers don't lie, liars compute.  The NRC found that the 
most optimistic study which actually measured carbon monoxide 
reductions from oxy fuels found a 16 percent drop.  And the author of 
that study, University of Denver chemist Donald Stedman, says that 
even if everybody else had such promising results "it wouldn't be cost 
effective." 
<P>
Other studies such as one conducted by the University of Georgia found 
virtually no reduction in carbon monoxide emissions at all. 
<P>
According to one NRC panel member, University of Colorado professor 
Douglas Lawson, it does seem to be the case that at warm temperatures 
oxy fuels reduce carbon monoxide.  But carbon monoxide is only a cold-
weather problem.  "In some studies there were higher carbon monoxide 
emissions with oxy fuels at that lower temperature than with standard 
fuels," Lawson told me. 
<P>
Further, even if oxy fuels do reduce carbon monoxide, they can 
increase levels of other pollutants.  For example, benzene levels go 
up.  Benzene is strongly suspected to be a human carcinogen. 
<P>
Carbon monoxide, on the other hand, merely replaces oxygen in the 
bloodstream.  While this can be fatal in massive doses (such as when a 
faulty propane heater killed former tennis great Vitas Gerulaitis), in 
even the heaviest levels ever recorded in the air above a city it 
never causes anything more than headaches and fatigue. 
<P>
In any event, notes Lawson, "It's been known since 1983 that majority 
of emissions come from a small percentage of the cars on the road."  
<P>
Says Stedman, "Forcing all drivers to use oxy fuels for the sake of 
those few broken cars is like making everybody take aspirin every day 
for the sake of a few who will get headaches." 
<P>
As a result of the NRC findings, Colorado Governor Roy Romer--hardly 
an enemy of regulation--says he is considering dropping the oxy-fuels 
program.  Unfortunately, since this story was ignored in all the other 
parts of the country that have since adopted it, the evil that 
Colorado's regulators did will live on.

<h2>
           Paper Scares Parents for Politics and Profit
</h2>
<p>
"DEADLY AIR BAGS."  So ran the inch-high headline in USA Today.  "Why Air Bags Are Killing Children," was the title of an accompanying story.  Jump to the next page and you found "Deadly Force: Air Bags are Claiming the Lives of Children," while yet the next jump is entitled "Prescription for Safety Turns Deadly."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's nothing a sensationalist paper likes more than running stories about suffering children, and no paper does it better than USA Today. Back in the early 1980s it led the way in publicizing the epidemic of missing children, an epidemic that turned out to be non-existent.  Now there seems to be an epidemic of children crushed under air bags which--oh irony of ironies--are supposed to save lives.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Don't get me wrong.  I'm not the world's biggest proponent of air bags.  I AM one of the world's biggest proponents of seat belts. Twice seat belts have saved my life.  The second time was when my car went flying off a cliff and tumbled down 350 feet.  I would have had just a few scratches had my air bag not then--after the tumbling had stopped--gone off and bruised my face.  Gee, thanks a lot.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that's the nature of the beast.  Presently air bags only protect you in head-on collisions.  And while they don't provide much additional protection beyond seat belts, they apparently do help a little, saving a little over 500 lives a year.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unless, it seems, you're a small child.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
According to USA Today, probably 20 children will be killed by air bags this year, ten more than will have their lives saved by the devices.  Now ten children is ten children, no doubt about that.  But this year, according to the National Safety Council in Chicago, about 1,100 children between the ages of 0 to 4 will be killed in motor vehicle accidents.  An additional 2,000 will die who are between the ages of 5 and 11.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
With that many deaths, it is hard to imagine any aspect of motor vehicles less likely to kill your child than air bags.  Indeed, it is hard to imagine anything that can possibly kill your child that will kill fewer children this year than air bags.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Naturally, USA Today does everything it can to exaggerate the scope of these deaths.  Of 22 children known to have been killed by air bags since 1993, it pictures fully 12 of them.  For each and every child on which it was able to obtain records, it lists their name, age, home town, and date of death.  Their anguished parents are repeatedly quoted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Meanwhile, the thousands of other children killed in other ways since then by car accidents go unmentioned, and even the number goes unlisted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yeah, yeah, but aren't I missing the big point here, that these devices that are supposed to save lives are taking them?  No, because tradeoffs with safety devices are commonplace.  Seat belts, for example, save over 5,000 American lives each year but every once in a while somebody whose life would have been saved if they had been thrown clear was instead trapped in their vehicle by a seat belt.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Air bags do save lives.  Last year, according to National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) figures, air bags saved 570 lives and took 12, including eight children.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The real point here is that while we're off  turning little bogeymen into giants, giant bogeymen are stalking the land but not getting huge spreads in USA Today or elsewhere.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A fourth of all children in this country are now obese, setting them up for a lifetime of disease and early death.  Schools are steadily dropping physical education programs from their curricula and nobody's complaining.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Half of all black children in this country, according to Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames, are suffering broken chromosomes due to lack of folic acid in their diets.  Broken chromosomes often lead to cancer. Adding folic acid to the diet is a cinch, but parents worried about airbags and all the other media-fabricated scares of the week--from Alar to power line electromagnetic fields to pit bull attacks--don't even know this.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of course, as few deaths as air bags cause, they could be made to cause even fewer.  Many years ago regulators such as Joan Claybrook, who was then President Carter's head of NHTSA and is now at the Naderite Center for Auto Safety, suspected that air bags posed a risk to children. Nonetheless, she pushed full speed ahead and child safety precautions were never built in.  But whose fault was that?  Why, says USA Today, Ronald Reagan's of course!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"'If I had gone back another four years, it's entirely possible we'd have gone back and rewritten the (air bag) standard' to better account for children," USA Today quotes Claybrook as saying. "But Ronald Reagan ousted Carter," says the paper, "foreclosing Claybrook's chance to revise the standard."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Entirely possible"?  She just needed four more years?  It's bad enough to use pictures of cute dead kids to sell papers, but turning them into political fodder--well, that's just cold.

<h2>
The Great Black Church-burning Hoax
</h2>
<p>
Responding to the reported wave of southern black church burnings, 
President Clinton proclaimed that "Racial hostility is the driving 
force" behind the church burnings and said, "I want to ask every 
citizen in America to say we . . . we are not slipping back to those 
dark days." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Okay, Mr. President, I'll say it.  I'll say it because this "epidemic 
of hatred" is a fraud.  A myth.  A deliberate hoax.  There is no good 
evidence of  any increase in black church burnings. There is, however, 
evidence, that a single activist group has taken the media and the 
nation on a wild ride. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It turns out there is no good federal data on black church arsons.  
The FBI doesn't keep such statistics, and the Department of Justice 
doesn't usually break them down by white and black churches or arson 
and accidents.  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms only 
tracks federal fires and those it's specifically asked to investigate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
A private group, the National Fire Protection Association, keeps 
careful track of church arsons.  While their data don't break down 
churches by race, they do show a dramatic drop in the number of church 
arsons, from 1,420 in 1980 to 520 in 1994. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Though arson committed against any house of worship is especially 
heinous, it should be reassuring to know there have been far fewer 
recently than there used to be.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So who is giving out these data suggesting it's open season on black 
churches?  It turns out the main source--indeed, the one which started 
the whole thing--is far from impartial.  It is the Atlanta-based 
Center for Democratic Renewal, whose self-proclaimed mission is to 
work "with progressive activists and organizations to build a movement 
to counter right-wing rhetoric and public policy initiatives." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Originally called the National Anti-Klan Network, it changed its name 
when the Klan virtually fell apart in the 1980s.  But far from seeing 
that as a sign of declining bigotry, it has continued for more than a 
decade to issue statements and reports "discovering" a sudden 
resurgence in racist activity. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR's agenda goes well beyond rooting out genuine bigotry; the 
group tars mainstream conservatives with the same brush as racist 
criminals.  The Rev. C.T. Vivian, chairman of the CDR board said,  
"There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons 
and those that are really doing the burning." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In late March, the CDR held a press conference and released a 
preliminary report showing a tremendous surge in black church arsons 
from 1990 to the present.  From there it's been a media snowball, with 
over 2,200 stories written on the subject to date--including three 
huge consecutive layouts in USA Today. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"You're talking about a well-organized white-supremacist movement," 
the Rev. Mac Charles Jones, a CDR board member told one paper.  "This 
is domestic terrorism," he told CNN. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But after numerous law enforcement agencies concluded there didn't 
seem to be any contact between those arsonists who had been arrested, 
others have blamed, as Jesse Jackson put it, "a cultural conspiracy."  
The "ringleaders" are everyone from talk radio hosts to Supreme Court 
Justice Clarence Thomas to the religious right. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 
said the Christian Coalition "created the context for the fires." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The CDR report claims there have been 90 arsons against black churches 
in nine southern states since 1990, with the number rising every year 
up to 35 in 1996 as of  June 18.  Each culprit "arrested and/or 
detained," it stresses, has been white. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But when I contacted the law enforcement officials of several states 
on the CDR list, a very different picture emerged. The CDR, it turned 
out, regularly ignored fires set by blacks and those that occurred in 
the early part of the decade, and labeled fires as arsons that were 
not--all in an apparent effort to make black church torchings appear 
to be an escalating phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example CDR lists ten churches allegedly torched in Alabama, but 
State Fire Marshall John Robison says that only one of these was a 
confirmed arson.  All the others were accidental, undetermined, or 
weren't fires at all but vandalisms. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
CDR somehow managed to omit three bonafide black church arsons that 
took place in Alabama in 1994.  In two cases the culprits were black. 
Moreover, the group left out ten black church arsons that took place 
before 1994, creating the illusion that the burning of black churches 
is a recent phenomenon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even the claim that black churches have been singled out for arson is 
questionable.  In 1995, according to USA Today, there were 45 arsons 
against white churches and 27 against black ones in the surveyed 
states. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Other than saying that some black churches over the years have fallen 
prey to racists, we can't easily infer motives. "We have not uncovered 
in [Alabama's] 38 cases a single piece of information to substantiate 
racially-motivated fires," said Robison.  Further, "There have been no 
dramatic increases, except for this year because of the media hype."  
Other states' officials have told him the same. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here lies the ultimate irony.  By claiming there has been an epidemic 
of black church burnings, it appears that in recent months they have 
actually caused one. They have also fomented tremendous racial 
division and caused great fear among southern black churchgoers. That 
which the Ku Klux Klan can no longer do, a group established to fight 
the Klan has done for them.

<h2>
Old Law Continues to Be a Highway Killer
</h2>

<P>
We often hear that to live longer, most of us need to lose weight.  
But did you know that when it comes to automobiles, losing weight is a 
killer? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's the conclusion of a draft National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration (NHTSA) study just evaluated by the National Academy of 
Sciences (NAS).  It found that for every 100 pounds shaved off the 
average weight of cars, 322 more Americans will die each year in 
traffic accidents. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The NAS panel declined to endorse the report, but did not specifically 
reject the 322 death figure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That estimate is considerably higher than the 200 deaths  a year cited 
in a 1991 NHTSA report. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it should make us re-evaluate an anachronistic law that's turned 
an agency with "Safety Administration" in its name into a killer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The law is CAFE, which stands for Corporate Average Fuel Economy 
standards.  Congress enacted it in the mid-1970s as a means to 
increase the fuel economy of cars and reduce our dependence on foreign 
oil.  It mandates that the cars sold by any manufacturer selling in 
the United States must average at least 27.5 miles per gallon. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since then, we've fought a war which made clear that nobody can tamper 
with our foreign oil supplies.  The post-war period has shown that the 
world has such a glut of oil that even with one of its major producers 
(Iraq) out the business, prices when adjusted for inflation are as low 
as they've ever been. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Yet CAFE remains on the books and it continues to kill.  Here's why. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There are numerous ways in which auto makers have made their vehicles 
more fuel efficient.  Engines have been improved, tires have been 
stiffened so they balloon less at high speeds, car bodies have been 
made to cause less wind resistance. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But for all this, the easiest way to improve mileage is still to make 
a car lighter or to simply sell more lighter cars and fewer heavier 
ones. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA has calculated that every 10 percent reduction car weight, on 
average, produces and 8 percent reduction in fuel consumption. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And there's the rub.  For as car companies have sold more lighter 
cars, there have been more deaths as a result. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In what is still the best peer-reviewed work on the subject, Robert 
Crandall of the Brookings Institute and John Graham of Harvard 
calculated that CAFE had caused about 500 pounds to be cut from 
automobiles and that this 500 pound reduction was causing from 2,200 
to 3,900 fatalities per year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They found that each 100 pounds shaved off cost 440 to 780 lives--
somewhat above NHTSA's calculation but the point is the same.  
Lightness kills. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In defense of CAFE, NHTSA has pointed out that since it was enacted, 
automobile death rates have gone down considerably. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sure they have, but that's because on a per-vehicle miles traveled 
basis deaths have been going down since the 1920s.  The point is they 
would have declined even further but for CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Another argument is that cars are safer than ever because of things 
like airbags and crumple zones that make the car collapse upon impact 
in such a way as to protect passengers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This, too, is true but irrelevant.  Were it not for CAFE those cars 
would be safer yet.     
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Indeed, one study shows that an airbag is the equivalent of about 485 
pounds.  So the airbag that you think makes you so much safer really 
just, on average, offsets CAFE. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
NHTSA contends that while cars have gotten lighter, there's no telling 
how much of this is due to CAFE  and how much to market forces.  It 
notes that many consumer items, such as cameras have been downsized by 
manufacturers without any incentive from the government. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But that comparison is "incredibly dumb," points out Sam Kazman, chief 
counsel for the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.  
"Cameras are products you carry around on cords around your neck.  
There's a tremendous incentive to make them smaller and lighter.  But 
with fuel prices staying the same, there's no indication that market 
forces have made cars lighter." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Since 1988, Kazman and CEI have fought CAFE, calling it "blood for 
oil."  In 1992 they sued NHTSA over the agency's insistence that CAFE 
wasn't killing anyone.  The court found that NHTSA had used "fudged 
analysis," "statistical legerdemain," and "bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo" 
in order to avoid dealing with CAFE's safety impact. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unfortunately, NHTSA won the next time the case returned to the court, 
because the judges said that while they were troubled by the safety 
issue, a bureaucratic agency deserves a certain amount of deference. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And so, the deception continues.  As do the deaths. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If all that's not enough for you, Bill Clinton and Al Gore's 1992 
book, Putting People First proposes raising CAFE standards to 40 miles 
per gallon by the year 2,000 and 45 miles per gallon by 2015.  That 
sounds more like putting people last.

<title>Fumento: Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction - 6/27/96</title>

<h2>            
Dole Right (Mostly) on Cigarette Addiction
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
When I heard seven tobacco company executives testify before Congress back in 1994 
that smoking wasn't addictive, I thought "These guys are lying through their nicotine-
stained teeth." The issue has resurfaced with Bob Dole's recent remarks at a Kentucky 
rally that, "To some people, smoking is addictive; to others, they can take it or leave it." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Having studied the issue since that original congressional hearing, I've found it's a lot 
more complex than most of us think. In fact, Dole's characterization seems about as 
sound as anything you'll hear on the subject. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
No matter, for Dole is a presidential candidate, and so a tempting--apparently irresistible-
-target. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The last thing our kids need to hear is a statement from a man who would be president 
that smoking is not addictive," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. "Senator Dole, side 
with our kids, not with the tobacco industry."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said Dole's comments show that Joe Camel -- the cartoon 
advertisement figure -- is in the lead to be his running mate. Mother Jones magazine 
actually took a full-page advertisement out in the New York Times declaring that Joe 
Camel would be Dole's choice for Surgeon General. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Referring to the fact that tobacco companies have been among Dole's biggest campaign 
contributors, Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said "Bob Dole should spend 
more time looking at the scientific evidence and less time counting his campaign 
contributions."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But you needn't be a recipient of tobacco money to think that this addiction thing is a lot 
smokier than it might seem.  True, a lot of people have had a hard time quitting 
cigarettes, but there are about as many who have managed to quit as are still smoking.  
According to the surgeon general, the vast majority of them gave up the habit without 
formal treatment. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
We live in a country in which a third of us are obese. Virtually all of them will tell you 
they've tried restricting their food intake but just can't keep it up.  Does that make food 
addictive? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One definition of addiction says that the substance in question must have some sort of 
intoxicating effect, and cigarettes do--albeit very slight compared to such drugs as 
cocaine and heroin.  But researchers have found the same thing about chocolate, that it 
raises levels of certain chemicals in the brain and makes you feel better. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Many of us joke about being "chocoholics" but to some who binge on thousands of 
calories of chocolate a day it's no laughing matter.  Indeed, a drug has now been found to 
block chocolate cravings. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But there is no scientific definition of addiction.  Neither the Diagnostic and Statistical 
manual of the American Psychiatric Association nor the World Organization use the term 
addiction.  This allows anybody who wants to use any definition they wish. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, the famous 1964 U.S. Surgeon General's report on smoking concluded that 
smoking was not addictive, though the Surgeon General's office now says it is--a move 
some say is motivated by politics and not science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately it comes down to how a New York Times headline put it in 1994: "Is Nicotine 
Addictive?  It Depends on Whose Criteria You Use." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But Bob Dole cleverly sidestepped the issue of whether smoking is addictive in general 
and observed that different substances have different effects on different people. You 
really can't argue with that--as much as his opportunistic opponents have tried. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
As it is, however, the issue of addiction is a red herring.  Dole was also right when he 
said, "But I think the more serious question is whether or not the FDA has jurisdiction" 
over cigarettes. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The FDA is using the addiction issue as an excuse to gain the power to regulate tobacco.  
But it routinely regulates drugs that are non-addictive--antibiotics, for instance--while 
forsaking regulation of substances that are. By the same criteria the FDA is applying to 
tobacco, "beverages containing alcohol or caffeine are addictive, but they're not regulated 
as drugs," notes Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, author of an upcoming 
book on the anti-smoking movement. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Addictiveness is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for FDA jurisdiction," he 
says. Rather, it's just a smokescreen for Commissioner David Kessler to justify the 
sudden reversal of its longstanding position that cigarettes are not covered by the Food, 
Drug, and Cosmetic Act. "They pretend this is a new development," Sullum told me, "but 
people have been talking about the addictive potential of tobacco for hundreds of years." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Only in one respect was Dole truly wrong. He also told the Kentucky crowd, "In effect, if 
they should claim jurisdiction and find that cigarettes are a drug, then in effect, you're 
banning cigarettes and production of tobacco, so it's going to affect a lot of people." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Possibly, but probably not. Kessler and Waxman did initially say that if the FDA decided 
to regulate tobacco as a drug, a ban might be its only option. But now the FDA is instead 
pushing a series of measures ostensibly intended to reduce underage smoking, including 
restrictions on advertising, promotion, and sales. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Personally, I like some of what they propose. Society has traditionally given children less 
leeway to do stupid things than it has adults. But Dole's right in that cigarette regulation 
is best left to the states--and individuals and their parents. Federal Big Brother should--
pun intended--butt out.

<h2>
     Animal Rights Mean Human Wrongs
    </h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">
Michael Fumento
</a>

<P>
Back when I was in college, I attended a meeting of the local animal 
rights organization.  When somebody asked the group leader about using 
animals for medical research she replied (and I'm not making this up) 
"Well, it's our belief that people shouldn't get sick, in which case 
there would be no need for animal testing." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Such awesome smugness is actually par for the course for these people.  
Consider the following statements from Ingrid Newkirk, co-founder and 
vice-president of People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), the 
largest animal rights organization.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"A rat is a pig is a dog is a boy." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Medical research is "immoral even if it's essential." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Even if animal testing produced a cure for AIDS, "We'd be against it."  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And here's the kicker:   "Six million people died in concentration 
camps," she told the Washington Post, "but six billion broiler 
chickens will die this year in slaughter houses." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Somehow I have trouble identifying that chicken breast I ate last 
night with my cousins who died in German camps.  And I must say that 
"Heil Frank Perdue!" seems to lack an ominous ring. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But then, I am a member of the group that constitutes the lowest form 
of animal life.  No, not lawyers--humans. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This week, the animal rights groups are going on the warpath against 
us human types.  They're launching "World Animal Awareness Week," 
beginning June 18th, in Washington, D.C. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Fortunately, the medical community has decided it's mad as hell and 
isn't going to take it anymore. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They pre-empted Wacky Week by launching their own campaign.  It 
included a press conference, statements by scientists and patients 
affected by animal rights extremism, release of a joint consensus 
letter signed by the nation's leading AIDS organizations supporting 
animal testing, and a report called Endangered Cures, which details 
specific areas of research threatened by animal rights activists. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Animal rights activists aren't called that for nothing.  They don't 
just stand around on street corners politely handing out pamphlets.  
Indeed, they have struck at scores of labs across the country and in 
other nations, smashing equipment and releasing experimental animals--
sometimes killing them in the process. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Among the raids the animal liberators have conducted was one on the 
laboratory of Dr. John Orem, who was using cats in painless research 
on crib death.  Crib death will claim 8,000 babies lives this year. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Everyone who works with experimental animals lives in constant fear of 
harassment, vandalism, and death threats.  Said PETA's medical 
advisor, Dr. Neal Barnard, a few years ago, "We're demoralizing the 
people who think there's a buck to be made in animal research.  And 
they're starting to get scared . . . and they're starting to veer 
away." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But the activists are also waging a war of public opinion with 
misleading ad campaigns, staged photos of animals in pain, and by 
enlisting the support of many celebrities like Paul McCartney, the B-
52s, Kim Basinger, Mary Tyler Moore, Woody Harrelson, and Alec 
Baldwin--the last of whom was later spotted wearing a leather jacket.  
Oops. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"The worst aspect of these campaigns, says Frankie Trull, president of 
the Foundation for Biomedical Research.  "Is the way they have shaped 
public opinion by providing misinformation and playing upon emotions 
of people who love pets." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This is ironic, because if the activists get their way, keeping a pet 
will be outlawed as slavery.  Pet ownership is an "absolutely abysmal 
situation brought about by human manipulation," Newkirk told the 
Washingtonian magazine. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But such views are kept out of the slick adds.  As a result, "They're 
eroding public support that would allow this research to continue," 
Trull told me. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The stakes couldn't be higher.  Animal testing of drugs intended for 
humans is absolutely vital.  Indeed, it's required by law. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"All drugs approved by FDA in last 30 years have to be tested on 
animals," says Wise Young, a professor of neurosurgery at New York 
University Medical Center and medical advisor to actor Christopher 
Reeve. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Without animal testing, he told me, we wouldn't have gotten anti-
hypertension drugs, anti-diabetic drugs, pharmaceuticals for epilepsy, 
or any of the modern anti-depressants.  "It's horrendous the kinds of 
lives people have when they don't have the benefits of research." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He noted that one drug originally tested on spinal cord injuries in 
humans failed.  But later it was tried in much higher doses in 
animals. There it was found effective and the trials were successfully 
repeated in humans.  This drug was given to Reeve and reduced his 
paralysis to the point where he has been able to resume much of his 
life. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, the animal rights activists are simply parasites.  They 
benefit just as much from animal-assisted medical research as anyone, 
even while they vigorously oppose it.  Oh sure, they abstain from 
eating hamburgers or wearing raccoon coats. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
On the other hand, they could wear bracelets with tags (similar to 
those worn by persons with penicillin allergies), saying "In case of 
emergency, do not administer any drugs or therapies tested on 
animals." Bet you don't see that any time soon.

               Bill Clinton Again Betrays the Vets

<P>

Wanted for pandering: President William J. Clinton. No, not 
philandering, pandering.  The latest incident: doling out money to 
veterans allegedly suffering from the effects of the herbicide Agent 
Orange, in order to shore up his political support among a group that 
has understandably come to loathe him.  
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clinton had a PR problem with the military even before he became 
president.  When almost three million of America's sons and daughters 
served their country in Vietnam, he was dodging the draft and figuring 
out a way to smoke marijuana without inhaling.  As president, he had 
barely taken the oath of office when he ordered that homosexuals be 
openly allowed in the military. And now, the greatest insult, his 
lawyer has declared him an active duty serviceman in order to postpone 
Paula Jones's suit against him. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So with the election just five months off and his opponent a true war 
hero, Clinton decided to open the government coffers to a number of 
Vietnam vets by providing compensation for those who have suffered 
from a rare nerve disease called peripheral neuropathy, who contract 
prostate cancer, or have babies born with spina bifida. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Veterans' Administration has estimated the five-year cost of this 
largesse at $350 million, which of course is too low because early 
estimates always are.  In any case, because prostate cancer is the 
most common malignant tumor in men (about one in ten will eventually 
contract it) and because Vietnam vets are only now starting to reach 
the age where it becomes a major threat, the cost of this giveaway 
will surely reach many billions of dollars. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
This might be fair if there were scientific evidence that these 
problems were really being caused by Agent Orange.  But there is not. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Those who were exposed to the very highest levels--the men of 
"Operation Ranchhand" who actually sprayed it--have been intensely 
studied for years. They have shown no more cancers, and their children 
no more birth defects, people with no dioxin or Agent Orange exposure. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, one of the Ranchhand researchers told a House committee in 
April, "The accumulated evidence does not establish that there is a 
cause-and-effect relationship between herbicide exposure and spina 
bifida." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So where does President Clinton get off on saying there IS a 
connection? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
His support comes from an Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, which is 
an update of an earlier report previously used to grant compensation 
to veterans suffering other diseases such as Hodgkin's disease, non-
Hodgkins lymphoma, and certain respiratory cancers. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
IOM is an arm of the non-governmental National Academy of Sciences.  
Congress asked the group to look into Agent Orange after Congress's 
own Office of Technology Assessment repeatedly found that very few 
ground troops were ever exposed to the herbicide and that no vets or 
their offspring had been shown to suffer health effects from it. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Both IOM studies used methodology that was anything but scientific.  
They largely ignored the volumes of data that showed no link between 
Agent Orange and health effects--the Ranchhander findings--and instead 
looked at studies of  Swedish and Dutch herbicide applicators, and the 
like. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Any study of anybody anywhere in the world with exposure to 
herbicides was used by IOM," explains Michael Gough, director of 
science and risk studies at the Cato Institute, a former chairman of 
the Ranchhand Advisory Committee, and author of the book Dioxin, Agent 
Orange. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One problem: None of these people were exposed to Agent Orange, but 
rather to other types of herbicides, many of which didn't even contain 
dioxin. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Moreover, the studies themselves consistently contradicted each other.  
One might find an excess of lung cancer but not of Hodgkin's disease.  
Another would find an excess of Hodgkin's disease but not of lung 
cancer. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ignoring such inconvenient facts, the IOM--well aware that it was 
working under political parameters and not scientific ones--seized on 
the slightest excuses to indict the herbicides even when the evidence 
weighed heavily on the other side. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
For example, their 1993 report listed 28 studies which looked for 
prostate cancer among persons exposed to herbicide.  Of these, three 
were positive (that is, they found a statistically significant 
increase), one was significantly negative, and 24 didn't go either 
way.  Bingo!  Herbicides cause prostate cancer.  Agent Orange is an 
herbicide.  Ergo, Agent Orange causes prostate cancer! 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"It's unbelievably bad what the IOM did," says Gough. "I think one of 
the major costs of something like this is that all the scientists, 
government and nongovernment, who have done their best to understand 
and explain the health of veterans are now discredited." 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Thus, he says, it also bodes ill for getting the truth out on Gulf War 
Syndrome, another alleged disease phenomenon that has more to do with 
politics than science. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ultimately, it is the vets themselves who will lose the most. Yes, 
some will get money, if they contract the right diseases. But at the 
same time, they're being needlessly terrified. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
How many vets will now refuse to have babies because they're afraid 
they will be born with birth defects?  How many will spend the next 
few decades agonizing that because of their Vietnam service they are 
far more likely to contract prostate cancer, a terrible illness to get 
even if you survive it?   
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Once again, Clinton has shown himself the enemy of the military.  And 
it's when he's making a show of being compassionate that he does the 
most damage.

<title>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</title>

<h2>GRAMM: CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
The Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are just a year away, and the contestants for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination are already out of the gate and heading for the first turn.  With an unpopular Democratic incumbent likely to be on top of the ticket -- for the first time in sixteen years -- and with a historic victory in last November's midterm congressional elections, Republican challengers are fighting to win a nomination many see as virtually guaranteeing a four-year lease on the White House.<p>
One GOP presidential aspirant has a leg up on the competition -- and maybe an arm, as well.  In the view of many political insiders, in fact, he's been preparing to run for President for at least the last decade, with his sights set on the 1996 GOP nomination.  With a secure Senate seat, a national fund-raising apparatus to go with his prodigious fund-raising skills, and an issue clearly in vogue, he is likely to be one of the finalists for the GOP crown.<p>
He is U.S. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, and though he has never before run for national office, he already is seen as a member of the GOP's top tier of presidential contenders.<p>
<b>THE NEW NOMINATING ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Before we can begin a dispassionate analysis of a presidential contender's prospects, we must recognize the changes in the rules regarding the nominating process, and their likely impact on the contest itself.<p>
The formal 1996 nominating season will be shorter than any in recent memory.  Large states like California and New York -- which, between them, control one-third of all the electoral votes needed to capture the White House -- long have held their primary elections relatively late in the election season.  As a result, they had relatively little influence over the party nominees.  Party activists in those two states, tired of having to support candidates largely chosen for them by others in states with earlier primary elections, finally rebelled and decided to move their respective state's primary elections up on the calendar, to give them more influence over the process.  Key midwestern states -- Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan -- facing the loss of their own influence as a result of the California and New York moves, are now considering holding their primaries on the same day in mid-March, as sort of a Midwestern regional primary.<p>
The result:  with California moving from early June to late March, and with New York moving from late April to early May, more than seventy percent of the delegates to the 1996 GOP convention will be chosen within a six-week period from mid-February to the end of March.<p>
The impact of the scheduling change on the nominating race could hardly be more dramatic.  No longer will long-shot candidates have the luxury of plotting an insurgent upset in Iowa or New Hampshire, then coasting on free media while raising money over the next several weeks.  In the new environment, money will matter even more than previously; candidates simply won't have time to raise large amounts while in the heat of battle.  Most seasoned analysts expect that a candidate will have to have a minimum of $20-$25 million on hand on January 1, 1996, to have a serious shot at winning.  And the shortened time-frame means that name identification and media skills will increase in value, as well.<p>
This new environment, then, favors candidates with the ability to raise large amounts of money, who know how to present themselves well through the media, and who already have positive name identification.  On two of these three counts, Phil Gramm is well-armed for the competition.<p>
<b>GRAMM:  CANDIDATE FOR THE NEW ENVIRONMENT</b><p>
Money is the mother's milk of politics, now more than ever.  Of the last eight major party nominees for President -- that is, going back to the 1980 campaign -- seven were the candidates in their party who had the most money in the bank on December 31 of the year preceding the nomination contest.  The new primary schedule enhances the need for early money.  Gramm has some of the best fund-raising skills of any of the likely contestants -- including even Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, who has already run three national campaigns.  Even before the end of the 1994 election cycle, Gramm was far in front of the pack when measured by funds on hand for a potential run -- he had almost $8 million in the bank, as compared to about $2.5 million for Dole.  None of the other potential GOP candidates had even $1 million on hand.<p>
Too, Gramm knows how to raise money.  In his last Senate campaign, he spent more than $12 million; and since then, he has served four years as chairman of the Senate Republicans' campaign committee, the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  From his post at the NRSC, Gramm has had the opportunity to travel the country on behalf of dozens of GOP Senate candidates -- and, in the process, has acquainted himself with literally thousands of high-dollar donors, the kind who write $1,000 checks without a second thought.  It would not be too much of an exaggeration to say that every American who has contributed $5,000 or more to the GOP in the last four years probably has an autographed photograph of himself and Gramm hanging on the wall of his den or office.<p>
The second key to winning the GOP nomination will be positive name identification.  This is the chink in Gramm's armor.  As the field begins to shape up for 1996, Gramm runs far behind better-known party leaders like Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, Dan Quayle, and Dick Cheney.  In early trial polls, Gramm only captures 2-3 percent of the GOP vote against the field, while Dole and Kemp battle it out for first place in the low twenties and high teens.<p>
But name identification can be driven up with paid advertising -- as long as there is adequate money to finance it.  As noted above, Gramm will likely have more money to spend than any other candidate in the field.  Thus, it is the third key to the nomination -- media skills -- that likely will become the determining factor.<p>
Media skills can be broken down into PAID media skills and EARNED media skills.  "Paid" media is just that -- media advertising paid for with campaign dollars; "earned" media is time on the mass media earned by the candidate for making news in some way.<p>
Gramm's earned media skills have, for the most part, been little better than adequate.  His slow Texas twang turns off Northeasterners as much as it soothes Southerners; but his wit and his knack for framing issues serve him well in the studio interview setting.  He has been known to drone on in speeches to large gatherings; he is perhaps best-remembered for his long-winded and boring keynote speech to the 1992 GOP convention in Houston.<p>
But while Gramm may not be well-armed when it comes to basic earned media skills, when the battleground shifts to PAID media skills, there is not a stronger warrior on the field.  Gramm's television commercials are things of beauty, miniature movies -- not surprising, given the attention Gramm pays them, not to mention the money he lavishes on these mini-productions.<p>
In big states like New York and California, the ability to successfully communicate with the electorate through television advertising is THE key to success.  And that means just two things are needed:  a good flight of commercials, and the money to saturate the media.  Gramm will have both.<p>
<b>SOME NEGATIVES</b><p>
It's a good thing Gramm has money going for him, because he's got to overcome several handicaps on his way to the White House.  To begin, no Republican has gone directly from the Senate to the presidency in this century (and only one Democrat, John Kennedy, has made the trip); Senate experience appears not to be as great a plus as experience in a governor's mansion, which, with its executive decision-making prerogatives, is viewed by most voters as a better testing ground for the nation's chief executive.<p>
Moreover, Gramm -- long known to the public at large as a conservative activist -- starts with a relatively small base in his own party, as a result of the kind of internecine warfare among conservatives that threatens to divide their movement and render it politically impotent.<p>
At issue is Gramm's support for the 1990 budget deal -- which included what was then the biggest tax increase in the nation's history -- despite President Bush's promise of no new taxes.  While conservatives on and off Capitol Hill raged about the President's betrayal, Gramm loyally carried water for Bush, and was pilloried by purist conservatives for his apostasy.  The following year he opposed a Social Security payroll tax cut offered by Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and even opposed another Social Security payroll tax cut -- combined with a capital gains tax cut -- offered by Republicans Malcolm Wallop and Tom DeLay.<p>
These heresies have given cause to some conservatives to think that Gramm -- a former economics professor at Texas A&M -- cares about only the spending side of the budget equation, and that he is unwilling to consider tax cuts as stimulative and necessary.  To most Americans, these arcane debates -- pitting minority factions of a minority party against one another -- remind them of nothing so much as Medieval arguments over how many angels will fit on the head of a pin; but to the conservative activists who have enormous influence over the nominating process of the Republican Party, they are important tests of purity.  If Gramm allows himself to be boxed in to a corner marked "green eye-shade Republican" along with Bob Dole, he will leave the economic optimist label open to others.<p>
But it's not just money and access to money that sets Gramm apart from the rest of the Republican field; it is another trait, deep in his bones.  In the words of one former House colleague of Gramm's, "Phil wakes up in the morning and thinks to himself, 'What are the ten things I need to do today to be President?' -- and then he gets seven of them done."  It is a driving ambition deep within Gramm, a determination to do what it takes in order to be President.??<p>

<title>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>BRADLEY TO REELECT CLINTON?</h2>
<i> by Bill Pascoe</i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Add Bill Bradley to a list that already includes Ross Perot, Colin Powell, and Jesse Jackson, and what do you have?  On the surface, a list of possible Independent candidates for the presidency -- but below the surface, a recipe for the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
For even as the political class muses loudly and publicly about the erosion of two-party politics and the breakdown of civil society -- both because the Establishment finds such talk interesting in an otherwise slow news month, and because it sells newspapers -- it blithely overlooks a fundamental fact gleaned from any in-depth analysis of American political history:  that national elections are about relatively simple choices; that much more often than not, those choices boil down to ONE simple question in the minds of most voters (to wit, Do I want to return the incumbent party for another four years in the White House?); and that, therefore, virtually any Independent candidacy (to the extent it is effective in its goal, which is to win votes) can have but one result -- the reelection of Bill Clinton.<p>
Of course, there are exceptions to the rule.  In 1996, the exception could be Mr. Jackson.  A Jackson Independent candidacy would likely have two effects, at least one of which would be good for the Democratic Party:  on the down side, a likely split-off of the black vote, with much of it going to Mr. Jackson, thereby making more difficult Mr. Clinton's chances for reelection; but on the good side,  an increased turnout among black voters, which could redound to the party's benefit in salvaging congressional seats that otherwise would be considered at risk.<p>
The jury is still out on whether Mr. Jackson will run or not.  The betting here is that he won't.  But that still leaves Messrs. Bradley, Powell, and Perot.<p>
And if even one of the three were to mount a serious Independent candidacy -- let alone a combination, or even, possibly, all three -- the likely result would be a renewal of Mr. Clinton's lease at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.<p>
Ah, the Conventional Wisdom says, of course that's true of potential Independent bids by Mr. Powell or Mr. Perot.  Both of them, according to the CW, would draw more heavily from the GOP presidential candidate.  Nothing new there.  But how would an Independent bid by a known Democrat like Mr. Bradley enhance Mr. Clinton's electoral prospects?  Wouldn't he draw from the  Democratic base vote, and weaken the President?<p>
No.  Mr. Clinton has a firm hold on his party's base vote.  Feminists, liberals, pro-abortionists, welfare recipients, gays, environmentalists, union members, public service employees -- the traditional Democratic coalition -- are still solidly behind the President, who has done as much as he can to deliver for them.  He was elected to office with 43 percent of the vote, and his approval ratings have hovered within a ten point range of that margin throughout his presidency, never dropping much below, even though he never gets too high.<p>
More importantly, any analysis that projects presidential results based on a simple reading of partisan loyalties -- or even ideological loyalties -- misses the point.  When push comes to shove in the polling booth, voters choose not on the basis of party or ideology, but on whether they want to give the incumbent party another four years in power.  Just ask Ken DeCell and Alan Lichtman, whose seminal book THE THIRTEEN KEYS TO THE PRESIDENCY remains the best analysis -- and projection 
model -- for explaining voter behavior in presidential elections.<p>
By their standards, a Perot or Powell candidacy would help Mr. Clinton not because they would split the GOP vote with the Republican candidate, but because they would split the ANTI- INCUMBENT vote with the Republican candidate.  (Interestingly, a close examination of exit polls from 1992 shows that, contrary to much of the Conventional Wisdom, Mr. Perot didn't actually hurt President Bush, he HELPED him, by splitting the anti-incumbent vote then, too; had Mr. Perot not run in 1992, the result would have been NOT a Bush reelection, but a Clinton LANDSLIDE victory.)<p>
Similarly, a Bradley Independent candidacy would provide a second option NOT for those inclined to return to Mr. Clinton to the White House, but to those seeking his removal.  And to the extent he waged a serious campaign and actually won serious votes, he would, necessarily and concomitantly, draw anti-incumbent votes from the anti-incumbent candidate -- e.g., the Republican nominee.<p>
Thus, in the unlikeliest of paradoxes, an Independent bid by a long-time Democrat unsatisfied with his party's presidential leadership would likely have just the opposite of its supposedly intended effect.<p>
Mr. Bradley has been accused of many things in his career, but being stupid isn't one of them.  The day before he announced his potential Independent candidacy, he claims to have called 120 people to tell them of his decision to retire from the Senate, and to discuss future options.  Would someone please send him Mr. DeCell's phone number?<p>

some very old advice</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Ooooooooohh, does Bob Dole -- the real Bob Dole, not the prettied-up Bob Dole -- make the bimbos mad.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's too soon to know which Bob Dole we'll get by November, because some of his handlers, in the Nice Republican tradition, yearn for the applause of the aging liberals in the media.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Some others, on the other hand, understand that the ground across America has shifted. Some of the Nice Republicans think this is because they've got something on the bottom of their shoes, and the others understand the earthquake rumbling beneath their feet.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Nice Republicans take their cues from The Washington Post, which they, like a lot of Washington, despise for its deceit and arrogance but nevertheless take their cues from it. Ignoring The Post is as difficult as ignoring the stink of a dead skunk under your bedroom window. It takes a stronger stomach than a lot of people were born with.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>So these Nice Republicans trembled on cue because Mr. Dole rebuked NBC-TV's Katie Couric for her adversarial scolding of Mr. Dole for his not joining the crusade against tobacco.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"Instead," reported The Post July 4 on Page One, "the former Kansas senator, who volunteered his doubts about the addictiveness of cigarette smoking during a tour of tobacco-producing Kentucky almost three weeks ago, has continued to wage war with the news media on the issue" (italics mine).<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Wage war with the news media?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Why, you might ask, would the news media -- news media being journalogical jargon for "reporters" -- be waging a war against a candidate for president of the United States in the first place? Don't the "news media" advertise themselves as neutral in these disputes? Odd that you should ask.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Post's description of the parties in the dispute tells you even more about media neutrality: The candidate is "old Dole," who is the "picture of frustration," picking on Miss Couric, "a popular anchorwoman known for her perky image and big smile." <BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The description of Miss Couric is accurate enough as far as it goes, and fairly daring for the politically correct Post, because this is the shorthand of aging white guys, their lechery showing, for "the perky boobs, blond hair and empty head that are the requisites for network-news pinups."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But it's not that Mr. Dole, treating Miss Couric with the respect that feminists say they despair of getting from old white guys like Mr. Dole, was picking on a little lady who merely parrots in a silkier voice what she hears the boys say. This is exactly how George Bush gobbled up Dan Rather for breakfast in a famous interview in 1988, which was grudgingly applauded even by the media notabilities who didn't like him, and the only difference between Mr. Rather and Miss Couric is that Katie is prettier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole, too bad for him, challenges a doctrine of media theology. Tobacco is this season's fashionable evil -- like eating steak and potatoes, or going to church. Enlightened people just don't indulge in such morbid things. (Speaking of behavior modification, the real old Dole would challenge President Clinton to scold gays for their addiction to practicing anal sex, the chief conductor of the AIDS virus, which is far deadlier than tobacco smoke.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's enough to make little Richard Cohen bang his rattle against the wall on the op-ed page at The Post: ". . . he went after [Miss] Couric, the Dorothy of our early morning Oz." (Won't someone please send this poor guy a man-size box of Kleenex?)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>There's evidence, scant but nevertheless just visible, to suggest that Mr. Dole is at last paying occasional attention to his own instincts. Only in Washington can you hear grown-ups question the universally held belief that the media are relentlessly liberal, or suggest that a candidate is out of step for saying what everyone already thinks.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole has been in politics long enough, longer than his armchair skeptics, to understand that neither he nor anyone else will take down Bill Clinton with a campaign designed to please the League of Women Voters. He'll have to fight with the tenacity, energy, guile and shrewdness of Mr. Clinton, who in turn will fight with the artifice, deception and cunning that propelled him from the casino-and-racetrack culture of Hot Springs to the hothouse of Washington and the White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The rap on Mr. Clinton is that he has elevated phoniness to high art. You might not like Bob Dole's indulgence of tobacco smoke, or even his treating a network bimbo with the respect he accords his other media adversaries, but the anger looks authentic. His only hope for November is that authenticity is what America is yearning for. America, not America's media, is the authentic constituency.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<IMG SRC="/wash_times/pruden.gif"><BR><font size=7>A familiar odor from<BR>
the summer of '73</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton is not a crook. We have Chris Dodd's word on it.<BR>
  And the word of Paul Sarbanes, Mary McGrory, Richard Cohen, Jim Hoagland, Tom Lantos and maybe Norman Ornstein. And Mark Fabiani's and Mike McCurry's.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The Democratic defensive line -- the politicians, academics and journalists who work hard to make our lives happy and productive, if only we would listen to them -- assures us that despite all the evidence that the ganglion of criminal scandal called Whitewater may look like a duck, walk like a duck and even quack like a duck, it's really a turkey.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Nothing upsets these refined worthies more than for someone to remark on the obvious, that the Clinton White House smells like the Nixon White House, that the flavor of the Clintonoid excuses, rationalizations and tortured justifications is remarkably similar to the taste of stale Nixonian leftovers, and that Pennsylvania Avenue reeks of the aroma that old-timers remember from the summer of '73.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"On my scorecard," writes Jim Hoagland in The Washington Post, "the president has endured a couple of bad but far from fatal weeks as the Senate Whitewater committee rolled out its final, conflicting reports, old associates in Arkansas were convicted in crooked land deals and House hearings revealed the White House's improper possession of more than 400 FBI investigative files. All that hurts, but there was no smoking gun: The Clintons were not personally and conclusively linked to major scandal."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Say what? Mr. Hoagland, a genial fellow who has heretofore successfully disguised himself as a wise-policy wonk and good-government groupie, thus reduces the Clinton White House "enemies list," to which he insists the Clintons are not "conclusively linked" even though it happened in their house, from outrage to merely a matter of "impropriety." We didn't hear this kind of excuse for Chuck Colson, who went to prison for the possession of a single FBI file.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mary McGrory, still waiting for JFK to float out of his grave at Arlington to rescue Camelot, mocks the Republicans on the Whitewater committee as witch-hunters: "They put a pointed hat on Hillary Clinton ... and they all but called her ... the wicked witch of the White House. But that doesn't make it Watergate. She isn't the president." Evita Peron wasn't the president of Argentina, either, but she did a good imitation of the maximum leader. (Don't cry for me, Arkansas.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Tom Lantos, the congressman from California, turned livid the other day when someone on Bill Clinger's committee, investigating Hillary's beheading of Billy Dale, remarked on the perfectly obvious, that the Clintons, who matured, sort of, in the Watergate years, learned nothing from that experience, except how to do it better.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Paul Sarbanes, who hectored the Nixon men without mercy for crimes less outrageous than those for which the Clinton men -- and women -- have implicated themselves and each other, finds the Clintons guiltless of doing anything wrong in Washington and even perfectly innocent of anything shady in Arkansas. (Ain't nobody here but us chickens.) Richard Cohen, the conscience of The Washington Post, assures us that he took time out from his bizarre feud with blacks to personally investigate the FBI files scandal and found nothing to worry about. (So there.) The good gray Norman Ornstein, also writing in The Post, says what went wrong at the White House was a bureaucratic snafu after all: The Clintons cut the size of the White House staff, and shouldn't have, because what they (and we) actually need in Washington are more bureaucrats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>For their part, the Clintons keep sending poor Mark Fabiani out to tell the reporters artless fibs, stretchers, fables, myths and yarns every time another scandal rocks the house. The president has put him in the position of the man who, caught by his wife between the sheets with her best friend, tells his wife: "I guess you'll try to make something out of this."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Fabiani will be on call over the next few weeks as the second Whitewater trial proceeds in Little Rock, where two bankers are on trial for robbing their bank in behalf of Bill Clinton when he needed the last few sacks of cash to sew up his gubernatorial election in 1990.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's fingerprints, so far as we know, were not on the deal. David Hale, his earlier banker angel, says Mr. Clinton was always insistent that his hands never touch the deals he designed.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton, up 20 points in the polls and looking at disgrace and ruin, is his daddy's salesman son, still trying to sell the notion that nobody but David Hale, a convicted felon, has accused him of anything illegal. But one by one the president's men are becoming convicted felons.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Sort of reminds people with long memories of Richard Nixon.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<p><font size=7>Trying to beat nothing<BR>
with not very much</font></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole poses an interesting question for America in 1996: Can a man with no strength of his convictions beat a man with the strength of no convictions?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Dole seems determined to campaign on a platform that can be boiled down to a forgettable bumper sticker: "Vote Republican: We're Not as Bad as You Think We Are."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bill Clinton's message, no less succinct, is the mirror image of the Republican slogan: "Vote Democratic: You're Right, We Bad -- And You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This sets up an interesting Hobson's choice, with each alternative worse than the other, and the answer may tell us not only who the president will be, but a lot about who we are as a people. Bill Clinton and his campaign-year alter ego, Dickie Morris, understand that almost everybody mistrusts Mr. Clinton, many regarding him as a liar like his wife and a fraud like no other, but an amiable fraud nonetheless and a likable liar besides. Not only that, he's famous. Mr. Clinton and his guru believe that since America now keeps pace with fiction, liars rule.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is a man of character and principle, even if he gives the impression that he doesn't understand what that means, exactly. In any event, he gives the impression that he's not really serious about wanting to be president. He seems to think the presidency is something like being a senator, only bigger, if not necessarily better. He believes in things, but not too much, which is good, but he's not as famous as Bill Clinton, which is not so good.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The poor guy has been so long in the Senate, where cutting deals is the mark of leadership, that when he closes a sale now, he can't shut up. He had the abortion question squared and boxed, safely on the shelf, with all the Christian "extremists" willing to put their suspicions aside, and then somebody or something persuaded him that Colin Powell and John Warner and Christie Whitman and the pro-choice wing of the party deserved a little lagniappe. Having flaunted his tolerance in the face of the conservatives, he shoved it down their throats.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>He expects to bask in the applause of the liberals and Democrats whose approval such Republicans not-so-secretly covet. We'll see how long he has to wait for that. Within minutes after his tribute to the successes of 1970s liberalism in his farewell address to the Senate, all but ignoring the legacy of Ronald Reagan in his rush to shower accolades on the Democrats who thwarted the Gipper's revolution, the Democratic National Committee in return faxed a bulletin to political writers listing 10 bad things Mr. Dole had done as a senator. (Note to Colin Powell: They're ready for you.)<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Given the givens, selling himself as the lesser evil is not necessarily a hopeless strategy. Despite the piously naive cliches of the political-science professors, the pundits and the good-government groupies, most people vote against, not for. Bill Clinton has disillusioned a lot of his 43 percent of '92, but if he has persuaded many in the 57 percent who voted against him in '92 that he's better than they thought he was, it's difficult to find them.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>No one understands this better than Mr. Clinton and Dickie Morris. That's why Mr. Clinton is running this year as a conservative Republican. He'll steal every issue Bob Dole lets him steal, understanding that he can't fool all the people all the time, but with a little Clinton luck maybe he can fool enough.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What terrifies the president and the man behind the curtain is the sure and certain knowledge that, despite everything the media elites can do to persuade everyone otherwise, Americans are growing more, not less, conservative. A poll taken last month for USA Today demonstrates that 83 percent of Americans favor a balanced budget, 83 percent want to prohibit racial preferences (i.e., scrap affirmative action), 82 percent want to make English the official language, 80 percent want life sentences imposed on drug dealers, 74 percent want term limits, 73 percent want prayer in the schools, 73 percent oppose legalization of marijuana, 71 percent want to cut off welfare to deadbeats, 71 percent want to reduce the number of government agencies, 67 percent oppose same-sex "marriage," and 57 percent oppose partial-birth abortions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Exact or not, such percentages tell Mr. Clinton -- and almost any other politician who can stay awake through the second cup of coffee -- who the real extremists are, and that there's no percentage in diluting a conservative message.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That's why he intends to run to the right of Bob Dole if the Republican nominee lets him. Mr. Dole and his compassioneers, full of moderation and meekness, may persuade a few people that he's not as bad as they think he is, but he'll never get anyone to throw his hat in the air with a message like that. An army marches on its stomach, and you can't win a war on milk and toast.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

Fortunately, it's difficult to libel the dead.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The first lady, who worked as a staff lawyer for the congressional committees working to bring down Mr. Nixon an eon ago, is a quick study and she learned a lot. Her mistake, as it may turn out, is that she thought she could make the Nixon strategy work in her husband's White House.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Nixon's men came up with what they called "the modified limited hangout," the paying out of as few of the sordid details of the Watergate scandal as possible in hopes that the press would go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Mr. Clinton's men are similarly paying out the sordid details of the Whitewater collection of scandals -- any one of which might be worse than the third-rate burglary of the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate Office Building on Virginia Avenue NW -- in the hopes that the press, with an attention span shorter than you could find in any kindergarten class, will get bored and go away.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The modified limited hangout is not working any better for the Clintons than it did for Mr. Nixon, for whom ultimately it did not work at all. Pity the poor spokesmen at the White House. Not only are they asked to tell fibs, distortions and stretchers to the reporters, some of whom are finally getting it, but the fibs, distortions and stretchers change every hour on the hour.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Late last week, Mr. Clinton's hapless excuses men came up with the third and fourth explanations of why the president's lawyer (and we can assume that a smart Yale lawyer like Bill Clinton knew about it all the time) tried to get the confidential FBI files on Billy Dale, covering 30 years of his life, seven months after the first lady ordered him fired as director of the White House travel office.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Rep. William Clinger of Pennsylvania suggests that Bernard Nussbaum, who was the president's lawyer, sought the FBI documents because even then the White House was concocting a smear job on Mr. Dale. Naturally, Mr. Nussbaum couldn't remember sending the request to the FBI. Nobody in this White House ever remembers anything. This is the first White House in history to make Alzheimer's disease, with its consequent loss of memory, a helpful qualification for employment.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Then someone at the White House had another bright idea. Maybe someone could say that Mr. Dale was being considered for another White House position, and they needed the background checks to make sure they knew who he was. He had only worked for the U.S. government for three decades. This was an excuse first tried at the Nixon White House when, in a celebrated fiasco, it got caught putting together a dossier on a prominent Washington reporter and then insisted that he was being considered for an important job in the administration.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But wait! The FBI dossier was not asked for by Bernie Nussbaum, who as everybody knows would never pull a dirty trick, but by the General Accounting Office. Drat! Then the GAO said no, it had never asked for nor looked at FBI files on Mr. Dale.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Back to the drawing board once more: The White House said it asked the FBI for the files by "accident" when it routinely sought background reports on all White House employees. Bernie, George, Bruce, Patsy, Harold, Maggie, maybe even Hillary. Not just Billy and the boys, but everyone in the Goodtime Gang.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was too much for Louis Freeh, the director of the FBI. He certainly doesn't want to do a Patrick Gray imitation, and be left twisting slowly, slowly in the wind. He ordered a full investigation of the White House request for the FBI dossier.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>"He certainly doesn't want the bureau mixed up in this stuff," says an official at FBI headquarters. "He has moved to make sure that the public's perception is that there's not some cozy relationship between the White House and bureau executives."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This is surely a puzzlement to the president, accustomed to using the State Police for all manner of conveniences when he was the governor of Arkansas. Puzzling to the first lady as well, who thought she had learned from the errors of the Nixon White House and imagined that the failure was not in conception, but in execution.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

No cheap sentiment<BR>for his generation
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Gentlemen (and ladies): Start your spinning.

<BR><DD> This is the Bob Dole nobody expected to see, lean and tough and poignant without the cheap sentiment, and from the White House to the newsrooms of the elites (and some who only dream of being among the elites), the favorite adjective was &quot;desperate.&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;The irony of Dole's decision ... is that one of the pivots of Dole's campaign was in fact an admission of his defeat&quot; (from the Boston Globe). The announcement &quot;is a drastic bid to unyoke himself from an unpopular Republican Congress ...&quot; (from the San Jose Mercury News). &quot;A bold maneuver, full of potential perils - not the least the possibility that an electorate weary of tactics and stratagems would see his resignation from the Senate as just another gimmick ...&quot; (from the New York Times).

<BR><DD>Some of the punditry was born of the amnesia that strikes nearly everyone who has lived in Washington long enough to get a telephone. Says Peter Hart, the Democratic pollster: &quot;Dole will live to rue the day. ... It's too tactical. You're denying your career. It's like going back to Russell and announcing you're moving to New York.&quot;

<BR><DD>Kevin Phillips, the Democrats' favorite Republican analyst, agreed: &quot;I don't think this puts a whole lot of electricity in his socket. He can go out and give speeches, but the speeches he gave before were no good.&quot; Concurred Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution, echoing the favorite spinsters' word of the day: &quot;It sounds like a strategy that's a good deal more desperate than the situation demands now.&quot;

<BR><DD>There's no doubting that Mr. Dole was in tough shape - dire straits, a panic, up a creek without the paddle, almost any of the cliches the pundits rush to employ. But the speech, one of the most memorable campaign speeches since Ronald Reagan's famous speech for Barry Goldwater in 1964, does not strike the ears of Middle America as a gimmick, a stratagem or even a tactic. (Most people forgive politicians their tactics, even when they shoot trespassers.)

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole sounded at last like a man who knew what he was doing, who was saying what he thinks because he was speaking from the heart. His careful, precise allusion to his heroic service in World War II struck just the right grace note. There is life after all beyond a company job in the ultimate company town: &quot;I will be the same man I was when I walked into the room, the same man I was yesterday and the day before, and a long time ago when I arose from my hospital bed and was permitted by the grace of God to walk again in the world. And I trust in the hard way, for little has come to me except in the hard way, which is good because we have a hard task ahead of us.&quot;

<BR><DD>He does, indeed. But when he speaks his mind from his heart, it rings as true as the sound of distant battle. Speaking this way now, after so many months of avoiding all sentiment because he was afraid it would sound like cheap sentiment, makes it all the more believable. If hardly anyone can imagine authentic sincerity from Bill Clinton, who will say everything about anything to anybody, hardly anyone doubts that the tears and the choked sobs were real. Nobody, said Steve Forbes after watching the remarkable ceremony on television, can pucker a lip like Bill Clinton, and only the most foolish of fools would try.

<BR><DD>The most heartfelt part of the Dole farewell was the hardest for Washington to credit: &quot;My campaign for the president is not merely about obtaining office. It's about fundamental things, consequential things, things that are real. My campaign is about telling the truth, it's about doing what is right, it's about electing a president who's not attracted to the glories of the office, but rather its difficulties.&quot;

<BR><DD>Lincoln's famous observation about not being able to fool all the people all the time will get its test this year. Bill Clinton has a lot of things going for him - youth, vigor, the gift of gab unencumbered by steadfast principle or heartfelt conviction - and the greatest of all is his confident reliance on the cheerful willingness of the public to cut a little slack to a roguish shill.

<BR><DD>Mr. Dole is embarked on a mission to see how many adults are left in America. He has said that he thinks a man of his generation, arguably the bravest and most dependable since the nation sent two mighty armies to battle against each other and there was enough left over to tame a frontier and build a constellation of gleaming cities, has enough left over this time for one final mission.

<BR><DD>Like Hernando Cortes, the Spanish conquistador who burned his boats on the beaches of Mexico 400 years ago to impress upon his crewmen that they were in the New World to stand or die, the Republican candidate for president is gambling that America has had enough of the children's hour.

Somewhere there's a<BR>hero from Kansas
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>Now that someone from Kansas has to stand up to the wizard behind the curtain, where's Dorothy?

<BR><DD>The wizard, without even popping a sweat, has sent the Republicans into a tailspin a lot like the crash of George Bush in 1992, when his eye-popping poll numbers fell from 92 percent in the wake of the war in the Gulf to 38 percent in the ruins of November.

<BR><DD>One loud &quot;boo!&quot; from the nation's most famous draft dodger and the entire regiment of Republicans, who only yesterday imagined they should be posing for recruiting posters, went flying for cover, crawling up under the nearest front porch to hide with the dogs. Bill Clinton, who's never met a woman he didn't run after or a man he didn't run from, was the most astonished pol in town.

<BR><DD>When the president found someone to throw the first punch at Newt Gingrich, he never imagined that nobody would strike back. When he found someone to throw the second punch, he never imagined that the Republicans themselves would join in piling on.

<BR><DD>The campaign to demonize the speaker was simple and brutish: Throw out lies and distortions and scream even louder when the Republicans fire back. The lies got louder, but the Republicans never fired back.

<BR><DD>The speaker's aims were not radical, unless most of us are radical: Cut down the size of government, shrink the budget on which big government feeds, crack down on criminals, throttle welfare cheaters, strengthen the military, roll back the regulatory bureaucracy, cut the throat of the trial-lawyer lobby before everyone but the lawyers are bankrupt, limit the terms of congressmen so they can return home to productive jobs, take the necessary steps to preserve the medical-care safety net - and cut taxes. Some radicalism.

<BR><DD>So radical, in fact, that President Clinton adopted most of these goals himself, beginning with his assertion that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; None of his own troops, liberals all, believe he really means it. Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, the Vietnam war hero whose contempt for the organizer of Vietnam anti-war rallies is obvious, calls him &quot;an unusually good liar,&quot; and in this case the president's big-government allies feel reassured.

<BR><DD>Some of the speaker's erstwhile allies, in the bravura of the morning after the November '94 blowout, likened their mighty victory to the D-Day landings at Normandy. The analogy, for a bunch of guys who mostly spent the Vietnam war at the Student Union, sounded a little far-fetched to some aging ears, but if some of these warriors had been barreling across France in the summer of '44 they would have braked cold on hearing Axis Sally's first diatribe against that ol' meanie Georgie Patton, and looked for a barn to hide in. Second Lt. Al D'Amato would have wanted the Germans to understand that he never really liked that Patton fella, anyway.

<BR><DD>Who can be surprised that the clouds of pink and baby blue floating over the White House are made of gauze and giddiness? Bill Clinton hasn't had a stroke of luck like the Republican collapse since Monroe Schwarzlose, a turkey farmer so obscure that even Mrs. Schwarzlose wasn't sure who he was, turned up as his only serious opponent in a Democratic gubernatorial primary back home. (Mr. Clinton won, but not by much.)

<BR><DD>The moral is that the Republicans can make a race of it in '96, too, if they can figure out which end of the gun you shoot with, and how to tell a foot from foe.

<BR><DD>For weeks everyone in Washington was trying to figure out whether Bob Dole was asleep, or merely dead, and now they're trying to figure out whether Al D'Amato is the hit man from Cleveland, dispatched by Mr. Dole, or whether he's just a slap-happy, showing off.

<BR><DD>What the Republicans seem to have lost sight of - and Bill Clinton hasn't - is that the conservative tide is still running, and gaining momentum. The great risk to Republican fortunes is that the voters will conclude that the Grand Old Partypoopers never had the convictions they seemed to have the courage of only a few months ago. Bill Clinton has no convictions, either, but he knows better than anyone else how to fake it.

<BR><DD>Mike McCurry, his press agent, remarked May 6 that the pendulum measuring the Clinton fortunes is groaning against the rope, close to reaching its apogee. Soon everything that has been breaking in the president's favor may begin breaking the other way.

<BR><DD>But maybe not. Iron laws govern politics, but not the iron laws of physics. The Republicans think they've got the character issue cold, and maybe they do, but in a street fight and a presidential campaign raw courage can count for more than character.

<BR><DD>The wizard, trembling behind the curtain, understood that. So did a little girl from Kansas.

<title>Rockwell: Bad Law Bites Back -- 12/3/96</title>

<h2>Bad Law Bites Back  </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
The &quot;Contract with America,&quot; reflexively denounced
by leftliberals, was never as good as its bad reputation. It posed
as big government's tormentor, but on close analysis proved to
be more gimmick than gauntlet. It even included some planks that
increased the power of the central state.
<P>
One item in particular did positive harm. This was the Congressional
Accountability Act, passed in the first days of the last &quot;revolutionary&quot;
Congress. Its point was to apply the government's health and labor
laws to Congress, thereby ending its previous, and presumably
hypocritical, exemption. Hardly anyone stopped to ask: was there
a reason for exempting Congress in the first place? 
<P>
Congress is beginning to find out. If labor laws apply to
Congress, its employees can use the courts to demand quotas, form
unions, threaten strikes, and generally cause trouble. And who
enforces all these laws? Bureaucrats in the executive branch.
That gives the Clinton administrationor whoever happens to be
in chargedirect control of Congressional offices.  
<P>
In the American constitutional tradition, Congress is <I>supposed</I>
to be exempt from any laws enforced by the executive. Remember
the doctrine of the separation of powers that used to be taught
in highschool civics? Congress supervises the executive, not the
reverse. Any other system invites abuse of power, corruption,
and intimidation of the elected officials closest to the people.
<P>
Let's say some lawmaker wants to cut the budget of the Labor
Department, and has a good chance of succeeding. Well, maybe the
Secretary of Labor might get interested in whether this lawmaker
is obeying all the laws on overtime pay or racial nondiscrimination.
Just the accusation would cause harm.  
<P>
To avoid that kind of intimidation, lawmakers might decide
they have better things to do than attack the agencies with new
legal power over them. That takes the heat off the home of big
governmentthe executiveand puts it on the Congress, the branch
charged with overseeing the spending of our tax dollars. 
<P>
The proponents of the Accountability Act argued that if Congress
is going to impose lawslike racial quotas or the minimum wageon
the private sector, the least it can do is obey these laws themselves.

<P>
For starters, not all legislators vote for every law. Why
should a majority of lawmakers be able to impose laws, enforced
by the president, on a minority of lawmakers? Even if a law passes
unanimously in one Congress, why should a future Congress be bound
by it? Congressmen should have sovereign immunity from all these
laws, even when they are passed by the Congress itself. 
<P>
A case now before Congress illustrates the point. Members
of the U.S. Capitol Police, a Congressional institution, want
to form a union, an action made possible only by the police applying
the executivedepartment labor code to themselves. In response,
the Republicans have done the right thing: sued to prevent it
from happening.
<P>
As the Republicans arguethough not for the recordunionization
introduces all sorts of complications. Unionized cops can, for
example, engage in work slowdowns and expel conservative, antiunion
police. Moreover, unions are heavily political organizations,
backing Democrats in all national elections.
<P>
If this suit succeedsand it probably will notit would gut
the Congressional Accountability Act, which would be great. But
by attempting to prevent unionization, the 105th Congress puts
itself in the ironic position of trying to repeal one of the most
heralded, if wrongheaded, achievements of the 104th.
<P>
When imposed against private companies, U.S. health, safety,
and labor laws cost hundreds of billions in lost productivity
every year. They are a major source of the secular decline in
American business vibrancy. Why did Congress, which should be
trying to repeal these laws, instead expand them?
<P>
When confronted with this point, some people argue that the
real purpose is to make Congressmen &quot;feel&quot; the laws
they have imposed on the American people and thereby encourage
them to work towards cutting red tape. But this too is a flight
of fancy. The authors of the Contract believe in these laws for
the private sector, and meanwhile, good lawmakers face witch-hunts
by the regime they are supposed to be battling. 
<P>
 Congress is right in suing to stop a police union. But it
should also admit it made a mistake in imposing this law on itself,
repeal the darn thing, and then repeal the oppressive regulations
that make life a living heck for American business.
<P>

<title>December 2, 1996--Murder by Air Bag</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<I>December 2, 1996</I><p>
<h2>Murder by Air Bag</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR>
Can we trust government to regulate business? For an answer, take
a look at the great airbag fiasco. Five years ago, the government
mandated that air bags be installed in cars. In an instance of
death by government, these bags kill people involved in fender
benders. 
<P>
Turns out, the car makers were right about the dangers all along.
But they were browbeaten and overruled by the usual cabal of anticapitalist
militants, Congressional liberals, and regulatory bureaucrats.
Let's review the history. 
<P>
Ralph Nader and his political network never stopped trying to
replicate the successful smear of the Corvair, as found in his
famous fairy tale, <I>Unsafe at Any Speed</I>. In the seventies,
they dreamed up a new way to attack the car industry, by now vulnerable
to media assaults. 
<P>
Here's what Nader and the gang came up with. Hear ye, hear ye:
there's a technology that would massively cut automobile deaths.
It is a pillow that pops out of the steering wheel in an collision.
Yes, it's even better than the seatbelt.
<P>
So why aren't these magic pillows available on cars? Why, indeed,
aren't they mandatory? In a word: Greed, said Nader and Co. The
car makers could be spending money to save your life. Instead
they are lining their pockets with profits from unsafe vehicles.
<P>
Thus did the air bag become the leftwing craze of the Carter years.
Typically, the product and the mythology surrounding it embodied
socialist paranoia. In this view, the capitalist is secretly killing
the consumer while the average man is too stupid to know about
it, which is why we need the government to intervene.  
<P>
But if air bags were a valuable product worth the expense, car
companies would have installed them while Nader was in law school,
if only to gain an advantage over the competition. 
<P>
None of the Naderite nonsense was convincing to people who knew
something about markets. But the media laughed at company warnings:
that, first, air bags were not cost efficient (yes, you can put
a price tag on safety; we could all drive around in tanks, after
all). Second, air bags would make people think they could get
by without a seatbelt, thus increasing injury. 
<P>
Third, that air bags are not soft and fluffy at all, but can hit
your forehead like a 200 mph brick wall. You might have all your
limbs after a crash, but you might also be dead. The companies
warned that children and small women were particularly at risk.
<P>
But the crash dummies favored by the consumer groups didn't test
for this factor, and, anyway, the well had been poisoned. The
media dismissed company complaints as more evidence of the capitalist
conspiracy to make people drive dangerous cars.
<P>
The government prevailed against the car companies, and the airbag
mandate went into effect. Everyone cheered Ralph and booed Detroit.
But the bags added billions to the cost of cars, led Americans
to drive more recklessly, and directly killed some fifty people
in just the last three years, including the infant who was decapitated
by an air bag in Idaho.
<P>
Haven't they also saved 1,500 lives? That's the claim, but there's
no way to know. It's easy for the airbag lobby to play fast and
loose with these hypotheticals.
<P>
Plus, it's one thing to have a loved one die in a tragic traffic
fluke; it's quite another to have him killed by a government mandate.
It's the difference between falling and being shoved off a ledge.

<P>
To correct the problem, the government is considering a number
of options. One is to allow people to have their air bags disconnected
by car dealerships. That's right: they can't do that legally now.
<P>
Another is to mandate a huge warning sign on the dashboard: WARNING!
DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY CAN OCCUR. Thanks a lot. Another is to
mandate a &quot;smart&quot; bag that will supposedly adjust to
your height and weight so it won't kill you. Still another would
order you to keep your baby in the back seat (as if a single parent
could take a long commute that way).
<P>
Mandate, mandate, mandate, that's all the government can talk
about. Instead, those behind this mess should be offering public
apologies and then forced to pay compensation to the families
who've had their mothers and children murdered by air bags, to
the car buyers who've had their prices artificially increased,
and to the car companies that have been vilified and harassed.
<P>
Even if the government won't draw the right lesson from this fiasco,
we should. Don't trust the feds with your safety. Trust those
in private enterprise, who have the best interests of the consumer
in mind. They won't kill you and then lie about it. 
<P>

<title>Rockwell: The Republican Mixed Economy -- 8/22/96</title>

<h2>The Republican Mixed Economy</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 




In the 1950s and following, when full-blown socialism began to lose 
its intellectual credibility, there arose a theory of the "mixed 
economy." The idea was that the best of socialism and capitalism can 
be combined into a new system that curbs the excesses of both. The 
result was the political economy of contradiction: "market socialism," 
"collective entrepreneurship," and "community investment," among many 
other strange hybrids. <p>

The theory of the mixed economy didn't get very far, no doubt because 
of its confused and conflicting character. Property is either private 
or it isn't. Prices either float freely or they don't. Investment is 
either market-driven or it's not. One system must dominate the other, 
in the same way that cars must drive on the left- or the right-hand 
side of the road. <p>

The idea of the mixed economy may have fizzled among American liberals 
(though academic publishers are still enthralled with the idea). In 
the Republican Party, however, the idea is making a huge comeback. The 
party is not backing the old mix of socialism and capitalism or 
anything as systematic as that; it is backing the political economy of 
polar opposites.<p>

No where is this more evident than in the Republican treatment of the 
budget. With Jack Kemp on the ticket, supply sideism has again become 
the dominant fiscal ideology. There's nothing wrong with the idea that 
tax cuts fuel economic growth. The American people are overtaxed, and 
only an all-out statist would deny it. The problem is the belief that 
government spending can go up forever without someone, sometime, 
having to pay for it. <p>

The Republican plan has not spelled out any spending cuts because Jack 
Kemp doesn't believe they're necessary (as he demonstrated during his 
free-spending HUD years). He's got a long history of excoriating 
people to his right who have the courage to call for cuts in Social 
Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare generally. He never misses 
the chance to underscore the ticket's desire to keep the social 
"safety net" exactly the way it is, or even expand it. <p>

In some areas, Republicans are pushing for huge spending increases. 
For example, they say that the Clinton administration has cut the 
military budget too far too fast, and that they will reverse course 
with tens of billions in new spending. And they are promoting the 
hare-brained idea that taxpayers should foot the private-school bills 
of any kid who is dissatisfied with public school. <p>

At the same time, tax cuts have become the centerpiece of the 
campaign. They are promising a three-year 15 percent cut in income tax 
rates, a per child tax rebate, and a 50 percent capital gains tax cut. 
That's laudable, though the full program--even if it passes--won't 
begin to reverse the tax increases Robert Dole has engineered during 
his 35 years in office. <p>

For once, liberals are asking the right question: where in tax-cut 
land is the money going to come from to supply new guns to the 
Pentagon, and a $2000 annual voucher to every "poor" child in America? 
The candidates won't say, except to suggest that this contradiction 
will be solved through the mysterious magic of "economic growth." 
Private enterprise can be enlisted, unwittingly, to pay for ever-
higher public spending. <p>

The ticket compounds the error by suggesting it will "end the IRS as 
we know it," a phrase designed to lead voters to believe they will no 
longer have to answer to the tax police. Here again, the idea is a 
fine one. But to make it a reality, government must dramatically curb 
its appetite for spending. Without such curbs, the promise to stop 
collecting taxes, or make paying them less onerous, is deeply 
deceptive.  <p>

There is such a thing as the bottom line. Every dime in new public 
spending must be extracted from private markets, either through 
stepped-up use of the taxing power or more borrowing, or by calling on 
the Federal Reserve to monetize the debt by printing money. All three 
have a destabilizing effect on the financial markets at some point. 
There's no such thing as having your cake and eating it too. <p>

The same contradictions spoil the Republican monetary policy. Jack 
Kemp has long advocated a gold standard (or, more strictly, a gold 
price rule for monetary management). But the chief benefit of the gold 
standard is that it puts shackles on the ability of government to 
borrow and monetize debt. You can always print paper money (which is 
why politicians like our present money system), but gold has a fixed 
supply (alchemy being the stuff of legend). <p>

At the same time, Kemp evangelizes for giving the poor more "access to 
credit." He endorses the dangerous movement to force banks to lend 
money to borrowers on grounds of their lowly economic status, without 
regard to whether the loans will be paid back on time or ever. This 
policy requires the kind of loose money regime absolutely prohibited 
by the gold standard. You can't expect to gain the benefits of a gold 
standard unless you're willing to accept its discipline. <p>

The same mixed-up approach is evident in their statements about 
regulation. Dole and Kemp employ the rhetoric of deregulation and call 
for the government to stop muscling private enterprise. At the same 
time, just prior to the convention, Dole told a group of disability 
activists that he is going to expand enforcement of his pet Americans 
With Disabilities Act.<p>

Yet the ADA--which calls on all public and private entities  to make 
accommodation for every conceivable disability, physical or mental--is 
surpassed only by the Clean Air Act in the costs and burdens it places 
on business. According to the letter of the law and court precedent, 
practically every business and public facility is in violation right 
now. For that reason, the ADA has become the latest get-rich-quick 
scheme for the litigious overclass of trial lawyers. <p>

So it goes for the freedom of association. The ticket has strongly 
implied it will retain the laws imposing affirmative action; indeed 
Kemp has been a rabid advocate of these policies. At the same time, 
the Republicans want to be seen as opposing "quotas," the logical and 
necessary outcome of anti-discrimination laws empowering the 
government with defining what constitutes illegal preference in the 
workforce. <p>

On and on it goes with welfare spending (they promise both a 
guaranteed national income and policies to force people to work), 
education (they promise to abolish the Department of Education and to 
have it administer a federal voucher program), immigration (they 
promise to end the free ride and give immigrants full rights to 
welfare), and trade (it is supposed to be both "free" and "fair," i.e. 
restrictive).  <p>

The final and most brazen contradiction has been the Republican 
Achilles heel for at least three decades. They promise smaller 
government at home while insisting that the U.S. step up its empire of 
foreign aid, foreign troops, and foreign wars. This is the most deeply 
dishonest of all the clashing positions within the Republican grab 
bag. A government big enough to run a global empire will hardly shrink 
from total social management at home. <p>

Philosophers speak of antinomies: contradictory truths that may not 
negate each other. Unfortunately for Republicans, these do not exist 
in economic policy. The mixed economy of Robert Dole and Jack Kemp is 
just as mixed-up as the attempt to blend socialism and capitalism. 
Reality eventually forces the politicians who try it to choose one 
path or the other. <p>

<title>Rockwell: Conservatives and Vouchers -- 7/22/96</title>
</head>

<h2>
Conservatives and Vouchers</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Seeking to align himself more closely with conservatives 
before the Republican convention, Bob Dole has endorsed a federal 
school voucher program. But if he had done his homework, he would 
have known that conservatives have grave reservations about 
putting private schools on the dole. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Dole's idea is a four-year pilot program that would cost 
$5 billion, with half the bill paid by the federal government 
providing the states foot the rest. Four million students from 
mostly poor families would get grants to attend private schools.
This is "a civil rights movement for the 1990s," he said. Is it? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For decades, conservatives have debated with liberals on 
education. Liberals say money needs to be redistributed from rich 
districts to poor ones, and overall spending increased 
dramatically. Bosh, say conservatives. The answer lies with local 
control, returning to basics, and rewarding achievement. Throwing 
more money at the problem--especially federal money--will not 
work. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To which side of the debate does the voucher idea belong? 
Vouchers means new federal spending in a new federal education 
program that violates the 10th amendment. Vouchers guarantee 
perpetually higher budgets for the Department of Education, which 
will distribute them. Vouchers get the feds involved in the 
funding and running of private schools, something not even Mr. 
Clinton's Goals 2000 does. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even Mr. Dole's pitch is strangely class-based: we should 
take from the rich, who send their kids to private schools 
because "they have the money," and give to the poor, so they can 
have "choice" too. The implication is that disparities in wealth 
are inherently unjust; it takes subsidies to make people truly 
free. Only the far-left used to talk like this. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course rich people have more "choice" than poor people, 
and not only in the schools they attend. Rich people can live in 
nicer homes, drive nicer cars, dress better, eat fancier food, if 
they so choose. Mr. Dole says "that's not the way it ought to 
work in America." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Oh? There's a name for the system that allows such 
disparities: it's capitalism. Those who work hard, save, and 
invest benefit materially, as they should. And by spending their 
own dollars on private school, people are investing in the future 
of their children. How strange that Mr. Dole would be the one to 
offer such a radical critique of this system. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What's brand new in Mr. Dole's plan is that vouchers would 
also be given to home schoolers. That's a sure path to disaster. 
The feds would not only monitor and license these caring 
mothers--the way social workers do welfare recipients--but also 
determine what and how many hours they teach. Goodbye 
homeschooling. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Already Americans are taxed to the hilt to pay for failing 
public schools. Already states are strapped by intrusive federal 
regulations that have transformed many schools into condom-
distributing, multicultural petri dishes. Now, Republicans are 
supposed to get behind a program that will do to private schools 
what the feds have done to public ones? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's safe to say that Mr. Dole's idea won't go far. Of course 
teachers unions oppose vouchers. But so does an organized 
movement of religious and economic conservatives in the 
Republican Party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
George Roche of Hillsdale College says vouchers would remake 
private schools "into the image of the very public schools that 
have failed so miserably." Ronald Trowbridge adds that "if 
government vouchers are extended to private primary and secondary 
schools," private schools "will become virtually extinct." 
Columnist Samuel Francis says that if vouchers pass, the nation's 
"private and parochial schools would soon be homogenized by the 
same government that has already ruined public schools."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Looking at the budget figures, Charlotte Allen, writing in 
the American Spectator, is shocked by the sheer cost. Taxpayers 
will "find themselves obliged to pay for a private-school system 
on top of a public-school system." Worst of all, they will "leave 
us even more in thrall to a powerful central government."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pat Buchanan, who once backed them, says he took "a hard 
second look at those school vouchers." Now he predicts they will 
"entail greater state contamination and control." Why not "give 
the billions back to taxpayers" in tax cuts, he asks? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economist Murray Rothbard was once asked what he proposed in 
place of vouchers. Abolish the Department of Education, he said, 
repeal regulations on private schools, cut public school budgets, 
and insure local control. Finally, Dr. Rothbard said, the best 
voucher is a person's own hard-earned dollar; government should 
let us keep what we earn. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead, Mr. Dole has proposed yet another far-flung federal 
program. On this issue, as with many others, he has abandoned the 
true conservative position, and thrown in his lot with the 
big-spending, egalitarian left.

<title>Rockwell: Alienation in American Politics -- 7/8/96</title>

<h2>
Alienation in American Politics 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "alienation" of workers 
exploited by wage slavery. Someday, they predicted, the system 
would come unglued, and the workers would expropriate the 
expropriators. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a bunch of malarkey, to be sure; no system is as 
exploitative as socialism. Yet alienation does exist: it's what 
average citizens feel towards the political process and the 
massive federal government it sustains. Every day we are 
exploited more and more, and yet seem powerless to change 
anything. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the recent example of VMI and the Citadel, proud 
and ancient institutions steeped in the respective histories of 
their states. As single-sex military academies, they offered 
young men the camaraderie only this setting can provide. Then, 
for no good reason, a majority of the Supreme Court decided it 
didn't like these schools. In one fell stroke, they are 
destroyed. It's the kind of action that alienates citizens from 
their government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example involves Stalinesque demographic planning. 
Federal judges in Baltimore, Maryland, and Dallas, Texas, have 
decided that inner-city public housing residents should be living 
in the suburbs, again, for no good reason. By court order, these 
residents will be dispersed according to a government plan and at 
taxpayer expense. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is wildly unpopular, both among those who pay to live 
in nice areas and among public-housing residents. When a similar 
scheme was tried in Chicago, it led to enormous social upheaval, 
huge population shifts, and the wrecking of formerly decent 
neighborhoods. No doubt, if the judicial dictators get their way, 
the same will happen in Baltimore and Dallas. Yet exploited 
citizens are powerless to stop these schemes. No wonder they feel 
so alienated from the government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Another example was brought home by the bombing in Saudi 
Arabia. How many people knew the U.S. stationed thousands of 
troops at the King Abdul Aziz air base in Dhahran? Of those, how 
many think the U.S. has a vital interest in continuing to do so? 
Yet when 19 Americans were killed, the obvious solution--bring 
the troops home--escaped everyone in Washington. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bloated military budget and the foreign policy it 
supports have virtually nothing to do with the average citizen. 
Only the traditional beneficiaries of imperialism gain: 
politicians, corporate exporters, military contractors, lifetime 
bureaucrats, and spooks. The long-suffering taxpayer is alienated 
from the whole system, yet powerless to change it. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The examples provided by the last few years could be 
multiplied without end. Clintonian tax increase, Nafta, Gatt, the 
Mexican bailout, welfare for immigrants: all are projects of federal 
government, all were fantastically unpopular, yet all were 
steamrollered through anyway. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Marxists used to talk about the "power elite"--the 
wealthy and unaccountable capitalists who oppress the workers. 
Who today denies that American politics is in fact dominated by a 
power elite? This class is not made of capitalists, who make 
their living, after all, by serving the consuming public. It 
consists of employees and hangers-on of the federal government 
itself. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Alienation is fueled by the obvious reality that the power 
elite does not have independent means of support. The huge public 
treasury they have at their disposal is transferred directly from 
the paychecks of the working class. This creates a permanent 
state of conflict, and deepening political discontent unlike any 
we've seen. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some people drop out of politics altogether, and turn 
towards radical groups with a leftist or rightist bent. Those 
still active seek other outlets, including third parties. Most
Americans think two parties are not enough. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What else can we expect when the nominees of the major 
parties are such open representatives of the ruling class? But if 
Watergate undermined faith in the presidency and in government 
generally, what will the newest unflattering revelations about 
Bill Clinton do? They can only increase alienation and 
discontent, and cast a permanent pall on the Beltway elite. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elite may bemoan this fact, but the rise of intense 
anti-government feeling is the most encouraging development in 
modern political life. Jefferson and Madison said a free people 
should never have confidence in men with power. The bigger the 
government, the less it should be trusted, and the less it's 
trusted, the more likely it is to fall. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In Marxist lore, history would settle all scores in favor of 
socialism. But the opposite is happening, and, because the system 
cannot hold, time is running out for leviathan. The expropriated 
taxpayers will have their day, the troops will come home, the 
central planning will end, and the dictatorship of the power 
elite will be no more. Then we will understand the one truth in 
Marxism: the state can wither away.

<title>Rockwell: Clinton's Libertarian Cloak -- 7/3/96</title>

<h2>
Clinton's Libertarian Cloak 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's a crazy, mixed-up political world when Bill Clinton 
comes out for individualist libertarianism. The trend began in 
his state of the union address when he announced that "the era of 
big government is over"--and then proposed half a dozen new 
government programs. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But that statement was merely a coming attraction. During a 
press grilling on the FBI files controversy, Mr. Clinton said he 
is "appalled" by "any kind of abuse of public authority that 
tramples on the liberties of individual citizens." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He's gone beyond stealing Republican issues. Now he's 
remaking himself in the image of Patrick Henry and Thomas Paine. 
Moreover, he says, this is not a new position, but one held "from 
my earliest days as a young man."
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's new-found libertarianism does have one 
advantage. He has committed himself to a philosophical standard 
by which he can be judged. Do his policies measure up? 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The White House wants to outlaw work that pays under $5 an 
hour. But what if a person can't find a job that pays that much? 
If he works for less, he and his employer violate federal law. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's a clear case of public authority trampling on the 
liberties of individual citizens. If a person works for two bucks 
an hour, and the deal is by mutual agreement, there's no harm 
done. But when the government steps in to prevent the 
transaction, it robs both parties of the liberty to contract. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Similar examples can be found on every page of the U.S. 
Code. Why should the government drive a wedge between consumers 
who want to buy cigarettes and companies that want to sell them? 
Why should the government force employers to hire people who 
aren't right for the job?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why should the government stop importers from selling Iraqi 
oil? Why should the government prevent property owners from 
draining their swamps and developing their land? Why should the 
government tax away up to 40 percent of people's incomes, and 
declare some to be "unearned"? All these actions trample on 
liberty. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Is it unfair to discuss economic policies when Mr. Clinton 
was talking about the "civil liberty" not to be spied on by 
federal police agents without cause? No, although left-liberals 
have long tried to have it both ways, dreaming of socialist 
economics and strict enforcement of the Bill of Rights. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the ACLU, it's impossible to separate the different 
aspects of liberty. A government that forbids and controls 
economic exchange will think nothing of invading what are 
designated as "civil liberties." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There might have been a time when left-liberals believed in 
free association and other civil liberties. They are still fuming 
because Senator Joseph McCarthy thought it mattered when a public 
figure in Hollywood or the State Department was a member of the 
Communist Party. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But those days are long gone. Today, the left is far more 
hysterical about private militias than Mr. McCarthy ever was 
about communists. Freedom of association? Any gun owner who gets 
together with a few friends to fret about the feds is to be spied 
on and treated as a potential bomb builder or church burner. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Liberals are still shrieking about J. Edgar Hoover's 
investigations of the civil rights movement. But today, left-wing 
nonprofit groups spy on people's political affiliations and share 
their files with happy federal bureaucrats. No anti-communist 
group of the 1950s painted with the broad brush of the 
"anti-hate" blocs of the 1990s, which link the desire for tax 
cuts or less recycling with every manner of terrorist activity. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The left loved the Bill of Rights when it was used by the 
federal government against the states. With the independence of 
the states demolished, the left thinks nothing of openly 
attacking the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 9th, and 10th amendments. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Bill Clinton's devotion to libertarian doctrine is 
laughable, so is the left's claim to defend individuals against 
the government. These are the people who have created the 
Orwellian state they warned us against, and--among a host of 
other depredations--turned private comments into punishable 
speech crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton's libertarian sentiments were provoked by the 
accusations that he used FBI files for political purpose. We'll 
know he's serious when he proposes to burn--not the files on 
political appointees--but the millions of dossiers on law-abiding 
private citizens. Until that great day, the big government whose 
era he claims has ended, will still be lording it over us.

<h2>
The Politics of Church Fires
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The 1988 Willie Horton ads were considered awful because 
they played on fears of race and crime for base (that is, 
Republican) motives. Fast forward eight years, and consider the 
uses to which the Democrats are putting the church burnings in 
the South.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These fires are invariably described as part of a "wave" or 
"rash" of attacks against blacks not seen since Jim Crow. Even 
though almost all are unsolved, the Clinton Justice Department 
assures us that whites are the perpetrators and racial hatred the 
cause. Therefore, these are not mere arsons, but big-league 
political crimes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, more than 200 federal agents are crawling around 
the rural South, usurping local and state fire investigators, and 
the South-bashing New York Times has had a field day, running 
treatises on why this is exactly what one would expect from a 
racist region. We should all look to New York City, locus of 
peace, harmony, and intergroup love. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A gaggle of left-wing organizations, led by specialists in 
racial agitation, has declared the burnings to be part of a 
conspiracy tacitly encouraged by the Republican Congress and the 
Supreme Court's rulings against racially drawn voting districts.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Jesse Jackson takes it a step further. The burnings are part 
of a new "anti-black mania," he says, a "white riot" spread by 
"lawmakers." People in white sheets burn churches, but so do 
Congressmen "in blue suits, who use thinly coated, veiled race 
signals when they say welfare and crime and three strikes and end 
affirmative action." Mr. Jackson urges people to register and 
vote for you-know-what party.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As for the victimized pastors themselves, they went on 
television to complain that they and their parishioners had been 
questioned, even though it's standard procedure to look to owners 
first when a building is torched. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All this is but a side show to the central message as stated 
by Bill Clinton. Standing outside a black church in South 
Carolina, he denounced burnings, poverty, and discrimination, and 
proclaimed the glories of civil rights. "We are not going back," 
he said. "We are not slipping back to those dark days." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In case you missed it, there's a political agenda here: any 
attempt to repeal quotas or welfare is, like torching a church, 
motivated by hatred. This is how liberal politicians play on 
racial fears and crime for their political purposes. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton has already been caught in one fib. He said he 
had "vivid and painful memories of black churches being burned in 
my own state when I was a child." It turns out that there is no 
record of such burnings. His remarks had to be corrected by a 
spokesman. They weren't churches, but "community buildings." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Joyce Price and Warren Strobel of the Washington Times
talked to NAACP officials, black pastors, and historians in 
Arkansas. But only one expert could remember a suspicious fire in 
the 1950s that involved a racial element. Curtis Sykes, chairman 
of Arkansas's Black History Advisory Committee, said the fire was 
set by a black man, who was convicted of several insurance-fraud 
arsons. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Frank Wolfe of the Arkansas-Democrat Gazette said that Mr. 
Clinton might be remembering the bombings in Little Rock on Labor 
Day 1959, resulting from resentments over forced school 
integration. Trouble is: all the targets were white, including 
public officials, lawyers, and firemen who had turned their hoses
on protesting white parents. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fibs aside, the campaign marches on. Always anxious to find 
evil in Alabama, the media have focussed on our four fires since 
December. But Alvin Benn of the Montgomery Advertiser raises 
serious questions. Since 1990, thirty-eight houses of worship 
have burned in Alabama. Twenty were black; eighteen were white, 
although there has been no publicity about them. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And none of the fires apparently involved "hate," says the 
State Fire Marshal. For example, some burglars set fire to 
churches after robbing them. Other cases involved internal church 
disputes, drunks who decided to burn a building, insurance fraud, 
electrical fires, and lightning. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More interesting data: thirty church burnings in the South 
over eighteen months may sound like a lot, and it is obviously 
thirty too many, but it represents 0.03 percent of the arsons 
recorded. In just 1994, Chicago had more than 1,000; Los Angeles 
more than 3,000; and New York City more than 5,000. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The church fires may "harken back to a dark era," as Mr. 
Clinton claims. But his efforts certainly harken back to other 
fear-based campaigns to get out the vote, while chilling anyone 
who would question statist federal policies and the racial 
orthodoxies used to justify them.

<title>Rockwell:  The Terror Threat? -- 6/5/96</title>

<h2>
The Terror Threat?
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Whip yourself into a frenzy. Dig a shelter out back. Fly 
into a panic and be extremely scared. It's time for special 
alarms, drills, and teach-ins. Most of all, pay your taxes with 
diligence and joy so the government can protect you.
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The big news? The feds say terrorists are loose on the land. 
And you could be their next victim. The only way to safety is to 
surrender your money, your freedom, and your guns to the 
bureaucrats, and quake with fear unless the FBI is near. At least 
that's what we'd do if we believed everything we're being told. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ever since the Oklahoma bombing, we've heard that the threat 
of domestic terrorism means the government needs vast new power 
and money. Every chance they get, officials from virtually every 
federal police agency--the FBI, FEMA, Justice, the CIA--tell the 
press that a bomb could blow up your neighborhood any minute. 
Look out! 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And that's only the beginning. Why, do you realize that 
someone could use chemical weapons against your hometown? Even 
more frightening is the supposed prospect of biological warfare. 
If something isn't done right away, we'll be infected with a 
deadly disease or writhe on the floor, dying from asphyxiation. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The likelihood that state or nonstate actors," says head 
spook John M. Deutch in his best bureaucratise, "will attempt to 
use weapons of mass destruction against U.S. interests is 
growing." But, never fear, the feds are here to protect you, 
just as they protected so many in the past. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last November, for example, FEMA hosted a creepy gathering 
in Mount Weather, Virginia, attended by the CIA, the FBI, and 
various other spies and paranoids prominent in the D.C. political 
racket. They met in a huge bomb shelter built at the height of 
the Cold War to maintain life and luxury for government officials 
as the civilian population suffered nuclear annihilation.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At this meeting, according to the Wall Street Journal, the 
geniuses in government met to fret about how little money is 
being spent to prepare for terrorist attacks. But "some serious 
planning has begun," says the Journal. Oh to be a fly on that 
wall. Who can doubt that these people salivate over the prospect 
of martial law, suspending the Constitution, and shoving the 
population around like cattle?  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What will the ruling regime do to maintain its power in the 
post-Cold War environment? Well, there is the terrorism bill 
passed by Congress and signed by the president. It bolstered 
federal police power with new funds and responsibilities, and 
restricted the rights of American citizens. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Funny that the framers of the Constitution never anticipated 
the need for an internal police force to keep the people in check 
and protected. If they had, they might have given up those silly ideas 
about liberty and self government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Going on seven years now, the ruling elites have confronted 
a serious problem. With no credible foreign threat on the 
horizon, the central state seems to have lost its primary reason 
for existence. The average fellow can't understand what the 
apparatus in Washington does with 1.7 trillion bucks every year. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A government this big does its best to avoid peace at home 
and abroad. As it knows from experience, these are the times that 
try men's pocketbooks. People demand lower taxes, shrinking 
government power, and less government arrogance. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For instance: during the first World War, the government 
practically established martial law at home, planned most 
industrial and agricultural production, revved up the military 
machine to full capacity, and squelched free speech and a free 
press. It was a sad chapter, but one that came to a quick close 
when the war was over. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For the American people demanded an immediate end to the 
violation of their rights and the high taxation of their 
property. The military shrunk in size, and the war planning 
boards were shut down, not to be reopened until the New Deal 
(under the auspices of curing an economic crisis, itself brought 
on by the Federal Reserve). 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same thing might have happened after the Second World 
War, which also saw an explosion in government power over the 
economy. But just as people were demanding a return to normalcy, 
the Cold War intervened, and thankfully so for folks in 
Washington. The communists were coming, and taxpayers could be 
relied up on to stay frightened and relatively docile for another 
forty years. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Fast forward to 1989, and the end of the ramshackle Soviet 
empire. With no substantial foreign policy threats on the 
horizon, peace and freedom threatened to break out yet again. A 
series of botched military exercises overseas has made the public 
ever more skeptical of the ruling regime. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Terrorism is as good an excuse as any for keeping people 
alarmed about some enemy, and to deflect attention away from the 
real threat to their liberties, which is the government itself. 
Indeed, for several years, polls have recorded record-level 
dissatisfaction with government. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Washington is none too happy that nobody seems to care about 
the supposed terrorist threat. Complains Senator Dick Lugar, 
"there is almost a sense of denial out there in the public." 
Indeed a recent poll--which underscores that the public is 
keeping its wits--reveals that only a few Americans are 
"seriously worried" about terrorism. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The government is trying to fix that. Some militia guys were 
recently arrested in Georgia, and the anonymous federal informant 
who had undoubtedly egged them on told the press they planning to bomb 
the Olympics. Not true, said the on-the-record briefing that followed, 
but the essential message had already been planted in the minds of 
many.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And last year, the feds called the Anaheim, California, fire 
department to say that Disneyland would be sprayed with poison 
gas in three hours. Whoops, they said later, it's not true. But 
again, the essential message had been planted. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From the beginning of time, governments have used the 
prospect of attack, real and phony baloney, to inspire citizen 
compliance. Will it work this time?
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I have my doubts. A government that can't deliver the mail
surely can't stop poison gas attacks. And the American people 
have become stingy with their rights and liberties, as they 
should be and will ever be, now that government has become the 
"fearful master" George Washington warned us against.

<title>Rockwell:  Revenue Neutrality   -- 5/9/96</title>

<h2>
Revenue Neutrality  
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>

  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republicans might as well pack their bags, admit defeat,  
and head home. Their entire program has been doomed by the  
doctrine of "revenue neutrality." In practice, it means that the  
government's income can never fall. This has turned fiscal policy  
into, at best, a pointless exercise; at worst, a deeply dishonest  
shell game.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Look at recent Republican maneuvers. Every proposed lower  
tax is matched by some increase. Give a tax credit for adoption,  
and raise taxes on business. Cut gas taxes, and increase other  
excise taxes. What's next? Cuts in the inheritance tax, "paid  
for" by an increase in the gas tax? Maybe the per child tax  
credit can be "paid for" by repealing the adoption tax credit.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The total burden of taxes remains the same no matter what  
these guys do. So what is supposed to be the purpose of this  
nonsense? If it is too much to ask that the federal government  
take less from the private sector, Republican slogans about  
cutting the size of government are empty. There's no point to  
elections, platforms, or debates, because you can't cut  
government without cutting its income.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The doctrine of "revenue neutrality" is a leftover from  
George Bush's 1990 budget agreement, which raised taxes and  
arguably lost him the election. Part of the deal was that any  
increase in spending must be accompanied by an increase in taxes;  
likewise, any decrease in taxes must be matched by an equal  
decrease in spending.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At first, it sounds reasonable to treat the federal budget  
as if it were a household's. But it's not, because it doesn't  
consist of owned property. It is a vast redistribution scheme  
whereby property is pilfered from some and doled out to others;  
either or both practices should be curbed wherever possible.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Before the 1990 budget deal, no one said that all tax cuts  
had to be "paid for" in other ways. That language makes it seem  
deeply expensive to cut revenue, and thus fiscally irresponsible.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For taxpayers, however, a tax cut is not an expense, but a  
boon. It allows them to keep more of what is rightfully theirs in  
the first place. What's expensive is keeping taxpayers on the  
hook for the same percentage of the national income, year after  
year, and never allowing it to fall.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One fallacious assumption behind the doctrine of revenue  
neutrality is that Congress can know exactly what people will do  
before and after tax changes. Consider the gas tax. It's possible  
that deep cuts in the gas tax would cause the price to fall and  
the demand to rise, thus increasing overall revenue. But Congress  
doesn't even consider the prospect. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This is true for many taxes. If the inheritance tax were cut  
dramatically, people's incentive to accumulate property would  
increase dramatically. It's even possible that the resulting  
economic activity would offset the revenue losses of the tax cut.  
So it goes for the income tax and every other excise tax.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But let's say the so-called Laffer Effect didn't kick in,  
and total revenue actually went down. A loss to government is a  
gain for everyone else. Lower revenue means government is less of  
a burden on the American people, and that the economy is that  
much freer. That's why we should be as thrilled to see a falling  
tax take as a falling crime rate. Each makes people that much  
more secure in their person and property.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What about the deficit? It's true that deficits crowd out  
private investment, tempt the Treasury into monetizing debt, and  
drive up interest rates. A balanced budget, with both spending  
and taxes low, is a joy to behold.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But we live in the age of deficits not because taxes are too  
low, but because government has been freed from the obligation to  
back the currency with gold. It's no coincidence that the budget  
was last balanced in 1969, when gold restricted the Treasury's  
ability to pile up debt.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Why do increases and decreases in the deficit always seem to  
surprise the political class? Because its size is influenced by  
factors over which they have little control, like economic  
growth, the business cycle, the size of the underground economy,  
and the numbers of people receiving wages and salaries. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One thing politicians can control is how much government 
steals from our paychecks every year. But to fix that, we must  
first trash the 1990 budget deal. Concocted by an evil genius,  
it's the only budget agreement in the last two decades that  
anyone bothers to obey. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
So long as "revenue neutrality" is the rule, leviathan will  
grow and grow, and the Republican promise to reduce the size of  
government will continue to be a rhetorical cover for the same  
old political racket.

<title>Rockwell: "Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry -- 5/08/96</title>

<h2>
"Civil Rights" Hits the Adoption Industry
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>

<P>
  
Federal offices aren't often surrounded by protesters. But   
egregious civil-rights decisions against Mitsubishi and Hooters   
inspired their workers to take to the streets. Meanwhile, lesser   
victims of the civil-rights police are forced to suffer in   
silence as legal defense bills threaten bankruptcy.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The Justice Department and the EEOC decide what constitutes   
"discrimination" on grounds of race, religion, age, disability,   
and sex, the most sensitive areas of our national life. Since any   
action can be construed as somehow influenced by them, the   
government can exercise ferocious power over a vast range of   
economic decisions.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


When a business is involved, bureaucrats act as the   
sure-to-win plaintiff's lawyers capable of imposing de facto  
quotas in any business or industry. It has the power to brand   
companies with labels like "racist" and "sexist," and drive them   
to ruin. It is a main reason why race relations are so rotten   
today, and why, more than three decades after the Civil Rights   
Act, everyone feels more victimized than ever.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Not only has the Congress done nothing to curb this, it is   
preparing to expand government power into the makeup of our   
families. The pretext is a bill making it easier to adopt   
children. There is a $5,000 tax credit, "paid for" by higher   
taxes on business. But the heart of the bill is a provision   
putting the federal government in charge of adoption and   
foster-child services, imposing huge new costs, and robbing   
prospective parents of the freedom to choose.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the adoption process, adoptive parents, biological   
parents, and children work directly with public and private   
adoption agencies. After years of experience, agencies have   
learned which matches are likely to succeed, and which are not.   
The criteria are often unquantifiable, but can include such   
factors as race and ethnicity.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


For example, a Vietnamese family may know of some Vietnamese   
orphans in need of permanent loving homes. So long as the match   
is otherwise suitable, the agency will work with the parents to   
accommodate their request. Children are then brought together   
with adoptive parents who will love them and care for them.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


But Washington planners find this intolerable, and so are   
scheming to abolish it. They don't want people to be able to   
specify the race of the children they want to adopt; nor do they   
want an agency to be able to draw on its experience in working   
with parents insofar as race is involved. The planners would   
replace the right of contract with bureaucratic edict.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


In the Washington tradition of antonymous titles, the bill   
is called the "Adoption Promotion and Stability Act." It mandates   
that adoption providers can no longer "discriminate in making a   
placement decision" on the basis of national origin, race, and color.  
The original bill was so draconian it had to be amended to   
say race can be one factor if more than one "qualified" family   
want the child. In fact, the amendment counts for nothing.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Let's say a young mother considers giving up her child for   
adoption. Today, she is allowed, within reason, to specify what   
kind of family she would like her child to be brought up in,   
including the racial makeup of that family. If this bill passes,   
the agency will not be allowed to take her wishes into account.   
Faced with less certainty about her child's future, she will be   
more likely to choose abortion.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The same goes for adoptive and foster parents. If the bill   
passes, they will still be able, for now, to request the sex and   
religion of the child they would like to care for. But any   
request regarding race or national origin will not be considered   
under most conditions. Will the Vietnamese couple be just as   
interested in adopting a white or black child? Of course not, and   
they might just drop out of the process.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


How will the government know whether discrimination takes   
place? In its usual ham-fisted fashion, it will count the   
numbers, establish quotas, and override people's preferences. It   
will substitute private judgment with rule by bureaucrats and   
lawyers, and give the Justice Department veto power over all   
private decisions that affect adoption and foster care.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


This law will also be subject to category creep like other   
civil-rights bills. It's only a matter of time before religion,   
sex, and disability are added to the list. In time, Washington   
will be running the private and state-level child placement   
industry the way it runs its own welfare bureaucracies.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The proponents of the bill make the wildly unproven claim   
that all delays in foster and adoptive placements are due to   
discrimination against minorities. They have demonized the   
National Association of Black Social Workers for seeking black   
homes for black children. Like all liberals bent on social   
engineering, they pursue their plans with a John Brown-like fury   
and blindness to the other side.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


What, then, is the real cause of sluggishness and   
disequilibrium in the system? Federal laws that overregulate the   
industry and prevent a well-functioning market for parental   
rights from emerging. So these revolutionary Republicans, instead  
of repealing the existing government interventions, impose more.  
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

 
The result will be to make adoptive agencies and social   
service providers vulnerable to killer lawsuits from parents who   
experience any delay. "Public-interest" lawyers will also file   
civil suits by the thousands, and tie the placement process in   
knots. In a system already replete with broken hearts, this will   
impose limits on the numbers of organizations willing to be   
involved in the first place.  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The bill will not end up "promoting the adoption of minority   
children," as supporters claim, because Washington can't people from  
deciding not to be adoptive or foster parents, or from choosing  
abortion over childbearing. The more freedom of choice the government  
takes away, the less anyone will want to bear the burden in the first  
place.   
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


There's a moral principle involved here too. The federal   
government has long managed our associations with regard to race   
at ever more intimate levels, and the results have been awful.  
Now it wants to make the same divisive intervention into the   
makeup of families. What's next? Non-discrimination laws for   
marriage?  
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


It's time we begin to trust the judgment of the private   
sector, and local levels of government over federal, and stop   
transferring power to Washington. Unlike Mitsubishi and Hooters,   
the children and parents victimized by civil rights enforcement   
aren't in a position to stage public protests.

<h4>THOMAS A. SCHATZ</h4> 
President<br> 
Citizens Against Government Waste and<br> 
Council for Citizens Against Government Waste<br> 
</center> 
<p> 
Thomas A. Schatz is President of Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) and the Council for 
Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW). 
<p> 
CAGW was founded by J. Peter Grace and Jack Anderson in 1984 following the release of the Grace 
Commission report. It is a 501(c) (3) nonprofit, educational organization with more than 600,000 
members nationwide. Mr. Schatz is a nationally recognized spokesperson on government waste and has 
appeared on hundreds of radio talk shows from coast to coast, including WBZ in Boston, WGN in 
Chicago, KABC in Los Angeles, WCBS in New York, and WOAI in San Antonio. His national television 
appearances include: "ABC News with Peter Jennings," "CBS News with Dan Rather," "NBC News with 
Tom Brokaw," CNN, CNBC, "Larry King Live," "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour," and numerous local 
network affiliates. 
<p> 
According to official Office of Management and Budget figures, implementation of Grace Commission 
recommendations saved taxpayers $152.4 billion through 1990, and CAGW estimates another $ 100 
billion have been saved since then. An additional $78 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1993 and $54 billion will be saved over the next five years from 
recommendations proposed by CAGW in 1994. 
<p> 
As President of CCAGW, the 501(c) (4) nonprofit lobbying organization, Mr. Schatz spearheaded the 
expansion of the grassroots Taxpayers Action Network to more than 400 chapters nationwide. Mr. Schatz 
has also testified on government waste issues before committees of the United States Senate and House of 
Representatives. 
<p> 
During his nine years with CAGW, Mr. Schatz has been instrumental in a development program that 
increased membership from 5,000 to more than 600,000. 
<p> 
Prior to joining CAGW in 1986, Mr. Schatz spent six years as legislative director for Congressman 
Hamilton Fish and two years practicing law and lobbying. 
<p> 
Mr. Schatz holds a law degree from George Washington University and was graduated from the State 
University of New York at Binghamton with a BA degree, With Honors, in Political Science. He is 
married to Leslee Behar and has two daughters, Samantha and Alexandra.

<title>Schatz: Radioactive Tax Boondoggle  -- 08/01/96</title>

<h2>Radioactive Tax Boondoggle</h2>

By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 

It's hard to imagine the government waste watchdog group Citizens Against
Government waste (CAGW), the conservative Heritage Foundation, the
Libertarian Cato Institute, and Taxpayers for Common Cents agreeing on a
policy issue with The Safe Energy Communication Council, Friends of the
Earth, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. And yet it's true.
These and other philosophically divergent organizations are united in their
opposition to more taxpayer funding for one of the most egregious symbols
of pork-barrel spending: the so-called Advanced Light Water Reactor (ALWR).
<P>
Bringing the budget ax down on the Department of Energy's ALWR program
should be a no-brainer for Congress. The drive to revive nuclear power with
taxpayer subsidies has failed on Main Street, Wall Street, and in the
utilities' executive suites.
<P>
Today, there's simply no domestic market for these reactors, and the
international opportunities are drying up as more governments turn their
backs on this economically-challenged energy source. Every U.S. reactor
ordered in the past 23 years has been subsequently canceled.
<P>
Two independent surveys released earlier in 1996 show that seven out of ten
American voters and nine out of ten utility CEOs don't want new nuclear
plants tax-funded or built, respectively. Most, if not all, forecasting
reports from Wall Street brokerage and investment firms wouldn't argue with
Bear Stearns analyst Daniel Scotto who quipped that the next nuclear
reactor would be built "when Jimmy Hoffa was found alive and well."
<P>
Yet, after spending 60 percent of all U.S. energy research and development
money on nuclear power between 1948 and 1996 (despite the fact that it now
only provides 8 percent of our overall energy needs), Congress is debating
whether to pump more of our tax dollars into the ALWR program.
<P>
Authorized by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), the ALWR was
originally intended as a five-year program to develop advanced commercial
nuclear reactors for the domestic market. But the program has become a
corporate welfare poster child, financially benefiting major firms such as
General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, and Asea Brown Boveri/Combustion
Engineering. In 1994, these three companies alone had combined revenues of
$73 billion.
<P>
U.S. taxpayers have provided more than $275 million for this program
between fiscal years (FY) 1992-1996. The fifth and final year of funding
ends in September, but the Energy Department has requested an additional
$40 million for FY 1997, and Westinghouse envisions itself on the receiving
end of funding through FY 1999.
<P>
Now, however, even the monolithic nuclear industry is wavering on the
ALWR's worth. In February, GE, one of the primary recipients of tax funds
for the ALWR program, announced that it was abandoning its Simplified
Boiling Water Reactor program (one of the reactor programs within the ALWR
program), which has received more than $50 million in taxpayer subsidies.
GE defended its withdrawal, stating that "extensive evaluations -- have not
established the commercial viability of these designs," a clear-cut
repudiation of the program's original rationale if there ever was one.
Taxpayers will most likely never recover this investment.
<P>
But there's more. Besides lining corporate pockets for dead-end research,
taxpayer funds have also been used to reimburse the above-named companies
for a portion of the fees charged by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
(NRC) for its costs to license and certify reactor designs. In other words,
taxpayers are covering the fees which were imposed in order to help offset
the costs of the NRC's services.
<P>
The ALWR program was intended to assist in the design of reactors to be
built in the United States. But since there is no domestic market, U.S.
taxpayer-supported reactor designs -- whose certification by the NRC has been
partially subsidized by the taxpayer under this program -- are being marketed
and sold in Japan, South Korea and other countries. This is a violation of
the intent of EPACT, which stipulates that recipients of any ALWR funds
must promise to construct and operate the reactor in the United States.
<P>
Fortunately, a bipartisan coalition in Congress, spearheaded by Reps. Mark
Foley (R-FL) and David Obey (D-WI) has formed to block any proposals for
continued funding the ALWR. Whether these federal purse-watchers will
succeed depends on citizens raising their voices loudly enough for Congress
to get the message.
<P>
Cutting this tax-vacuum would be an unequivocal statement that Members of
Congress are committed to cutting waste and redirecting budget priorities
to the nation's economic good. It's time to get this tax hog out of the
federal trough.

<title>Schatz:  Finders Keepers -- 12/21/95</title>

<h2>Finders Keepers</h2>



By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 

  
  
Picture this: You've been living beyond your means and have had to 
borrow a great deal of money over the years just to keep your bills 
paid and family fed.  Finally, after much procrastination and a few 
sleepless nights, you put yourself and family on a regimen, aiming to 
balance your books over the next seven years while still meeting your 
basic needs.  Tackling  the accumulated debt and interest comes next.  
Then one day, a psychic from the CIA tells you that there's a good 
chance -- but not a guarantee -- that you'll come into some money 
during that seven-year period. 
<P>
What do you do?  Do you spend that hypothetical money, reverting to 
the bad habits that put you in this fix to begin with, or resolve to 
stick to your seven-year plan, recognizing the slim margin of error in 
your calculations and questionable reliability of CIA psychics?   And 
if that psychic turns out to be correct, do you balance your budget 
faster, let's say in five years, and begin to reduce your massive 
debt?  Or do you blow the windfall as usual, costing you more money in 
the long run and imperiling the financial security of your family?  
The logical, responsible answer is to do everything in your power to 
balance your budget faster, start paying off your debt, and break 
free. 
<P>
That's what a reasonable person would do, particularly someone who is 
trying to overcome a lifetime of profligacy.  But in the logic-free 
zone of our nation's capitol, the moral of this parable doesn't 
necessarily track.    
<P>
As Congress and President Clinton continue their dance around the 
budget solution, there's talk of "finding" more money, either through 
revamped economic assumptions or a change in the calculation of the 
consumer price index.  And naturally, being a city of addicts, there's 
already talk in some quarters of spending what has yet to be "found," 
despite the fact that the two sides' budget plans are still hundreds 
of billions of dollars apart.  So while economic assumptions are 
always debatable, and the consumer price index is undoubtedly 
inflated, the idea that we can make things right just by juggling the 
numbers sends the message loud and clear that politics as usual 
continues to rule the roost.  For politicians searching for an easy 
way out, and an escape valve for mounting pressures, it is a nearly 
irresistible solution.          
<P>
So steeped is this city in the compulsion to spend, and so blurred can 
rhetoric and reality become, that it's always worthwhile reviewing the 
facts.    
<P>
Doomsayers have led those unfamiliar with Washington lexicon into  
believing that one, the Republican plan cuts spending, and two, does 
so in a way that will adversely affect the country.  Baloney all 
around.  First, spending will increase in each of the seven years even 
under the "radical" Republican plan. And second, the long-term 
economic benefits of getting the nation's fiscal house in order will 
be worth it.    
<P>
If the Republican plan is adopted, the federal government will spend 
$12 trillion over the next seven years -- an average of $1.7 trillion 
annually.  Medicare will increase 6.4 percent annually -- the most of 
any federal program -- and the per-beneficiary increase will be 47 
percent.  The earned income tax credit, which the president says is 
destroyed by the Republican budget, will increase by 150 percent.  
Student loan volume will increase by 50 percent.  Medicaid goes up by 
30 percent.   
<P>
Give, these projections, the real question is:  How much more do we 
really need to spend?  And what can we afford if, like the person in 
our parable, we're carrying around a $5 trillion debt? 
<P>
Already, interest rates have dropped in anticipation of a balanced 
budget agreement.  The effect on families for housing, car payments, 
education, and other expenses is enormous.  A two percent drop in 
rates can mean thousands less each year in such payments. 
<P>
If there isn't a deal, we will be violating one of Thomas Jefferson's 
moral precepts:  "We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle 
posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves."  
Nobel Laureate James Buchanan recently noted that up until the past 
several decades, balancing the budget was part of our "effective 
constitution," but that "we have lost the moral sense of fiscal 
responsibility to make formal constraints unnecessary." 
<P>
There's a great national debate over "family values."  What kind of 
standards are we setting for future generations?  Without a balanced 
budget, we will pass on a tax rate of 84 percent to our children and 
grandchildren just to pay our bills.  A child born today will pay 
$187,000 in taxes over a lifetime just to pay his or her share of the 
interest on the national debt.  Is that a legacy we can live with?   
<P>
<P>
We can avoid such a fate simply by living within the parameters of the 
Republican plan.   While priorities can always be negotiated, and 
should be negociated, $12 trillion is more than enough money to meet 
the nation's true needs over the next seven years.  And if additional 
funds surface in re-estimates of economic assumptions, let's make the 
moral and just decision to balance the budget faster, start paying off 
the debt, and save the future for our children and grandchildren.

<title>Schatz:  No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</title>

<h2>No Virginia, There is no Budget in Washington</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
<br> 
 
There is no such thing as a "budget process" for the federal 
government.  
<p>
Any junior executive will tell you that a real budget is a financial 
plan; it controls how much money may be spent, both overall and for 
each spending category, before any checks are actually cut.  The Grace 
Commission called the federal budget "a political document, ... of 
limited usefulness as a vehicle for planning, control or evaluation."  
Here we are 12 years later and, as Yogi Bera said, "it's deja vu all 
over again." 
<p>
Money is often appropriated without regard to revenue, a practice 
which has been taken for granted for years, but which has lead to a 
federal debt of more than $4.9 trillion.  Even with better than 
average odds that Congress will reach a balanced budget by the year 
2002, the debt is still expected to top out at nearly $6 trillion.   
<p>
The government's fanciful accounting practices invite waste, lack of 
accountability, and gross mismanagement.  But the long-term danger is 
that these distorted budget practices seriously imperil all the hard 
work and political courage being demonstrated on Capitol Hill to bring 
the federal spending juggernaut under control.  
<p>
The annual budget battle over appropriations has become an 
exasperating exercise in futility.  This year, thanks to the tenacity 
of House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (D-La.), and 
many like-minded members of Congress, a significant number of wasteful 
government programs and pork-barrel projects will be purged from the 
13 appropriation bills.  But members who scour the bills looking for 
juicy bits of bacon complain, correctly, that it is the budget system 
itself that allows unwanted pork projects to filter through.   
<p>
In the next phase in the fight for sound government, fiscally 
responsible members of Congress from both sides of the aisle have 
offered budget reform bills to bring federal budget policies in line 
with reality and with private sector practices.  
<p>
A budget reform bill offered by Reps. Christopher Cox (R-Calif.) and 
Steve Largent (R-Okla.) would reconfigure the process from the ground 
up, seeking an end to that mindless annual scramble for scarce federal 
dollars which passes for the appropriations process.  The bill's 
philosophy was summed up when Rep. Cox wrote recently:  "A budget, 
properly used, should provide a framework for the individual spending 
decisions that follow.  The adoption of a budget, therefore, is not 
the proper time to debate those individual decisions."  The 
Cox/Largent legislation would enact a "budget first, spend second" 
provision, reduce the federal budget to a one-page, 19-function 
resolution, and toughen the president's enhanced rescission powers. 
<p>
The spirit of the Cox bill is mirrored in a "truth in budgeting" act 
Rep. Joe Barton (R-Tex.) will introduce on November 8.  His bill would 
create a more workable and understandable budget process by 
introducing biennial budgeting, creating a reserve (rainy day) fund 
for fiscal emergencies, putting an end to the fanciful concept of 
baseline budgeting, and enforcing sequestration if spending goes over 
enacted budget and entitlement caps. 
<p>
Sen. Connie Mack (R-Fla.) is proposing budget reform as well, 
including a Spending Reduction Commission. 
<p>
All of these efforts finally begin to liberate the federal government 
from baseline budgeting, the foundation of Washington's "weird 
science."  Baseline budgeting is an entrenched accounting gimmick 
which allows Congress and the President to say with a straight face 
that a reduction in the increase of an agency's budget is actually a 
"cut."   
<p>
The proposed changes may seem common sensical, but they represent 
dramatic change to the Kafkaesque world of federal spending.  Congress 
has been loath to make these "easy" choices in the past, even with 
solid bi-partisan support.  It is so much easier to crow about hard-
fought budget savings from program terminations, while still being 
able to take credit for redirecting the money into other programs and 
trust fund accounts.  This "carve and spend" will continue to 
frustrate real efforts to reduce spending unless Congress moves 
forcefully to overhaul the budget process itself.  The lock-box bill 
approved by the House earlier this year, which will permit saved funds 
to go toward deficit reduction, is a big first step.  But a major 
overhaul must follow, and soon. 
<p>
Reform-minded members like Reps. Cox, Largent, and Barton represent 
the next wave in the revolution that began last November.  Budget 
reform must be at the top of Congress' "to do" list for the next 
session.  Anything less than a full frontal assault on congenital 
budget gimmickry and accounting trickery will make a mockery of all 
the hard-fought gains achieved this session and guarantee that we will 
never get spending under control.

<h2>            
Senate Should Reject the Chemical Weapons Convention
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


      The U.S. Senate should reject ratification of the Chemical
     Weapons Convention (CWC), a treaty that purports to ban chemical
     weapons and forbid their production, stockpiling, and use.
     Contrary to its announced purpose, this foolish treaty would
     increase, not eliminate, the risk of chemical weapons use, and
     would seriously damage U.S. national security interests.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bad guys are deterred by force, the threat of force, or by their
     cold calculation that the costs of evil behavior are not worth
     the risk. Many dangerous countries, such as Libya, Syria, Iraq
     and North Korea, have not signed the CWC and would not be
     deterred by pieces of paper.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China and Iran, which have significant chemical weapons programs,
     are unlikely to comply. Of particular concern is Russia, which
     has the largest arsenal of chemical weapons; the actions and
     statements of its military leaders confirm that Russia would not
     comply at all.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Even though the CWC would not rid the world of chemical weapons,
     it would impose a terrible regulatory and reporting burden on
     every U.S. company that produces, processes, or consumes a
     scheduled chemical. The CWC would affect U.S. firms that make
     dyes and pigments, insecticides, pharmaceuticals, ceramics,
     nylon, paint and varnish, electronics, textiles, and soap and
     detergent.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Arms Control and Disarmament Agency estimates that 2,175 U.S.
     companies would be saddled with reporting requirements and data
     declarations; others estimate that the burden will fall on 10,000
     U.S. production facilities. This time-consuming reporting could,
     in turn, produce additional government oversight and regulation
     by agencies such as OSHA, EPA, and IRS.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     No previous treaty has ever subjected U.S. private industry to
     international inspection. CWC is the New World Order closing in
     on American business.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The process of allowing teams of foreigners to investigate,
     inspect and challenge all facets of private U.S. businesses could
     open them up to industrial espionage and the theft of their
     proprietary information. Forcing them to spend unnecessary funds
     to hire more people to fill out more government forms, and submit
     to routine inspections, would reduce their ability to compete in
     world markets.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In addition to the costs to be borne by private industry, the
     treaty would require the United States to pick up the tab for 25
     percent of the costs of implementation and verification at an
     estimated cost of $200 million a year. Other countries would
     probably demand that the United States pay their costs of
     implementation, too.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the CWC would give birth to a new international
     bureaucracy. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical
     Weapons is already headquartered in The Hague with a Conference
     of State Parties, an Executive Council, and a Technical
     Secretariat whose verification responsibilities extend over a
     hundred pages.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Every time we hear trendy slogans such as "global village,"
     "world economy," or "international cooperation," Americans should
     remember that other nations have no familiarity with or
     understanding of our Bill of Rights or our federal structure of
     government with separate state laws. Treaties are customarily
     written as though all power to make and fulfill international
     commitments resides in the head of state who signs the document.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If the CWC goes into effect, what happens to our Fourth Amendment
     rights? The CWC's Technical Secretariat, without a warrant, would
     be empowered to inspect virtually everything within the premises,
     including records, files, papers, processes, controls, structures
     and vehicles, and to interrogate on-site personnel.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Under CWC, what happens to our First Amendment rights? Freedom of
     Information requests will not be permitted under the proposed CWC
     implementing legislation, so Americans would have fewer rights
     under this treaty than if a U.S. agency, such as the FBI,
     investigated them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     As implemented by the Clinton Administration, the CWC would have
     a meddling effect in U.S. affairs. It would forbid U.S.
     commanders to use tear gas and other riot-control substances to
     protect our soldiers and minimize civilian casualties.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The CWC is unverifiable and unenforceable. Former CIA Director
     James Woolsey testified on June 23, 1994 that "the chemical
     weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence perspective,
     that I cannot state that we have high confidence in our ability
     to detect noncompliance, especially on a small scale."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In closed societies, factories making fertilizer,
     pharmaceuticals, or plastics can easily cover up their production
     of chemical weapons. After receiving notification of a challenge,
     a facility has six days to hide the evidence before inspectors
     are admitted.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Small amounts of concealed chemical weapons can be militarily
     very significant. Used against critical military targets,
     chemical weapons can have dramatic consequences.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     To paraphrase a popular bumper strip, when chemical weapons are
     outlawed, only outlaw governments will have chemical weapons. Our
     World War II experience shows that the best way for civilized
     countries to prevent the use of chemical weapons is for the good
     guys to have their own deterrent arsenals of chemical weapons.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In any event, the Senate must not make matters worse by ratifying
     the unenforceable, costly, and probably unconstitutional CWC.

           Self-Appointed Monitors Of Corporate Responsibility
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The CEO of Cypress in Silicon Valley has just issued an
          eloquent put-down of the social-responsibility
          busybodies who are trying to intimidate corporations
          into selecting their boards of directors on the basis
          of racial and gender diversity. T.J. Rodgers wrote a
          letter to the Sisters of St. Francis in Philadelphia
          who had used their ownership of a little Cypress stock
          to engage in leftwing mischief-making.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Far from being put on the defensive by having a convent
          of nuns lecture him on corporate responsibility,
          Rodgers rejected their arguments as "not only unsound,
          but even immoral." He admonished them that Cypress's
          board of directors "is not a ceremonial watchdog, but a
          critical management function."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress's directors need to have experience as a CEO of
          an important technology company and direct expertise in
          the semiconductor business based on education (usually
          with a Master's degree in engineering science) and
          management experience. Contrary to the nuns' argument,
          Rodgers explained that "a woman's view on how to run
          our semiconductor company does not help us, unless that
          woman has an advanced technical degree and experience
          as a CEO."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Sounds like common sense, doesn't it. "I believe," he
          said, "that placing arbitrary racial or gender quotas
          on corporate boards is fundamentally wrong."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The nuns had tried to lay a guilt trip on Cypress by
          suggesting that it lacks corporate "morality" and
          Christianity by failing to appoint a board of directors
          with "equality of sexes, races, and ethnic groups."
          Rodgers didn't hedge in his response. "I am unaware,"
          he said, "of any Christian requirements for corporate
          boards; your views seem more accurately described as
          `politically correct,' than `Christian.' "
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
         Then, Rodgers went on to argue that the nuns'
          presumptuous requirements for corporate boards are
          "immoral," which he defined as "causing harm to
          people." He pointed out how all the retirees whose
          pension funds invest in Cypress would suffer if Cypress
          were run on anything other than a profit-making basis.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          The letter from the nuns was so sanctimonious that it
          did not allow for any possibility that a CEO could be
          moral if he disagreed with their position. I found
          myself cheering when Rodgers told the sisters to "get
          down from your moral high horse."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Cypress employees in San Jose averaged $78,741 in
          salary and benefits in 1995. All are Cypress
          shareholders, have a first-rate health-care plan,
          profit-sharing, and other goodies such as gifts of
          personal computers and employee education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rogers reiterated that "choosing a board of directors
          based on race and gender is a lousy way to run a
          company. We will never be pressured into it. We simply
          cannot allow arbitrary rules to be forced on us by
          organizations that lack business expertise."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers obviously warmed up to the challenge of do-good
          busybodyism. "The political pressure to be what is
          euphemized as a `responsible corporation' today," he
          said, "is so great that it literally threatens the well
          being of every American."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers listed some of the other special-interest
          groups that are harassing corporations about their pet
          issues. These include the complaints that corporations
          are not sufficiently "environmentally conscious," that
          they do business with certain countries, or supply the
          Armed Forces, or pay their CEO too much, or give to
          certain charities.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers cited a Fortune magazine report showing that
          the so-called "ethical mutual funds" that invest
          according to a social-issues agenda, which control $639
          billion in investments, produced an 18.2 percent return
          in the last 12 months, while the S&P 500 returned 27.2
          percent. Thus, the investors in the "ethical funds"
          lost 9 percent of $639 billion, or $57.5 billion in one
          year, because they invested on a social-issues basis!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers lashed out at the current election-year frenzy
          in Washington to institutionalize the so-called
          "corporate responsibility" concepts promoted by Labor
          Secretary Robert Reich and Senators Ted Kennedy, Jeff
          Bingaman and Tom Daschle. Their proposals "provoke fear
          and anger against America's business," and are
          fundamentally wrong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          One Bingaman-Daschle proposal would grant a low federal
          tax rate of 11 percent to "responsible corporations,"
          i.e., companies that limit the pay of their CEO to no
          more than 50 times the company's lowest-paid employee.
          Such a rule would limit the pay of the CEO of the
          world's most important semiconductor company (Intel) to
          less than that of a second-string quarterback in the
          NFL.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Commenting on the double standards of the "leftist, out
          of touch with reality" Senators, Rodgers asked, "How
          long will it be before Senators Kennedy, Bingaman, and
          Daschle hold hearings on the `irresponsible
          corporations' that pay tens of millions of dollars to
          professional athletes? Or are athletes a `protected
          group,' leaving CEOs as their sole target?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
          Rodgers concluded by stating that he stands for
          "personal and economic freedom, for free minds and free
          markets, a position irrevocably in opposition to the
          immoral attempt by coercive utopians to mandate even
          more government control over America's economy." May
          his tribe increase, and may his forthright statement
          embolden other CEOs to speak up, too.

Whatever Happened To Competition in School?
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     When it comes to the Olympic Games, everyone seems to understand
     that competition produces the winners and the record-breakers.
     It's unlikely that the athletes could reach such heights of
     achievement and endurance if they were not competing against
     other athletes who are closely matched in skills and putting
     forth their very best.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some people, however, are at war against the whole concept of
     competition. They think it is undemocratic, unfair, and elitist.
     It's a sign of the times that, in Cecil County, Maryland,
     basketball is now played by some very unusual rules.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     If one basketball team is ten points ahead of the other,
     additional baskets don't count until the underdog team catches
     up. No record is kept of who scores how many baskets, so no
     player can ever be recognized as the star of the team.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     This system should be called Outcome-Based Basketball because
     it's just like the Outcome-Based Education (OBE) that has spread
     through our public schools like a contagious disease. OBE is
     sometimes called Performance-Based Education.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE's advocates mouth the mantra "self-esteem." Since the lack of
     self-esteem is postulated to be the cause of all social ills
     (crime, illegal drugs, teenage pregnancies, AIDS, and low SAT
     scores), OBE's primary goal is to inculcate self-esteem.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     There is no evidence that lack of self-esteem causes those
     problems, nor is there any evidence that having self-esteem
     causes students to score better in academic subjects. At best,
     teaching self-esteem is a waste of precious classroom time and,
     at worst, it's teaching the wrong lesson that it's okay to feel
     good about doing poorly in school.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Self-esteem should be the reward that comes from achievement and
     hard work. It should be earned. But lack of evidence doesn't slow
     down the self-esteem peddlers because this mantra advances their
     goal of eliminating all competition from the school experience.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Outcome-Based Education has been properly labelled a dumbing-down
     of public school education. But it's even worse than reducing the
     amount of knowledge covered and failing to teach essential skills
     such as reading.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    The combination of OBE and self-esteem eliminates competition as
     a learning mechanism. This destroys the students' incentive to be
     the best they can be, and it destroys the school's accountability
     because parents have no way to measure what their children are
     doing.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In an OBE school, the traditional A, B, C, D and F are replaced
     by letters that are meaningless in terms of specific academic
     achievement, such as S for Satisfactory (sometimes it just means
     Sometimes) or G for Growth. William Glasser's 1969 book "Schools
     Without Failure" led the charge against traditional grades.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Glasser also argued that giving homework is unfair and elitist
     because A and B students usually do their homework, whereas poor
     students don't, thus widening the gap between those who succeed
     and those who fail in school. He even opposed objective tests
     because they require students to give correct answers, in
     contrast to tests that ask questions for which there are no right
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The anti-competition movement is galloping across America.
     Schools are getting rid of their honor roll, honors courses,
     class rankings, academic prizes, and even valedictorians.
     Spelling bees are out. If fact, even correct spelling is out;
     it's replaced by inventive spelling (so students can spell words
     any way they want).
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Ability grouping, or tracking, is forbidden as elitist,
     undemocratic, or even racist. Pity the poor teacher who has to
     present a single course of study to eighth graders whose reading
     ability ranges from the second to the twelfth grades. This
     problem is getting worse with the mainstreaming of the learning
     disabled.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     OBE does not allow any student to progress faster or farther than
     the slowest child in the class. This system conceals the fact
     that some children aren't learning much of anything.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     What is the teacher to do with the faster learners after they
     complete the assigned material? They are required to do peer
     tutoring (trying to tutor the slower pupils) or "horizontal
     enrichment." The former is a frustration for all students, and
     the latter is busywork.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Cooperative Learning, in which students receive a group grade, is
     another means of concealing who does the assignment accurately
     and who goofs off. The brighter students soon learn that their
     effort is not rewarded, and the slower students learn that
     there's no reason to try because someone will given them the
     answers.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The testing system has been corrupted. Not only do all students
     score "above average" (a marvel of statistical fakery), but many
     tests are peppered with questions that ask for non-objective
     responses about feelings, attitudes or predictions, or which have
     a built-in bias toward Political Correctness.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The response to the dramatic decline in SAT scores over the last
     two decades has resulted, not in toughening the curriculum, but
     in raising every student's score 100 points, so now students get
     perfect scores even if they have some wrong answers. This is one
     more way of concealing the distinction between average and
     above-average students.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Competition needs to be restored if schools are to prepare
     students for life. Children should learn early that life is
     competition, and the rewards go to those who work hard, persevere
     and achieve.

Phonics Boom
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It's many years overdue, but the scandal of widespread illiteracy
     has finally become a topic of general discussion and debate, from
     local newspapers to network TV news. Americans are at last being
     told the tragic fact that the public schools are failing to teach
     children how to read.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Our largest and trendiest state suddenly forced the facts of
     illiteracy into the national news stream. California came in last
     in national fourth-grade reading tests, set up a state task force
     to find out why, held legislative hearings, discovered that the
     state's Whole Language method is a disaster, and earmarked $100
     million for new textbooks and teacher training to switch the
     schools back to phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In order to receive their share of the money, schools will have
     to give students "systematic explicit phonics instruction, with
     phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relationships, and decoding."
     Governor Pete Wilson is even requiring that school districts
     spend their federal Goals 2000 money on reading instruction.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Wilson's spokesman, Sean Walsh, was blunt. "Whole Language was an
     utter failure. Our curriculum taught to kindergarten to
     third-graders, quite frankly, stinks."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Whole Language system teaches children to guess at words by
     looking at the pictures on the page, to memorize a few dozen
     frequently used words, to skip over words they don't know, to
     substitute words that seem to fit, and to predict the words they
     think will come next. The child who is taught those bad habits,
     instead of how to sound out the syllables, will never be able to
     read big words or become a good reader.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many schools give high grades and happy report cards to children
     who are good at guessing and memorizing words, so parents don't
     realize that their children are being taught to guess instead of
     to read. Self-esteem is a higher priority than literacy.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A federal agency called the National Assessment of Educational
     Progress (NAEP) publishes what is called the Reading Report Card
     for the Nation and the States. Its recently released report on
     the 1994 test given to 140,000 students in grades 4, 8 and 12 in
     public and private schools proves that schoolchildren's reading
     skills are not only bad, but are getting worse.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Comparing 1992 and 1994, the NAEP results show a significant
     decline in the percentage of students scoring at or above the
     "proficient level" and at or above the "basic level," and a
     significant increase in the percentage of pupils performing below
     the "basic level." The NAEP tests also show a lack of any
     positive results from the expensive federal Title I program for
     the disadvantaged.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     How did it happen that the entire public school system abandoned
     phonics and substituted a guessing system? It's rather easy to
     date and track the Whole Language system from its official
     adoption by the state of California in 1987, because California
     is a model for other states that want to be "progressive."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     But Whole Language was not a new idea in 1987; it was just a new
     name for the system that was already in widespread use called
     "whole word" or "look-and-say." The mystery as to how that stupid
     system swept the country, starting in the late 1930s, was
     revealed in a report aired the first week of June on National
     Public Radio.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     "Look-and-say" came to dominate the schools as a result of a
     sophisticated marketing plan carried out by Scott Foresman, the
     publishers of the "Dick and Jane" series of elementary school
     readers. Scott Foresman sent slick salesmen to every school
     district to demonstrate how easily children could be taught to
     "read" the inane "See Dick run" stories that had color
     illustrations of Dick, Jane and Spot (the dog) doing whatever the
     one-syllable words described.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     By the 1950s, the Dick and Jane readers were, as Newsweek now
     tells us, "ubiquitous." Rudolf Flesch's 1955 landmark book, "Why
     Johnny Can't Read," fully exposed the fact that this system is a
     cheat on everyone.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The typical first-grader already knows the meaning of thousands
     of big words, such as hamburger, basketball, birthday,
     toothbrush, and even hippopotamus and Philadelphia. But the child
     will not be able to read those words unless he is taught the
     skill of sounding out the syllables. That's what we call phonics.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
    It is encouraging to see that California is making a massive
     attempt to abandon the failed Whole Language system and switch to
     the proven method of phonics. But changing the educational system
     today will be like trying to change the course of an aircraft
     carrier with a rowboat.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Parents who want to make sure that their children are not
     handicapped by the dumbed-down methods used in most public
     schools today should assume the task of teaching their own
     children how to read. It's easy to do if you use intensive,
     systematic phonics. I did it with my six children, and I urge all
     parents to do likewise.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Reject MFN For Communist China  -- 6/6/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>June 6, 1996</i><h2>                        
Reject MFN For Communist China
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Bill Clinton's policy of cozying up to Communist China by
     granting Most Favored Nation (MFN) status is in shambles. The
     question of the moment is, will Bob Dole let Clinton dangle on
     the limb of his own mistake or save him from embarrassment by
     agreeing with this shameful policy?<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It was all so inconvenient. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
     Firearms (otherwise known as BATF, the agency that played a fatal
     game of cops and robbers against Americans at Waco and Ruby
     Ridge) finally did something useful. They arrested Chinese
     Communist agents for smuggling 2,000 AK-47 automatic assault
     rifles into the United States.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Clinton Administration has such peculiar biases. The
     Administration engaged in hear-no-evil, see-no-evil as long as
     the Chinese Communists merely forced women to undergo late-term
     abortions, locked up citizens who dared to speak out for freedom,
     stole billions (not just millions) of dollars worth of U.S.
     intellectual property, thumbed their noses at signed trade
     agreements, and sold our weapons technology to rogue dictators.
     But when China violated our gun-control laws, that was just too
     much for the liberals!
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The BATF arrest of seven persons in the San Francisco Bay area
     stopped a very profitable Chinese business of selling weapons at
     a 400 percent mark-up to U.S. big-city gangs that want to wipe
     out their rivals. It was a sophisticated worldwide operation that
     must have enjoyed the complicity of the Chinese government.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Those arrested have direct links to China's Defense Ministry and
     Deng Xiaoping's son-in-law. To conceal the source of the weapons,
     the money was laundered through Beijing's state-run bank in Hong
     Kong.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In the 18-month U.S. sting operation, the Chinese discussed with
     our undercover agents the future sale of explosives, anti-tank
     rockets, and shoulder-fired anti-aircraft systems capable of
     knocking planes out of the sky. One Chinese boasted he could
     bring 300,000 AK-47s into the U.S.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Selling all kinds of weapons is big business for Communist China.
     It has sold missiles to Iran and nuclear reactor technology and
     materials to make enriched uranium to Pakistan.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China's expanding economy is financed by a $34 billion trade
     surplus with the United States that has cost Americans 700,000
     jobs. This trade surplus is partially based on stealing our
     products (computer software, video films, musical recordings,
     compact disks, other intellectual property, books, etc.) instead
     of buying them.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Pirated CDs and CD-ROMs are made in China in an estimated 31
     government-licensed plants. China itself can use only about two
     percent of the CDs produced, so the rest go into the
     international market and cheat U.S. companies out of sales.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China signed an agreement to stop this theft in February 1995,
     but nothing has changed. China simply thumbs its nose at the
     whole concept of copyrights and trademarks.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China has made so much money from U.S. trade that it is now
     trying to buy SS-18 strategic missiles, components and technology
     from Russia or Ukraine. For those who've forgotten our worries of
     the Cold War, the SS-18s are the biggies that can reach the
     United States from a launch on the other side of the world.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     China continues to persecute Tibet, use slave labor to produce
     goods for export, and show contempt toward any self-government
     for Hong Kong. China tried to threaten Taiwan's democratic
     election process by firing rockets at the island.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     U.S. big businesses, which want MFN because they lust after
     so-called "free trade" with China, should wake up and taste the
     chop suey that China served the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
     Douglas pursued China's aviation market with the passion and
     naivete of a teenage suitor, but ended up (in the word of one
     Douglas executive) being "betrayed."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Over a costly 15-year courtship, Douglas gave China 80 years of
     accumulated aircraft-manufacturing experience. That was the
     largest technology transfer in history. Douglas taught China how
     to build commercial planes, trained Chinese engineers, and even
     turned over powerful weapons-producing technology.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Like classic con men, Chinese officials schmoozed Douglas by
     dangling the prospect of multi-billion-dollar aircraft purchases.
     Then China turned around and gave its juicy contract to Europe's
     Airbus.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Hypocrisy about the demands for MFN status has reached new
     heights on both sides. In America, the internationalist claque
     that continually calls for "free trade" ignores the fact that
     China has slapped a 30 percent tariff on goods it imports from
     the United States. In China, the ruling clique threatens to
     "punish" U.S. companies if we dare to criticize the $2 billion
     piracy of our intellectual property.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     It is ridiculous to allow Communist China to enjoy the same
     trading privileges with the United States markets that friendly
     countries have. Congress should reject Most Favored Nation status
     for Communist China, and Bob Dole should show leadership in
     calling for that rejection.

<html><head><title>Schlafly: Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed  -- 5/30/96</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>May 30, 1996</i><h2>                        
Pupil Privacy Law Is Needed

</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The school establishment has suddenly discovered a bill that
     passed the House last year and is pending in the Senate which may
     interfere with plans to build files of personal information on
     public school pupils and their families. The Family Privacy
     Protection Act was noncontroversial when it sailed through the
     House by 417 to 7, but the school establishment has gone into
     panic and sounded phony alarms over a whole page of the May 19
     New York Times.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Designed to protect pupil and family privacy, the bill is
     straightforward in stating that schools may not, without prior
     written parental consent, ask minors to answer questionnaires
     about political affiliations or beliefs, mental or psychological
     problems, sexual behavior or attitudes, illegal or
     self-incriminating behavior, appraisals of other family members,
     or religious affiliations or beliefs.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     That's a reasonable rule because the schools have no business
     eliciting that kind of personal or family information from
     students. But in an era when schools assert their right, without
     parental knowledge or consent, to pass out condoms and to force
     little girls to undress and undergo intrusive genital
     examinations, it looks like the schools want to reject all
     accountability to parents.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The hysteria of the school establishment against this bill is
     encapsuled in the lead sentence in the New York Times news
     article: "Research into illegal drug use by American adolescents
     could be stifled by legislation pending in Congress." This is
     followed by quotations from several Ph.D.s ominously predicting
     that the bill "will leave us conducting the war on drugs largely
     in the dark."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     One of these Ph.D.s who is crying around about how the law would
     "cripple" his surveys of schoolchildren, said sarcastically, "We
     also couldn't find out whether they believe in God, which some
     people think is important." Pardon me, but I don't believe he
     should be allowed to ask public schoolchildren whether or not
     they believe in God. Where is the ACLU when we need it?
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The widespread use of intrusive surveys and questionnaires in the
     public school classroom started in the mid-1970s and resulted in
     the passage of the first Protection of Pupil Rights Amendment in
     1978, sponsored by former university president and Senator Sam
     Hayakawa. The public school establishment was powerful enough to
     prevent regulations from being written until President Ronald
     Reagan demanded them in 1984.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     National Education Association agents in the Department of
     Education and public school administrators nationwide circled the
     wagons against this law. Despite egregious violations, it has
     never been enforced.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Take, for example, the infamous 149-question survey which has
     been given, despite parental objections, to nearly all 6th, 9th
     and 12th grade Minnesota pupils. Parents were up in arms about
     it, not only because it was privacy-invading, but also because it
     assumed that illegal drug use, promiscuity, and suicidal
     tendencies are normal teenage behavior.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Another serious objection was that it encouraged pupils to inform
     on their parents. That sort of interrogation of children should
     not be tolerated in a free society. Here's a typical question:
     "Has drinking by any family member repeatedly caused family,
     health, job or legal problems? If yes, who? (Mark all that
     apply.) Parent who lives with me, Parent who doesn't live with
     me, Brother or sister, Other relative, Other person who lives
     with me." Here's another: "Has drug use by any family member
     repeatedly caused family, health, job or legal problems? If yes,
     who? (Mark all that apply.)" The same options are offered.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Many questions conveyed the notion that the majority of teenagers
     are using illegal drugs. "If you use marijuana, how old were you
     when you started? If you use any other drug, how old were you
     when you started? How often do you get drunk?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions interrogated the child about his religion. "How
     often do you attend religious services?" "How important is
     religion in your life?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Some questions would be downright traumatic for some children.
     "Have you ever tried to kill yourself?" "How often have you run
     away from home?" "Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that
     you wondered if anything was worthwhile?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Of course, the survey included lots of Peeping Tom sex questions.
     "Have you ever had sexual intercourse (gone all the way)? If you
     have sexual intercourse, how often do you and/or your partner use
     any birth control method? Have you been pregnant?"
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The public schools have no business requiring children to answer
     any of these nosy questions without prior written parental
     consent. To assert that restricting these surveys will hamper our
     "war on drugs" is ridiculous.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The purpose of the pending legislation is to extend the scope of
     the law to all surveys and questionnaires that are federally
     funded, not merely those funded by the Department of Education,
     and also to remove some vague language that has enabled the
     public schools to circumvent the law for the past ten years.
     Senators should say ho-hum to the hysteria of those who might be
     restrained from asking children about matters that are none of
     their business.

What's Going On With Bob Dole's Friends? 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Why are the so-called Republican moderates undermining Bob Dole's 
     presidential candidacy? Doesn't he have enough problems without 
     his friends planting mines on his road to the White House? 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     First, Governors Christine Whitman and Pete Wilson gave cover to 
     Bill Clinton on his veto of the partial birth abortion ban, which 
     was overwhelmingly passed by Congress (with support from Bob 
     Dole) and was building to become a major Republican campaign 
     issue. When Whitman and Wilson said on national television that 
     they support Clinton's veto, they destroyed effective campaign 
     use of this issue by Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Whatever one thinks about the abortion issue, this support of 
     Clinton by two prominent Dole supporters was completely 
     unnecessary and grossly unhelpful to his campaign. Dole had just 
     honored Whitman by naming her one of the two temporary chairmen 
     of the Republican National Convention. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Secondly, we saw the incredible undermining of Bob Dole by his 
     longtime friend and fellow Kansan, Senator Nancy Kassebaum, as 
     well as the other moderates, Senators John Chafee, Slade Gorton, 
     Mark Hatfield, and even Kit Bond. What they did was to join the 
     Democrats on a motion (that passed 52-46) to remove Medical 
     Savings Accounts (MSAs) from Senator Dole's leadership amendment 
     to the Kennedy-Kassebaum health bill. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     MSAs are not only sound policy and very popular, but they are 
     supported by Bob Dole. They help to define the difference between 
     the parties: Republicans support MSAs because they promote choice 
     in doctors and treatment, portability and affordability, while 
     the Democrats oppose them with dishonest class-warfare rhetoric. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Above and beyond the substance of the MSA argument, the Democrats 
     clearly recognized this vote as a crucial Clinton vs. Dole 
     political confrontation. Every single Democrat voted against MSAs 
     and Vice President Al Gore was rushed to the Senate Chamber in 
     case he was needed to break a tie vote. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     The rejection of MSAs in the Senate bill was a rejection of Bob 
     Dole's leadership. When Dole has friends like this, he doesn't 
     need any enemies. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Third, Christian Coalition director Ralph Reed signaled his 
     willingness to accept a rewriting of the Republican Platform 
     plank on abortion. He gave talkative interviews that resulted in 
     front-page news stories in the New York Times for three days 
     running. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed may have been trying to help Bob Dole by putting the 
     Christian Coalition's imprimatur on a move long demanded by the 
     moderates, namely, the removal of or watering down of the pro- 
     life plank in the Republican Platform. But his contradictory 
     statements (such as denying that he is trying to rewrite the 
     platform language and the same week releasing a new book that 
     specifically presents new platform language) have the effect of 
     encouraging the pro-choicers to keep the political pot boiling in 
     the media and then push for a prime-time floor fight at the 
     Republican National Convention in San Diego. That is decidedly 
     not helpful to Bob Dole. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's proposed new platform language uses the word 
     "constitutional" in a slippery and deceptive way. Instead of 
     calling for constitutional protection for the unborn and/or 
     overturning Roe v. Wade, he suggests using "legal and 
     constitutional means to protect the right to life." Under this 
     language, all actions would have to be in conformity with Roe v. 
     Wade. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed's new book, excerpted this week in Newsweek, also lectures 
     religious conservatives to "shun harsh language" in "Clinton- 
     bashing." That's strange advice in this presidential campaign in 
     which the Democrats are already conducting a no-holds-barred 
     media advertising campaign of Republican-bashing. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Reed is widely credited with clinching the nomination of Bob Dole 
     by using Christian Coalition troops to carry Iowa and 
     particularly South Carolina for Dole. But he's not helping Dole 
     now by fracturing the constituency that Dole desperately needs to 
     be elected. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Fourth, in a Sunday television appearance, one of Bob Dole's 
     closest associates, Senator Al D'Amato, aimed daggers at Newt 
     Gingrich and Pat Buchanan, accusing the former of setting the 
     wrong agenda for the 104th Congress and the latter of being a 
     "philosophical ayatollah." That is hardly the way to unite the 
     party and encourage broad-based support of Bob Dole, and an 
     experienced politician like D'Amato must know this. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     Finally, Bill Kristol has weighed in with the argument that Bob 
     Dole can't win. That's one of the most hurtful slogans that can 
     be hung around the neck of any candidate. 
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     What's going on? Why are the people who were once so determined 
     that Dole be the Republican presidential candidate now sniping at 
     him?

<title>Schlafly: The Reincarnation Of Clinton Care  -- 5/9/96</title>

<h2>
The Reincarnation Of Clinton Care
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

.html">
Phyllis Schlafly 
</a>

<p><BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the most obnoxious features of the Clinton health care
plan (which died the death of a thousand cuts in 1994) was its
creation of a long list of new federal "Health Care Crimes." 
It now appears that the Republicans, in their eagerness to
manifest their total capitulation to President Clinton, have
included an equally obnoxious crime section in their so-called
Health Reform bill (H.R.3160).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Somehow this section (Title II), which parallels the discredited
and (we thought) defunct Clinton bill, was passed by the House
without anybody discovering its far-reaching ramifications. 
Then, Dr. Jane Orient, executive director of the Association of
American Physicians and Surgeons (AAPS), read the bill and
discovered that much of this health crime section was copied from
the Clinton bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
AAPS is the organization whose lawsuit against Hillary Rodham
Clinton forced her to comply with federal law and make the
records of her Health Care Task Force public.  After two years of
litigation, Hillary's lawyers had to admit that they had lied to
the court in asserting that all members of the Task Force were
federal employees when, in fact, the Task Force included outside
special-interest groups with a direct financial interest in
passing the Clinton health care bill.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Republican Health Reform bill (H.R. 3160) criminalizes what
are called "federal health care offenses."  The definition is
excruciatingly broad:  a violation or conspiracy that involves
"any public or private plan or contract, affecting commerce,
under which any medical benefit, item, or service is provided to
any individual."  "No proof of specific intent to defraud is
required."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill specifies monetary penalties of "up to $10,000 for each
instance" of "failure to comply with statutory obligations,"
for "incorrect coding," or for providing "a medical or other
item or service that a person knows or should know is not
medically necessary."  Big Brother will decide what health
services are "necessary."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new crime of "health care fraud" carries fines plus
imprisonment of up to ten years.  "If the violation results in
serious bodily injury," imprisonment can be up to 20 years, and
if death results it can be "for any term of years or for life."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A person who "intentionally misapplies" any assets of a health
care benefit program "shall be fined under this title or
imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both; but if the value of
such property does not exceed the value of $100 the defendant
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one
year, or both."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Did you get that?  If you misapply a benefit that has a value of
less than $100, you can spend one year in prison and be fined,
too.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Whoever" makes a false statement to a health care plan is
liable to a five-year prison term.  "Whoever" can mean anybody,
patient or provider.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"In any investigation relating to any act or activity involving
a Federal health care offense, . . . [the Attorney General] may
require the production of any records that may be relevant." 
The Republicans' passion to turn over more and more power to
Janet Reno (which started with the Anti-Terrorism bill) is a
curiosity to behold.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Failure to provide health information, "oral or recorded in any
form or medium," to a criminal investigator from any government
agency carries a five-year prison term.  Information extracted
under this provision can be used against the patient if "the
action or investigation arises out of and is directly related to
the receipt of health care or payment for health care.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill's exotic forfeiture provisions put health care offenses
on a par with racketeering and drug dealing, and are actually
broader than under the Clinton bill.  "The court, in imposing
sentence on a person convicted of a Federal health care offense,
shall order the person to forfeit property, real or personal,
that constitutes or is derived, directly or indirectly, from
gross proceeds traceable to the commission of the offense."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bill requires the Federal Government to "establish a
national health care fraud and abuse data collection program"
and specifies that "the information in this database shall be
available to Federal and State government agencies and health
plans" pursuant to any procedures set by the Secretary of Health
and Human Services (that's Donna Shalala).  This will empower the
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Federal Government to use medical records to prosecute almost
anybody.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These provisions mean the end of patient privacy and
confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship.  Dr.
Orient asserts that they lay the foundation for forcing all
medical professionals to submit electronic information on every
medical encounter to a central computer, a practice that is
already required by a new Maryland law that takes effect this
July.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Maryland law will require all health care professionals to
disclose to the government the details of every patient
encounter, including diagnosis, test results, therapy, charges,
and 32 pieces of demographic data on every patient.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only Republican part of the Health Reform bill is the section
on Medical Savings Accounts.  The rest of it is ClintonCare.  So,
why are the Republicans fronting for Bill Clinton and Ted
Kennedy?

<h2> 
Books About What's Going On At Colleges 
</h2>

</a> 
 
<P> 
Those who just learned about the dumbing down of our best colleges from the slashing  
report of the National Association of Scholars should do their homework by reading some  
of the excellent books written during the last several years.  Allan Bloom's "The Closing  
of the American Mind" was a trailblazer, but it was followed by several more informative  
books that failed to attract the attention they deserve. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Impostors in the Temple" (Simon & Schuster, 1992) is what Martin Anderson, a former  
Columbia University professor and now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, calls  
many of our nation's academic intellectuals -- that is, people who pretend to teach and  
pretend to do original, important work, but actually do neither.  He says that "the death of  
integrity in the heart of higher education is the root cause of the educational troubles  
which afflict us today." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. Anderson helps us to understand how it all happened at Stanford, one of the nation's  
most prestigious universities.  He describes how Stanford bilked the federal taxpayers out  
of millions of dollars and played a big role in the Political Correctness movement. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Dr. George Roche, president of Hillsdale College, demonstrates in "The Fall of the Ivory  
Tower" (Regnery, 1994) how the easy availability of federal money channeled to colleges  
and universities has corrupted our entire educational system.  He sets forth chapter and  
verse of why and how this is so. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The flow of taxpayers' money has resulted in a large percentage of students being  
admitted to college who have no business being there at all because they are academically  
or emotionally unprepared.  The high rate of default on student loans is a national  
scandal. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One of America's most distinguished scholars, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,  
Thomas Sowell gives us a realistic look at the decline, the deception and the false dogmas  
of the U.S. educational system, which he charges is morally and intellectually bankrupt.   
In "Inside American Education" (Free Press, 1993), he exposes the ideological  
indoctrination and double standards about behavior and race practiced at the leading  
universities. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sowell says that they have presumed to be the conscience of society, while shamelessly  
exploiting college athletes, overcharging the government, organizing price-fixing cartels,  
and abandoning the teaching of undergraduates to student assistants while the tenured  
faculty pursue personal prestige. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Charles Sykes, author of "ProfScam:  Professors and the Demise of Higher Education"  
(St. Martin's Press, 1989), presents a devastating indictment of U.S. universities, which  
he calls vast citadels of waste, ruled with an iron hand by an oligarchy of arrogant,  
tenured professors who are overpaid and underworked. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes names specific universities, professors, dates and places, and asserts that a  
university education is a scam which cheats students, parents, and taxpayers.  He says the  
universities offer more and more courses of less and less importance, including a plethora  
of junk courses referred to by students as "guts" (slang for a course that can be passed  
with no more preparation than gut instinct). 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Here are some examples he cites:  Anthropology of Play, Socio-Psychological Aspects of  
Clothing, Music Video 454, Sport and Political Ideology, Recreation and Leisure, Pocket  
Billiards, and Rock `n' Roll Is Here To Stay. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In his second book, "The Hollow Men -- Politics and Corruption in Higher Education"  
(Regnery Gateway, 1990), Charles Sykes explains the politicization of the college  
courses.  He tells how race, gender and class have been enshrined as the looking glasses  
through which all subject matter must be seen if one is to survive in academia. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Sykes explains how colleges have gone overboard with institutionalized affirmative  
action, sensitivity training, and anti-free speech codes.  The second half of the book is  
devoted to a case study of Dartmouth College, which became a prime example of the  
intolerance of those who preach "diversity." 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
"Tenured Radicals" (Harper & Row, 1990) is the expression Roger Kimball uses to  
discuss the radical politics of many in academia. His main focus is on the absurdity of  
what passes for scholarship on the campuses, and he describes the unintelligible jargon,  
or "ProfSpeak," which passes for erudition in the academic world. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Kimball explains the deconstructionist movement, which he calls a hoax perpetrated by  
academics in order to create more possibilities for papers, symposiums, specialized

In "The Closing of the American Heart" (Probe Books, 1990),Ronald H. Nash describes  
how the decline of moral and religious standards over the past 25 years has contributed to  
the collapse of the nation's educational standards.  He charges that moral illiteracy is  
reflected and taught in academia through relativism, positivism, and humanism.

Dinesh D'Souza, in "Illiberal Education:  The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus" (Free  
Press, 1991), explains Political Correctness (P.C.) on college campuses.  He shows how  
P.C. produces closed-mindedness and intolerance, which is to say an "illiberal  
education."  He explains how Political Correctness opposes the teaching of Western  
Civilization and demands that professors give their first attention to race and gender  
issues.

<h3>HUD:  BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD</h3>

By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz </a><p>
<hr></center>
It is heartening to hear Congress is considering the elimination of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  It is heartening to see that someone in Washington has figured out that 
Washington does not have all the answers and it is time to try something else.<p> 
HUD was created in 1965 out of several federal agencies concerned with housing, mortgage finance and urban issues.  HUD was formed to address an emerging urban crisis and a growing underclass, subject to squalid housing conditions, crime, unemployment, eroding families and limited educational achievement.<p>   
As originally conceived, HUD was an integral part of the "War on Poverty," which to date has cost $5 trillion.  Our urban problems have not markedly improved during the 30-year war, and many would argue that conditions have grown worse.  Life in the roughest parts of our cities is similar to Hobbes' state of nature:  nasty, brutish and short!  <p> 
Since the $8 billion HUD scandal in 1989, the words "financial mismanagement" and HUD have become synonymous.  In 1984, the Grace Commission warned of financial disasters stemming from HUD's fundamental flaw.  According to the Grace Commission, HUD is "a financial institution with a social mission," and the emphasis on its social goals "resulted in a higher priority on program execution at the expense of the internal management requirements normally associated with a financial institution."  Sound financial management is secondary to spending. <p>   
Since 1990, HUD has been featured prominently in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) "high risk" program, which lists by department the federal government's fundamental financial management weaknesses.  HUD's financial management systems for monitoring low-income housing assistance are so bad that HUD cannot assure taxpayers that their taxes are used for eligible recipients, or that there is adequate fund control for more than $100 billion in long-term contractual funding serving 3 million families.  The Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) insurance fund for single family housing loans may not be sufficient to cover losses.  Currently, FHA has in force $303 billion of insurance, but it may not be able to pay potential claims without seeking higher appropriations from Congress.  Also cited are 106 Public Housing Authorities (PHA), accounting for 17 percent of all PHA housing units, which have been identified as troubled.  Taxpayers cannot be "assured that public housing funds achieve intended purposes."  PHAs administer more than half of HUD's budget.   <p>
Not only is HUD wasteful and ineffective, it is a financial liability.  Any private corporation in the position of the federal government would have done something about the department long ago.<p> 
HUD's failure to resolve its 30-year internal conflict between its role as a financial institution and its social goals has prompted freshmen House Republicans, led by Representatives Sam Brownback (R-
Kan.) and Sue Myrick (R-N.C.), and a Senate task force, chaired by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.) and Spencer Abraham (R-Mich.), to recommend HUD's elimination. <p>  
The recently released House bill, known as "The Federal Housing Reform and Local Empowerment Act," proposes to replace the existing public housing and housing assistance with a voucher program to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  Under the proposal, state governments are given the options of participating in the HHS program, running their own voucher program, or setting up their own public housing program.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that this would save $17 billion in budget authority over five years. <p>
The bill also consolidates many of HUD's programs into two block grant programs:  the Housing and Development Block Grant and the Special Populations Block Grant, both of which will be administered by HHS.  Other programs will either be eliminated, transferred to other government agencies, or privatized. <p>
Earlier this year, the Administration recognized that something had to be done to save HUD from the scalpels of Republican budget hawks.  As part of the vice president's reinvention program, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros laid out the administration's strategy for saving the department.  Cisneros proposed consolidating 60 HUD programs into three community and housing funds, creating a voucher system for public housing, and converting FHA into a government-owned corporation 
to reduce costs.  According to OMB, the administration's proposal would save $770 million over five years.  That's less than five percent of the savings from the congressional reform bill. <p>
The "reinvention strategy," which has become a trademark of the Clinton administration, is an attempt to protect favorite programs and departments from budget cuts and taxpayer criticism, under the guise 
of improving the federal bureaucracy.  For the Clinton administration, reinvention substitutes for true reform.  More often than not, the rhetoric of reinvention has become an argument for the status quo and 
an assurance to special interests that business-as-usual can continue.<p>     
This rearguard action was recently rejected by former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, who said that the "American people do not want to reinvent government, they want to reduce it."  He added that taxpayers, "[D]on't want to manage the bureaucracy better, they want to shrink the bureaucracy.  And they don't want people dependent upon government, they want people empowered." <p>
HUD has had its 30-year trial run.   It failed.   It's time to downsize, devolve, privatize and terminate HUD.

<b>President, Citizens Against Government Waste By:  Thomas A. Schatz</b>
<p> 
Much of the nation has been under the oppressive grip of a heat wave with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees.  These sweltering days of summer are no match for the oppressive burden of federal regulations that have gripped the nation for years.  Come October, the cool fall air will replace the stagnant heat, but unnecessary and ridiculous federal regulations will continue to cost American taxpayers nearly $600 billion per year. 
<p>
In its unrelenting leadership role, the House of Representatives is actively trying to get rid of burdensome regulations and return the nation to common sense and fiscal freedom.  The Regulatory Reform Bill, which was signed on February 24, 1995, allows property owners to seek compensation when a federal regulatory action has taken place and improves the process by which federal regulations are developed and 
issued.   
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) again took on ridiculous regulations when he proposed "Corrections Days" earlier this year.  Corrections Days, which passed with a vote of 271 to 146 on June 20, 1995, is a mechanism to streamline the termination of silly regulations.  The House will be holding corrections days twice a month.  Among the many targets for corrections is the repeal of a provision that places costly safety requirements on ships carrying vegetable oil into or out of U.S. waters, even though the oil, if spilled, poses no threat to the environment or public health; and a federal rule barring the removal of trees surrounding an airport for safety purposes if those trees are in a wetland. 
<p>
In its first session of corrections on July 25, 1995, the House voted 269 to 156 to exempt San Diego, California from a water pollution regulation that would require the city to build a $2 billion sewage treatment plant.  Critics of the plant contend that discharging sewage into the Pacific Ocean four miles offshore would not affect sea-life 
and in some instances would benefit marine life.  This is an important first step in trying to bring the federal regulation leviathan under control.   
<p>
As the House catapults ahead with serious regulatory reform, the Senate has once again lagged behind.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kansas) set aside the GOP-sponsored regulatory reform bill on July 18, 1995, because of lack of support.  Senator Dole is unsure when and if the bill will ever come up for consideration in the 
Senate.  The Senate is too timid to attack the voracious appetite of federal regulations. 
<p>
Regulation reform is not an esoteric or vague concept.  Regulations affect everybody.  Government regulation dramatically increases the cost of doing business, which results in fewer jobs and lower salaries, and makes U.S. companies less competitive. 
<p>
Regulations extend their claws into all sectors of society including food and medicine, the environment, and the Department of the Interior (DOI). 
<p>
Probably the most powerful regulatory agency in the entire federal government is the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   The expansion of the FDA is unparalleled in the federal government.  Growing from 4,470 employees in 1970, with a budget of $227 million, the FDA currently has 9,217 employees at a cost of $764 million.  This is a 106-percent increase in employees and a 237- percent increase in budget.  The FDA approves more regulations rather than drugs.  Drug approval averages 12 years and $359 million per drug.  The cost of this excessive regulation is passed on to the consumer at approximately 25 cents per dollar.  Critically needed drugs are delayed incessantly because of excessive regulations. 
<p>
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is notorious for its overzealousness in regulating.  Initially established in 1970 to combat a real and growing pollution problem, the EPA has turned into a monolithic regulating monster.  Evidence of such heavy-handed regulations include a Pennsylvania couple being threatened with 
polluting a waterway by installing a tennis court on their land; a couple in New York being fined $30,000 for building a deck on their house because, among other things, it cast a shadow on a wetland;  and an auto parts store owner being fined $10,000 because he didn't post a sign, which was down because of window washing, stating that his store accepts waste motor oil for recycling.  Micro- managing the 
environment instead of fighting pollution is the new mission of the EPA. 
<p>
DOI weighs in with its own stupid and environmentally unsound practice of micro management.  The Endangered Species Act (ESA) and the National Biological Survey (NBS) are examples of the DOI's misguided policies.  The ESA causes hardships for private property owners, businesses, and developers; it confers enormous power on unaccountable bureaucrats; and is costly to U.S taxpayers.   
<p>
The ESA has listed 853 species to be protected, while some 4,000 other plants and animals are official candidates for future listings.  According to Maura Dolans of the Los Angeles Times, blunders by the Fish and Wildlife Service may have contributed to an extinction.  The Service spent nearly $3 million  to buy a Florida habitat for the endangered dusky seaside sparrow -- and then neglected to manage the land properly.  The last bird died in 1987. 
<p>
The NBS was created to catalogue everything that walks, crawls, swims or flies around this country on public or private lands.  Critics say that the program will take years to complete, involve thousands of government scientists, and would clash with private property rights.  Because an area was designated under the NBS as a wilderness area, a lost Boy Scout was not rescued in a timely manner.  A rescue 
helicopter was not allowed to land in a sensitive area.  A note had to be dropped to the child.  The Boy Scout was eventually rescued by a second helicopter when the search party failed to find him. 
<p>
Needless regulations are shortsighted and stupid.  Some may seem humorous, but all are serious.  The increased presence of federal regulations erode away personal freedoms as well as our bank accounts.  The federal government should be for the people not against the people.

<h2>Tales From the Gypped</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><p>
</center><hr>
<br>
Medicare reform will be among Congress' top priorities after the  
August recess.  Those who are fighting any reform, their message is  
that each dollar spent in the program produces a dollar in benefits  
for America's seniors.  Nothing could be further from the truth. <p> 
The Medicare program is a sitting duck for con artists, thieves, and  
degreed opportunists.   Because of its size, diabolical complexity and  
lax management practices, this $177 billion leviathan has become the  
equivalent of a Gucci-clad matron sauntering down the street sporting  
a flashing neon sign that says "please rob me!"  Those with a notion  
to defraud Medicare know that these three factors alone guarantee that  
the risks of gaming the system are worth taking because Medicare is  
where the easy money is.<p>
In fiscal year 1993, Medicare processed almost 700 million claims.   
That's nearly 2 million per day, about 250 million more than it  
processed five years earlier, and nearly six times the number of tax  
returns processed by the Internal Revenue Service.  Physicians, supply  
companies, or diagnostic laboratories have about three chances out of  
1,000 of having Medicare audit their billing practices in any given  
year.<p>
Medicare fraud is perpetrated by billing companies, providers,  
suppliers, even organized crime and drug dealers.  There are scams  
involving kickbacks, durable medical equipment, prescription  
marketing, nursing homes and home care providers, tampered medical  
supplies, ambulance and taxi services.  Medicare fraud is as varied as  
the imaginations of the criminals who game the system.  Citizens  
Against Government Waste's (CAGW) new report, Medicare Fraud: Tales  
from the Gypped, details more than one hundred examples.<p>  
Unless you've been away on the space shuttle, you surely are aware of  
the litany of waste that plagues the program.  But individual examples  
don't give the full picture.  It is heart-stopping.   At least ten  
percent, or $17 billion each year, in Medicare spending is irrevocably  
squandered.  That 10 percent is also, coincidentally, the annual  
growth rate that is leading the program to bankruptcy over the next  
several years.<p>  
Here are just a few of the countless examples:<p>     
** Several Michigan pharmacists obtained large supplies of expired  
drugs and dispensed them to nursing home patients, at full cost to  
Medicare.  One of the pharmacists who participated in the scheme  
quipped, "those people are old, they'll never know the difference, and  
they'll be dead soon anyway." <p> 
** A pharmaceutical salesman peddled $6 million in expired,  
mislabeled, unsterile, or second-hand pacemakers over an eight-year  
period, sometimes providing Hawaiian vacations or prostitutes as  
kickbacks to cardiologists who agreed to implant the adulterated  
devices in unsuspecting patients.  In his offices, authorities found  
"a number of bloody pacemakers, raising suspicions he was reselling  
devices surgically removed from other patients or even from corpses." <p> 
** In Florida, more than a dozen companies, claiming to supply  
Medicare patients with liquid nutritional supplements and feeding  
kits, defrauded Medicare of an estimated $20 million.  The "kingpin"  
of the scheme fled the country, but was found in Venezuela and  
extradited. <p> 
** A company in New York lured Medicare beneficiaries into disclosing  
their Medicare identification numbers in exchange for microwave ovens,  
air conditioners, or angora underwear.   <p>
** A Georgia health-care company is under investigation for allegedly  
pocketing more than $14 million in illegally obtained Medicare funds.   
Money allegedly went toward golf-course memberships, vacations, a new  
car for the CEO's son, $9.7 million for computer software, $84,341 for  
gourmet popcorn, and $18,600 for lobbying activities.  <p>
** A California supply company billed Medicare for $5 million worth of  
surgical dressings for patients who never underwent surgery. <p> 
There is no doubt that Medicare is in crisis.  We've heard from  
Medicare's Public Trustees that the program is faltering.  This year,  
the trustees have given us a date certain for Medicare's impending  
demise if its current rate of spending is not reduced: 2002.  They've  
told us that if we don't act today, never mind the long-range affect  
on baby boomers and their children, our parents and grandparents, who  
currently receive benefits, will be cut off in just seven years. <p>   
Rhetoric and denial are the postures of choice in Washington.  Some  
members of Congress, along with their outside supporters, claim there  
is no crisis.  Others argue that the federal government will never let  
the system run out of money, as if the American taxpayer is a never- 
ending source of cash for this out-of-control program.  And then there  
are those, like Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.), who can't  
resist the easy politics of intergenerational fear-mongering.    <p>
But Republican attention to Medicare's problems are not some partisan  
plot.  Mr. Gephardt ought to familiarize himself with the authors of  
the 1995 Trustees Report, which included such Republican "friends" as  
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Labor Secretary Robert Reich, Health  
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, and Social Security  
Commissioner Shirley Chater.  <p>
If Medicare's centralized, non-competitive, single-payer system is at  
the heart of billions of dollars in wasted resources, eliminating  
waste and fraud requires that competitive, market forces be introduced  
into the Medicare system.  Free market forces and incentives would  
reduce Medicare's excessive costs and improve the quality of health  
care available for seniors.  By putting the onus for rooting out fraud  
and abuse on the private sector, and creating inescapable incentives  
to do so, risk-free opportunities to defraud the system would be  
greatly reduced.  Moreover, we would finally provide seniors with a  
medical system that develops greater quality rather than one that  
simply increasingly consumes more and more health dollars.  <p>
How we deal with Medicare's crisis will speak volumes about who we are  
as Americans and what kind of society we value.  At stake is whether  
today's senior citizens, not to mention those of us who are following  
close behind, will have a viable health-care system in the future.   
Waste and fraud will only rob us all of a better future if we continue  
to assume it is an unavoidable result of a well-meaning big government  
program.<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at Congress 
in 1996 and asks, with the budget in limbo, are you getting all the government
you're still paying for?
<p>
With the primaries already under way and members gearing up to defend their 
seats, what issues will be at play?  Tonight's guests give us their predictions. 
You won't want to miss hearing their inside perspectives from those
who work closely with Congress on both the Senate and the House
sides.  And you will hear from one freshman Congressman from the
class that the media tells us is terrorizing the politicians living
inside the beltway.
<p>
But first, <i>Straight Talk</i> invites you to hear from Gary Bauer, 
president of the Family Research Council.  A political veteran, Gary not 
only shares with you some of his predictions on the 1996 issues; he offers some 
hope for the future of the American family.  There are steps we can take to make 
a difference.
<p>
Although Gary is seen on various newscasts and quoted in many
newspapers, for the full story, <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind
the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, Gary, we are in an election year, and it is always
interesting how the way people campaign isn't the way they necessarily
govern, and there is always new information coming out.  What
do you see in the budget debate this year that sort of highlights
that phenomenon?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  You know, this is one of the serious problems facing the 
country, because I think the American people, by and large, have concluded 
that Washington doesn't speak the truth; that the politicians in Washington, 
D.C., play fast and loose with the facts, and now we have some recent 
evidence that I think is pretty disturbing.
<p>
Both sides in the budget debate were assuming and predicting that the Medicare 
Trust Fund would run a surplus last year.  The estimates were it would be as 
high as $4.7 billion.  Now that the Medicare debate is over, we discover
that instead of a $4.7 billion surplus, there was a $35 million
deficit.
<p>
Now, clearly, the Clinton Administration had to know that by the time the 
debate was going on.  These figures come in every month.  Right about the time 
the debate would have been at its peak, the Clinton Administration had to know 
that this massive deficit was going to appear, and yet they did not announce
it until after the debate was over and, not coincidentally, their
side had won.
<p>
So I can certainly understand the cynicism level that you see among the 
American people, which is a very disturbing thing for a democracy when, 
particularly, citizens and young people decide that they can't trust those who 
would lead them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have seen that people mean a lot of things when they talk
about balancing the budget, and in the same way they have meant
a lot of things when they talk about being pro-family.
<p>
You wrote a book that deals with that, Gary.  Tell us a little bit about it.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, I just got real tired of people who believe
in traditional values being smeared and stereotyped as being bigots
or extremists or radical right or Christian right, all these terms
we hear thrown around.  I look at the agenda that we believe in
and that most of the people who support us believe in, and it
is a pretty mainstream agenda.
<p>
So we decided to write a book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, in which we 
would describe what America would look like if my side won, if we were the 
Hollywood movie producers, if we were running the school boards and had the 
White House and the Congress and the university presidencies, and so
forth.
<p>
I think the America that I describe in that book is an
America that 80 percent of the American people want; that is,
a country with safe streets and schools that work and traditional
values and kids who are being raised the right way again.
<p>
Our hope is this year that a lot of people will read that book and
it might help provide some context for them as the debate goes
on in 1996.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of my favorite things in this book
is the yes or no questions at the end that really help people
understand exactly what is happening.  Why did you put those in?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, one of the hardest things to pin down is an
American politician.  I don't know if many of our listeners have
ever written to members of Congress or not, but if they have,
they will find that almost no matter what position they take,
the member of Congress, when he writes back, seems to find some
way to actually agree with them even though, when you look at
the voting record, they are voting against many of the things
their constituents are writing about.
<p>
What we try to do in this book is, as you point out, at the end of each 
chapter, give a couple of questions that a citizen can ask somebody running 
for school board or for Congress or the Senate or for the Presidency
that are very clear, have yes or no answers, and leave very little
wiggle room, as we call it in Washington, D.C., for a politician
to be able to deceive or to get around the truth.
<p>
And again, our hope is that a lot of citizens, armed with these questions 
and with the facts, will be able to make more valid judgments about
who is speaking for them and who is not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ironically, right now, Hillary Clinton also has a book out, and 
she's on the author's circuit.  Yet her vision of family is very different
from the vision you describe.  How is that impacting you?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, there is a really telling quote in Hillary Clinton's
book that you really have to think about, and as we all thought
about it, it became more and more disturbing.  Mrs. Clinton says
in her book, &quot;There is no such thing as other people's children.&quot;
<p>
When you read the book, you discover that what she means is that
she has a vision that government ought to play a major role in
the raising of children, whether it is government day care or
government intervening in education or government making judgments
about what should or should not be taught, and so forth.
<p>
Our vision is diametrically opposed to that.  We believe that parents are
the first and most important teachers that a child has; that they
bear the ultimate responsibility for what those children ought
to be taught.  And so we kind of welcome the fact that Mrs. Clinton's
book is out at the same time as ours, and quite frankly, I would
be quite happy if I could engage her in a debate about American
families and American children and the proper way to go.  Kids
don't need more bureaucrats in Washington; they need more people
who love them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Doesn't government have a role?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, certainly there are things that government can do
to make family life easier, and we can probably all tick them
off fairly easily, whether it is lowering taxes on families so
that hard-working mothers and fathers can keep more of what they
earn or something like educational choice, which would enable
parents to choose the schools they want to send their children
to.  So there are things that are reinforcing to what the average
mother and father is attempting to do.
<p>
The problem comes up when government attempts to replace those parents, to 
have a bigger role than the parents or the family has in the nurturing of 
those children.  We have 100 cases of that, examples of that.  We look
at programs like welfare, which might have been very well intentioned
but in fact have in many ways destroyed the inner-city family.
<p>
So a lot of what government does ends up being very hurtful, and
many of the good things that government could do to help families,
it just doesn't do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you hope to accomplish with <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I realize Americans are busy.  There are 101 challenges and 
time demands, and so forth. I would be happy if I could just get a large number 
of average Americans to read this book, have a better sense of what the 
pro-family movement is all about, and perhaps be just a little bit more 
educated when they look at public policy issues and look at those who are
attempting to get their votes.
<p>
You know, with all the influences that are on us, all the paid advertising, it 
is tough to know how much influence a book like this can have, but I know that
Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family has set a goal of distributing
a million copies of this book by the end of the year, and I think
if that actually happens, it could have a major impact on the
public policy debate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Dr. James Dobson has partnered with you, and Focus on the Family 
has published <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, hopefully, to put forth a positive 
image. Do you think that this book could help with the cynicism that is really 
rampant in American politics today?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Cynicism is really a killer in a democracy.  People have got to have 
some degree of faith in their government, in those who would govern them.  I am 
an optimist about the ability to reform Washington and to turn the
country around, and so if <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, if that book
in some small way gives people a sense of how things could be
better, then I think it would be a very positive contribution
to the debate this year and beyond.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for being with us today, Gary.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> begins
our discussion of the congressional year ahead.  Please stay with
us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. To begin our look ahead at what Congress has in store for 
1996, I am joined by Bret Bernhardt, Legislative Director for Senator Don 
Nickles; Marshall Wittmann, Director of House Relations for the Heritage 
Foundation; and Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's Assistant 
to the President for Government Relations.
<p>
Welcome to the show, gentlemen. Predictions are such a fun thing to do. It 
is the beginning of an election year, and yet the end of the legislative 
session.
<p>
Let's just kind of go around.  Marshall, what do you see as sort of 
the top five, top ten issues that you think are going to be really hot in 
Congress?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, I think the main issue is going to be the
divisions between Clinton and the Congress, liberal versus conservative,
on every issue, I think, coming down the pike.  Congress will
try to remind the American people that Bill Clinton is a liberal
and they are conservative.  So you are going to see issues like
immigration, you are going to see issues like tax limitation and
the balanced budget amendment be revisited in the House of Representatives.
Education may be another issue.  Another key issue will be the
partial-birth abortion veto, which has already passed the Congress.
We expect Clinton to veto it.  There may be an override fight.
<p>
But every issue, you will see Congress reminding the American
people that Bill Clinton is no conservative.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And who is going to win that?  I mean, I think we have seen 
that Bill is pretty good when it comes to telling that kind of story. 
How do you think they are going to be able to play the game?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, the ultimate decision will be made by the American 
people in November when they vote in the election, and I think that they
will be the major arbiter of who wins this fight.
<p>
The past year we have seen the first skirmishes in trying to make 
government smaller.  Now, Clinton might have won the first round, but I 
think the most important round will be fought in November.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Marty, what do you think?  You have been on the Hill a long 
time, and welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. What do you see as moving 
the Congress forward in 1996?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think we are going to see some continuing focus 
on the budget, balanced budget.  With the governors' recent conference, there 
seems to be a renewed focus on a possible balanced budget agreement that
would be between the President and the Congress.  So I think that
is going to happen.
<p>
The question of what is going to happen with family tax relief is of great 
concern to Family Research Council, and some other policy matters that are 
still unresolved. We have had the Labor-HHS bill stalled in the Senate. We 
have some important pro-life concerns on that legislation.
<p>
I think Marshall is right that there are going to be some bright lines drawn 
between the President's rhetoric and his true positions on some issues.  The
challenge in some cases is going to be getting these through the
Senate.  I know Bret is well aware that there is quite a challenge
on the Senate floor with the amendment process and the lengthy
debate, and so on, that it is much easier to control the process
in the House and get some very stark legislative proposals brought
up, and certainly the partial-birth bill moved much easier in
the House than it did in the Senate, but it has passed both and
will be onto the President's desk sometime soon.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, Bret, I do want to hear your predictions as well, but 
the bright line -- they always say it is a little harder to draw a
bright line in the Senate than the House.  Would you agree?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: Yes, I think that is right.  In the Senate it
takes roughly about 60 votes to get something through that is
very controversial because of the filibuster that is able to be
done by the Democrats in the Senate.
<p>
I think you will see -- and I agree with what Marty and Marshall have said 
here -- that in the Senate you will probably -- and I would imagine the 
House to a great degree, also -- moved as consensus items here initially,
and as we have seen with the welfare with the governors having
put together a consensus bipartisan-type package, that will probably
begin moving here fairly soon, and that could be then the sparkplug
that then gets the budget negotiation ignited again.
<p>
And then later on we will move into some areas in which we define the 
Republicans' agenda and get us ready for the elections in the fall.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you are nonpartisan, of course, Marshall.  However, in 
terms of defining the Republicans' agenda, that is a lot of items on
the table.  How would you define it?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, you know, one thing we have to make clear is that Bill 
Clinton wasn't exactly telling the truth when he tried to cast himself as 
Ronald Reagan in the State of the Union address.
<p>
What will happen is that there will be a number of issues.  It might be 
through the appropriations process, where we try to show that Bill Clinton
is on the side of big government, and Republicans and conservatives
want smaller government.  It might be on the issue that Marty
touched upon, family tax relief.  And it might be on these important
social issues such as the pro-life issues.  It may be on the issue
of racial preferences.
<p>
So there will be a number of issues that will come down the pike, I expect, 
this year that Congress will try to make that distinction, because, as we know, 
Bill Clinton is a very good talker, but you have to look at what he does and
not what he says, and Congress will be trying to point that out
to the American people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, it is very ironic. In one week he makes a very wonderful, 
warm speech, and in another he brings us back Dr. Henry Foster in a program that 
won't talk about teen sex, just teen pregnancy, which was a tad surprising.
<p>
But tax relief, everybody from the <i>Washington Post</i> to the <i>New
York Times</i> tells us that we could all get along without tax relief.
Is that your assessment, Marty?  Is tax relief holding us up
on the budget?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, we don't believe it is holding us up. The 
question is, with those people who want to get rid of tax relief, is their 
agenda to really reduce the deficit or is it to have more money available 
to spend on more social programs?  I think that the answer is the latter, 
that they really want to use that money to spend it.
<p>
There is some talk of trying to separate the two, do the budget reduction 
first and then come back to the tax package.  But I don't think that is 
likely to happen.  I think that, particularly in the House, the leadership
is committed to doing that as a package if there is to be a package,
and there has been discussion on the debt limit bill of at least
doing a first installment of family tax relief and probably at
least capital gains reduction of some sort.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, a lot of people are reporting that there probably will 
not be any budget agreement made, that we will just live on continuing
resolutions, spoon-fed every now and then, until the election,
and then that will be one of the shining lines drawn.  Do you
all agree with that?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: I think that if that is the case, if we don't get a budget 
agreement, we will continue on in that process.  But I think, as I said 
earlier about the welfare agreement being the catalyst for producing a 
budget agreement, you could have a situation where you will have room for 
a tax cut, and if you get in the area of $150 billion, say, we have
plenty of room for the child tax credit, capital gains, and a
few other items that we have had in the contract and other items
we have been pushing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the new kids in town, sort of courtesy of Mr. Forbes, 
has been the flat tax.  Does this draw any lines for us, or do you think the 
welfare reform, the pro-family tax relief, and some of the other thing -- 
immigration -- will supersede?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I think the flat tax will be an important issue in the 
election.  I don't expect that Congress will overhaul the tax code this 
year.  But what the flat tax points out is how much money has gone from the 
family in Washington, and you have all these special interests in Washington 
who play the tax code, except Mom and Dad back at home at the kitchen table
don't have those lobbyists at Family Research Council fighting
them.
<p>
But what the flat tax does is draw that distinction between
those for big government and those for smaller government.  And
I think that will be debated.  It will be the great debate of
1996.  But I don't think there will be any congressional action
other than hearings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think the flat tax is as big an issue, like devolution 
was, like let's make government smaller, let's make the tax flatter?  Does it 
have that kind of power?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT:  I don't think it does as much as smaller
government.  We tried this in 1986, and a lot of blood was let
in coming up with that 1986 package.  It started out as a flat
tax, and look what we ended up with.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: So I think there is a lot to be said. It is going
to be a long ways before we get to an actual flat tax.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you see, Marty, as you kind of look at the war of 
the issues?  Where do you think pro-family Americans are really going
to be looking?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think a lot is going to really focus on the 
cultural agenda, what are our children learning, what kinds of influences 
are affecting them in society, what kinds of dangers are they exposed to 
in the area of crime and drugs and things like that.
<p>
I think there is still very deep underlying concern about issues like that, 
and I think families are going to look to see what is the government doing 
to make the world and the country a safer place for their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Can they offer anything?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Government?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: For the family.
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: What government can do is get out of the way. So often 
government makes decisions, whether it is in terms of Goals 2000 education, 
whether it is in terms of the tax policy, where they tell moms and dads what 
to do, how their children should be educated.  In large part government needs
to stop being an obstacle to families, and over the last 40 or
50 years we have seen that time and time again, whether it is
values or economic issues like taxes.  Government steps upon the
territory that should be the preserve of the family.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are kind of coming to the end of our time.  Marshall, 
we wanted to ask you quickly, I think it was very much a surprise to people
yesterday when Pat Buchanan actually won in Louisiana, and by
no small margin. What is your assessment of that?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, more than anything else, it underscores the volatility
of this election period.  We saw that in 1994; to some degree
in 1992.
<p>
The other interesting part is the role that social conservatives
played in that vote.  If you look at the vote, the reason that
Buchanan did so well because of the strength of social conservatives.
So people of faith and family are having an impact and will have
an impact this year, and those people who ignore them do so at
their peril.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And I don't think that is a surprise to any of the people 
here. Thank you for being with us.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss a children's
issue that has a lot of parents worried:  education.  What do
the upcoming semesters hold for America's students?  After this
break we'll find out. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would like to
welcome guests who have the inside track on our country's educational
issues:  Amy Myers, Press Secretary and Government Relations Director
for the Eagle Forum; Hans Meeder, Professional Staff for Long-Range
Policy and Planning from the Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee; and Jennifer A. Marshall, Education Policy Analyst
for the Family Research Council.
<p>
Thank you for joining us.  Thank you for having a smaller title.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
We are taking a look at all the issues coming up in 1996.  We have looked 
at the Hill. But education is very near and dear to a lot of people's hearts.
Hans, why don't we start with you?  Where do you see education
issues going in 1996?
<p>
MR. MEEDER:  Well, I think that the key that we are going to have to work 
on in 1996 is that President Clinton is continuing to have a barrage of lies 
about what creates quality solutions for our children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Give me an example.
<p>
MR. MEEDER:  Well, he basically has created a Goals 2000 program
to basically have federal control over curriculum content and
the direction of education reform.  They continue to put money
into programs like the Title I program and Head Start, which are
30 years old, have been reformed five or six times, and still
the studies show that they have no lasting impact on our children
for good, and if anything, they might actually perpetuate some
bad practices.
<p>
And yet, at the same time, what we see really works
for kids at the local level are parental control and involvement
over education, strong local commitment and flexibility, and a
strong focus on academics.  It is really not that complicated.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So how do we get there?  Give me a quick one on
how we get there.  Then, Amy, we are going to ask you.  How are
we going to achieve it?
<p>
MR. MEEDER: It is not one silver bullet that will fix it, but the first 
step that we are going to work on is identifying how many federal programs 
are out there, what the federal role really is, and then start a process 
of trying to turn back as much control locally as possible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amy, what do you see?  We are looking at education in 1996.
What is going to come up?
<p>
MS. MYERS: Well, I think you will see a lot of issues that come up.  Whether 
or not they go anywhere, we will see.  The House of Representatives tends to 
be a little bit more favorable toward parents and local control, whereas the
Senate is still a little bit behind schedule on that.  And, of
course, you have President Clinton, who thinks that only Washington
knows how to control education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. MYERS: I think through the appropriations process we might see the 
defunding or cutting back on a number of programs that a lot of 
conservatives feel are detrimental to the --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How about Goals 2000?  A lot of concern for that.  Do you think 
we will see a cut in Goals 2000?
<p>
MS. MYERS:  Well, we did see a cut in the House version of the appropriations 
bill, which was zero funding. In the Senate version it was fully funded. So 
we probably will not see Goals 200 eliminated.
<p>
It is a two-fold process. You eliminate funding as well as repeal the law. 
Goals 2000 does not have a lot of money in it compared to other programs. 
However, it does have a lot of the federal strings.  I think that is what 
is most concerning to a lot of American families.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To have you do this analogy quick for me, Jennifer, you said 
one time that if you look at every educational dollar, the government throws
in a few pennies and then controls the spending of the rest.
How does --
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  That is right.  It is something like on the order of 6 
to 7 percent of the Federal Government contributes to local education; 
yet I don't know how much percentage of the actual mandates and regulations 
are actually coming from the Federal Government. So you can tell that they 
have really got the beast by the nose.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It has been kind of interesting because
some states have said, &quot;Okay, we won't take that federal
money,&quot; and I am sure parents in those states initially think,
you know, we've lost all this money, when they have lost a fraction
of what it takes to run local schools.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: That is right.  Something like $2 per student per year, 
something that you could buy a sandwich with at McDonald's, and what you 
have to do for that money is form a state school improvement panel,
form local panels, revise your curriculum, submit proposals to
the Secretary of Education, for $2 per student.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is amazing.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: Ridiculous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you think is going to come up in 1996?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, we hope that there will be a great discussion on the 
federal role in education, and we are especially looking forward to 
consideration of the back-to-basics bill, which would shut down the Department
of Education and block-grant those programs for a period of four
years.
<p>
What we would really like to see, and this would mean an
end to the federal role in education, would be a tax cut at the
end of that time to return the money to the people who are putting
it in the pot right now, so they could run education at the local
level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Hans, what does your organization see as
the likelihood of that?  Do you think long term -- even in 1996,
short term -- we could see the end of the Department of Education?
I have heard its death knell before.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Well, the thing that we have to realize, most Americans 
don't really know the difference between -- I hate to say this -- but
between local, state, and federal involvement, and that is why,
when the President starts talking about extreme cuts to education,
which, at the most, we are talking about one-half of one percent
of national education spending, is what we are talking about reducing
at the federal level, but when he starts throwing that kind of
talk around, people get very nervous, because most people are
very supportive of education in general, and we have seen polling
that shows that of the general public, only about 19 percent right
now support eliminating the Department of Education, and almost
80 percent oppose it, and a lot of it because they don't understand
what the Department of Education at the federal level really does.
<p>
We feel that in order to do it successfully, we have to undergo
a very big education effort to show people the massive proliferation
of programs.  Just to let you know, the Department of Education
itself has about 250 education programs, maybe a little bit more
than that.  But we are in the process of identifying several more
hundred education programs already spread across the Federal Government.
<p>
What our members don't want to do is get rid of a couple hundred
programs and an agency and yet still have the Federal Government
very involved in education, and then we all think the problem
is solved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Because they have put those programs maybe under 
Agriculture or under another department.
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Same thing, but just a different way of paying for it.
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Hundreds of programs have cropped up over the last 40 years. 
Basically, any Congressman or Senator that wanted to say they were for 
education created a new program, and we have multitudes of Indian ed programs, 
science programs. Unfortunately, very few of those programs are really 
focused on basic academics, the reading, math, and science, and many of
them are just kind of special interest buyoff programs.
<p>
So we feel that before we can really move on restructuring the federal
role, we have to know what is out there and then educate the public
on that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, Phyllis Schlaffly has been a real leader in that. 
I mean, she has worked very hard on education issues. What is her 
perspective on the back-to-basics approach?
<p>
MS. MYERS:  I think that we and Phyllis have said that the back-to-basics
approach is a good step in the right direction.  It does not eliminate
the federal role in education; however, it does definitely move
us toward that direction.
<p>
We don't think that there is a constitutional role for the Federal 
Government to be involved in education, and that is how we would 
eventually like to see things end up.  Given the current Congress and the 
current President, we don't see that as a realistic goal in the 104th 
Congress.  You don't have a Senate that will do anything and you don't 
have a President that will sign it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's the hard part.
<p>
MS. MYERS: Yes. But we would like to see an end in the federal role in 
education, and just to add on to what Hans had said, I know that their 
committee has shown well over 660 programs throughout all of the agencies
in the Federal Government that are involved in education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One thing we know about government is it grows.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
Thanks so much for being with us.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear from one of the 
freshman class of lawmakers, Congressman Dave McIntosh. Please stay 
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I had the opportunity to speak with an influential 
House freshman, Congressman Dave McIntosh, Republican of Indiana.  Let's 
hear what he has to say about our country's year ahead.
<p>
Thank you very much for being with us today, Congressman McIntosh. You 
have been one of the most influential freshman Congressmen, and as
you look at this year ahead, what do you see coming up on Capitol
Hill?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  I think it is going to be a year
of challenges.  I represent Indiana, so I like to use the movie
Hoosiers as an example.  I think the freshman class are the small-town
team, the myelin players, and we are in the big leagues now for
the championship.
<p>
All the press is saying, &quot;Oh, they're bound to fail, they're bound 
to buckle and give up on their principles.&quot; But we are at halftime, 
and we are reassessing where we want to go, and everybody knows the 
fundamentals are there, and if we stick to what we told people we cared 
about in the last election, it will carry us on to victory, ultimately, if 
not before November then after November, because I think the American people 
want to see the changes that they voted for in the last election, less
government -- and even President Clinton has agreed with us on
that -- but even more than the budget and the tax issues, which
I think are important, they want to see a reaffirmation of the
family and of faith as being important in our public lives.
<p>
And so you are going to see next year a renewed effort to focus on
those issues and say it is time that we have a constitutional
amendment that will allow school prayer, that will allow freedom
of religion in our public lives.  It is time that we look at our
welfare program, not just as a budget matter but as a program
that is devastating families and driving people to divorce, driving
young children into a terrible family situation, and we have to
fundamentally get rid of that system and change it.
<p>
The other one that I am going to be looking at is the marriage penalty 
that is not only in our tax code but in also a lot of government pension
programs and benefits, where they tell somebody, &quot;Look, if
you were only divorced, you would be getting more money.&quot;
And to me that is just wrong to say to people, &quot;Because
you are married, you are going to be penalized.&quot;  It undermines
the family and the basic institution of marriage in our community.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Are you concerned that the budget debate will have
a negative effect on family issues?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think what you are seeing now is the freshmen who 
were new to Washington -- and I have enjoyed getting to know my colleagues.
They are so committed to the principles that they believe in.
A lot of them were not politicians.  You get people like Steve
Largent, who was a football player and had never run for office
before, did this because he believes in the future of the country.
That is typical of a lot of our colleagues.
<p>
They are determined to not back down on our promises, and what I think we need 
to do is say, &quot;Look, the President has stopped us from getting
to a balanced budget, but now we can get some of the things done.&quot;
The rest of it, we need to go back to the American people and
say, &quot;We took it as far as we can.  Give us another round
of support and we can, to use the Hoosiers analogy, we can win
the game in the end.&quot;  But it is going to take the support
of the people and the voters and people to get involved next year.
<p>
One of the things that I tell folks at home in Indiana -- because
they will come up to me and say, &quot;Hang in there. You're doing
what we sent you to.&quot;  I'll say, &quot;Thank you, and I need
you.  I need you to help me build support in the community, to
get out there and ring doorbells with me, talk to people, and
let the community know there is a plan to get us back on the right
track where we restore families, build strong communities from
the bottom up.  But it is going to take everybody, not just 40-some
members of the Congress or 200-and-some members of Congress but
everybody in the country to do that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The media and the people inside the beltway have really 
demonized the freshman class and blamed them for the impasse in the budget 
debate. What is your perspective on that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think, ultimately, that is a convenient excuse for 
people. There is one thing that has happened.  The media and the people in 
Washington don't really know what to make of the freshmen, because we are
not willing to paper over the differences and say we are balancing
the budget when we know we are not.  We are saying, &quot;At least
let's be honest.  If we're only getting half a loaf, let's tell
people that.&quot;
<p>
And so it has been hard for them to figure out how to work with us as a class. 
But I think, ultimately, you had Presidential politics coming into it. President 
Clinton, I think, did not want a balanced budget, so he vetoed the effort
we had.  Senator Dole, President Clinton views him with suspicion
because he is running for President.  And there were some larger
forces involved in it.
<p>
But, ultimately, we need to say, let's get what we can.  But if it isn't the 
real thing, if we haven't really balanced the budget, haven't given the 
families their tax cut, let's not paper that over but take it to the voters
in the election next year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, it has been interesting watching the budget debate. 
There have been a lot of kudos coming to the freshman class as having really 
advanced the discussion of a balanced budget, and then you have the 
<i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> and the pundits on 
Saturday and Sunday morning saying, &quot;You know, great advancement of the 
issues, but if you could just get rid of those tax cuts, we would all
be on the same page.&quot;  What is your response to that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: It is typical Washington, actually.  What has 
happened is, as the negotiations have gone, spending keeps going up every
step of the way, and what they are saying is, as you take more
and more for Washington's budget, let's get rid of the provisions
that help the family budget.  Put aside your tax cut that allows
the average family to get something out of this balanced budget.
<p>
We did some studies in my home town in Muncie on what the typical
family would benefit from the tax cuts.  They make about $25,000.
Oftentimes both parents will be working.  They have two kids,
and they would pay about a third of their money in taxes, either
to the Federal Government, to the state, or to local property
taxes.
<p>
If we had a $500 tax credit, instead of paying a third
or roughly about $8,000, they would only pay $7,000, and that
is a huge difference.  That is $1,000 that they don't have to
turn over in their paycheck.  It is a pay raise that they see
right away that, each week, adds up, and eventually, they are
able to save for their family and be able to have a better lifestyle.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Looking at all the issues on the table - we have
tax cuts, welfare reform, school choice, religious liberty --
what is your perspective on what the top three issues really are?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  I think you are going to see at this
point a balanced budget, an honest balanced budget, with the family
tax cuts, a religious freedom amendment that says we need to have
the ability to have prayer in school.  We need communities to
be able to have a creche scene at Christmas.  Our faith is important
to us, and you see that a lot in the freshman class, where people's
personal faith is what guides them, and they bring that forward.
<p>
And then I think the third major issue is in education.  A lot
of us would like to get rid of the Department of Education, certainly
get rid of Goals 2000.  But, fundamentally, on the positive side,
what we need to do is say that parents and communities can do
a much better job than bureaucrats in Washington, and we need
to allow parents to have the ability to guide and control education.
<p>
They are the ones who teach the values at home.  They are the
ones who need to have a school system that reinforces those values.
And working together with good teachers, we will be able to teach
our young people so they can be good citizens.
<p>
But if you have this Goals 2000 where you are not really teaching them, 
you say it is okay to misspell words - we are going to let you be creative
-- or you teach them values that are just wrong and simply not
what parents would want their kids to have, then the education
system doesn't work for us.
<p>
So those are the three main areas I think we are going to focus on.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you think is the untold story of the freshman class?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: A lot of us would like to get rid of the Department 
of Education, certainly get rids of Goals 2000.  But fundamentally, on the 
positive side, what we need to do is say that parents and communities can
do a much better job than bureaucrats in Washington, and we need
to allow parents to have the ability to guide and control education.
They are the ones who teach the values at home.  They are the
ones who need to have a school system that reinforces those values.
And, working together with good teachers, we will be able to
teach our young people so they can be good citizens.
<p>
But if you have this Goals 2000 where you are not really teaching them, 
you say it is okay to misspell words - we are going to let you be
creative -- or you teach them values that are just wrong and simply
not what parents would want their kids to have, then the education
system doesn't work for us.
<p>
So those are the three main areas I think we are going to focus on.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, what are you looking forward to in 1996?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think it is going to be a year where, in reality, 
we are ahead at half-time.  The President has said it is the end of the era
of big government.  Families count.  I am not sure he means it
totally, but he has said that and, basically, delivered a State
of the Union speech that could have been Ronald Reagan's.
<p>
I worked with Ronald Reagan for a while.  Probably the difference is 
Ronald Reagan would have meant it.  But it is nonetheless a consensus
now that we are moving in the right direction.  I am optimistic
that on some things we will be able to pass them in Congress and
the President will sign them.  Other things, I think, we will
have to once again, as I said, take it to the election.
<p>
But I have a lot of optimism about that, because I think you are going
to see a lot of people who started to get active in 1994, were
never that political, realize that the future of the country is
going to be at stake, and it is one of those times in our country's
history where we can renew government and set it on a new course.
<p>
The other thing that I am looking forward to is actually in 1997,
and it is not political at all.  It is the national Promise Keepers
meeting.  We had a regional event in Indianapolis at the Hoosier
Dome there, and you had 60,000 men coming together and reaffirming
their faith.
<p>
What I tell people is, this is a revival that can happen in our country. 
It is not government, it is not politics, but it is real because it is 
people in their own lives and in their own communities.  What we can do 
in government is make sure we stay out of the way, that we don't block that 
from happening. And I think that is going to be an exciting event for the 
entire nation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of 1996, after the election, will the story of 
this year's Congress be one of further realignment in a pro-family 
direction or of a swing back to the way that it has been, a little more 
politics as usual?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think it could go either way at this point. I 
think the fundamentals are there.  You have good leaders who stand up for 
family values. But the real critical decision is going to be on election day,
and I certainly hope that we have further realignment in a pro-family
way.  I think you will have a lot of politicians talking about
it.  The challenge will be to get people who say, &quot;That's
my first priority, is the family and reestablishing the family,&quot;
so that we can really realign the priorities here in Washington.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, thank you very much for being with
us.  Best of luck to you, and we look forward to seeing what comes
ahead.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: Thank you very much.  Congratulations
on all the good work you all do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at what Gary 
Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has to say on CNN's 
<i>Crossfire</i> almost one year ago regarding an issue which continues to 
permeate our country's political world, abortion.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. Gary Bauer has often had the opportunity to appear on
many network news programs, and it interesting to see that Gary
was fighting the same battles regarding the abortion issue on
CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> during an appearance almost one year ago. So
let's take a look at a brief news clip as Gary presents some thought-provoking
arguments. <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from CNN Crossfire, March 23, 1995, follows:]
<p>
MODERATOR: Gary Bauer, as a Democrat, I certainly
wish you every success in saddling the Republican Party with your
views on abortion.  But isn't Senator Specter right in saying
that you will help reelect President Clinton if you insist on
pushing the Republican Party to adopt your views?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Right.  Well, in all due respect to Senator Specter, whom I have
worked with on many occasions, including the confirmation of Clarence
Thomas, which I hope you are still very proud of, sir, I think
that Arlen Specter is wrong about that.
<p>
The great growth in the Republican Party since 1980 has been based on 
Reagan Republicanism. That is not a fringe.  It means small government, low 
taxes, a strong defense, family values, and the sanctity of life.  That's
the kind of Republican winning all over this country.  That's
the formula for victory.  That little office over at the DNC that
Lynn Cheney(?) talked about is an office that would love to see
us abandon that winning formula.
<p>
MODERATOR: Well, why not be just a little bit cynical?  I know you might not be 
up to this, but there are a lot of Republicans who would like the pro-life
forces within the party to just be a little bit cynical, a little
bit strategic, and lie low for a bit, as some are doing, as Ralph
Reed does on alternate weeks, and wait until -- you know, organize
your forces, as you do, and then wait until you have a Republican
President and a Republican Congress, if that happens, and then
pop back up and say, &quot;Now here we are.  Now let's call in
our chips.&quot;
<p>
MR. BAUER: You know, Mike --
<p>
MODERATOR: Wouldn't that be a cleverer strategy?
<p>
MR. BAUER: No.
<p>
MODERATOR: Since you must admit that abortion is more controversial within 
the Republican Party than small government, low taxes, and all those
other things you listed.
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think the American people are sick of clever. I think I may 
be unusual in Washington, D.C., but I don't believe in stealth candidates. 
I believe that candidates win when they state what they believe and state it 
with conviction and stick to it regardless of polls.  That is what worked 
for Ronald Reagan twice, and I believe that Ronald Reagan, four months
ago, won his third landslide victory when candidates that ran
on all of his philosophy swept into office all over this country.
<p>
Mike, I want to be really clear about this.  I believe the Republican
Party ought to have an open door to anyone who wants to walk in
the door.  But the party has to stand for something, and I believe
at that core --
<p>
MODERATOR:  Why should anyone vote Republican who believes that a woman's 
right to choose is important as you believe that a fetus' right to life is, 
if the Republican Party platform says that abortion is murder and should be 
illegal with no exceptions?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, the fact of the matter is that 60 percent of the 
American people in a poll just this week by the <i>Washington Post</i>, not 
a conservative newspaper, found that Americans either want, in the case of 27 
percent of them, an end to all abortions, or in the case of 33 percent more, 
restrictions on abortion.  You can win an election with that 27 percent and
the 33 percent that believe abortion on demand is a mistake and
needs to be restricted.
<p>
The fringe here is the position that the Senator takes, which is no 
restrictions at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with us to 
hear how you can get more information on Gary's book or the issues
affecting you and your family in the upcoming year.
<p.
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us at <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. If you would like to receive a copy of Gary's book, 
<i>Our Journey Home</i>, or more information about our guests or the topics 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will be celebrating Valentine's Day with a new slant
on what many consider to be true romance: abstinence.  Saving
sex for marriage seems to be an increasing trend, and we will
meet some people who will explain this not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon.
We hope you will join us again as we continue to bring you perspectives
not often seen in the media and exclusively seen here on <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight's
<I>Straight Talk</I> celebrates Valentine's Day by taking a look
at romance with a newly rediscovered twist.
<p>
When you think of romance, you may think of flowers, candlelight
dinners, and late night walks with that special someone.  In recent
years in our culture, it also means a night that ends with a sexual
encounter.  All too often this sexual experience takes place between
two people who don't share a lifetime commitment to marriage.
<p>
It may seem harmless, but tonight we'll talk to those who
don't think so as they share their personal experiences.  <I>Straight
Talk</I> will discuss the wave of abstinence that is sweeping
the country among teens and young adults who are looking for love
in all the right places.
<p>
But first, we invite you to hear from Gary Bauer, president
of the Family Research Council.  Gary has experienced many elections
throughout his years inside the beltway, and he shares with us
his views on the Iowa caucuses and how the results indicate what's
ahead in New Hampshire.  Although you've heard a lot of predictions
by now on what will happen between now and Super Tuesday, when
the Republican nominee will probably be known, Gary brings a unique
perspective from the pro-family frontlines as <I>Straight Talk</I>
takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thanks for being with us today on Behind
the Headlines.  It was interesting in the Iowa caucuses how prior
to the election everyone said that Dole had to have 30 percent
to survive.  Then he gets 26 percent, but it's the great unreported
story.  What's your take on why Dole's showing -- a poor showing
-- of 26 percent is so un-talked about?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I think, first of all, Kristi, the thing that
strikes me once again is just how bad the conventional wisdom
in Washington, D.C., is, and I say that as a person that obviously
works in this city and has been here a good long time, but the
pollsters and pundits, even those on the conservative side, really
get out of touch with the grassroots.  I think everybody thought
that Dole would do quite well in Iowa.
<p>
He did win, but it is, I think, an extraordinary warning
to his campaign that 26 percent of the vote in, what, his third
or fourth campaign in Iowa -- this is not a sign of strength.
Someone said &quot;many more victories like this, and he'll be
limping into San Diego.&quot;  So I think it is a sign that the
Dole campaign has some real challenges ahead and that he has to
deliver a much more aggressive and a much better message for the
future than he has been able to deliver so far.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Pundits agree that the race was for number
two.  Dole appeared to have one locked up; the question was how
big was his margin.  And then Buchanan wins the number two spot,
and nobody wants to talk about it.  Why do you think that is?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, Washington and the press corps generally
has an aversion to Pat Buchanan that is, I think, pretty obvious
to even the untrained eye.  It reminds me of this same aversion
that they had to Ronald Reagan.  People forget, you know, the
Reagan presidency was tremendously successful, and he is a beloved
figure in many ways now, but back in 1976, when he was taking
on Gerald Ford, people laughed at Ronald Reagan.
<p>
He was considered to be unelectable.  The Washington establishment,
including a good number of conservatives, thought that he was
splitting the party.  He was losing a lot of money.  He was in
debt.  He lost the first five primaries.  Even when the public
began to respond to him and he began to have success, Washington
and the press corps was in denial about him.  They still couldn't
believe that the American people responded to his message.
<p>
I was struck by the fact that Buchanan and Alan Keyes, the
only two candidates really aggressively promoting a pro-family
message, that if you put their two votes together in Iowa, they
would as a team, they would have won the Iowa caucuses.  So once
again, I think the message out there is that people are hungry
to hear about these issues and hear about them in a very articulate
and heartfelt way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  CNN reported in an exit poll that 42 percent
of the people who voted for Pat Buchanan said that conservative
values were the reason they chose him.  What do you think that
means for conservative issues as we watch this electoral cycle
unfold?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I think that if the party doesn't get the message
now, they'll never get it.  What these voters want, these new
voters that have poured into the Republican party in the last
15 years, is a candidate who is willing to speak with as much
passion about the right to life issue, about the family, about
protection of culture, et cetera, as much passion about those
things as they do about flat taxes and the budget deficit.
<p>
So far, a lot of Republican candidates have only talked about
the economic matters and then almost as a throwaway line have
said, &quot;well, yeah, and I'm pro-life,&quot; and so forth.
That might have worked 20 years ago in the Republican party.
It doesn't now.  People are hungry for this message, and I think
Buchanan's success will force the entire party to fashion a message
better than they've done up until now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you interpret Alexander's third place
win and the fact that he leaped over both Forbes and Gramm?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think Alexander is benefiting from sort
of the fact that he's not the other guys.  He hasn't engaged in
a lot of negative advertising.  He has conducted a pretty upbeat
campaign, and if voters got turned off by one individual or another
-- certainly many got turned off by the incredible negative advertising
Forbes has done -- Alexander was a place that they could turn
to and not really worry about being embarrassed about their vote.
Whether he has legs to make it through the next six weeks when
there is an incredible number of primaries and you really have
to start delivering a vision for the country is unclear at this
point.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was watching the pundits yesterday, and I
very much agreed with one who said that Forbes' fourth place showing
indicated that money can't buy everything.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Yes, you know, the Family Research Council doesn't
endorse candidates, but I must admit that personally I was pleased
to see that a candidate can't do well just because he can write
unlimited checks.  That is a disturbing thought to me, that somebody
can take $20 million or $30 million and buy a Senate seat or buy
a governor's race or buy the presidency.
<p>
I think at the end of the day the American people will want
more than good advertising.  They are going to want to know that
the candidate shares their values, and serious questions arose,
on the social issues about whether Steve Forbes shares those values,
in the last three or four days of the Iowa caucuses.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Here at the Family Research Council media office,
we get normally at least 100 calls a day, often more, and in the
last week the number one question asked of us, for you, Gary,
is how do you interpret Gramm's plummet so that he took only a
five place position in Iowa?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, if I was happy to say that you can't buy
the presidency, I was also very sad to see Phil Gramm's fall on
these hard times, as he clearly has in Louisiana and Iowa.  Senator
Gramm is a good and decent man.  I think that he probably miscalculated
about where the center of gravity is in the Republican party.
Gramm led the way defeating national health care.  He deserves
great credit for that.
<p>
He has been incredibly articulate on economic issues, but
I think he didn't understand or has not understood up until now
that on these social issues you have to address them.  You have
to convince the voter that you are committed to these things,
that you are willing to do something about them, and his inability
to do that opened the door for Buchanan and some of the other
candidates.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the themes that the media has not reported
and almost ignored exclusively is the common man theme of working
class Americans concerned for their families.  How will they support
them?  Where is the money going to come from?  Buchanan's numbers
show that in the last three primaries, but particularly in Iowa,
the majority of his supporters, almost 90 percent, made under
$70,000.  How do you interpret the common man theme in this electoral
cycle?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think there is.  You know, the Democratic
party demagogues these issues.  They take working men and women
who are really hurting, and they try to play class warfare over
it, and they try to suggest that a few more government bureaucracies
and a couple thousand more bureaucrats will make it all right,
and we all know that is foolish.  It hasn't worked.
<p>
But there are some in my party that are kind of cavalier
about this sort of issue.  They sound like they don't really care
that America's basic industries have had to downsize in the last
20 years, and they act sort of neutral over the question of whether
American companies start building their plants in places like
Mexico and China and so forth.
<p>
I grew up in a blue collar family, and I know how those people
think, what they strive for, what they care about.  A lot of those
people play by the rules.  They are the backbone of the country,
and I hope my party will fashion a message for them that is attractive.
I think Pat Buchanan is doing that, and I think that is why in
Louisiana and Iowa he did so well among voters making less than
$30,000 a year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Everyone is packing up and leaving Iowa today,
heading off to New Hampshire and around the rest of the country.
We should know in the next six weeks who is going to be the leader.
How would you advise candidates about getting legs, building
legs, taking their campaigns forward?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think for all the candidates the basic
message is this:  that the American people are interested in smaller
government and lower taxes, traditional values, the sanctity of
human life.  Mold those things together.  Put together again the
Reagan coalition that really won three landslide elections, two
Reagan elections and then George Bush on Ronald Reagan's coattails
in his first race.  Put that coalition together again, and that
is 55 to maybe 59 percent of the American people.  That is a majority
in any race, and it is the road to victory for the Republican
party.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for being with us today.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <I>Straight
Talk</I> discusses the new sexual revolution.  Stay with us to
hear why teens are committing themselves to abstinence.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In the beginning of the sexual revolution,
our cultural leaders, from liberal university professors to movie
stars, first questioned marriage, said love should be free, said
we didn't need that kind of commitment.  But free love turned
out to cost everything, from dreams of growing old with one faithful
partner to sometimes life itself.
<p>
So our society went looking for band-aids to cover the symptoms.
Sometimes a temporary fix came in new drugs for the latest twist
on sexually transmitted diseases, like chlamydia and syphilis.
Then came AIDS.  Now they are pushing condoms, saying sex should
be safe, but safe sex can be risky to your health and your heart,
and so the pendulum swings back.  Generation X polls indicate
a new revolution, a time for a love that is real and lasting and
pure, a love that sees sex as a celebration of two lives shared
together forever.
<p>
Are these ideas controversial?  They are the foundations
of Family Research Council's Save Sex for Marriage campaign, which
featured young adults who have committed themselves from this
day forward to save sex for a lifetime love in marriage.  The
campaign appeared in national magazines such as <I>Rolling Stone</I>,
<I>Seventeen</I>, and <I>Teen</I>, and the response isn't what
you may think.
<p>
Many young adults called and wrote FRC actually thanking
the pro-family organization for speaking for the growing number
of people who don't want to be a statistic of one night stands
and broken dreams.  Relationships are very important to the generation
which best understands the tragedies of divorce, fatherlessness,
and abandonment.
<p>
Today not everybody is doing it.  There is a resurgence toward
abstinence, in part because it is easy to see that so-called safe
sex isn't safe and it isn't enough.  In fact, in a recent survey,
84 percent of sexually active teenage girls said that the topic
they most wanted information on was how to say no to sex without
hurting the other person's feelings.
<p>
Research also indicates that the sexually active struggle
with the untold story of emotional ties difficult to break, and
in a sexually predatory environment, many people are looking for
a way out, as well as a way to tell a real love from a line.
<p>
Among America's youth, virgin is no longer a dirty word.
The new sexual revolution isn't about sex at all.  It is about
saving it.
<p>
As you can see, a whole new sexual revolution is afoot, and
to help us understand why, I am joined by Juliette Pierce, an
abstinence educator who created her own successful program called
Choices from the Heart; Mike Griffin, a high school teacher who
has implemented abstinence education for students at Bishop McNamara
High School; and Gracie Hsu, a Family Research Council analyst
who has studied teen sexuality and written a number of pieces
redefining today's sexual attitude.
<p>
Welcome to the show, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining
us.  I am in very sacred company here, the experts.  You all have
been looking at issues of teen sexuality for a long time, and
we were talking before the show started.  I had a sex education
program where we had to learn how much it cost and where we could
buy it and had pop quizzes on that kind of thing.  I imagine that
you all wouldn't want to see that taught in some of the programs
you are working with.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  No, you would not be getting that in Mr. Griffin's
sex ed course.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What would I be getting?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Well, I am teaching at a Catholic school, which
focuses on a lot of things from the Catholic teaching, but even
more specifically to the sex education issue, you get a values-based
curriculum.  The kids need to know the plumbing of sexuality in
the body; more importantly, they need to know how that relates
to their life.  Oftentimes kids do know some of the plumbing,
but when it comes to choices, they do not know them.
<p>
I'll give you an example.  The other day in my class, I had
a freshman who was telling us the ABCs of the female reproductive
cycle, and when asked the question &quot;how long is the entire
woman's menstrual cycle&quot; gave me the answer of four days.
Now there is a good chance from the numbers that this kid may
be sexually active, which, as I said to the girls in the class,
is a bit scary, that the kids do know the plumbing, but they don't
know the values, and they don't know some of the moral issues
that lay at the heart of human sexuality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you find that as well, Juliette?  You were
working with AIDS and HIV teaching.  Did you find as you were
looking at the mechanics of disease and sex that values was totally
missing?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  I did.  In fact, I talked to a group of youngsters
about don't you want to be involved with someone who loves you,
and the response that I got was what do you mean love?  I don't
want anyone to lie to me.  It was as though they would be insulted
if someone insinuated that there was love involved, because then
they would realize that that wasn't real at all, and they would
prefer the person be honest with them.  So there was a real lack
of values involved.
<p>
So what I try to do with Choices from the Heart is to talk
to them about why it is they choose to be sexually involved. 
What is the reason behind it?  So let's not treat the symptoms
by giving them ways to protect themselves, but let's talk about
how they can really do some introspection, look at the motivations
behind why they are sexually involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What would you say are the top one, two, three
reasons why kids are having sex and having it very young these
days?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Well, I can tell you that I've gotten a separate
set of responses from males and females.  From the females, the
answers range from trying to lay a foundation for a relationship,
trying to solidify a relationship, peer pressure, and then thirdly,
just wanting to feel grown up, and that was the way that they
were doing that.
<p>
The males, on the other hand, had a whole separate list of
responses.  Their responses ranged from peer pressure, feeling
like they were left out if the fellows, quote, unquote, knew that
they were not sexually active, to, you know, the whole idea of
being able to conquer someone and what that is about for them,
and then, lastly, probably just wanting to be involved in a relationship
and making it something that was very special between themselves
and that other person involved.
<p>
But if you will note from those top three responses, there
are very few areas where the males and females agree on the reasoning,
which was a real red flag to say to them, look, there are two
separate agendas being promoted here.  You know, who do you think
is going to win when both people have an agenda and they don't
share the same goals in being sexually active?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Common sense relationship skills.
<p>
Gracie, there is a lot of discussion on abstinence programs,
and we are certainly talking to two people who know how to run
a good one.  What does the research show about how do we help
kids restrain their sexual impulses?
<p>
MS. HSU:  Well, the number one reason why kids become sexually
active is because they don't have a good support base, or at least
that support base is collapsing.  So, of course, the best prevention
is to have two parents in the home who love the kids and who will
raise them with an expectation that they will save sex for marriage.
But beyond that, if there is sex education in the schools, which
we don't completely come down on, but if there is, then we want
it to be in abstinence-based programs, because those programs
have shown to work.
<p>
In complete contradiction, the contraceptive-based approaches
actually show that there is more sexual activity, more exposure
to sexually transmitted diseases, and an increase in teen pregnancy,
and that is not what we are looking for.  We are looking for success,
because what contraceptive programs do is that they make equivalent
not having sex the same as having sex as long as you don't have
any of these outcomes, and we know that when you have sex, even
if you don't get pregnant or get an STD, that you are going to
be suffering long-term with broken relationships, in marriage,
with a more difficult time to have sexual satisfaction, things
that really do impact kids' lives on a long-term basis.
<p>
But if I could just give a little pitch to some good abstinence
programs, for example, Best Friends, right here in the city, has
just done a recent evaluation, and it showed that only 1.1 percent
of all the girls that have been through this program have gotten
pregnant.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And this is a relational program, where you
pair girls up with an adult to provide a little more support.
<p>
MS. HSU:  Right, and there is also the positive peer pressure
that comes about, because they will say I'm your friend, and you
cannot do this, and I will hold you accountable.  And that's really
what this is all about, and we would like to see that kind of
thing replicated, because it really has to do with positive relationships.
If they have a good father figure, you know, or a good mom who
is willing to lay down the rules and hold them accountable, then
you know that you are going to have a far better -- not just in
terms of being abstinent, but a better kid in terms of character
development, being able to have self-control and self-discipline.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the people on the left say that the
reason why kids are getting pregnant is they just don't know enough
about condoms, and they are going to hand them out everywhere
we go; we're going to make them free; we're going to subsidize
them.  Ironically, we spend about $10 for every condom-based program
to any $1 or less than $1 on abstinence.  Do you find that kids
have heard of condoms?  You know, have they heard of contraceptives?
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, definitely.  Let me say one thing.  Teaching
in a Catholic school, there are a lot of things that may be different,
but in terms of teaching this issue, I don't think what I'm teaching
is anything different than could be taught in a public school,
and make no mistake about it:  from dealing every day with teenagers,
promoting condoms as well as the abstinence message sends a double
message.  You can't have it both ways.
<p>
I had one of my students last year who, when I described
Joycelyn Elders saying we want to teach abstinence but we also
need to teach them what to do in the back seat and that is using
latex condoms, you know, they said to me, they said, &quot;Mr.
Griffin, what are they saying?  They are saying on one hand, you
should be abstinent and wait until you're married, but on the
other hand here's a bunch of condoms.  You know, what are the
condoms for, to abstain with?&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
And the kids ask the questions.  We need to, as adults, realize
that they need some guidance, and that's why I could not agree
more with what Gracie said.  As a teacher, I know that ten times,
maybe a hundred times, more important than what I do is what goes
on in the home, and that's where the public schools might take
a lesson from the Catholic schools in which our job is to support
what the parents are being taught, and the parents want values
taught.
<p>
They don't want to turn their kids over to sex educators
and health educators in the public school who have their own agenda
and their own set of priorities for these kids.  They want values
taught to them, and even if parents may not have made all the
right choices themselves, they want something different for their
kids, and they want some help.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Juliette, you work with some kids that are
really troubled.  If the home is broken down, what do you think
a person like yourself can tell them?  We have about a minute
left.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  What I do is I talk to them about what their
goals and aspirations are.  What is it that they would like to
see in terms of their life, and then let's talk about the choices
that you're making right now and how that plays into your ability
to realize those goals and dreams and aspirations.  So even if
their home life is such that they really can't see any support
or reinforcement, but I'm saying to them I know that's what you're
seeing, but what about your life?  You have some degree of control,
and let's talk about how you can make the best choice.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  These are exciting programs.  Please join us
after the commercial break as we continue to discuss why young
people need to hear that saving sex is the best way to save themselves
from physical consequences and emotional heartache.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <I>Straight Talk</I>.  I am
joined again by two people who offer more to teens than the choice
of using or not using a condom, abstinence educators Juliette
Pierce and Mike Griffin, and we are joined by Rob Anderson, a
medical technician and body builder who was featured as a model
in the Family Research Council Save Sex campaign.  Thanks so much
for joining us, you all.
<p>
These guys are some professionals, Rob, but I know you work
with kids regularly and have used body building even to help meet
people and as an inroad.  What do you find when you're talking
to kids really helps them say I want to take control of my sex
life, as well as my physical life and my mental life.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, the thing I've found most important
is developing a relationship with the kids, getting to know them,
and I think the most important thing is credibility.  When they
know that you've taken a stand and that you have made a commitment
to abstinence and that you are doing the same thing that you're
talking to them about doing, they really appreciate and respond
to that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you find that it has called a more open
communication maybe than you were initially comfortable with to
kind of take that stand?
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, yes, it got real open.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
I really had no intentions of ever modeling for a poster
promoting abstinence or anything like that, and you know, when
people who knew that I took that stand asked me would you do that,
I thought, my goodness, but the opportunity presented itself and
I said if I'm really going to take a stand, I might as well take
the stand.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.  Very visible, too.
<p>
In your work, do you find people like Rob who stand up and
who is an athlete, does that make a difference when you see other
people, other adults, taking a stand?  Juliette, what do you find?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  It makes a tremendous difference, because I
can tell you that in the earlier part of actually introducing
Choices from the Heart, I felt like I was the lone voice crying
in the wilderness, and there were so many people who felt very
passionately that I was wasting my time.  So to see someone like
Rob say that, you know, I believe in this enough to go public
with it and to talk about it is very important, and I think youth
can identify with someone who they know is not too old to have
any fun.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.  Or want to, anyway.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Exactly, exactly.  And they say if this person
has made this decision, then maybe I should think again about
the choices that I've made.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Great.
<p>
Being in a faith-based school, Mike, I wonder if it is different.
Probably people assume there are lots of role models around.
What has helped support your efforts?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Well, it is definitely role models, and Rob
won't be leaving the studio today until he agrees to come to Bishop
McNamara to talk to my kids.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, yes, they need role models, and they do sort of assume
-- you know, we were talking before the show; a lot of people
assume Catholic school, all of a sudden these kids will have gotten
this education already, but they need role models, too.  They
need people who will walk the walk, and that is one of the things
that I have found helps the effectiveness of my program.
<p>
Some days I'll walk in there and I feel like I am fighting
every single cultural attitude out there, but the one thing that
I have is I'm walking the walk, and I can tell them this is what
I stand for, and kids today, if they need anything, it's someone
who will stand up for something.  In a society where so often
they see people bend their own morals just to fit whatever they
want to do with their life or their particular immediate goal,
to see someone who will stand up for values is something that
they will take with them forever, and that will make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We've been talking a lot about saving sex and
abstinence, and I think we have to emphasize that we are not talking
about people who maybe have never had sex.  We're talking about
people making a decision from today forward.
<p>
Rob, when you're talking to kids, do you see a lot of kids
discouraged, you know, saying I'm sorry, I had sex; I can't do
what you're doing; it's too late for me.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I've seen a lot of
kids like that.  I went to one group downtown, and this one girl
said, you know, &quot;I understand you're telling me that I have
a choice, but sometimes you get in situations where you don't
have a choice,&quot; and I was just devastated.  I mean, I didn't
feel like I could say anything.  But talking to those folks, I
always try to emphasize that it is from this day forward.  A commitment
to abstinence, like you said, isn't -- you can't commit to the
past.  You can only commit from this day forward, and hopefully
I can be encouraging to folks that way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Juliette, what do you say to the kid who says
&quot;look, I can't do it; it's too late for me&quot;?  What's
your response?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Well, I tell them from my own personal experience.
I tell them that at 22 I came to the realization that, you know,
I was tired of having my heart broken, and I realized that there
was a direct correlation between the amount of involvement that
I had in a relationship and my ability to recover after the relationship
was long over.
<p>
So what I do is I share with them that this is something
that you can do, and what you have to do is really make a decision
and then look at your lifestyle, look at the company that you
keep, look at the choices that you are making, and let all of
those things correspond or reinforce your decision to be abstinent
from this day forward.
<p>
So that means that if you are involved with someone and that
person has not taken the same stand, then chances are that that
relationship is going to go through quite a bit of tension, because
you are going to be fighting against, you know, someone who wants
to be involved with something that you don't.  So I encourage
them to involve themselves with individuals who are of like mind
so that they are already lessening the chances that they will
be faced with compromising situations, and to think through a
date.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, right.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  So if it means that John can't walk me to the
door tonight because long good-byes lead to early good mornings,
then John can't walk me to the door.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  And try not to spend a lot of time alone with
that person, because you know that chemistry alone is going to
cause you to interact with one another, but if you are in the
company of others and everybody is on the same page regarding
their commitment, then chances are you're not going to be involved
in those compromising scenarios.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, I have to say, in talking with my students,
some of the most powerful and persuasive moments when I can see
the benefits of abstinence come from those who may have been sexually
active.  I was in my classroom the other day, and I felt like
Rob; I felt like I wanted to break down when one of my 16-year-old
students looked at me and said, &quot;you know, being involved
in this game and in this lifestyle, sometimes it's gotten to the
point where I'll be talking and a boy will be talking to me, and
I'll even in the back of my mind ask myself, you know, why is
he messing with me?  Why is he even talking to me?  What's he
got on his mind?&quot;
<p>
I thought how sad to be 16 and so cynical, but how realistic,
too, and what the kids need to see is, as you said in the opening
piece, the sexual revolution, all of these great rewards that
are supposed to come from this type of living and from this activity
just don't cut it.  They don't happen.  They don't make it.  So
sometimes those kids who may have been in this situation can be
really powerful.
<p>
So I try to bring some of my seniors, maybe who have been
sexually active and who as a result of the course have chosen
abstinence, come back, talked to the younger kids, and tell them
I know, I've been there, and I can see why that's a lie; that
lifestyle, and those goals, and those promised rewards don't end
up materializing.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  The other piece of that, too, that I want to
add is that there's a misconception that intimacy means physical,
and one thing that I reinforce to them is you can be intimate
with someone and hold their hand, because intimacy is your willingness
to commit to knowing what's going on in my heart and what's going
on in my mind, and if you are willing to do that, then you can
look at me, and I'll feel as close to you or even closer than
if we were actually physically involved.
<p>
So let's look at what intimacy really is and the commitment
that it takes to get there and not just reserve it for something
that is physical, because truly that is where we have missed the
boat.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And in taking marriage out of the equation,
we've lost the fact that sex is the culmination of an intimate
relationship, not the evidence of it.
<p>
We don't have a lot of time left, but one thing that we've
looked at, and I wanted to see if you all agree with us.  So much
discussion of AIDS and death and the down, how sex can kill, as
the Family Research Council has looked at data, we've said, look,
it can't be all about death.  We're not telling them don't get
a disease.  We're telling them there is something good out there
if you have the skills and the self-confidence to wait for it.
<p>
Let's go around quickly before we get to the end.  Rob, what
would you tell kids in terms of why it's a joyful, enjoyable thing
to wait, rather than just the AIDS.  I mean, we know sex can kill.
What don't we know about how good it can be to have a more stable
relationship?
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, I'd say that I waited, and it was worth
the wait.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
I just got married this December.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Congratulations.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  And that commitment to save sex for marriage
is now a new commitment to stay committed to my wife for the rest
of my life, and I would just say that that commitment just yields
peace in my heart from knowing that I'm not bringing a whole lot
of baggage into my marriage relationship, and my virginity was
a gift to my wife on my wedding night, and it was a blessing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.
<p>
Mike, what would you say, the positive side?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, that's why I get really personal with
the kids.  I tell them, you know, the reason why I'm waiting is
so that when and if I get married I can look at my wife and say
I loved you even before I knew you, and I committed myself, and
if I want to go all the way with marriage, I want an all-the-way
way to celebrate it, and that is through sex in marriage, and
the rewards will come after that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's fantastic.
<p>
Juliette, what would you say, the positive?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  I would let them know that the choices that
they make today will give them the ability to make choices in
the days ahead, but if you don't make the right choices now, then
you don't have the ability to make the choices in the days ahead.
So to draw the correlation between the right now and then, and
every young person has goals and aspirations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Oh, yes.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  No matter what they are or how bizarre they
may be, they all have them.  And wouldn't it be great to know
that all of those possibilities are available to you and that
absent of something tragic, you have the ability to live out those
dreams.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I hope that people will call us to hear more
from you all.  Thank you so much for coming.
<p>
When we return, <I>Straight Talk</I> will bring you some
individuals who have committed themselves to saving sex for real
love.  They have their own unique reasons and experiences, and
you won't want to miss them.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <I>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</I>.  I would like to welcome some
very special individuals to our show, Kate Gilchrist, a young
woman who, although formerly sexually active, has committed herself
to saving sex for marriage, and Maggie Kuhn and Scott White, each
of whom are waiting to share themselves with their lifetime love
in marriage.  Thanks to you all for being here.  We really appreciate
your time.
<p>
We see a lot of discussion, especially in the world of numbers,
about Generation X and what people think and what people feel,
but you're the people everybody is really talking about.  How
do your peers see sex?  Do they think it's insignificant whether
or not sex takes place, or are they concerned about issues of
the heart?
<p>
Scott, how about you?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  I think a lot of kids think that sex is just
something that they can do in high school that there really aren't
any consequences with what happens afterwards.  They really don't
see the long-term effects of maybe a pregnancy or maybe an STD,
but it really just depends on what circle of friends that you
get into, with some kids getting involved with different things,
where you see some that completely stay away from sex and that's
not even an option, but other people just think of it as a casual
thing on the weekends.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that most people, Maggie, appreciate
the consequences?  Are they thinking about AIDS?  Are they thinking
about anything?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I think a lot of time people, especially high
school students, are just so excited about the freedoms that they
have in high school.  It's just getting older and knowing that
you're your own person.  I think a lot of times people don't really
think about the consequences, because they're so caught up in
doing what I want to do, and they don't really think about whether
or not this is what they want to do.  They're thinking about,
you know, what's great for right now, and they're not always thinking
about the long-term consequences.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think, Kate, that there's not enough
information out there, or do you think it's the way it's told,
or do people need more of a personal approach, someone to come
alongside.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I think that there is plenty of information
out there, and I think that it is an individual's own choice.
I think it is a lot the age that you're at in high school.  You
go through, like, this rebellious stage where it is easy to just
totally go against your parents, even if they talk to you about
it all.  I really don't think that a one-on-one would work.  I
think it really just depends on the individual itself, because
I know that I wouldn't have accepted a one-on-one from anybody.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What helped you make your decision to say from
this day forward I'm going to save sex for marriage?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I got sent away to a program for two years,
and I realized that God had really just taken me out of the whole
situation that I was in and placed me in a place that could just
help me get my priorities straight again, and when I was able
to come back home I was so different that I did not want to even
resort back to sex, because I realized how much God had just done
for me when he pulled me out of that whole situation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So in your circumstances, it would have been
faith that made a key difference.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  Yeah.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Among your friends who are saving sex, what
do you think is making a difference?  What's helping people make
that kind of decision?  Scott, what do you think?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  I think that a lot of kids, really, they don't
want to see sex as -- it's the ultimate gift that you can give
your husband or your wife, and that's just something that you
can really -- that's the one thing that you can hold onto and
that nobody else can take away, and it's really your decision,
because a lot of things in this world, you really can't count
on, and that's one thing that you know that you can have and that's
going to be your decision to give up or not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What about you, Maggie?  What do you think
is helping people when they make a decision to save sex?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I think it's very much a personal conviction.
I think you hear so much about sex in our society.  It's so common.
It's just something you have to decide on your own, and I think
for most of my friends and for myself, I think it's just having
faith in God's plan and knowing that sex is perfect when it's
within marriage, and you just have to wait, and you know, it's
hard to wait, because we're all human.  We want immediate answers,
and we want immediate intimacy, and sex seems like such an easy
way sometimes, but really it works in the opposite direction,
and when you really wait, sex is just created for marriage, and
that's how it's the best.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you all are talking about a lot of people
have to make up their own minds, but Scott, you're on a council
in your high school to kind of bring some abstinence-based programs
in. Do you think a peer group approach works better?  What motivated
you?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  A lot of kids -- the council is just a student
advisory council, and they're basically what Fairfax County, which
is the high school system I go to -- they're using that as a forum;
they're now using abstinence as an option, whereas before it was
more geared toward safe sex.  Most people are just really -- the
approach they are trying to do is just a peer-based group, and
they are trying to use peers as saying, look, this is going to
be an option instead of just worrying about safe sex, or no sex
at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you guys think about the culture that you
live in, you know, the movies, the music, is any one thing more
difficult to take than any other?  Where does the most pressure
come from in terms of kind of saying, hey, it's no big deal, have
sex, whatever?  Maggie, what is your impression?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I can't really single out one specific type of
media or one specific area of our culture.  I think it's all over,
and that's what is so overwhelming is that it's not just one area.
It's not one thing you can turn off.  It's everything.  It's
in music.  It's in television.  I mean, you read about it all
the time, and that's what is so overwhelming is that our society
just -- it's just common.  You know, having sex before marriage
is seen as totally normal, whereas saving yourself until you're
married is just -- well, it's not spoken of, really.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It really isn't, is it?  Kate, now that you've
made even a chance of plan, are people respecting your change?
Are they saying great job?  What's the response of people?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  A lot of people at my high school -- it's
a public school, you know, not a lot of Christians around there
-- they don't understand why I can't have sex, as long as when
I get older it's not as it is now, you know, just a lot of different
people and stuff, and people at my church and at youth group where
we go to, they really accept it and they just think that it's
great, and I'm really affirmed by that, and there are people at
school that, you know, they're, like, that's just amazing that
you can do that, you know.  It's hard.  It seriously is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Where do you think some of the biggest pressure
comes from, if you kind of look -- is it the whole pile-on of
the culture?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I think it's everything.  I think that there
is a lot of peer pressure in the schools, and not only in the
schools, in the music that you listen to.  I know I listen to
a lot of R&amp;B and stuff, and every song that you pretty much
hear, every slow song, is about, like, somebody's legs or having
sex with somebody, and seriously it is, and it's just like, whoa,
what does that put in my mind, and t.v. shows like <I>Melrose
Place</I> and <I>90210</I> and just shows like that.
<p>
I mean, it's just like relationship, relationship, having
sex with one person and another.  It's just crazy stuff, and it
just all really just fills up your mind.  I think it's how much
you accept it and how much you watch that stuff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sure.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  Like, I just choose not to watch those t.v.
shows.  One, my mom won't let me, but, two, I just choose not
to, because I see a reason why.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How can any of you defend yourself?  You've
made a decision.  You know, what do you do to defend yourself,
maybe, from the culture or even from the peer group that might
say, you know, hey, it doesn't matter.  Scott, what can you do?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  Well, I think it's really like Maggie said before.
It's a personal conviction, and that is just the basis, I think,
of my walk and knowing God's plan for me.  He knows that whatever
happens, if I'm supposed to get married or not, that He has just
called me, and He has just said I'm not supposed to have sex right
now, and that's just one of those things that you just kind of
take to heart and you just really think about, that you don't
really have -- that is not an option for me right now to worry
about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have very little time left.  Maggie, I'm
going to let you close us out.  What advice would you give someone
who is kind of struggling right now?  How would you encourage
them to make the kind of decisions that you three have so courageously
made?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I would just say to just step out for a second,
step out of your life and look in and look at what you're doing
and really, you know, question your actions.  I think so often
people just act without thinking, and when you really get down
to it and think about having sex before marriage, it honestly
doesn't make sense.
<p>
I just think so many people if they just took a step back
and actually looked at what they were choosing to do, whether
it be just like a quick decision or even if they think, okay,
well, I really love this person, I think they really need to just
stop and think about what they are deciding and remember that
sex is a lot more than a physical thing.  It has emotional ties.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's really personal.
<p>
Thanks a lot.  Thank you for joining me, and when we come
back, there will be more <I>Straight Talk.</I>
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>.  FRC staff is often asked by the media to
present their views on issues affecting families today.  In December,
Cathy Cleaver, FRC's Director of Legal Policy, gave her view on
the increasing cyberporn threat.  So let's take a look at an excerpt
from an <I>NBC Nightly News</I> cyberporn story as <I>Straight
Talk</I> brings you some Homefront News.
<p>

<p>
[Segment from <I>NBC Nightly News</I> follows:]
<p>
MS. PAULEY:  A different kind of government shutdown in the
news tonight.  What happens when smut and freedom of speech collide
on the Internet?  Today Americans who use the CompuServe on-line
service found they were subject to another country's rules.  Here
is NBC's Fred Francis[?].
<p>
MR. FRANCIS:  Because CompuServe has a global reach, it says
it was forced to block -- some say censor -- access to 200 sexually
explicit discussion groups on the Internet to appease a German
prosecutor who found the material pornographic.
<p>
In the dark alleys of cyberspace, where pedophiles can prey
upon very young children, it is common on the Internet for sexual
predators to roam free.  This man was charged and convicted for
luring children through the home computer.  Even adults are often
enticed by raw and raunchy pictures and text.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  It's going to take laws like Germany has, saying
we are not going to tolerate child pornography; CompuServe, stop
serving it to your subscribers on a silver platter.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  <I>Straight Talk</I> continues after the break.
Stay with us to hear how you can get more information regarding
the issues and trends affecting you and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <I>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</I>.  If you would like
to receive more information about our organization, tonight's
guests, or the topics discussed, call us at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will be discussing one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?  We hope
you will join us next week to find out as we continue to bring
you a unique pro-family perspective not often heard in the media
and exclusively seen here on <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> asks who 
holds the right to raise our nation's children today.  Inherently it is 
the parents' rights to decide their children's upbringing and education, but 
these essential rights are being challenged across America.
<p>
For example, just last summer Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Earls[?] were refused the 
right to the results of AIDS tests and cervical cancer tests given to
their 13- and 15-year-old daughters.  Who held back those results?
The same Georgia middle school that condoned a counselor driving
the girls to a health clinic during school hours where they were
tested, given condoms, and prescriptions for birth control pills
without their parents' knowledge.  We will find out why this scenario
is becoming increasingly common and how some are attempting to
combat increasing government control over our children's lives.
<p>
But first, let's hear about the current buzz in Washington and
across the country about the first Republican primary.  I had
the opportunity to discuss the Iowa and New Hampshire results
with Family Research Council's Bob Morrison, who is special assistant
to Gary Bauer.  Bob provides insights into what the primaries
mean to you and what they could mean to our country's upcoming
elections.  With Super Tuesday just around the corner, you probably
won't read Bob's perspectives in your local newspaper or hear
it on your favorite newscasts.  So stay with us as <i>Straight Talk</i>
takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, thank you so much for being with us here on Behind the 
Headlines. A lot of attention is being paid to Iowa and New Hampshire right
now.  Is that attention deserved?  Historically, have these states
been make or break?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Sure they have.  They are very, very important throughout 
their history.  It is a way for a system that has grown large and unwieldy 
to sort of break it down into a manageable size, Iowa being part of the Midwest, 
New Hampshire representing sort of the flinty Yankee tradition.  They are 
still states where you can do politicking on a retail basis, at least
until this year, where it wasn't always a question of how many
ads can you throw up on television but how many people can you
meet in lodge halls and church basements and high school auditoriums.
How many people can you just go to a meeting among farmers? 
So both states are manageable, and that is why they play a critical
role.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think there is something special in
the mix of midwestern practicality and family values and the northeastern
frugality that makes it really important that we be in those two
particular states, or do the candidates really illuminate themselves?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Well, there is a conservative bent, in that sense.
In the Republican caucuses and primaries in those states, there
is a tendency toward a more conservative side, which the Republican
party has seemed to represent over time.  In the Democratic party,
that is not necessarily the case.  In the Democratic party, some
notable liberals have done well in Iowa and in New Hampshire.
So those are critical points.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How have they evolved in importance?  Well, in this year in 
particular we have had what is called a front-loading of the primary and 
caucus system, so that candidates have really been out there campaigning 
furiously for well over a year.  Some of those candidates who announced
for president in the Republican side announced six months to nine
months earlier than they typically did in years past.  There is
going to be a fury of campaign primaries -- mostly primaries from
this point on -- between now and the end of March.
<p>
So it is very possible by mid-April, by tax time, we may see a winner emerge
who has amassed more than half of the delegates that are necessary
to be nominated on the Democratic side and on the Republican side.
Now it is assumed that President Clinton has no opposition, no
declared opposition, that they will just sort of routinely go
through the motions and he will wrap up the victories he needs
to assure his renomination.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One rather schizophrenic criticism of the process is that on the 
one hand Iowa and New Hampshire make really liberal Democratic choices and on 
the other hand very conservative Republican choices.  Is that fair?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  The activists in both parties tend toward being liberal
in the Democratic party and conservative in the Republican party.
That is the tendency.  Now we all know that there are well-known
conservative Democrats:  Governor Casey of Pennsylvania, Sam Nunn
of Georgia.
<p>
There are conservatives in the Democratic party; there
are liberals in Republican party:  Arlen Specter, Governor William
Weld.  So to the extent that these folks still get elected in
various offices, you cannot say that the parties are monochrome,
they're all one thing or all the other.  But this is the first
opportunity to bring out some of those seething activists who
have been waiting to get in there and pitch in every four years,
the people who may have a terminal case of Potomac fever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Every political year, people like to complain about
the limited choices available to them, and yet the political process
does seem to continue.  How have some of our greatest leaders
fared in the Iowa and New Hampshire process?
<p>
MR. MORRISON: They are relatively modern vintage, so basically Ronald 
Reagan, as I mentioned, did not do well in Iowa in 1980, came smashing 
back to beat not only George Bush but Bob Dole and a host of other
contenders in 1980, and Reagan was basically the man to beat after
the New Hampshire primary.  In 1984, the New Hampshire primary,
the Republicans, Reagan was just renominated.  There was no contest
really.  But for the Democrats it was a very big fight, and that
is when Gary Hart came forward.
<p>
As far as presidents who have been elected, as I mentioned, Reagan did 
well in New Hampshire. We also had Carter doing well in the Iowa caucuses. 
Carter came on to win the New Hampshire primary in 1976.  Bush, of course,
coming out of New Hampshire in 1988, captured the nomination and
went on to win the election.
<p>
A key New Hampshire contest was four years ago for Bill Clinton.  Bill 
Clinton was in serious trouble in his candidacy.  There were stories about 
draft evasion. There were stories about womanizing.  He was in very, very 
serious political shape, but he was able to score a number two slot.  He did 
not win the New Hampshire primary.  Neighboring Senator Paul Tsongas,
former senator from Massachusetts, actually won, but this is that
expectations game.
<p>
Clinton was able to come up so close to Tsongas in New Hampshire that 
he virtually came out and proclaimed himself the comeback kid and 
essentially was able to reenergize his campaign coming out of New Hampshire. 
In a short period of time, people thought that Clinton had won New Hampshire.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Prior to the influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, most political 
candidates were chosen by party bosses in the back room.  Now we have this
more democratic approach, Iowa and New Hampshire, I think, very
powerful in that.  Are we better served today by electing our
candidates in primaries or by the old system?
<p>
MR. MORRISON: If you had a national primary, then the other things that 
people don't like, the concentration on money, would only be that much
more intense.  You would have to raise huge amounts of money to
mount a campaign nationwide.  Even as we have it, with what's
left of Super Tuesday, several southern states holding primaries
on the same day, as we come out of New Hampshire you are going
to see that a lot of people have to raise a huge amount of money
very quickly.
<p>
The odds will then tend to favor those who have already raised a huge 
amount of money. President Clinton obviously is in good shape for 
fundraising.  Senator Dole is in good shape for fundraising.  But it 
is not absolute.  The interesting thing is what these states do in spite of 
big money, and the example that we have this year is the fate of Senator Gramm.
<p>
Senator Gramm once said that he had the best friend in politics that you 
could have, ready money, and he had said that you needed to have $20
million to even get into this game.  He didn't even get to the
first primary, and that's not the only time that has happened.
Texas Governor John Connelly, former Secretary of Treasury, he
raised a massive amount of money in his campaign -- I believe
it was close to $10 million -- back in 1980, and yet Governor
Connelly did not survive this Iowa and New Hampshire winnowing
process.  So basically what Iowa and New Hampshire do is not so
much to give us the nominee but kind of tell us who has been culled
from the pack.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Well, Bob, as you and I are sitting here talking, people 
are actually voting in New Hampshire. So when the people are watching 
this <i>Straight Talk</i> episode, already the results will be known. What 
would you tell those people who are already aware of what happened?  How 
could they interpret the events?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Well, just basically don't lose heart,
be engaged, make your wishes known.  If you are happy with the
outcome, stay with it.  Encourage other people.  We have had too
much disaffection and cynicism in our political system.  It is
not an ideal system, but as Winston Churchill said, democracy
is the worst system except for all others that have been tried.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being with us on <i>Straight
Talk</i>.
<p>
MR. MORRISON: My pleasure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> delves 
into why parents' rights to make and influence key decisions in their 
children's lives are slowly diminishing. Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am now joined by Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Policy 
for the Family Research Council.  Cathy's extensive research into
the parental rights issue has led her to some interesting court
cases currently being battled across the United States.  Also
joining me is Paul Webster, a legislative assistant to Congressman
Steve Largent of Oklahoma who introduced the Parental Rights and
Responsibilities Act of 1995.  Welcome, both of you, to the show.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Cathy, you have been tracking this issue for a while, and 
for others it might seem self-evident. Okay, we care about parents. We 
think they should be in charge of their families.  But what has brought us 
to the point where we are actually looking for legal outcomes?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, we are just recently seeing an increasing, I feel, 
arrogance on the part of government in protecting children from their 
parents. We have seen it at the U.N., in the rights of the child, and
now we have seen it increasingly in our country.  The most evident
examples are the condom distribution programs, where condoms are
given to children as young as 11 or 12 years old, even over their
parents' objections.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And even in New York, the New York state court ruled that 
the parents could have no say.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  Well, New York, we were lucky in New York two years
ago.  New York said, no, this does violate parental rights, but
just last month the Massachusetts Supreme Court case saying parents
have no rights in this regard, children will be given these condoms,
even if parents object, was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court.
So now we have a terrible situation in Massachusetts where parents'
rights were simply dismissed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So having conflicting cases, Massachusetts and New York, does 
that drive it towards the Supreme Court, do you think?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Perhaps eventually. That's what we thought would drive it to 
the court this time, but they said no.  I am sure there will be other cases, 
and we will be working on cases to take it up to the court to resolve
this, because there is precedent at the court.  The court has
said that parents have this right and that the right shouldn't
be infringed.  So it's not anything new that we are searching
here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Paul, wasn't the condom distribution kinds
of cases that perked your attention and Congressman Largent's
attention, or were there other things that made you think we need
to get involved legislatively?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Well, what our interest was was a desire to support and protect 
America's families.  Congressman Largent came to Washington with really an 
agenda that was two-fold: one of them which focused on fiscal matters, 
balancing the federal budget; the other one specifically was to support and 
garner some kind of governmental, I guess, inactivity or limits on the 
government to the kinds of things that are going on that many families across
our country feel are threatening or infringing their ability to
just live the way that they live, live the way that they were
brought up, those types of interests.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Give us an example, you know, some issues that you all were 
looking at and saying I think the line is getting a little fuzzy here, and 
it shouldn't be.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Well, I think it's very clear.  I was asked a question, 
&quot;well, I have kids, and are you telling me that all these government 
interests are trying to break down my door and do terrible things between 
my children and I?&quot; My response is I don't think that anybody is 
proactively targeting your family to go after and make some kind of mischief.
<p>
What we hear in our office are families that are going about their 
business attempting to raise their children the way that they raised or
the way that they think that their conscience dictates and finding
that just in the normal course of day-to-day activities, either
through a school or through some other government agency, that
they are now prohibited from just confronting their educators
and saying, hey, listen, I take great pains to instill in my children
things that we believe in and values that are important to us,
and we would really appreciate it if you didn't contradict us
through whatever means that you are doing so now.  And those kinds
of reasonable actions are the kinds of actions that many times
across the country have been halted and really given families
very little recourse in terms of what they can expect and what
kind of support they can expect from the government.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it has been particularly sensitive on issues like sex 
education, condom distribution, and the discussion of values that might 
come up in, say, outcome-based education, where we are going to define
diversity as a value and then maybe bring in issues regarding
homosexuality that might have a different moral perspective than
parents.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  The school is very often the setting for
these kinds of violations of parental rights.  Psychological counseling
that parents don't want given to their children but that is given,
regardless of the objection, that is another big area, but even
outside the school, child protective services sometimes have come
into the home -- in fact, I shouldn't say sometimes, more often
that we would like -- come into the home and removed children
on mere rumor or on things as benign as spanking of a child. 
Now that doesn't happen every day, but it's happening with increasing
frequency, and that is sounding an alarm for parents.  You know,
we should be able to discipline our children with reasonable corporal
punishment, for instance.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.  You know, I think one thing a lot of people aren't 
aware of is that the Children's Defense Fund, a very liberal so-called 
pro-child group, formerly headed by Hillary Clinton, has advocated that no 
child be allowed to come home from the hospital until a social worker has 
been there first.  What other big picture, you know, big picture new
world order kind of intrusions do you see proposed by people?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, the children divorcing their parents.  There's
another key example, I think maybe derived from the same group.
We have a case out of Washington State that people have looked
at for some years and have been frustrated about where parents
were trying to protect their child from drugs and from sleeping
from her boyfriend.  This is a minor child, and that child wanted
to file for divorce, and social service agencies came in and said,
no, you child, your rights are being trampled on by your parents.
So we are going to protect you from your parents.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I know, Cathy, you've taken a look at the U.N. convention, 
and one of the concerns of people who want to strengthen parental
rights is that talks about the child's free right of association,
maybe to associate with drug dealers or to associate with people
who they are concerned about.  I think everyone appreciates in
their own life their parents saying that person you cannot hang
out with any more.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Beyond even that is the uninhibited right to receive any 
information or any speech or material that the child wants, including 
specifically pornography.  It's ridiculous. I mean, the U.N. is so far 
out of touch, but the scary thing is that U.N. principles are being forced 
upon our country against, I believe, our citizens' will.  President Clinton 
in 1994 signed the U.N. treaty on the convention on the rights of the 
child. It needs to be ratified now, and we are urging the Congress not
to ratify this for that reason alone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  I think there are really two dominant perspectives on
this whole issue.  One of them is very child-centric, that is,
whatever it takes to enhance and maintain the welfare of the child,
and the other one is a, in my perspective, much more common sense
approach, and that is our country was founded on freedom.  It
was founded on the right to be peculiar, if you will, antiquated,
progressive.
<p>
We have a society that is a free society and whose government was 
established to maintain that freedom, regardless of how it manifests 
itself, and so we are seeing the notion, the concept of freedom being 
held hostage by this idea that we have to protect specific and certain 
segments of our population no matter the cost, even if it costs us our 
freedom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Paul, what is the status of the legislation right now?  Where
is it?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  Well, we are very happy to see a Senate companion
to our House bill.  That is S-984.  The House bill is HR-1946,
and both chambers, the Senate and the House, have conducted subcommittee
hearings where witnesses have testified on behalf or in opposition
to the concept of the right of parents to direct the upbringing
of their children.
<p>
Right now we are working with organizations, the Family Research Council 
and other organizations, to get exact precise types of language that 
allows the courts very little wiggle room in terms of how to interpret 
the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children.  We have 
128 co-sponsors on the House side.  So we are very excited about that, and 
we are looking forward to a subcommittee market scheduled where they'll
entertain amendments or changes to the bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Great. We are going to want to hear more about that after the 
break, and Cathy, thank you so much for being with us.  I would certainly
encourage anyone to call the Family Research Council for some
of Cathy's excellent materials.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the rights of parents as we are
joined by those who are on the forefront of this issue.  Stay
tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Segment from Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act Press Conference 
follows:]
<p>
MR. LARGENT: Currently there is an imbalance between who makes the decisions 
in the home between parents and the government as you can see represented here 
on our balance.  Parental rights.  I think this is a graphic representation
of what we're talking about.  American families in the balance.
<p>
Currently, parental rights, even though they have been recognized
as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court, by lower court decisions
time and time again all across the country, the lower courts do
not recognize parental rights as a fundamental right.  What we
do with the parental rights bill is codify into law a federal
statute that parental rights are a fundamental right and should
thereby have the same protection as any other fundamental right.
<p>
Today, because of the imbalance or misinterpretation of Supreme
Court ruling, parents must demonstrate that the government has
acted unreasonably in order to prevail.  Government must demonstrate
that it simply has acted in a reasonable fashion in order to prevail
in court cases where their parental rights have been usurped.
<p>
There are four specific areas that we address in the Parental
Rights and Responsibility Act.  That is the right of parents to
direct the upbringing of their children in regards to their education,
their religious training, their medical care, and the discipline
of their own children.
<p>
We'll go to the last chart, and then I'll introduce Greg Erken with Of The 
People. This is what we want to see as a balance between government and 
family in terms of who directs the upbringing of our children.  After the 
Parental Rights bill is passed, we will find a situation where parents
must demonstrate first that the case is about a parental right,
again, one of those four areas that I addressed, and that the
government has intervened in their parental rights.  This is the
four-step process that we are putting in place with the parental
rights bill.
<p>
Then the last two steps, the onus is really on the
government to show that there was a compelling governmental interest,
not a reasonable cause or a reasonable interest, but a compelling
governmental interest existed and it used the least restrictive
means.  This test is applied to all fundamental rights protected
by the Constitution.
<p>
We are not erecting a new test here. We are simply saying that what the 
Supreme Court has decided over the last 70 years in terms of parental 
rights being a fundamental right, that this is the standard that should be 
applied and is the accurate standard that the Supreme Court has already 
decided, and we are simply placing that in federal statute.  So that is
the heartbeat, the guts, of the Parental Rights and Responsibility
Act. That is what we are trying to do.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: I'm Executive Director of Of The People, which is a coalition 
of parents, state legislators, and grass roots activists working at the state 
level to add a parental rights amendment to state constitutions.  Our
efforts at the state level are working in tandem with the federal
efforts here represented by this legislation to guarantee the
rights of parents.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  We find it confusing and alarming that so much of government 
today seems determined to relieve of us of our parental responsibilities 
and rights, especially concerning education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you can see, it seems the parental rights battle has 
begun at the federal level.  I am joined again by a key player, Paul 
Webster, legislative assistant to Congressman Steve Largent. Also 
joining us is Greg Erken, Of The People's executive director, and 
Rebecca Bocchino, a parent who became fed up with her children's education 
and began to research why her fight to change things seemed so hopeless. 
<p>
Thank you for being with us.  Greg, your group has been working at the grass 
roots level to get behind this piece of legislation.  How is that working,
and why did you get involved?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, Of The People has been working for about two years now, as 
you say, at the state level working to add a parental rights amendment to 
state constitutions, and we are also working with Paul and Congressman Steve 
Largent's, who is Of The People's national vice-chairman, in support of the
federal statute.
<p>
Just as some of your other guests have said and
will say, we got into the fight because it seems in so many areas
parents across the country are running into what we call a we
know what's best mentality for your children, whether it's condom
distribution or the resistance to school choice and vouchers,
psychological counseling or the threats to the rights of homeschoolers,
I would connect the dots and say that there is an overall assault
against parental rights and responsibilities, and we need to directly
counteract that at the federal and state level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, it's interesting that you have the right to make 
decisions for your parents unless it's different from a judge or a social
worker, it would appear.  I mean, your rights go as far as their
judgment would take you.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Yes, that's right.  I think what parents are facing now is 
occasionally they are allowed by our kind bureaucratic elites to actually 
oversee their children and their children's decisions once they leave the 
house, but we need to reverse that decision, that attitude, and we need to
make sure that parents in the vast majority of cases are in charge,
and it's the schools and other bureaucratic shops that should
ask the parents can we teach your children this, and how about
this?  Would that be okay if your child was in such-and-such a
class?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Exactly. Rebecca, you are a parent.  I know
that there were some parents that led you to say, you know, this
has been frustrating.  I need to make some changes.  What happened
in your own family situation?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Well, we thought we had moved to one of the best school 
districts in the nation. Fairfax County, Virginia is one of the largest 
school districts in the nation, and we thought we were coming to a place 
where our kids would get the best education that they possibly could,
only to find that most of the decisions were made by the school,
and we found the process of involving parents was so manipulative
that parental input actually was changed to parental reaction,
and I noticed my kids were coming home with more and more intrusive
questions, more intrusive curriculum.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Give us an example.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Guidance counseling, use of journals, sex education. I 
mean, Fairfax County is full of it, and the more questions that I asked, 
the more I was treated like the enemy and the more hostile reaction I got. 
<p>
The guidance counseling manual in Fairfax County goes into great detail in 
instructing counselors how they can stiff-arm parents from getting 
information about what their children are being counseled on, even though 
the manual admits that parents have the right to know, and two parents in
Fairfax County asked through a FOI request, a Freedom of Information
request, to know what was done with their children, and they were
told that it would cost them $600 to find that information out,
and that is unbelievable.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And that is already taxpayer funded. I mean, they are paying 
for the education the children were receiving.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Sure.  And parents found their kids were being exposed 
to psychotherapeutic techniques. Two programs that have received the 
most criticism nationally, Pumsy[?] and DUSO, were both on the approved 
materials list in Fairfax County.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, so people understand, these are sort of dream fantasy 
projection kind of things.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Give them a little detail on what Pumsy, for example,
would do.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Pumsy used guided imagery.  One of the
exercises involved tying up the teacher and blindfolding the teacher
in the middle of the classroom.  These exercises were designed
to teach students that they could retreat into their own mind,
into their own world, that they were the sole authority.  All
information could be obtained within.  Parents found their children
were taking psychotropic trips in the back of the family station
wagon, just self-induced hypnosis whenever they felt like it.
Even though counselors denied that they were using these techniques,
they lobbied hard in the general assembly not to ban the use of
psychotherapeutic techniques in the schools.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. What are you seeing, Greg?  What other kinds of 
stories? I mean, the majority of the stories seem to come from the schools, 
where taxpayer money is presumably helping our children, but they are
not going to tell us what they are doing to help.  What else are
you seeing?
<p>
MR. ERKEN: Well, I think one of the classic kinds of cases that we see 
nowadays is condom distribution in the public schools, and parents are 
opposing not just the condom distribution, per se, but the fact that 
they are being handed out to their minor children over and against their 
consent, and there have been a couple of legal developments in the past 
couple of years that point out the need, why we need additional legislation 
for parents.
<p>
Parents in New York City a couple of years ago successfully sued
to get an opt-out in New York City for condoms.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now an opt-out, you have to explain that.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: Sure. A parental opt-out is a provision whereby a parent 
doesn't have the ability to stop the distribution period in the schools 
but does have a mechanism to make sure that their child either, say,
does not receive a condom or at least the parent is notified before
their child receives a condom from the school nurse or whatever
the mechanism is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  While an opt-in program would be parents saying, yes, 
please give my children condoms; here's my written consent, like the same 
thing a parent would do to go on a class trip.  Yes, my child can go, rather 
than my child only can't go if I say no.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  That's right.  In a lot of ways an opt-in is preferable, because, 
after all, aren't we trying to get parents more involved with their child's 
upbringing and in the public schools.  Shouldn't we kind of fight the couch 
potato mentality that allows parents, after all, just like the rest of
us with human nature -- it's too easy to go on autopilot and to
say someone else will make the decisions for my children.  Let's
have parents make those decisions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Paul, you're on Capitol Hill.  What has been the response to 
congressmen and senators when you come with these kinds of horror stories. 
I mean, are they interested in the fact that parents like Rebecca
are being told it's none of your business what happens with your
money or your children?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Their response is really surprising.  The first response is 
are you serious? Are you telling me that some parent in Georgia has to fight 
in order to not allow the school to take their daughters to a county health 
facility without their knowledge or without their consent?  They say are
you serious that kids in Massachusetts were exposed to blatantly
offensive and sexually explicit materials in the school assembly?
Are you serious that tests are asking things like are there handguns
in your house; are your parents on welfare?  You know, when was
the last time you masturbated?
<p>
They can't believe that this is the state of the relationship between their 
community government and their schools, which for the most part has the 
greatest government access to children and parents.
<p>
The other thing that is hard to believe that I like to point out to legislators 
on Capitol Hill is why is that so many of these state and local governments are
so willing to go to the mat for some of these things that seem
so silly and so peripheral to the education process when national
statistics are replete with examples of illiteracy, inability
to fill out job applications, remedial education in college of
basic mathematics.  I mean, it just seems to be a prioritization
that does not reflect the wishes and the needs of American families.
<p>
So really the biggest reaction is I can't believe that we need
this, and when we do explain to them, they say, wow, that sounds
like very commonsensical legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It's interesting the amount of attention paid to the sex lives 
of children rather than their reading ability.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Oh, it's amazing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk more about that in a moment.
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear more about the endangered
rights of parents.  You won't want to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. I'd like to welcome our guests back to the
show:  Paul Webster, legislative assistant to Congressman Steve
Largent; Greg Erken, Of The People's executive director; and Rebecca
Bocchino, whose life as a parent was affected by this key issue.
<p>
Rebecca, you were saying that in your discussions with parents
there are a lot of misconceptions about parental rights.  What
are you finding?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Some parents are making the mistake
that we need to ask the government to give us parental rights,
and that is wrong.  We have the right.  It is inherent.  It's
God-given, it's inalienable, and it is the proper function of
government to secure those rights.  Too many times we even see
Republicans talking about local control.
<p>
This whole opt-in opt-out issue, for example, in Virginia was tossed back 
to the local governments, and even some Republicans were plugging that as 
a good thing. I'd like for legislators and governors and mayors to understand
that parental rights is not subject to local negotiation.  It's
inalienable, it's inherent, it's our right, and it's the proper
functions of government to secure those rights.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And you were saying that sometimes government plays the race 
card in being against opt-ins, for example, which empower parents.
How do they do that?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  The Virginia Education Association and the NEA love to 
argue that because some families don't speak English or have other 
cultural barriers, they would not necessarily understand enough to 
make a decision to opt-in to a program. By their own logic, then, they 
also have to admit that they wouldn't understand enough to opt out, 
and if our long-range vision for education is truly lifelong learning, 
shouldn't we do all we can to lift parents up to the point where they can 
make an intelligent decision for their children?
<p>
I don't happen to agree with the statement that minority families are 
incapable of making decisions for their children.  I find minority families 
to be some of the most interested in their children's morals and values and 
education of all, and I disagree with the Virginia Education Association
and the NEA in that assumption, but we really should take a look
at opt-in as the preferred method of obtaining parental consent.
<p>
I mean, you couldn't walk into an emergency room and have a surgeon
go ahead and operate on your child unless you told them no, and
we shouldn't have it that way in the schools, either.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: As a matter of fact, the research would indicate that 
minority parents are even more conservative and concerned, and perhaps
the education establishment knows that, which is why they use
them to get out of asking.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Sure, absolutely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What's been your experience, Greg?  You are spearheading
this state by state.  What are you finding?  As parents go to
their legislators and say we want some action, how is that being
received, and what have you been doing?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, in state after state, the reaction is as Rebecca has 
described. Generally they are getting pretty much of a stiff arm, the 
parents, that is.  Paul touched on another interesting issue, which is as 
the parental rights movement grows, it is not going to be just the
kinds of parents who are concerned about the kinds of values that
are being taught, in sex ed and everything, but there is another
whole group -- and obviously there is a lot of overlap -- of parents
that are concerned just about academic standards.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Maybe not about the condoms, but when Johnny
comes home and he can't read or write, they want to get involved
with the public schools.  They are running into the same problem.
But help is on the way, because Of The People right now has launched
a number of efforts in states to put our simple amendment, which
says the right of parent to direct the upbringing and education
of their children shall not be infringed, into state constitutions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How many states are you in right now?
<p>
MR. ERKEN: We are active in 28 states, and we have a lot of interest in
the other ones.  We are going to ballot by a citizen initiative
in the state of Colorado.  It will be on the ballot there in November
1996, and I think we will also be very successful moving the amendment
by legislation in Michigan and perhaps Illinois and Alabama.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And certainly the research would indicate that when
one state embraces something like that, you get a real wildfire
starting.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  That's exactly what we are after.  We think
that the parental rights movement, because it is so potent, there
are so many parents like Rebecca out there who are fighting to
defend their families, this has the potential to become what we
call the term limits of the social values movement where we get
some victories at the state level, it spreads like wildfire, and
in turn that's going to help the efforts of Congressman Largent
at the federal level.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  And we've already seen state legislators begin to propose 
-- in Indiana the state house just passed a statutory parental rights bill 
that was -- it was not a state constitutional amendment, but Indiana, 
Alaska, Washington State, Kansas, I believe, there are a number of state 
statutory efforts that are going on.
<p>
I mean, it seems odd that we have to argue the point for something that 
is so common sense as to parents, you're good parents, you have the 
best interests of your children at heart, please, go about your business, 
we bless you and we support you, do your thing.  It's kind of funny.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In a country where an accused murderer is innocent until 
proven guilty and parents are held in suspicion, you know, almost guilty
until proven innocent.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  And it really does smack to the very foundations of what 
the United States is all about. Our constitution guarantees that we have 
certain civil liberties that are fundamental.  We have the liberty to 
speak. We have freedom of religion.  We have the liberty to believe. We 
have the liberty to exercise in the press, in the media.  The Supreme
Court has already said that -- 70 years ago was the last time
they iterated this -- that parents have the freedom to raise their
children free from governmental interference or intrusion.
<p>
So what we are really talking about and what underlies all the discussions
about today's social problems is the constitutionality of the
freedom for people to live as they choose, to live without overarching
governmental intrusion.
<p>
You know, the interesting thing back is if we look back 200 years at a 
different time in history, the people of this land revolted against a 
government that was too intrusive, that was too tyrannical, that stiff-armed 
their citizenry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Taxation without representation.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Exactly. Now we're having parenting without representation on 
the local and the state level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Greg, are you all concerned about legal challenges, 
constitutional legal challenges, and how are you preparing for that?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, first of all, as Paul mentioned, we are codifying 
something that the Supreme Court said, as he mentioned, 70 years ago and 
which the court has never overturned.  What we are doing is bringing in 
out of some law clerk's file that nobody sees and you parents have to hope 
that judges will remember these cases and apply them correctly.  We
are exercising the right of the people, hence our name, to move
parental rights sort of out of the ether from some of those rights
that everybody instinctively knows they have and putting it in
black and white.
<p>
That's something that the people always have a right to do, and the 
U.S. Constitution and the state constitutions always speak of enumerated 
and unenumerated rights, and all we are doing is moving this one from 
the back burner, because it's being forgotten by too many bureaucrats 
and judges and saying, hey, we want it in black and white now.  The time 
is right to add it up there with free speech and freedom of religion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Rebecca, is this conversation giving you more hope or
more fear?  You know, do you see any light at the end of the tunnel?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Oh, definitely more hope.  I mean, this Congress
is finally -- for the first time, I feel like we have a chance
to really do what parents have been trying for for a long time.
I don't know about you, but I don't want the village raising
my child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's right.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: And it's the socialist mindset that says if you're against 
government providing the service, you're somehow against the service being 
provided at all.  I want to be free to do what I can do for my children
and provide for them what I can provide.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you know what's interesting about that it takes a village 
comment is that in context -- and we're talking about Hillary Clinton's
book, <i>It Takes a Village</i>, where she argues that we need more 
government to raise successful kids -- the African proverb comes from the
context that when the families break down or the men leave the
family or they've gone off to war and been killed, it takes a
village to make up for broken families, not it takes a village.
Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  And it would be one thing -- again, you
could take that slogan, and in proper context it would be okay.
For example, if the village were not undermining what the parents
are teaching their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: The problem is when your child leaves home, they might 
encounter something in the movies or in the pop culture, which has 
gotten a lot of attention, which undermines parental authority.  What
we need to do is shine the light on too often it's our own government,
through our tax dollars, in the schools, that are doing some more
of that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. The village is on the attack. We've got a couple 
seconds left.  What's one last thing you'd like people to understand 
about this issue, very quickly?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: They need to get involved.  You know, the price for
freedom is eternal vigilance, and parents are going to have to
quit the country clubs and the golf games and get into the PTAs,
get on the school boards.  They are going to have to take a more
active role in their children's lives and in their education than
they're doing now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much for being with us. When we return, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a bit of Gary Bauer's appearance on 
CNN's Morning News, discussing another hot issue, welfare reform. 
Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Gary Bauer makes many appearances throughout the year on a 
variety of news broadcasts.  Gary is often seen giving his insight, 
particularly on CNN.  So let's take a look at what Gary had to say on 
CNN's Morning News regarding an issue most definitely discussed in the
upcoming election debates, welfare reform. <i>Straight Talk</i> now
brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from CNN Morning News follows:]
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Is there a quandary here for conservatives as to how much you 
soften on this provision?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Apparently some of my friends think there's a quandary.
I don't think there is.  I believe that anything that encourages
promiscuity and discourages marriage results in more abortion
and more illegitimacy.  That's what we've got now.  We've got
1.5 million abortions a year and one-third of our children being
born out of wedlock.  That's a disaster for this country.  Part
of the problem is welfare, and we need to reform it.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Well, but you see that there's a movement, it would seem, 
within the House and among the Republicans to soften the provisions.
How much would be acceptable to you?  Can you go with vouchers?
Can you go with some form of if not cash payment, provisions
to these unwed mothers?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I tend to be sympathetic towards vouchers in all sorts of 
areas, education, welfare, and so forth, but I hope the Republicans 
don't lose their heart on this, because I think the Catholic bishops 
are sounding the wrong note in their opposition.  To follow their argument 
through, we ought to increase welfare benefits.  Let's increase them 
ten-fold, because that will get abortions down.  Nobody believes that. 
In fact, the welfare system is encouraging abortion and encouraging 
illegitimacy by discouraging marriage.  That's what we need to get at.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Do you think the Catholic bishops are just seizing on the 
abortion issue to stake out more of a claim for the liberal position on
welfare?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't want to get too esoteric here,
but I think that in the bureaucracy among the Catholic bishops
there's a lot of support for the traditional welfare system that
has been put in place over the last 30 years, a system that takes
money out of the pockets of the American taxpayer and uses it
to subsidize bad decisions, and I hope that the Republicans put
a stop to that.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Is there any legitimacy, if you will, to the argument that 
this will lead to more abortions, any data to prove that?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I have a 20-year record of being a pro-life supporter. I 
don't think anybody doubts that if I thought there would be even one 
more abortion, I wouldn't support this.  I believe that the welfare reform 
will result in less abortion. In fact, the states with the highest welfare 
payments are the states with the highest abortion rates.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with us 
to hear how you can get more information regarding the issues affecting you 
and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. If you'd like to receive more information 
about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics discussed, call us at 
1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week, we will be discussing how the media influences society
today.  From television to movies to music to the Internet, we
are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see,
hear, and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make.  Does
the media take such a responsibility seriously?  We'll find out
next time on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
takes a look at something that hits close to home, especially for us here, 
the media's influence on today's culture.
<p>
Although the entertainment world's original mission was to bring wholesome 
programming and unbiased news coverage to the public, we have strayed far 
from that intention, it seems. An example can be seen in a recent 
controversy.  Just last week on ABC's <i>Nightline</i>, a report was given 
that insinuated American Catholics in the 1940s and 1950s, as a general 
rule, were prejudiced against Jewish Americans.  And although prejudice 
exists and is a terrible thing, should broadcasters slant a newscast with 
a negative portrayal of Catholics as a whole?  Is it fair to draw
conclusions of the views of all people in a certain group?  We'll
take a look at issues such as this and others in tonight's show.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from Bill Mattox, FRC's Vice President
for Policy.  Bill's extensive research of marriage and divorce
provides some key insights into why those who pledge to spend
their lives together in marriage often find themselves with broken
hearts and broken homes.  Bill's expertise on this subject has
been published nationwide, and <i>Straight Talk</i> would like to share
some of his findings with you as we go behind the headlines.

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bill, thank you so much for being with us today on Behind the 
Headlines. As you know, tomorrow is Leap Year Day, and there is an 
interesting old Sadie Hawkins tradition from European history in 
Scotland beginning in 1280, and into England and beyond, that says 
that on that day, women were allowed to ask men to marry them, and
if the man said no, he might have to pay a sum of money or buy
her a silk dress.  What do you think about that old custom?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, I suspect there are a lot of young women today
who would like to see that tradition carried on and would seize
the opportunity that this day might provide to approach their
boyfriend and see if he might have serious intentions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Marriage is a fascinating topic.  Every women's magazine 
talks about it in great detail.  For Generation X-ers, it is 
particularly sensitive.  They have experienced a lot of divorce and 
marriage issues.  How is the pendulum swinging for them?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, you're right.  They very much look at this issue very 
differently, I think, than many previous generations, and I think a lot 
of that is because their experiences as children have been quite
different.  Many of them, as you know, have grown up in homes
that either never had a father to begin with because they were
born out of wedlock or, more often, where the marriage broke apart;
and many of them have seen, then, first hand the problems associated
with divorce, both what it does to adults as well as the pain
that it often causes children.
<p>
I think, for that reason, many young people today are quite wary of marriage. 
On the one hand, they don't want to go and repeat their parents' mistakes 
and very much want to avoid divorce.  In fact, in a lot of the polling
that we have done, we have seen that the concern about divorce
and opposition to easy divorce is greater among this age group
than it is among older groups.
<p>
But at the same time, because in many cases they have never seen a marriage 
succeed, they have never seen conflict resolved successfully, many of them 
are not prepared perhaps for successful marriage and, perhaps sensing
that, are quite often much more willing to go the route of, say,
cohabitation than previous generations.  We have seen here in
recent years that the rise in couples living together outside
of marriage has been quite profound, especially among younger
Americans, and I think it is a reflection, ironically, of their
concern about divorce and, in a perverse way, a reflection of
the -- at least in the case of some -- a reflection of their high
ideals about marriage and the fact that they very much want a
marriage to succeed.  Unfortunately, as you know, cohabitation
is not likely to increase the likelihood of a strong marriage;
in fact, it is more likely to hinder a successful marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Divorce is a very troubling subject to just about 
everybody, and in fact divorce reform today is a very big issue. People
are taking a look at how we might change the system.  How is divorce
reform being developed to bring more justice, in particular often
to women and children who are abandoned by men in search of trophy
wives?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, there are a lot of things being talked
about at the state level, and I frankly am quite encouraged by
the kind of growing dialogue and conversation and attention that
is being given to this subject.  In fact, speaking of leap year,
I just learned about a radio station down in Texas that, kind
of concerned about this issue, approached nine different judges
in the kind of three-county area where the radio station is heard
and asked them, on the 29th of February, a special day of the
year, that they not sign any divorce decrees on that day.  And,
lo and behold, all nine judges agreed to go along with that request.
They are calling it, I think, something like Home Improvement
'96 or something.
<p>
But we are seeing a growing level of interest and activism at the state 
and local level on this subject, and the policy proposals take a lot of 
different forms. The most common approach -- and, I think, perhaps the 
most appealing approach to this issue -- is one that is being advanced in 
the state of Michigan, where they are saying, look, on grounds of sheer 
justice, we want to protect spouses who do not want to see their marriages
dissolve, if they have done nothing that would, in a sense, fall
into the category of fault, so that if one spouse just wants to
get up one day and walk out, he or she is not able to do that;
that we are going to protect the interests of the spouse that
would not want for the marriage to dissolve.  Obviously, in cases
where both parties want to see the marriage dissolved, that would
still be possible.
<p>
But I think this has perhaps the greatest potential for movement in many 
of the states, because it really emphasizes this idea of justice and the fact 
that when someone abandons commitments that they have pledged to carry out, 
that has an effect, obviously, on the other spouse and also on children,
if children are involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  If you and I, Bill, were in a contract together and we were 
both going to bring something to the table and make a product, neither one 
of us could walk away without at least its costing some money to us, let 
alone perhaps being required by law to provide part of our contract.
<p>
In a fault-based system, my understanding is that there would
be some consequences for the person who walks away.  How will
a fault system be perhaps of assistance to women and children?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes. No-fault divorce is, I think, a misnomer.
There is no such thing as no-fault divorce.  I think, instead,
what we really have is, in a sense, no-consequence divorce, where
there are no apparent, at least no legal consequences, to someone
breaking a contract.  And yet we know that in other situations,
if that same man goes into the work place that same day after
he has abandoned his wife and children and decides to, say, fire
an employee or to break a contract with a vendor that does business
for his company, he is going to face certain legal rules that
he must abide by or face certain consequences.
<p>
What we have done with so-called no-fault divorce is really create 
no-consequence divorce.  And I think what we want to say is, look, if 
you make pledges, if you make commitments, if you make promises, we are
going to expect you to carry those out in the same way that we
do in other realms of life, and we are going to do this not just
for your good but to protect the interests of others who make
agreements with you based on their belief that you intend to follow
through.
<p>
Now, if for some reason the other party fails to live
up to their commitment, we will not hold you to remaining in the
marriage if you do not want to.  So if there is fault on the part
of the other party, yes, you can in those cases get a divorce.
But if, instead, you want to simply abandon your responsibilities,
you will not be permitted to do so and leave all the consequences,
if you will, to the other spouse.  We will protect their interests.
<p>
To take a look at the typical divorce, generally, the husband
is leaving a wife and child, often perhaps for a trophy wife,
and what we see, though, is that the thing that he most wants
is the ending of the marriage, and he gets that.  Then in divorce
what we see is a lot of negotiation for property and children,
and often the husband comes to the wife and says, &quot;Look,
you give me the property I want or I'm going to fight you for
the kids, and it is going to cost you a lot of money.&quot;  And
child custody battles become very bloody.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that going to a fault-based system will 
end these bloody wars over property but primarily for child custody?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: It may. I think it would be appropriate, whatever we do about 
fault-based divorce and whether we return to it in some way, shape, or form, 
I think it would be appropriate for us to try to disentangle these two
questions, because you are right.  It is quite common for one
spouse to kind of press on the property side while the other spouse
seeks to protect their interest in terms of child custody, and
that one quite often gets the kids and very little else.
<p>
I think it would be appropriate for us to separate these two issues and
to, first and foremost, in cases where the marriage is irretrievable,
say we want to protect the interests of the child and to make
a decision about how that child should be cared for and in whose
custody that child should be placed before we then proceed to
other questions about the division of property.
<p>
If that sort of situation were in play, then I think what we would see is 
that the decisions about who gets custody of the children would be
carried out in a way that is much better for all parties concerned,
and it would be done in a way that, of course, then would not
have implications for whether or not the parties are treated fairly
when it comes to property division.
<p>
But my hope is that we can avoid these kinds of questions as much as possible, 
and one of the things again that I find encouraging about a lot of the 
discussion that is beginning to take place is there is a growing recognition
that we have a very serious divorce problem in this country, and
my hope is that we can do as much as possible to prevent divorce
so that we don't have to then deal with a lot of these thorny
issues that arise in the course of divorce or, for that matter,
many years after a divorce.
<p>
You know, the bottom line here is commitment.  If there is a commitment to 
making things work, that goes an awfully long way toward making some of 
these difficult things all of a sudden seem less daunting and more 
overcomable.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And, of course, Family Research Council has a lot
of information and resources available.  We would welcome anyone
to call.
<p>
Thank you, Bill, so much for being with us.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
looks at a few ways that the media shapes our culture today
and whether or not industry leaders are taking that responsibility
seriously.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In today's world, it is virtually impossible to escape the 
media -- from newspapers to radio to television to cable networks, to 
satellites, to movies, to computers, and the list goes on.  We are 
surrounded by it and experience its influence daily.
<p>
As the media has blanketed our nation and culture, it has expanded not 
just in scope but in the way in which information is exchanged.  The 
growth in types of communication forms has been especially fast paced in 
the last 40 years; and, bombarded by so many messages and message forms,
the definition of normal has evolved.
<p>
[<i>Roseanne</i> segment follows:]
<p>
TEENAGE GIRL: That it's time for me to get some birth control.
<p>
[End of segment.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A few cases point:  the media's depiction of the typical 
family, whom it glorifies as heroes, and what is considered acceptable 
behavior.
<p>
So as we flip through the channels, we are forced to ask ourselves 
whether media positively or negatively affects our culture today. 
<p>
To help us distinguish between some of the negative and positive effects 
of media, I am joined by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for 
the Family Research Council. As a former <i>L.A. Times</i> writer and 
editor, Bob has first-hand knowledge of how the news media works.
<p>
Also joining me, Tom Fitton, Director of Development for Accuracy in
Media, a media watchdog organization; and Sandy Crawford, director
of the Entertainment Division for the Media Research Center.
<p>
Welcome to this show, its distinguished guests which people need to 
know. I am surrounded.  Frankly, we started the show talking a little
bit about ABC's <i>Nightline</i> in the head.  ABC's <i>Nightline</i> 
show actually came out and said, well, we know -- and how do we know 
this? -- that Catholics almost all in general, in the 1940s and 1950s,
didn't like Jews.  Therefore, Pat Buchanan, being Catholic, must
not like Jews, either.  And now you tell me that, Tom, they have
decided to apologize.  Does this surprise you?
<p>
MR. FITTON: That's right.  They implied that Patrick Buchanan's father 
listened to Father Coglin(?), who was an anti-Semitic radio priest, talk 
show host, back in the 1930s and 1940s.  Ted Koppel came out and said,
&quot;Well, even though it was in the <i>Washington Post</i> and 
reported elsewhere, we should have checked it out ourselves,&quot; and
it turns out he didn't listen to Father Coglin, and there is this
unspoken assumption, or spoken assumption, that conservative Catholics
from the 1950s and 1940s were necessarily anti-Semitic.
<p>
Ted Koppel had to apologize on air to the Buchanan family, and that is 
a big deal in network news, to have a personal apology like that,
which shows just how far they went overboard in slurring the family.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Perhaps how much they were concerned about lawsuit,
as well.
<p>
Sandy, what have you seen in your work -- I know you
look at the entertainment medium, in particular -- about other
kinds of stereotypes that are being forced on people about all
these people are like this or like that?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: We are seeing a lot of negatives, especially where Catholicism 
is involved. That attitude is something that comes into play with 
entertainment media.  Many times you will see priests who are pedophiles, 
you will see nuns who are habitual child abusers, always whacking
children around with rulers and that kind of thing.  So you will
see that kind of stereotype, especially addressing people who
are religious or addressing people who are politically conservative.
Many times the folks who are politically conservative tend to
be portrayed as being somewhat backward and old-fashioned and
fuddy-duds; we don't want to be like that, that kind of mentality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. I actually was on a CNN program just last
week where they made the passing slur that, well, you know that
a lot of Buchanan women supporters have never been to college.
I had to say, &quot;Well, I don't assume that that makes them
idiots, and I don't assume that that is true, either.&quot;  You
know, I am offended on both counts.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, something we have noticed, too, is that Jay Leno has 
been particularly very, very harsh about Buchanan, and every night with 
the monologues -- I mean, we can look at these monologues and understand 
that a joke's a joke, and we can all laugh at that.  But some of these
so-called jokes have started to become very, very harsh, just
very unfair assassination attempts on Buchanan, referring to him
as being a member of the Klan and just really terrible stuff.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: As if that is funny.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FITTON: You know, the instinctive thing to call a conservative a 
Nazi, even in a joking manner, and to do it constantly night after 
night certainly doesn't help the conservative cause any, and it 
shows maybe that their instincts are wrong on this issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, you were actually in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 
newsroom and have had a distinguished career in journalism before 
you came to this side of the fence, and I know you've got a book 
coming out soon which we want to hear about.  But what happens inside
some of the entertainment world and news world?  Are people making
these assumptions?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, the assumption is always there that if you are in 
journalism, you are a liberal, number one, and they have many ways of 
testing that.  It used to be the Ronald Reagan test, I called it, 
where a small group of people would gather in the newsroom, and then 
someone would bring up Reagan's name -- it used to Nixon's, then Reagan 
--  and there would be a general smirk, and so forth, and everybody 
would make sure everybody was smirking.  And if somebody didn't -- they 
just took it straight -- they would start boring in on that person,
and they would start extracting opinions from that person, and
that person would become a lightning rod quickly if that person
didn't tow to every liberal orthodoxy.  It was uncanny.
<p>
I can say many great things about the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and I 
think it is a fine paper, but I will say it is the most intellectually
stultifying place I have ever worked.  Even the liberals were
looking over their shoulders to make sure that the particular
brand of political correctness was absolutely correct.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is easy to see political correctness on an Oscar night 
or an Emmy night.  Everybody has to wear the red ribbon and say the
same kinds of things about the Earth and fur and vegetarianism
or whatever.  But some shows -- you all, in particular, look at
a lot of entertainment things; Tom, you had some to bring up --
some shows do go a little bit further in kind of pushing a world
view.  What have you seen in your observations?
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, we tend to focus a bit more on news, and the problem 
is the news is pretty good at usually pointing out problems. <i>Prime 
Time Live</i> on ABC a few weeks ago had a good segment talking about 
the ethics problems that children have, that many are stealing and 
cursing and doing all sorts of nasty things in ways they used not to do,
and they pointed out some advice that you could give parents to
have your child behave in a more appropriate manner in school
or at home.  And I don't know if it had to do with religion. 
Religion was mentioned once.  Children were asked, is there anything
you would give your life up for? and they went out of their way
to say, well, there was really nothing they would give their life
up for, although there was a sidebar comment, &quot;A few children
said their family and religion.&quot;  That was the only time
it was mentioned.  It was not used as a sort of model to make
children grow up right, and the parents were told basically to
have dinner with their children more often, nothing about church.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So that's the answer to our problems, is mealtimes.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: I think that is symptomatic, and Ben Stein pointed this 
out in his book, <i>The View from Sunset Boulevard</i>, back in 1980; 
that religion on television was not so much trash as it was omitted. 
You would see a priest or maybe a rabbi perform a wedding or a funeral 
and maybe listen to a confidentiality.  But that was it.  They were
never main characters.  They were always considered peripheral.
<p>
He said there's a reason for this.  Most of the people in Hollywood
are irreligious.  They are not merely lapsed Catholics or Jews;
either they are hostile toward religion or feel it has no value
in the modern world.  Stein cited various surveys that have been
backed up since then by Robert and Linda Lichter and Stanley Rothman
showing people in Hollywood are greatly irreligious.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I have been intrigued by the popularity of <i>ER</i> 
and <i>Chicago Hope</i> and a lot of doctor shows right now, and everyone's 
on their deathbed and nobody prays, which I find an intriguing phenomenon;
you know, week after week, everyone's dying and nobody thinks,
I wonder what happens next or even talks about it.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: That is an interesting observation.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Or it is a last resort, but never in the middle of something.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I have actually never seen it.  I must admit I am a big fan 
of both those shows.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
And I have never seen anyone pray, even at the moment of death.  They are 
hanging on for their last moment, and they want to have one last Big Mac or 
something, you know? It is an interesting last wish.
<p>
What are you finding, Sandy, in entertainment?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, for the past two years we have released every year a 
study of how religion is portrayed on television, and our findings were 
very much in keeping with Mr. Stein's findings, that religion really was 
a non-event on television, that you tended to find more families who were 
watching the Superbowl together than ever going to church, ever saying
a prayer or saying grace, that kind of thing.  So our research
results do back up those claims.
<p>
As far as this general overall politicking, we have found overall that a 
lot of the politics of prime time have toned down somewhat.  The focus has 
turned to values -- sexual, moral values, moral issues -- and I think
that is where the big debate is going to be, because we are talking
about things like homosexuality and teen sexuality, that kind
of thing, and you are seeing just so much more really sexy television
shows that are out there, and even at hours early in the evening
now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more about this.
Please join us after the commercial break as we continue to discuss
the media's cultural influence with those who are watching.  Stay
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined again by some experts who have investigated the 
media's influence on our culture and especially our children today:  Robert 
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council; Tom 
Fitton, Director of Development with Accuracy in Media; and Sandy 
Crawford, the Media Research Center's Director of Entertainment Division.
Thank you again for being with us.
<p>
Sandy, I wanted to go to you first because we all know that newsrooms are 
supposed to be apolitical, and I want to hear about how apolitical they 
really are.  But I was intrigued recently on again a <i>Chicago Hope</i> 
episode where they portrayed a partial-birth abortion scenario.  They
got it wrong.  According to the partial-birth abortion ban, if
your life was in danger, absolutely, it is a necessary procedure.
<p>
It is always -- you know, abortion is, after all, an ending of
something.  In this episode, the baby was dead, the woman was
going into cardiac arrest, and they removed the child and called
it a partial-birth abortion to save her life and then had a show
about this where both of these facts were wrong; and, coincidentally,
it was on the timing of the vote.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you see that kind of coincidence in entertainment?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Nothing is coincidental.  Putting something on prime-time 
television means never really having to check the facts. It's all gut.
In the producers' gut, if they knew this was right, then that
is all that counts.  Don't let the facts get in the way.  And
that is something that we find in many instances in dealing with
things like we were talking about where religion is concerned.
There is a mind-set in Hollywood where the folks just -- they
don't have the facts on some of this information.  They don't
do their homework to the extent that they should whenever they
enter the political arena.  Now, there are some folks who do do
their homework.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: But in many instances it is whatever is in that liberal gut. 
That is what is going to fly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It must be true.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: It must be true.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  And they're not going to get challenged a whole lot.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: No.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: That's the problem. They're in a little glass jar, all talking 
to each other, all saying the same thing.  As Pauleen Kale, the New Yorker 
film critic, said once, &quot;I can't believe Nixon won by a landslide. 
Nobody I know voted for him.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: They are so out of it sometimes; they don't get that 
corrective, just the questioning sometimes from another point of view.
<p>
MR. FITTON: And the question seems to be, what is the impact?  And
for a long time during the 1980s, there was this unspoken pact.
Bill Bennett and Nancy Reagan got the media companies not to
glorify drug use in their movies or in their programs.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, that has fallen by the wayside.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is sliding, yes.
<p>
MR. FITTON:  MTV is full of music videos glorifying the use of drugs. They 
have run documentary programs on MTV. CNN has run a documentary program 
with a pro-legalization bent, and this sort of stuff is coming out in the 
form of higher drug use among teenagers.  It does have a real-world impact, 
and to pretend that adults can somehow separate what is good and what
is bad -- well, we can't allow our children to be forced to make
decisions like that because often they need a little help, and
one of the ways that we can help them is by keeping some of this
bad stuff off, by encouraging the corporations to be more responsible
about it.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Even cigarettes are back as a prop, because
Hollywood had been sensitive about that.  Young people were being
led into smoking, so it wasn't so cool anymore.  But if you see
movies like <i>Get Shorty</i> with John Travolta, the cigarette is the
main prop.  He uses it much the way Humphrey Bogart used to. 
But back when Humphrey Bogart was smoking, we didn't have these
soaring cancer statistics.  So I think they are being absolutely
irresponsible in glorifying cigarette use.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are going to look in the next segment in particular at 
the issues of children with an expert with Missing and Exploited Children.
But in terms of the news media looking at children and the entertainment
media looking at children, one thing that we have noticed is some
assumptions:  that they are sexual, that they can make their own
choices, that they don't need adults.  Do you see these kinds
of assumptions being made by the news media?  You know, get those
parents out of the way of those enlightened children.
<p>
MR. FITTON: That is right. I mean, MTV, which reaches a lot of children,
whether parents like it or not, ran a series of programs called
<i>Sex in the Nineties</i>. What they would do was produce folks who
were engaging in sexual behavior that most parents wouldn't want
their children to engage in.  There was no moral -- it wasn't
called immoral. It wasn't called, Hey, maybe you ought not to
be doing that. They presented homosexual relationships the same
way they presented heterosexual relationships.  It was seamless.
They would talk to a homosexual about his or her relationship
and then they would jump and talk to a heterosexual, as if there
was no difference.
<p>
These sorts of things are being fit to our children through outlets 
that children watch.  They really have a hostility towards parental 
values in this area.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, and they always say it's always up to the parent to 
be there, to change the channel.  Any parent knows you can't be in front
of a television set all the times your children might.  A case
in point was the other day when I took my daughter somewhere but
we left our 12-year-old just for a few minutes, and we had to
tell him, &quot;Look, you can only watch this.&quot;
<p>
Well, everybody knows the human heart is just -- if you say no to 
something, the human heart wants to say yes.  If you line up 30 park 
benches and on the last one it says, &quot;Don't touch, wet paint,&quot;
that's the one they're going to touch.
<p>
So we're in a bind.  If we make a big deal out of telling our son don't 
turn on the MTV, that is undue pressure on him.  And yet if we say nothing, 
he may stumble upon it.
<p>
So don't tell me it is always up to the parent to do it. We've got to 
clean up the air waves.  They ought to be family-friendly, and every 
parent shouldn't feel you have to throw up a fortress around your house 
and children.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Sandy, you have a tool for that, and
I know Bob has used it.  Michael and I don't have children yet,
so we haven't had the need for it.  But tell us a little but about
the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: We put out the <i>Family Guide</i> every year. It covers 
every single prime time television show on the four major networks and 
also Warner Brothers and UPN on the Warner Brothers and UPN networks. 
<p>
So what we try to do is give parents as much information about every
television show as possible.  We talk about things like what kinds
of values are on the show, if there is a lot of sex, if there
is a lot of rude language, just so each parent can make the call
themselves and apply what works for their family and make the
decision and get as much information as possible so that they
are making educated decisions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of values do you see being given to our children 
or assumptions made about our children on entertainment television?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, the major assumption that is being made about children 
is that they are ratings points; they are just rating points.  Moving
a show like <i>Friends</i>, NBC's <i>Friends</i> -- that is a 9:30 
television show if I have ever seen one, with some of the subject matter
that is on, and very risque, lots of sex, lots of very vulgar
language on that show -- moving it to 8 o'clock, the ratings went
up, and of course they went up, because there are more warm bodies
sitting in front of the television, regardless of what age those
warm bodies are.
<p>
So in many instances you have networks that are
looking at children as potential audience members, as extra points
that they can sell to potential advertisers.  So that is kind
of a sad commentary on how the networks feel.
<p>
The networks do see children as being sexual beings, that they should -- 
that their wants and needs and desires are on the moral equivalency
level of those of adults; that they should have the opportunity
to experiment sexually, that kind of thing.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Right, and therefore, they are not as sensitive to parents' 
wishes. They say, we can go to the kids directly, because if they're 
competent, after all, they can listen to the stuff as well as anybody 
else.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tom, what have you seen?  We are coming to the end
of our time.  When you go to -- and I would like each of you to
really fast respond to this -- if you look at an entertainment
industry or news company, and you say to them, &quot;Look, you're
being an irresponsible citizen of our national community,&quot;
what kind of response do you get?
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, you get a very hostile, defensive response, and just 
one person saying something isn't enough.  You need to write to the 
advertisers. We have confronted these folks at the stockholders' meetings. 
We have embarrassed them in public, and that is the only way these 
corporate types respond positively to these concerns.  You can't be nice
with them.  You need to say, &quot;You're going to lose money
if you engage in this sort of irresponsible programming.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you think, Sandy, when you tell them, &quot;You're
being an irresponsible entertainment producer&quot;?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, you've got to keep that two-way dialogue going. It 
is not enough just to walk away from the television, because when
you do that, you're saying that there's no hope for Hollywood
and that they're never going to change.
<p>
I really do believe there are a lot of good people in Hollywood who really 
do want to change. They need our encouragement and they need our support.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are going to get to hear more from Bob Knight after the 
break.
<p>
I would like to thank both of my guests and hope that people
will call us for more information about their excellent organizations.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear more about how the 
media has changed the portrayal of children and their behavior over
the years.  Is it hurting or helping them?  We'll find out after
this break.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're  back with more <i>Straight Talk</i> from the 
Family Research Council.
<p>
I would like to welcome Pete Banks to the show. Pete, a former police 
investigator and supervisor in the Child Abuse Unit is now the Director 
of Outreach at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
And joining us again is FRC's Bob Knight, who has researched the
sexualizing of our children.  Thanks so much for being here.
<p>
Pete, my introduction to your organization came years ago when I was
a reporter, and it was very impressive.  You all had a cataloguing
of materials that showed how children were being seen as sexual
objects and were working on trying to rein in that kind of problem.
<p>
What have you seen in terms of the sexualizing of children, and
what is your group trying to do about that?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, we are responsible mainly for the national child 
pornography tip line, and as such we assist the U.S. Department of 
Customs and the postal authorities in their investigation of child 
pornography.
<p>
You know, there is not a fine line.  The fact of the matter is, child 
pornography is against the law.  We are not talking about protected 
speech; we are not talking about free speech; we are not talking about 
First Amendment.  We are talking about victimizing children, not only 
when the pictures are taken but also when they are displayed, and if 
you understand that each time that child's picture is shown, they are 
being victimized again and again, and quite often that type of material 
is used to exploit other children, used as grooming tools for other 
children to say, &quot;Oh, you see, they are kind of happy, they are 
smiling; why don't you do the same thing?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Have you seen in our entertainment media, which started 
off with adults, and a lot of people are going to be the caretakers 
of children, to children really being sexual agents on their own, what 
impact have you seen from that sort of change in the media?
<p>
MR. BANKS:  Well, you know, one of the things that we always don't like 
to see is the childhood or the innocence taken from a small child, and 
that in itself is wrong, and that is wrong when they are victimized by 
a child molester or victimized by any of the institutions in society, 
whether it be the media or otherwise.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is a concern of your all's?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Oh, certainly it is, yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And what have you been telling the police and the parents 
that you work with about that shift?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, understand that children that are victimized, not only 
does it harm them, but they also have the potential for when they grow up 
to be victimizers themselves.  I think this is something that we have found 
to be true throughout the abuse of children and throughout the sexual
exploitation of children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, I know this has been a real concern of yours and that 
some of your interest in the media came because not only was the media 
sending certain messages, but it was sort of changing the culture in 
particular for children. What have been your observations about this 
shift?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Well, the media are emitting a constant drum beat, and it 
is geared toward children, and it is that you are the main actor
here; you make up your own mind.  Only a wimp child would go to
his or her parents.  You see it all the time, and sometimes the
media promote things merely by examining them.
<p>
Case in point: a cover story in <i>USA Weekend</i> just a couple of weeks 
ago. It showed a picture of hundreds of kids, and it said, &quot;Why 
More Kids are Turning on to Pot,&quot; or something like that.
<p>
I remember during the 1960s when I was growing up that my interest in 
drugs was piqued by Time magazine and other magazines constantly 
saying, &quot;Look, everybody's doing it.  Everybody's doing it.&quot;
I felt weird because I wasn't doing it.
<p>
I got a chill when my son picked up the Sunday paper, and the first thing 
he saw was this thing, and he's going, &quot;Wow!  What's all this 
about?&quot; It is to the point where I don't want a mainstream magazine 
to come into my house anymore, because they are aiming it right at
my kid.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, there was an interesting study
not so long ago that Judith Reisman did, Dr. Judith Reisman, taking
a look at even in <i>Playboy</i> magazine over the last, I think -- 
what was it, Bob, 30 years? or since the beginning of the magazine --
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- that, more and more, the cartoons portrayed child sex 
rather than even adult sex in this adult magazine.  Has that been a trend 
that you have observed?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, just recently I remember seeing an advertisement
for some professional skaters, and one of the skaters was wearing
an outfit to dress up like a little child acting risque and everything.
You know, kids are naturally inquisitive and naturally risk-taking,
and we certainly don't want to be giving them more and more ideas.
<p>
You know, this is one of the things that happens on the on-line
services on the Internet, where they are able to go in and to
be whoever it is they want to be, and they wind up getting over
their heads.  They wind up getting in trouble because they are
making decisions because they haven't had the opportunity to go
through life to make the good decisions.
<p>
This is one of the concerns that we have about Cyberville.  We don't 
call it cyberspace anymore; we call it Cyberville, with citizens and with 
places. And the only difference between Cyberville and everything else is 
Cyberville has no zoning regulations, and Cyberville has no FCC.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BANKS: So you can turn a corner and be anywhere.
At least there are some regulations, often effective, sometimes
not, that show what children see on commercial television, and
parents can make choices as to what they see on television.  But
in Cyberville, you have to be very careful about where your child
is roaming.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that the research indicates is that 
when it comes to sex acts in particular but in terms of children, 
child sex acts specifically, that we start with bringing down the 
barriers with visualization, like you said, showing alcohol, showing 
drugs, showing sex.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Grooming, it is called.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Grooming. And this is the kind of thing that, from MTV 
to, frankly, sitcoms, there is a lot of grooming going on out there, 
isn't there?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Yes, there is.  Yes, there is, unfortunately, that the 
taboos of yesterday are no longer in place, and I often wonder -- 
you know, when I retired from the police department, I kind of left
and I figured maybe we had two generations left in America before
we all killed each other, and I can remember so fondly that when
I was a kid, I mean, going to Mrs. Krischek's house with my little
bag on Halloween and getting a couple of potato pancakes and eating
them.  Can you imagine if your kid came home today with potato
pancakes?  You would throw everything out.
<p>
But by the same token, there were certain things that a child learned 
as they reached to adulthood when they are able to make the proper 
decisions, when they have had the exposure from the family.  But what 
we see now is kids without families.  What we see now is kids that
are growing up without any love, without any caring, without being
given any moral discipline by anyone.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: I mentioned earlier that the idea that the parent can be 
there and always monitor what the child is watching has fallen by the 
boards because of family dissolution.  Studies show many children watch 
hours of television and they are unsupervised.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Well, it is a national babysitter.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, it really is, and it babysits because the mother or the 
father can get something else done in the meantime.  They can't be there 
every second. So they do the best they can.  They hope to leave the child 
in the hands of someone who is not going to exploit them.  But you
can't be so sure these days.  There is so much on there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So where do we go from here?  There are tools like the 
Accuracy in Media and Media Research Center guides.  Frankly, Family 
Research Council has been interested in a P-chip, not a V-chip which 
would let the government or the entertainment media make some choices
for us, and if you buy technology, it blocks what we decide it
blocks; we have been in favor of a P-chip that a parent could
program in their own selection to block, depending on age appropriateness.
<p>
But what do you see out there?
<p>
MR. BANKS:  Well, you know, I wish we could program parents before they 
have children so that they can make good decisions, because it's a full-time 
job. We cannot put all of our eggs in the basket of technology.  We see 
that with the blocking mechanisms on some of the computers and everything
out there.  That is wrong.  Raising a kid is a full-time job,
and you need to make the right choices.  You need to ensure that
you elect officials that create the laws, that pass the laws,
that enforce the laws that protect your children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I was talking to a parent just before I came in 
here. Sorry, I want to get your opinion on this.  She said she bought
every blocking mechanism possible, put them on the entire computer,
and then got on there and saw what was happening in some of the
chat rooms and was horrified.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Right. It's a challenge to the kids, and again, those areas are 
the, quote, unquote, protected areas. They are the free-speech areas, and 
you have to be very, very careful.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it shows that you can't just depend
on shielding mechanisms.  Number one, your kid goes out there
and talks with all the other kids who haven't had a conscientious
parent shield them, so they pick it all up, anyway.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Right.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  The other thing is that why should the onus
be on the parents?  We've got to clean up the air waves.  This
is a little like that proposal by the President to bring back
school uniforms.  It may be a good idea for the wrong reason.
He said, &quot;Well, maybe now they won't get into fights over
expensive designer jackets.&quot;
<p>
So this is the typical liberal response. Instead of saying, &quot;Well, 
let's stop the crime,&quot; now make everybody wear uniforms.  So they say, 
&quot;Instead of stopping the trash that's coming out of the air waves, 
let's shackle all these parents to this new technological gizmo that's
supposed to help them.&quot;  It is avoiding the problem and treating
the symptom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to have you back, Bob, to talk about 
your book looking at the impact of the media.
<p>
We have a few moments left.  What would you like parents to understand
about the world in which their children are growing up?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, what they need to understand is that the ground rules 
have changed.  It is no longer the way it was when they were children.
And the other thing is that they don't want to put their child
into a place where they're going to lose their childhood or their
innocence.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And is that the computer world today?
<p>
MR. BANKS: That is <b>the</b> world.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A lot to think about. I would like to thank my guests very 
much.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a clip from Gary Bauer's 
appearance on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>. We'll hear what Gary has to 
say about the media. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>.
<p>
Gary Bauer had the opportunity to express his opinion on 
today's media during a recent CNN <i>Inside Politics</i> show. Whose 
responsibility is it to monitor what happens in our entertainment 
industry? Let's hear what Gary Bauer has to say on Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[CNN segment from April 11, 1995, follows:]
<p>
MR. BAUER: The fact of the matter is that American culture is a lot different 
than it was 10, 20 years ago and that there is a constant diet of 
glorification of violence, of sex, of anti-women attitudes, of things that 
are debased and depressing that are served up particular to our children,
and I think a lot of Americans are offended by it.
<p>
Look, you have to be Rip Van Winkle and be asleep for the last 30 years 
to not realize there has been an incredible change in the nature of what
is shown on TV and in the movies as far as language is concerned
and vividness of the images, et cetera.
<p>
I think the point there is that, constitutionally, the folks in Hollywood, 
like Mr. Scher(?) and others, are able to do almost anything they want, 
and I don't think anybody would challenge that.  But there is also such a
thing as being good citizens.  And I think what Bob Dole's hopes
-- and I believe he spoke in his speech of the concept of shame
-- I think Bob Dole hopes that people in Hollywood would start
being good citizens and be partners with the rest of us in trying
to raise children and to send messages in our culture that are
positive and uplifting rather than constantly focusing on death
and destruction, violence, and hostility and violence against
women.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.
Stay with us to hear how you can get more information regarding
the issues affecting you and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]

<P><FONT SIZE=6>The fault-lines of today's divorce policies</FONT>
<P><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR>
The Washington Times
<HR width = 30%>
</CENTER>

<P>Once upon a time a private eye could build a flourishing business with a cheap camera, a good skeleton key and an appetite for the prurient, setting up a married man in a compromising position with a woman not his wife. A quick snap and the photograph was on its way to his lawyer.

<P>Not only would the &quot;unfaithful&quot; husband pay a premium for these fraudulently scandalous photos, artlessly staged, but his &quot;betrayed&quot; wife could appreciate them, too. She wanted a divorce as badly as he did and they had to prove someone's sexual infidelity to get one.

<P>Other scenarios were not so hypocritically benign, with the private eyes sneaking around hedges at the Bide-Away Motel, an out-of-the-way apartment or house, all to get the goods on someone's private pleasures.

<P>&quot;No-fault&quot; divorce became the simple-minded cure for all this. No-fault divorce, an erroneous label stolen from a no-fault automobile insurance policy, suggests that marriage is a little like a traffic accident, with the same high speed that bends the colliding parties out of shape but without the body and fender shop to put everything aright again. The intent of the law was to make divorce easier, more humane and less hypocritical for both parties. Feminists quickly saluted it as a means of asserting their independent rights.

<P>This was OK when both parties wanted the divorce. The law merely reduced employment opportunities for professional snoops. But many times no-fault divorce put the wife at a severe disadvantage, enabling her husband to make a unilateral decision which overnight reduced her standard of living, whether she had a job or not.

<P>State Rep. Jessie F. Dalman, a Republican, introduced a bill Feb. 14 in Michigan - with a bow to St. Valentine -  to repeal no-fault provisions when one spouse still wants to preserve the marriage. This places Michigan on the cutting edge of the movement to think again about the preservation of the terms of endearment. Other states are moving that way, too.

<P>In the Michigan bill, unilateral divorce would be repealed, with certain obvious exceptions - if the party wanting the divorce could prove the other spouse abusive, addicted, adulterous or in prison. At the least, judges would move more slowly in granting a divorce when half of the loving (or not-so-loving) couple wants to remain in the state of bliss.

<P>Every state now has some form of &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce. This approach has been especially unkind to women and children. Maggie Gallagher, in her forthcoming book &quot;The Abolition of Marriage,&quot; demonstrates how no-fault divorce literally allows one spouse to get away with murder, the &quot;murder of a marriage.&quot; Unilateral divorce radically alters the legal and moral basis of marriage: &quot;Today, while it still takes two to marry, it only takes one to divorce.&quot;

<P>Ms. Gallagher makes the larger argument that no-fault divorce dilutes the marriage contract, rendering it considerably less binding than, for example, a contract to sell a car or a cow. When the law supports the one who flees commitment(s), more marriages &quot;irretrievably break down.&quot; Chalk up another victim of the iron law of unintended consequences.

<P>Women in the 1960s and 1970s who should have known better were brainwashed into believing that a man who wanted a divorce should no longer pay alimony, just child support. &quot;Let the wife eat the cake she bakes.&quot;

<P>Brian Willats, communications director of public policy for the Family Forum in Lansing, Mich., a think tank that studies family issues, supports the Michigan bill because he thinks it strengthens the leverage of the &quot;virtuous spouse,&quot; the one who lives up to the marriage vows and doesn't want to break them. It tips the balance of power to the steady spouse, reducing the clout of the wandering spouse seeking greener pastures.

<P>This also restores a missing solemnity, a certain dignity, to the idea of the marriage contract. We've all heard, ad nauseam, the litany of ills that follow the single divorced parent, the poverty that attaches itself to the spirit as well as to the pocketbook, to society and to the family.

<P>When two people no longer want to stay together, they ought to be able to split their blanket. But not so fast: If one spouse objects, he or usually she should get an opportunity and a little more time to seek a reconciliation. If it takes two to say &quot;I do,&quot; shouldn't it also take two to say &quot;I don't&quot;?

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3><center>Dr. Edwin J. Feulner Remarks for Town Hall Launch<br></h3>
<h4>June 29, 1995<br></h4></center>

<p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><p><b>[Town Hall President Tim Butler introduced Dr. Feulner]</b>

<p>Dr. Feulner:<p>
Thank you, Tim, for that kind introduction and welcome to all of you here today as we write another chapter in the unfolding and never-ending story that is democracy in our great nation.  We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, it has been created to serve people. To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue; an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who is interested.

<p>And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.

<p>Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families and communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.

<p>But in Thomas Jefferson's time, in the days of John Adams and Ben Franklin, communication was not a simple matter and so through print -- through the power of the written word -- the intellectual underpinnings of a revolution were laid.

<p>Two hundred years ago, the pamphlets of Tom Paine and so many others were the home pages of a network of idealists that became a movement... that became a revolution... that became a nation.

<p>Thomas Jefferson once wrote James Madison that a "little rebellion now and then is a good thing and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."  In 1994, the winds of political change once again blew across the land.

<p>I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation has been instrumental in creating Town Hall as <i>the</i> conservative meeting place on the Internet, but I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, we will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.

<p>On the Senate front, Bob Dole continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country. In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a leader -- a man of action and accomplishment.

<p>On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.

 <p>We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole and Speaker of the House -- Newt Gingrich.


<p>Thank you both for joining us.  We are all honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to conjure up someone who ought to know.  Please welcome the father of inventions, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.


<p>Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboard?


 <p>Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors?

<p>[Ben Franklin: <i>Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny; and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentleman, on a count of three.... one.... two.... three.... start your engines.</i> ]

<p>Feulner: Ladies and gentlemen, Town Hall is officially launched.


<p>Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, Mr. Franklin. Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations whose vision and creativity have spurred them to join this innovative effort.  I am very pleased to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.  As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall.
<p>

<ul><p>First, please welcome, David Keene, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/">American Conservative Union</a>.

<p>Next shades of the Boston tea party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.

<p>It is also a great pleasure to welcome the President of <a href="/empower/">Empower America</a> -- Bill Dal Col.

<p>Following Bill is Gary Bauer, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/">Family Research Council</a>. Welcome aboard, Gary.

<p>Next, Town Hall is privileged to house <a href="/lead-inst/">The Leadership Institute</a>, headed by Morton Blackwell.

<p>I am also very pleased to introduce the President of the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, Karen Kerrigan. Come on up, Karen.

<p>Next we are pleased to announce the addition of the <a href="/wash_times/">Washington Times National Weekly Edition</a> to the ranks of Town Hall and its Editor-in-Chief, Wes Pruden.

<p>Finally, I am very proud to welcome, the <a href="/yaf/">Young America's Foundation</a> and its president, Ron Robinson.</ul>

<p>It's a great starting line-up but only the beginning of a fast-growing community. Thank you all for being here today.

<p>I am now very happy to be able to give all of you the opportunity to hear from our two wonderful leaders here today. It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- Newt Gingrich.

<p><b>[Gingrich speaks]</b>

<p>Thank you, Mr. Speaker, for those wonderful words.  It is my great privilege to introduce to you now the outstanding Majority Leader of the United States Senate -- Senator Robert Dole

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we will take you to the Stand for
Children rally, which took place just last week.

<p>

The rally's name exemplifies what we all hold 
dear, America's children, but although those sponsoring the 
event claimed to encompass all viewpoints, all groups, and 
all individuals, we found out differently.  So we are going 
to show you another event involving pro-family and pro-
children groups who were deliberately excluded from the 
Stand for Children events, because the important issue is 
not just that we stand for children but what we stand for 
and who is standing, government or parents.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research 
Council's Director of Cultural Studies, Robert Knight.  Bob 
discusses another controversy which the media for the most 
part has ignored, the Whitewater land and loan scandal 
involving President and Mrs. Clinton.  Yet recent events and 
convictions can no longer keep the scandal out of the news. 
Let's hear Bob's unique insight as a former newsie on what 
happens to scandal Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  As a journalist with 
such prestigious publications such as the <i>L.A. Times</i>, you 
have seen a lot of things happen when it comes to
politicians and scandal.

<p>

I think in terms of Whitewater, which is the 
current business scandal affecting a Presidency to date, we 
haven't seen anything quite like it since Nixon and his Vice 
President, Spiro Agnew.  And yet we are talking about 
misdealings allegedly related to money, and the coverage on 
Whitewater has been a bit slim.  How has the coverage on 
Whitewater reflected the potential for scandal that is 
there?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, for years following revelations 
of various things Clinton had been accused of during the 
primaries when he was running for President, the press gave 
a cursory examination of the charges and then pretended that 
they had covered it, and so that was old news and they 
didn't have to look at it anymore.  And meanwhile, 
Whitewater was unfolding; witnesses were coming forward.

<p>

Certainly Troopergate, which is kind of connected 
to Whitewater, with the state troopers giving affidavits 
about all sorts of odd behavior on the part of the governor, 
was ignored.  You could find out about these things only by 
reading the <i>London Sunday Telegraph</i>; the <i>American 
Spectator</i>, the conservative magazine; and the <i>Washington 
Times</i>.

<p>

Everybody else was ignoring it, and the <i>Washington
Post</i> even ordered one reporter off the story.  He had
composed a story relating the troopers' accounts, and his
story was spiked, and he came forward and said that.  It was
a rare breach in journalistic etiquette, and he had to leave
the <i>Post</i> eventually.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There have been a lot of alleged 
misdealings by Republicans when they are in office.  We see 
Ronald Reagan and Iran Contra, where he is completely 
cleared, and in the news conference in which he is cleared, 
the prosecutor says, "I found no evidence, but I believe it, 
anyway."  You see people like Ed Meese, who was cleared.  
You see a lot of figures that were under scandal, and yet 
investigators found nothing.

<p>

And then you look at what we are seeing today in 
Whitewater.  How do you compare the treatment that Democrats 
and Republicans have received when it comes to scandal?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Like night and day.  If it's a 
Republican scandal, it's front page; if it's a Democratic 
scandal, it may not even make the pages.  You're talking 
about a failed S&L that has cost the taxpayers $50 million. 
You're talking about convictions of the governor of 
Arkansas and, at the time, Governor Clinton's two closest 
business associates.  You are talking about Hillary Clinton 
as the attorney of record for the Madison Guaranty Trust 
through Rose Law Firm.  You are talking about destruction of 
records, billing records, the mysterious reappearance of 
other billing records.  These people, if they had been 
Republicans, frankly, would have been run out of office by 
now.  I have no doubt.  There is so much that is wrong here. 
And yet the media either bury the stories, wave them away 
as meaningless and not interesting to the public because 
they are so complex, and basically have played down 
Whitewater.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  This is the way the media has really 
contrasted the Whitewater debate.  On the one hand, they 
will say Democrats are claiming it's a Republican witch hunt 
into an insignificant business dealing.  On the Republican 
side, Republicans have said it is important to look into 
Whitewater because it involves allegedly using almost 
worthless land as collateral to get loan money from 
struggling savings and loans, that loan money going either 
to Clinton's campaign or Clinton's friends -- at his 
request, allegedly -- and then all these loans are defaulted 
on and repaid by the taxpayers.

<p>

Now, that is just -- you know, it is interesting 
that these two sides are contrasted as being equally 
interesting when the media pitches it.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  That is right, and the tip of the 
iceberg in Whitewater is bigger during the iceberg during 
the Reagan years, just the tip, because they are ignoring 
things like the President's connection with Dan Lassiter, a 
convicted cocaine smuggler and a guy who peddled influence 
within the Clinton Administration and worked the state 
government, the Arkansas development authorities.  That kind 
of stuff cries out for examination.  But the press is 
(yawning), "It's just not interesting enough for us."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think it is interesting to 
contrast what is happening today with Whitewater with what 
happened in 1994 in the Texas race for governor, where the 
son of the former President, George W. Bush, is accused in 
this campaign of being involved with a savings and loan, 
merely on the board, not allegations of wrongdoing but just 
that he had been there.

<p>

You contrast that today with what is happening in
Whitewater and actual allegations of taxpayers being bilked.
Why do you think that contrast is there?  How do you explain
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: I can only conclude from years in
journalism that it is because Bush is a Republican and
Whitewater involves Democrats.  It's that simple.

<p>

I watched it at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> when I was a 
news editor.  I was amazed at how the two parties would be 
handled in routine news stories.  Here's how it works:  You 
might have a balance in a story, because they might mention 
and quote Democrats and Republicans in terms of equal amount 
of ink.  The Democrats would make heartfelt pleas that would 
pull your heartstrings about some welfare program or 
something, and the Republicans would be quoted as to 
strategy, not about why they opposed it, because they might 
have thought it hurt people, just that, "Well, we're going 
to make this an issue in the election."  It was all 
tactical; it was bloodless.  Wouldn't move anyone.

<p>

So you would think you would have the white hats 
here and the black hats over here, and they would say, 
"Well, the story is balanced.  We quoted both sides."  I saw 
this all the time, and it is because the media 
overwhelmingly are composed of liberal Democrats.  It is 
almost uniformly.  I have worked on both coasts.  I have 
worked at the <i>Miami Herald</i>, <i>Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel</i>,
the <i>Annapolis Evening Capital</i>, the <i>L.A. Times</i>. It's the 
same everywhere.  It is a liberal journalistic elite, and it
is not a conspiracy; they just hire their own.  They hire
people who think like they do, and they tend to muster out
people who don't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kenneth Starr, the independent 
prosecutor for Whitewater, had come under a lot of 
controversy and scandal himself.  He was accused of being 
the tool of a Republican witch hunt.  He was accused of 
being incompetent.  And yet he has earned three Whitewater 
convictions, two of Bill Clinton's former best friends and 
the former governor of Arkansas, who was appointed as Bill 
Clinton left for Washington.  Frankly, how is that going to 
change anything?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Oh, that should change a lot, because 
at first the press were praising Starr because they thought 
he was ineffective, frankly.  They thought, Oh, good, he's a 
nonpartisan type of guy and he is not going to delve too 
deeply.

<p>

And then as he became more serious about the case, 
they began attacking him as a political instrument of the 
Republican Party.  But his conviction in Arkansas with a 
jury of ordinary men and women in the midst of a very 
corrupt system is a stunning blow to the Clinton 
Administration, and it is a stunning blow to the people who 
say that it is merely a politically driven issue.  I mean, 
something has got to be there, and he has proved there is 
something there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now that we have three convictions 
in Whitewater, three people very close to the President, we 
are preparing for two more cases coming up in the next 
couple of weeks.  There is a lot of speculation in the media 
that someone will cut a deal.  As a journalist, do you think 
that is possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, I do; in fact, David Hale would
be the guy who could actually bring down the President. He
said that he was pressured into giving a $300,000 loan to
the Clinton campaign, and he pressured the McDougals into
doing it.  They have denied it, the President has denied it.
But if he is given immunity and testifies and he is 
believed, that could be big trouble for the President.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: After the convictions of two of Bill 
Clinton's closest former friends and then Governor Jim Guy 
Tucker, now formerly governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton came 
out and said, "Look, it's not that the jury disbelieved what 
I had to say; they thought I was okay, and they released 
seven pages of statements from the jury where the jury was 
saying things like, 'Well, yeah, I believe the President.'" 
But how do you interpret that kind of action?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, none of them wanted to accuse 
the President of the United States of being a liar.  But by 
their action, they basically said we don't believe him, even 
though some of them said, "Well, we found him quite 
believable," and then they did the opposite of what the 
President said.  So I think actions do speak louder than 
words.  That was an incredible repudiation of a sitting 
President and his sense of honor and his word.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that the Whitewater 
story has legs, that it can carry itself through the 
election cycle?  Because now, interestingly enough, a lot of 
the journalistic pundits over the weekend were saying, "Oh, 
sure, there's another court case coming up, but after that 
it's definitely a dead story."  You know, how dead is it?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You know, it is kind of fun, because 
the Media Research Center releases statements by journalists 
when they are in unguarded moments, and they reveal the 
agenda, and a lot of them have said for weeks, months, "Oh, 
this is a dead story.  Nobody is interested in it.  Nothing 
is really going to happen."

<p>

They were stunned by the verdict.  But some of 
them are still saying, "Well, so what?"  The big so what.  
Well, so what, indeed?  The President's closest associates 
convicted, plus an Arkansas governor.  This is huge, and it 
has got to have legs now, and in fact, if the journalists 
aren't going to embarrass themselves further, they'll take 
it up full force.

<p>

I still don't expect them to do so, though, 
because I think the partisan politics of the press is so 
rigidly liberal Democrat that they still won't give it the 
coverage it deserves.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Over the weekend I watched a lot of 
the news analysis shows, and once again the reporters 
continue to assert that Whitewater is probably going to be a 
dead story even though we have three convictions and two 
trials coming up.

<p>

One of the scandals that they thought would have 
more impact was Travelgate, the firing of White House 
employees then being accused of misconduct in the course of 
their job, then being acquitted of misconduct, even though 
the FBI was brought in, and frankly, the lesser reported 
fact that these employees worked with the journalists' 
travel plans, so a lot of journalists knew them and knew 
their character.

<p>

Scandals like Travelgate, the firing of a lot of 
attorneys across the country, all kinds of issues like that 
might have potential in this election.  What scandals do you 
think will have legs?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, Travelgate is a scandal with 
legs, because it is ordinary people doing their jobs and 
then being accused of horrible things unjustly.  The FBI 
being used improperly by the White House to falsely portray 
these people as crooked, I mean, that is outrageous.  That 
is a breach of not only ethics; that is criminal behavior.

<p>

I think if that story is really played to what it 
deserves, that alone could bring down a President.  I am not 
sure it will, though.  Again, it hasn't been played very 
heavily.  Most people don't understand what occurred.  And, 
also, Hillary is at the core of that one.  It is not so much 
Bill Clinton as Hillary, because an aide of Hillary's has 
said that he felt pressure to do the firings from above.  He 
didn't name Mrs. Clinton, but it was clear where that was 
coming from.

<p>

So she is up to her neck in that.  She is up to 
her neck in the Madison Savings and Loan failure.  And never 
forget the cattle futures in which she made $100,000 in a 
week, unlike anybody else who invests like that.  I mean, 
there was clearly skullduggery going on and the insider 
trading.  That sort of has been forgotten, too, by the 
press.

<p>

I think we are getting to the point where there is 
so much there that people want to turn away and say, "It 
can't be true.  This is just so crooked, it's so extreme, 
that these people can't be guilty of all the things they've 
been accused of."  It's almost an overload, sensory 
overload, of scandal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, as you evaluate Whitewater and 
Travelgate and some of the scandals and all the media that 
has surrounded it, what do you think the big picture is for 
our <i>Straight Talk</i> viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, I think there is a political 
danger that the Republicans will say, "You know what?  We 
don't have to address the core issues that our constituents 
care about:  the family tax break, the $500 tax credit, 
reestablishing the moral fabric of this country, maybe 
judicial reform, certainly all the economic reforms that are 
needed, cutting down big government, because we've got 
Whitewater."  You know, there is a complacency that may well 
set in, and I think if the Republicans fall for that, and 
the press acts characteristically to keep burying 
Whitewater, they could be very surprised in November and 
find out that the American people still weren't fully aware 
of it and just didn't care.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  We really 
appreciated your journalistic insight.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Thanks for having me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> takes you to the June 1 Stand for Children and 
to a special stand for parents by leading pro-family groups.
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segments from Children's Defense Fund's Stand for Children rally 
follow.]

<p>

CHILD: This is the day the Lord has made.  Let us 
rejoice and be glad in it.

<p>

[Song: This Little Light of Mine.]

<p>

ROSIE O'DONNELL: Fifty religious leaders, each 
with a child from his or her congregation, share the stage 
with me today.  They are here to stand for children.  It is 
time for us to make children and their rights our first 
priority.

<p>

EDWARD JAMES OLMAS:  As individuals, they, like 
all of us, have been touched by violence or by the crisis in 
health care, or by how difficult it is to obtain quality, 
affordable child care, or by the decline of our public 
school system.

<p>

IMAN: We stand for a government and a society 
that support families and their needs, not just with words 
but with actions.

<p>

MS. EDELMAN:  This is a day about unity and 
community and not about controversy.  This is a day about 
rekindling our children's hope and renewing our faith in 
each other and in our great nation's future.  It is about 
America's ideals and not about any group's ideology.  We do 
not stand here advocating big government; we stand here 
advocating just government --

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

-- government that does not give more to those who 
have and less to those who have not.  We advocate cost-
effective government that invests more to prevent than to 
punish our children's problems.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We believe that jobs and not jail should be the 
rite of passage to adulthood, and we question the family 
values of anybody that is willing to spend $20,000 to lock 
our children up but is unwilling to spend $3,500 to give 
them a head start.  We can do better.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We do not believe that government is <i>the</i> answer to
the breakdown of family, community, and moral values all 
over America, any more than we believe that hungry and 
homeless children are responsible for all of America's ills, 
as some of our leaders seem to think.  They say that we are 
too poor to invest another penny a day, each of us, to see 
that every one of our mothers has prenatal care and that we 
are too poor to invest, each of us, another nickel a day to 
give every one of our children health care, 10 million 
uninsured children; but that we are not too poor to give new 
tax breaks to the non-needy and to give the Pentagon weapons 
systems it did not even request.  We can do better than 
that.

[Segments from Family Research Council Stand for
Children press conference follow:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What we are doing is adding and even 
clarifying some of what it means to stand for children.  In 
the Children's Defense Fund's comments about this particular 
rally, it has been a bit slanted.  There has been a great 
big government viewpoint; there has been a viewpoint that 
would say, frankly, standing for children means standing 
with government and standing with government programs.

<p>

But I am standing today with some of the leading 
pro-family organizations in the nation, groups that work 
every day on family issues and actually were not invited to 
Stand for Children.  As a matter of fact, Family Research 
Council, when we read in a newspaper account that we had 
been invited, addressed Marian Wright Edelman saying, "We 
would be glad to stand for children, we would be glad to 
address the issues that we think are important for the 
family.  However, we weren't invited.  Perhaps you would 
like to change that."  And that actually hasn't happened.

<p>

When more than 100 organizations that get a lot of 
tax money to have a welfare approach to children's issues 
say that they are going to stand for children, it is treated 
as though the name of the event equals what actually will 
happen.  The reality is that big government doesn't stand 
best for children; parents do.

<p>

In 30 years of excessive taxes, in 30 years of 
giant welfare programs and 30 years of greater and greater 
overbearing government control in our schools, what we have 
found is that parents have been squeezed out of their family 
cars, and Big Brother is driving, and frankly, he is headed 
in the wrong direction.

<p>

We need a $500-per-child tax credit.  We need 
parents to be empowered in education.  We need adoption tax 
credits, and we need them now.  We applaud the current 
Congress for their efforts on tax relief and for dealing 
with the burden of the overbearing budget that is going to 
come to our children.  

<p>

Unfortunately, liberal activists like the 
Children's Defense Fund prevailed upon President Bill 
Clinton to veto very important legislation.  The Children's 
Defense Fund has embraced an attitude that liberal elites do 
know better than parents, and, unfortunately for the 
children who get caught up in the welfare state, that just 
isn't true, and in particular, one of the shameful programs 
going on today is what is happening in foster care.

<p>

Foster care becomes a quasi-parent for more than 
600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent wait 
more than seven years to get into adopted families.  We have 
made adoption very difficult, and children are caught in the 
crossfire.

<p>

Frankly, we need to make adoption easier.  When 
the family breaks down, we need to step in with limits so 
that these children could be set free for future families.  
We need to understand that what children need most is 
families, not government.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  If you look at the list of the 426 
national organizations that have endorsed this march, at 
least 102 of them received federal grants in fiscal year 
1993-1994.  These grants totaled about $400 million to these 
groups, and on top of these groups, you have lobbying arms 
of federal programs worth about $7 billion, whether it be 
the National Head Start Association, the Association of 
Women, Infants and Children's Supplemental Nutrition 
Administrators, groups like this are involved, and the 
reason why they are involved is very simple:  This Stand for 
Children march is the latest attempt by the welfare rights 
lobby to slickly package its message.  It realizes that you 
can't talk about poor people, you can't talk about the 
welfare state, because the American public knows very well 
that the welfare state breeds dependency, breeds 
illegitimacy.

<p>

MS. NANCE [Concerned Women for America]:  If the 
choice for American women would be they would prefer to stay 
home and rear their own children, then why aren't the 
Children's Defense Fund and the National Organization for 
Women out working for women's choice?

<p>

MS. FLAHERTY [American Family Association]:
Computer technology has made pornography more accessible 
than ever before, especially to children, who in most cases 
know better how to work a computer than their parents.  Kids 
can't walk into a porn shop, but today they don't need to 
when the equivalent of an adult bookstore can be brought to 
their fingertips via the Internet.

<p>

How can we stand for children in today's world?
Parental love, caring, and involvement are vital, of course.
But it is also imperative to enact strong pornography laws
that will keep sexually explicit materials out of the hands
of children.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  While the march is carefully timed 
to influence the 1996 elections, it may not even be accurate 
to call this march partisan.  Its chief organizers are to 
the left of Clinton.  The march may well be the last gasp of 
1960s-style paleo-liberals.  Look who is absent from the 
list.  The U.S. Catholic Conference, the national body for 
the Roman Catholic Church, and the Christian Life Commission 
of the Southern Baptist Convention, the two largest 
Christian bodies in the United States, are not sponsoring 
this event.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: As we stand, let us stand up for the 
use of instructional materials that help parents and 
children establish lasting meaningful relationships, 
instructional materials such as <i>You Are Special</i> that really
will result in developing self-esteem and self-reliance in 
children, the kind that they need in order to survive and 
meet the challenges of today.

<p>

[End of FRC Stand for Children segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We now have the privilege of 
introducing some of those whom you just saw and who stood
with the Family Research Council's own Stand for Children.
I would like to welcome Dr. Mary Johnson, principal of the
D.C. Public Schools Ballou Mathematics Science Technology
Academy and author of <i>You Are Special: A Child's Guide for
Successful Living</i>.

<p>

Also joining us is Ken Weinstein, Director of the 
Government Reform Project at the Heritage Foundation; and 
Diane Knippers, president of the Institute on Religion and 
Democracy. 

<p>

Welcome. A lot of impressive organizations and 
people. I appreciate you all joining me.

<p>

In the short amount of time -- because we have so 
much to cover in our discussion of Stand for Children -- 
each of you had a special concern, and we saw just a little 
bit of that.

<p>

Dr. Johnson, let's start with you.  Why were you 
concerned when the Stand for Children rally started to 
become publicized?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON:  Well, our organization and my book, 
<i>You Are Special</i>, are very special to all of us, and 
we are very excited about getting parents involved, having 
seminars, and letting people know about the book, <i>You Are
Special</i>, because we have gotten so many positive comments 
from parents about the value of it.

<p>

So we are constantly in the public's eye talking 
about it, sharing, giving the books to mentors, and that 
kind of thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The book itself is attempting to 
build self-esteem and values through Biblical principles.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Right. So we were excited about it 
at first, and so we wrote and said we would be happy to be 
there and we would bring materials and share literature and 
whatever, and we were kind of surprised.  We got a letter 
back saying, "Well, we'll have to let you know."

<p>

So we were a little surprised at that, but we said 
okay, but we are busy telling everybody about it and passing 
out buttons, because we support anything for children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON:  Stand for Children, work for 
children, do whatever we can to help our children.

<p>

And then later, near the end of the time frame 
just before the march, we received a letter saying that they 
were sorry, that they had decided not to include us and the 
distribution of our materials.  So we were a little miffed 
at what happened.  Then we said, "Well, I'm pretty sure 
there must be some good reasons."  And then later we found 
out about other groups.  Then we really didn't know what to 
think.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is ironic that a book that Marian 
Wright Edelman gives a quote for on the back, which talks 
about the Bible, was kept out, while the Gay and Lesbian 
Victory Fund was welcome to Stand for Children.

<p>

Ken, you took a look at some of the groups that 
were there.  What made you interested in Stand for Children?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Dr. Johnson's concerns were high 
and spiritual; mine were sort of low and corporeal.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I noticed the list of national sponsors of the 
Stand for Children rally, and I noticed that a lot of them 
were feeding at the federal trough, and I did a database 
search of the groups at the Heritage Foundation, looking at 
how much in federal grants they received.

<p>

I was quite astonished to see actually how much in 
federal grants were actually represented last Saturday on 
the Mall here in Washington.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you, as a matter of fact, were 
characterizing it widely, not as a Stand for Children but --

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Well, as both the last stand for 
big government and also the stand of the social service 
administrators, since, really, they were standing for their 
own programs, particularly because they fear that the 
actions of the 104th Congress are going to change the 
welfare delivery system and take power and resources away 
from them and return it instead to citizens and the 
institutions they control.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

Diane, you were interested in some of the 
community things.  We have about less than a minute left.  
What did you notice about the community side of the event?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Well, we were particularly 
concerned about the religious angle, because there were a 
lot of religious organizations that gave more legitimacy to 
this march.  But our concern was that it really represented 
the left wing of the religious establishment, and many 
mainstream religious groups were not involved.  It gave a 
very distorted picture of this march.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more 
about all of this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> comes back, we will 
bring you more after the commercial break. Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the 
pro-family movement's Stand for Children with those who were 
excluded from the Children's Defense Fund recent Stand for 
Children rally.  Here tonight are Dr. Mary Johnson, Ken 
Weinstein, and Diane Knippers.

<p>

I would like to just start out -- you know, we 
briefly kind of gave an overview of the things that had 
concerned us.  What could have made the rally better --  
Diane, let's start with you this time -- in terms of making 
it the ecumenical, nonpartisan, pro-family event it was 
advertised?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Well, I had kind of a fantasy last 
week.  What if Marian Wright Edelman, who heads the 
Children's Defense Fund, had called James Dobson and said, 
"Look, let's have a genuine bipartisan, non-ideological 
Stand for Children, which I think our country really needs, 
and let's do it together."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And Dr. Dobson?  Tell us who that is.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  The head of Focus on the Family.
And very different ideas about what kinds of solutions, 
particularly from the point of view of government solutions, 
we need for children, but both apparently with a heart for 
children.

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Then maybe we would have had the 
kind of event -- or the U.S. Catholic Conference, the 
bishops of the Roman Catholic Church, or the Southern 
Baptists, the National Association of Evangelicals -- the 
largest Christian denominations in our country would have 
felt free and comfortable to really endorse.

<p>

Instead, on the religious side, you had huge 
representation of very small religious groups.  Sikhs and 
Buddhists and Muslims are not large groups in our country.
And among particularly the Protestants, the representation 
there were the churches with very liberal hierarchies.  In 
fact, four of them -- the United Methodists, the 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Episcopal Church, and United 
Church of Christ -- the leaders of those denominations also 
signed a letter to uphold Clinton's veto of the partial-birth 
abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Astounding.  That is something that 
people of faith on the whole, Catholic and Protestant, 
abhor.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes, very highly -- standing for 
children in a very selective way; let's put it that way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ken, if you could have redesigned 
the march, I guess there would have been less federal money 
involved.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  Yes, much less federal money 
involved.  There would have been conservatives and liberals 
standing up there.  The event also would not have been held 
on the Jewish Sabbath, so Sabbath-observing Jews from the 
more conservative Jewish denominations could have 
participated rather than simply members of the left wing or 
more liberal Jewish denominations.

<p>

I would have not tried to do what Marian Wright 
Edelman did, which was to launch sort of a stealth campaign 
for the Stand for Children by meeting with the AFL-CIO's 
executive committee back in February to sort of give them a 
tip about the importance of this rally and how important it 
was -- the same meeting, by the way, that the AFL-CIO's 
executive committee voted to spend $35 million to defeat 
conservative members of the 104th Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. That is what is so 
interesting.  I loved your report, by the way --

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and I would encourage people to
call in at the end of the show to get it.  But it was just 
very clear.  I mean, if you look at who came from a social 
perspective -- Planned Parenthood; Zero Growth Fund, 
apparently standing for fewer children; Greenpeace, I am not 
sure, standing for children who pick up trash -- and then we 
have the majority of groups being involved in federal 
monies.  I mean, what does the AFL-CIO, the labor movement, 
have to say about standing for children that Focus on the 
Family would not have to say?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Sure, absolutely.  The AFL-CIO, 
the only way that it stands for children is by standing for 
grants to its members and for government programs that 
provide jobs for its members.

<p>

But certainly AFL-CIO, by standing for the welfare 
state and by standing for the way things have been done over 
the last 30 years that have generated the real crises that 
we see today, particularly our inner cities, you know, it is 
just sort of another failed example of the liberalism that 
we have to forget about if we are going to have a future 
that our children can enjoy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dr. Johnson, how would you have 
redesigned the march?  How could you have made it more 
ecumenical?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Well, I am not sure, but what I wish 
had happened is that everybody who has done things for 
children, have programs for children, would just be 
welcomed; that the letter that I got would have said, "We 
cannot assure you space to display anything, but come and 
bring your materials and share.  We know about your 
materials.  Bring them, share them with the parents and 
share them with others so they will know."  And everybody, 
other organizations, not just Focus on the Family, "Bring 
materials, come in, join us in any way that you can.  We 
don't know that we can provide space for you, but just come 
on and join us and bring whatever you can so that we can 
share all kinds of materials, programs, and whatever you 
have that we know will be helpful to children."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Were you concerned that your faith 
perspective -- I mean, ABC World News, for example, showed 
the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund at their special table in 
their booth handing out their materials, and then, in an 
open-air event, they said that there wasn't a table space 
for you, which seems hard to believe.  Are you concerned 
about that?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: I was down there. There was room.
There was plenty of room.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Yes, we were concerned, but we just 
didn't understand it, and we tried not to place a judgment 
on it, and we just tried to say, well, maybe there are some 
reasons that we just don't know.  We tried to look at it as 
objectively as we could.

<p>

But, yes, we were sort of amazed at the reaction. 
We thought the letter would come back and say, "Oh, come, 
do come, please come.  We want you there.  Bring your 
materials.  We know it has a religious slant, but it is not 
geared to any particular religion, and it is geared to all 
people.  It is written for all cultures, all nationalities 
and whatever," because we sent materials along with our 
initial letter.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, of course.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: "So, yes, bring it, and if you can 
find a little spot, you can find some space, you know, 
wonderful."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, I hope our listeners are going 
to have space for this book, and we're going to give an 800 
number, and again, people, you are going to want to hold 
fast to get this book.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more about the kinds of things children desperately need in 
America today.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, and we are talking to 
experts who are enlightening us on what it truly means to 
stand for children.  Welcome back to Dr. Mary Johnson, Ken 
Weinstein, and Diane Knippers.

<p>

Diane, we have been talking a little bit about
what we would have liked to have seen.  But you actually
went.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What did you see at the Stand for Children march?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Well, I started out on Friday 
night.  I went to the ecumenical service at the National 
Cathedral here in Washington, and then I went very early 
Saturday morning to a nearby Episcopal church where all the 
Episcopalians gathered.  We got a free breakfast and tee 
shirts.  I almost wore my tee shirt but decided not to.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We also got these little preprinted cards to send 
to our Senators, Representative, and to the President urging 
that we keep high levels of federal spending for children.  
These were convenient so we could send them in.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Ken is probably going to want to borrow these.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Exactly.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  The lobbying started at the 
religious events.  There were several that different 
denominations had beforehand.  When we actually got to the 
march -- I must say that it was one of the best organized, 
perhaps slickest marches I have ever been to, and with very 
effective use of children, the 2,000-children choir, the 
10,000 children crossing the bridge.  And all of this, the 
music, it was quite a celebratory event leading up to Marian 
Wright Edelman's final speech, where the bottom line was she 
got a lot of names and a lot of press coverage for a very 
one-sided political initiative that then started here in 
Washington on Monday when they started lobbying.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a person who evaluates daily and 
for a long time the impact of some of the liberal faith 
groups on politics, do you see this as being a direct 
connection between the intertwining of a liberal faith 
perspective and politics?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Oh, absolutely. In fact, it 
occurred to me that there was as much overt political 
activity at the religious events and as much or maybe more 
talk about spirituality and morality at the rally.  I mean, 
it was the same kind of thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kind of backwards, almost?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes. The homilies -- I mean, I 
kept looking anywhere for distinctive messages about moral 
messages.  In the entire 24 hours, I did not hear the word 
"divorce."  I did not hear the word "illegitimacy."  There 
was no mention of the problem of father absence, either at 
the religious events or the rally.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that is astounding.  I want to 
return to the question of father absence.

<p>

But, Dr. Johnson, in your book <i>You Are Special</i> you 
take a look at the Ten Commandments, the foundation of all 
Judeo-Christian civilized societies, and you talk about how 
to teach values.  I mean, you were there.  Did you wish that 
some messages -- what did you see and what would you have 
liked to have heard a little more about?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Well, we were there in the 
afternoon.  I would like to have seen more information and 
more focus on how to actually help our children on a day-to-
day basis.  The rally was wonderful, the march was great, 
the Stand for Children whole concept was fantastic.  But 
what comes later?  Our children need companionship with 
parents.  They need spiritual development on a day-to-day 
basis.  And our parents, because some of them are so young, 
need training themselves to help their children develop.  
And our children need time with an adult, time that has been 
set aside for them to help them.  This has to happen on a 
regular basis.

<p>

And without this kind of emphasis on helping our 
children develop and grow daily all the time, then it is 
just not going to be effective.  Nothing is going to be 
effective that does not deal with the children on a daily, 
regular basis, or regular basis, to help them develop.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So it was more of an emphasis on 
programs versus the intimate people touch that is really 
needed.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Yes, right, and that is what we are 
focusing on.  Sitting with the child with a book.  Spending 
time talking to the child.  Helping the child clarify what 
is really right and wrong, and we use the Bible as our 
basis, the Ten Commandments, other Biblical principles.  But 
parents that I have talked to say this is just so valuable, 
because it helps them to sit with their children, and they 
get a real clear understanding of what is right and what is 
wrong based on the Biblical principles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Ken, you made a very interesting 
point that for people of some faiths, you couldn't even 
participate.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: That is correct. No, orthodox 
Jews do not engage in public secular activities from sundown 
Friday till sundown Saturday, and so I spent from sundown 
Friday till -- I was in synagogue Saturday and I missed the 
rally, which I don't regret having missed, but nonetheless, 
it was -- I mean, I decided that my religion comes before my 
work, and so I didn't attend, and I know there were other 
orthodox Jews who did want to attend but couldn't because of 
the fact the rally was held on the Sabbath.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That was the nature of the event.

<p>

I want to hear more about the programs you would 
like to see when we come back.  When we return, <i>Straight
Talk</i> shares more on how you can stand for America's
children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. In light of the recent Stand 
for Children rally, we are talking to some of those who are 
truly fighting for the rights of America's children.

<p>

Ken, I wanted to start with you.  You took a look
at the programs represented at Stand for Children. What did
you find about the people who said they were standing for
children?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Sure. What they were standing for 
was an attempt to prevent any real significant welfare 
reform in the 104th Congress.  Also, they were standing for 
actually the more liberal elements, if you can believe that, 
in the Clinton Administration, trying to assure that their 
weight, that they had a stronger weight against the so-called 
new Democrats who actually push for some mild forms 
of welfare reform.

<p>

What they have done, in essence, is identify the 
plight of children with the welfare state and with the 
welfare state as it currently exists, and as we all know, it 
is the welfare state, more than just about anything, that 
has destroyed civil society in the inner city, in 
particular, destroyed churches, destroyed the healthy 
organizations that teach children character, and have also 
actually in many cases taken the place of fathers in the 
inner city by providing financial pay so that women can have 
children without men around.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Family Research Council 
got involved in evaluating Stand for Children for just that 
reason.  Our concern was that the best advocates for 
children are parents, and in fact we know in terms of early 
sex for teens and teen promiscuity that the best way to have 
children delay sex is to encourage them to talk about it 
with their moms and dads.

<p>

So instead of running a federally funded public 
service campaign that talks about moms and dads, talk to 
your kids; kids, talk to your parents; we run a dancing 
condom ad, and that just seems typical of the approach where 
we don't do family-building things.

<p>

Diane, what did you see?  I mean, what emphasis 
was there on family as the way to help kids?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: There was lip service to the family 
around the edges, but there was nothing really that gave 
support or particular advice or encouragement.

<p>

One of the things that disturbed me -- I am of the 
conviction that the major crisis facing our country, if you 
wanted to simplify it, you could say it in two words:  it is 
father absence.  There are just terrifying statistics about 
where we are headed with children being reared in single-parent 
families.

<p>

Now, this would have been a perfect opportunity to 
really lift up fathers as role models.  Instead, all the 
little vignettes of children that were in crisis, it was men 
that were the bad guys.  They were the abusers or the 
deserters of the family.  And the heroes, the people that 
intervened in the lives of children, were all women.  Now, 
we need to show men who are heroes to children and who will 
intervene.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You all are heroes, and I hope 
people are going to call to get more information about your 
organizations.  And we need to talk more about father 
absence.  Diane, we'll have to have you back.

<p>
