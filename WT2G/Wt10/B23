<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Seven decades ago, the federal government nationalized one of the most important natural resources in existence. If this resource had been oil, coal, lumber, or steel, the American people would have been outraged. Yet this resource -- the electromagnetic wireless spectrum -- was simply unknown to most Americans, so few knew or cared. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the seven decades the federal government has held and parceled out the spectrum, many important and highly innovative technologies have been derived from it: AM and FM radio, broadcast television, cellular telephony, and satellite-delivered television, to name just a few. But the grossly inefficient and highly bureaucratic system of federal spectrum management also has slowed the introduction of many of these technologies by prohibiting or discouraging competition in the use of this valuable resource. In addition, the holders of wireless spectrum licenses have been denied the freedom accorded other types of communications technologies. For example, radio and television licensees continue to be denied First Amendment protections equal to those of print technologies, such as newspapers and magazines.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A comprehensive bill deregulating much of the telecommunications industry was passed recently by Congress and signed by President Clinton this February. But this new law focuses primarily on wireline industries and issues (such as telephony and cable television) and ignores many equally important issues within the wireless sector of the industry (including cellular, satellite, and television broadcasting).<sup>1</sup>  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) did manage to force a last-minute debate over a portion of the bill that would give away large portions of the spectrum to a broadcast industry making the transition from analog to digital television. Dole argued that this giveaway would constitute "a big, big corporate welfare project"<sup>2</sup> because it sacrificed as much as $70 billion in potential revenues at a time when Americans are being asked to tighten their belts to help balance the federal budget.<sup>3</sup>  While this provision was not changed, Senator Dole's efforts did force supporters of the bill to offer to hold hearings in the future on legislation to reverse this misguided policy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the defective spectrum management system left unaddressed in this round of telecommunications reform is to be remedied, Congress must do more than simply pass legislation auctioning off the spectrum now set to be given away at no cost to the broadcast industry. While auctioning the broadcast spectrum is a crucial first step, effective spectrum reform legislation will require Congress to go much further and:
<p><ol>
<li><b> Provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum.</b> Current holders of spectrum should be granted an absolute property right in their current allocation, not just licenses to use the spectrum as regulators see fit. Giving industry this flexibility would result in more efficient and innovative use of the spectrum resource.
<p>
<li><b> Expand the auction and allocation process.</b> The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications Information Administration (NTIA), the two federal agencies responsible for managing the spectrum, should be required to allocate and auction off as much of the spectrum as possible. Congress should specify that any new spectrum property for which there is a competing claim, including spectrum recently set aside for the broadcast industry, must be sold in an auction process. This will guarantee more rapid deployment of the spectrum to new users who value it most highly.
<p>
<li><b> Redefine (or define for the first time) the "public interest" standard and ensure that First Amendment protections are accorded equally to all media.</b> Electronic media and technologies that utilize the wireless spectrum traditionally have been held to different standards under the First Amendment. This must change, especially as the lines between technologies begin to blur. There is no justification for treating speech that is transmitted electronically any differently from the printed word.
<p>
<li><b> Transfer all remaining spectrum authority from the FCC and NTIA to the courts, private entities, and an independent body.</b> Once spectrum privatization is complete, there will be no need for continued oversight by either the FCC or the NTIA. Coordination problems can be handled by the courts, private industry coordination organizations, and a small administrative body if needed.
 </ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If Congress fails to improve the current telecommunications reform with comprehensive wireless reform, it will have failed to deregulate the entire industry. This means wireless technologies and industries will remain overregulated relative to wireline industry, and placed at a competitive disadvantage. The practical result of this distortion will be to blunt efficiency and entrepreneurship. The result: fewer new jobs and more costly and more limited services for the consumer.

<h4>WHAT IS "THE SPECTRUM," AND HOW IS IT MANAGED TODAY?</h4>
<hr>
<p>
<a href="tp11c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Major Uses of the Electromagnetic Spectrum<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"The spectrum," as it is generally known, is made up of "radiated electromagnetic waves (radio waves) [which] permit the transmission and reception of information over a distance -- even through empty space -- without the use of wires."<sup>4</sup>  In essence, a collection of these waves, which vary in strength and frequency, can constitute a single channel along which distinct information can be transmitted. If much information is to be sent at once, a channel requires more spectrum space -- or "bandwidth" -- to be transmitted. For example, a broadcast video signal requires more bandwidth than a cellular voice signal. However, certain channels can be used to deliver many different types of signals, and also can be used by different parties in different geographical areas. For example, a television channel in Washington, D.C., can be reused in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and many other metropolitan areas. As spectrum experts Charles L. Jackson and Dale N. Hatfield note, "[T]he radio spectrum resource can be shared by many simultaneous users by taking advantage of its frequency, time and space dimensions."<sup>5</sup>  In other words, because the transmission distance for most spectrum frequencies is limited, the same channel can be used by different carriers in different locations if they are far enough apart. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain channels may even be used within the same region to deliver multiple types of signals simultaneously through a process known as "spectrum sharing" or "overlay."  Digital compression technologies facilitate this process by squeezing more space out of the same spectrum channel so that it may be used by more than one entity. Spectrum experts often speak of the "digitalization" of spectrum as a major breakthrough because it will expand significantly the number of spectrum uses and users as bandwidth becomes more abundant.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Older and less efficient analog transmission technologies still dominate much of the spectrum, however. Analog technologies utilize wave modulations that are susceptible to interference problems. Digitized transmission, on the other hand, breaks down waves into numbers and codes that can be encoded and decoded to transmit information. As this process becomes increasingly sophisticated, signals can be sent much more clearly, rapidly, and efficiently than analog signals.
<p>
<b>A Short History of Spectrum Management in the United States </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the early decades of this century, the wireless spectrum was left unregulated. As both public and private use of the spectrum grew, however, government officials became concerned about what has been labeled "chaos in the spectrum."  In other words, policymakers feared that unregulated use of this new and important resource would cause signal quality to deteriorate to a point where no one would be able to communicate effectively. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After numerous complaints from the U.S. Navy about such interference, Congress passed the Radio Act of 1912. This granted the federal government the ability to allocate licenses among users for specific spectrum allocations. The entire process was geared to assuring military users the best parts of the spectrum, leaving private users with nearly useless channels. Things grew worse during World War I, when the Navy took control of the entire spectrum. Although the Navy was forced to relinquish control in 1919, the Department of Commerce retained licensing power.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This licensing power was limited. For example, the Department of Commerce could not charge for use of a license or restrict use once a license was granted. Not surprisingly, spectrum users began applying for as much of the spectrum as they possibly could, knowing there was no cost associated with doing so. This led to genuine interference, or "chaos," problems within the spectrum, leading to demands by policymakers and industry officials for more legislative intervention. Economist Jora R. Minasian aptly noted in 1975 that this interference "was not due to any inherently particular technological characteristics of radio emissions, but to the fact that rights to use of the frequency spectrum, rights of radiation, were ill-defined."<sup>7</sup>  Sixteen years before Minasian wrote these words, Nobel economist Ronald H. Coase pointed to the same problem in a famous 1959 article on the Federal Communications Commission. 
<blockquote><p>
	 [T]he real cause of trouble was that no property rights were created in these scarce frequencies. A private-enterprise system cannot function properly unless property rights are created in resources, and, when this is done, someone wishing to use a resource has to pay the owner to obtain it. Chaos disappears; and so does the government except that a legal system to define property rights and to arbitrate disputes is, of course, necessary. But there is certainly no need for the kind of regulation which we now find in the American radio and television industry.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, Professor Thomas Hazlett of the University of California-Davis notes that the legitimate chaos evident during the 1921-1923 period, when calls for government control were multiplying, "was, in essence, an outcome of government control: over 500 broadcasters were... bunched up all at the same point on the spectrum to which they had been directed by the Commerce Department, and operations were not always perfectly synchronized."<sup>9</sup>  Minasian agrees: "No attempts were made prior to May, 1923, to assign a separate channel to each station, or to provide geographic separation of the stations operating on the same channels, or to provide mutually exclusive times of operation. The wave lengths were assigned to all in a group.... This policy, coupled with a liberal policy for issuing licenses to amateurs, resulted in interference.... "<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Radio Act of 1912 and the administrative decisions that flowed from it had two main effects. First, it encouraged military use of the spectrum at the expense of private broadcasters, leaving them little room to operate effectively. Second, it failed to create a private marketplace in spectrum rights that could have solved the ensuing interference and chaos problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite these impediments, property rights in the spectrum were developing. Professor Hazlett explains that while federal regulators, legislators, and industry officials worked together to pre-empt the institution of a property rights regime, some judges were taking steps to establish property rights. As an illustration, Hazlett points out that in one 1926 court case, <I>Tribune Co. v. Oak Leaves Broadcasting Station</I>, "the classic interference problem was encountered, litigated, and overcome, using no more than existing common-law precedent."<sup>11</sup>  In this case, Judge Francis S. Wilson adjudicated a dispute between two broadcasters who faced an interference dilemma. Judge Wilson argued that once an entity had established a presence in a given allocation within the spectrum that user had a <I>de facto</I> property right in that allocation. By establishing this common law precedent to protect property rights in the spectrum, the decision effectively rendered the interference problem moot.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some immediately recognized the power of this precedent-setting decision and welcomed it. Others, in the industry and in government, feared that it meant they would not be guaranteed a comfortable, ologopolistic market setting (that is, a non-competitive market in which both the regulator and the regulated entities were satisfied with control of entry and comfortable market share, respectively).<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hazlett suggests this was not an accident. During Herbert Hoover's tenure as Secretary of Commerce in the 1920s, large incumbent broadcasters worked with Hoover to establish a "public interest" paradigm of federal regulation and control of the spectrum to replace the emerging common law, property rights-based paradigm. Basically, Hoover and the large broadcasters argued publicly that, despite the clear failings of past legislative efforts and the potential property rights solution developing in the courts at the time, only federal regulation of the spectrum could eliminate the chaos that existed during this period.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This pressure eventually led to the adoption of the Radio Act of 1927, giving the federal government complete operating control over and ownership of the spectrum. Under the 1927 Act, the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) was established and given the power to grant three-year licenses in exchange for certain public service requirements. Licenses would be granted (and revoked) in accordance with "the public interest, convenience, or necessity."  No more specific definition of what constituted "the public interest" was given.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Hazlett notes, the creation of the FRC and the public interest paradigm was the answer to broadcasters' prayers: "[I]t immediately grandfathered rights for major broadcasters, while eliminating marginal competitors and all new entry."<sup>13</sup>  Furthermore, Hazlett notes that the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> argued at the time what should have been evident to everyone: "The point seems clear that the Federal Radio Commission has interpreted the concept of public interest so as to favor in actual practice one particular group. While talking in terms of the 'public interest, convenience, and necessity' the commission actually chose to further the ends of the commercial broadcasters."<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, little has changed since the <I>Harvard Business Review</I> printed these words in 1935. When the Federal Communications Commission was formed in 1934, the FRC was folded into the FCC along with its public interest powers.<sup>15</sup>  Throughout the years, the agency has developed highly haphazard, inflexible, and inefficient techniques to manage the spectrum resource.
<p><b>The Spectrum Scarcity and Interference Myths</b><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before discussing the pitfalls of the current regulatory approach, it is important to debunk the myths used to justify the disastrous spectrum management techniques employed by the FCC since its inception. These myths are (1) that the spectrum is scarce and (2) that private ownership would create interference problems. Both arguments are fatally flawed.
<p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Scarcity Myth.</b> The scarcity of the spectrum is irrelevant and cannot serve as a credible basis for federal ownership and management.<sup>16</sup>  As Coase has explained: 
<blockquote><p>
	 [I]t is a commonplace of economics that almost all resources used in the economic system (and not simply radio and television frequencies) are limited in amount and scarce, in that people would like to use more than exists. Land, labor, and capital are all scarce, but this, of itself, does not call for government regulation. It is true that some mechanism has to be employed to decide who, out of the many claimants, should be allowed to use the scarce resource. But the way this is usually done in the American economic system is to employ the price mechanism, and this allocates resources to users without the need for government regulation.<sup>17</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The scarcity rationale is even more irrelevant today as digital technologies move America into an age of "boundless bandwidth" and "spectrum surplus," as technology visionary George Gilder is fond of saying.<sup>18</sup>  "Why have... gloomy, scarcity-based forecasts proved so wrong?"  asks Gilder."  Because in each case, advances in microchip design tools, integration of more transistors on single chips, improved design of radio frequency systems and new antenna technology led to the creation of better systems at higher frequencies. "<sup>19</sup> Lawrence Gasman, president of Communications Industry Researchers and author of <I>Telecompetition</I>, agrees: "With lower-power communications, data compression, and practical communications at high frequencies, spectrum may still be scarce, but it is not as scarce as it once was, and it is becoming less scarce all the time."<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Interference Myth.</b> The interference justification for federal spectrum management is equally flawed. As Hazlett cogently points out:
<blockquote><p>
	Economists, political scientists, and lawyers generally agree that the interference rationale for licensure in "the public interest" is nonsensical. The interference problem is widely recognized as one of defining separate frequency "properties"; it is logically unconnected to the issue of who is to harvest those frequencies. To confuse the definition of spectrum rights with the assignment of spectrum rights is to believe that, to keep intruders out of (private) backyards, the government must own (or allocate) all the houses.<sup>21</sup> 
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thomas G. Krattenmaker and Lucas A. Powe, authors of <I>Regulating Broadcast Programming</I>, concur: 
<blockquote><p>
	 [I]nterference, like scarcity... is a bogeyman. All resources are subject to interference in the sense that their value will decline if everyone attempts to use them at once. This is why governments recognize property rights (which include the right to exclude others from using) in resources exchanged through the marketplace. Interference will... destroy the value of any resource, but usually the government does not choose to displace the market to prevent interference. Two people cannot comfortably sit at the same time in the same desk chair. Yet this fact has not led government to parcel out the right to sit in a chair. Rather, ownership of the chair is taken to confer authority to exclude others from sitting in it, no matter how eager they may be to do so.<sup>22</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To illustrate the absurdity of both the scarcity and interference rationales for asymmetrical regulation of the broadcast industry, the authors further note: 
<p><blockquote>
	 It was as though Congress, having realized that paper is scarce and that "interference" occurs when two or more people write simultaneously on the same sheet of paper, had declared that the government owned all the paper in the United States. A Federal Paper Commission would then be necessary to decide how much paper would be available for (say) books and how much for (say) wallpaper. The Commission would further choose who was permitted to engage in book publishing.<sup>23</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Recent court and FCC decisions support these sentiments. In the 1986 case <I>Telecommunications Research & Action Center v. FCC</I>,<sup>24</sup> Judge Robert Bork, writing for a majority of the D.C. Circuit Court, argued that spectrum scarcity was a "universal fact" of economics and therefore could not serve as a valid basis for lesser First Amendment treatment of broadcasting. Likewise, in the FCC's 1987 <I>Syracuse Peace Council</I><sup>25</sup> decision revoking the Fairness Doctrine, the agency argued that when "analyzing the appropriate First Amendment standard to be applied to the electronic press, the concept of scarcity . .. .. is irrelevant."<sup>26</sup>  The Commission went on to note that "We believe the function of the electronic press in a free society is identical to that of the printed press and that, therefore, the constitutional analysis of government control of content should be no different."<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the scarcity rationale nor the interference rationale for federal spectrum management can be used credibly to support the continued socialization of spectrum or its special regulatory treatment.
<p>
<b>"Zoning" Delays Introduction of New Technologies </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the fact that neither scarcity nor interference can serve as legitimate justification for federal spectrum ownership, the FCC continues to employ the same outmoded spectrum management techniques it has used for the past seven decades. As use of the spectrum grew and new technologies developed, the FCC began to partition the spectrum into various blocks called allocations. Within each spectrum allocation, the FCC specifies how that particular block of spectrum may be utilized. FM radio, for example, is allocated a block of spectrum between 88 mhz and 108 mhz, and the commercial paging block is found between 931 mhz and 932 mhz. Broadcast television, satellite dish television, and cellular telephony all have similar block allocation arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Within each of these block allocations, the FCC then subdivides the allocation geographically. These subdivisions, known as allotments, are important because they enable spectrum to be reused in many different geographic areas. After the agency divides the spectrum into allocations and then subdivides it into geographic allotments, it parcels out specific spectrum assignments in the form of spectrum licenses. These licenses provide a specific legal right to use the spectrum, but only for the listed use. In other words, a television broadcaster is licensed only to broadcast video programming; it cannot offer cellular, paging, or other types of communications services even though there may be a large potential market for these services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, this system has proven extraordinarily inefficient and time-consuming. As the Congressional Budget Office notes:
<blockquote><p>
	Block allocations take a long time to establish, and once established are difficult to change. Difficulty in responding to changes in technologies and consumer preferences can leave parts of the spectrum underused. In some instances, a limited allocation of spectrum gives license holders control over prices and accompanying high profits or rents. Accordingly, the radio spectrum is not distributed among different users in an economically efficient way. Under the block allocation system there is no smooth path that permits spectrum to move easily from lower to higher value services.<sup>28</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This parceling system has not changed fundamentally since the FCC began managing the spectrum in the 1920s. In essence, the FCC is "zoning" the spectrum, to borrow the terminology of real estate land management. Those firms lucky enough to receive a license must be content with a single use; innovation and entrepreneurial activity are discouraged.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Worse yet, the assignment and licensing process is prone to the same criticisms economists level against all government licensing schemes. As a Progress and Freedom Foundation working group recently found, "Across-the-board, the Commission's licensing process is characterized by procrastination, equivocation, and seemingly endless delay. Unnecessary delay, ultimately found to be in the public interest, imposes enormous costs on the industry and the national economy."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, even though spectrum was reallocated in 1970 to make room for cellular services, the first experimental license was not granted by the FCC until 1977, and other commercial licenses were not granted until the early 1980s. Economists Jeffrey H. Rohlfs, Charles L. Jackson, and Tracey E. Kelly have argued that "had the FCC proceeded directly to licensing from its 1970 allocation decision, cellular licenses could have been granted as early as 1972 and systems could have become operational in 1973, a decade earlier than they were in reality."<sup>30</sup>  As a result, they estimate, this regulatory delay cost the U.S. economy $86 billion, or 2 percent of gross national product (GNP) by 1983, when cellular licensing finally began.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, such costly delays have been the norm, since licenses have been doled out to the industry through "comparative hearings" in which applicants for a license must demonstrate their worthiness to FCC bureaucrats. "Comparative hearings can be long, burdensome, and inflexible. Years can elapse as lawyers present the merits of each side," notes Citizens for a Sound Economy Vice President James Gattuso. 
<blockquote><p>
	Perhaps worse, even after this costly procedure [estimated to cost about $130,000 for the applicant and another $5,000 for the FCC<sup>32</sup>], it is often difficult or impossible for the Commission to determine which applicant will best serve the "public interest."  The Commission may find itself not only trying to decide which applicant is most sincere in its expressed desire to serve the public, and which has the financial resources to do so, but also may have to pass judgment on the applicant's entire business plan to determine it would meet the needs of consumers.<sup>33</sup> 
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the Commission must engage in <I>de facto</I> industrial policy to distribute licenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This problem was not alleviated when Congress authorized the FCC in the 1980s to begin using lotteries instead of comparative hearings to distribute licenses. Thought to be a cheaper and more rapid way to expedite licenses to the industry, lotteries simply awarded them randomly to a lucky few among the thousands of applicants. In fact, note Evan R. Kwerel and John R. Williams at the FCC's Office of Policy and Plans, "Because the cost of applying was low and the licenses were quite valuable, large numbers of applicants chose to enter the FCC lotteries. For example, there were nearly 400,000 applications for cellular licenses -- so many that the shelves broke at the FCC processing center in Gettysburg."<sup>34</sup>  Furthermore, as noted by Jonathan Blake, a partner at Covington & Burling and former President of the Federal Communications Bar Association, "because lotteries were every person's chance for a big payoff and winners routinely sold their licenses as soon as possible to real operators, it was soon observed that lotteries led to private auctions. In turn, this led to the question: why shouldn't the government conduct the auctions?"<sup>35</sup>
<p>
<b>The Auction Alternative Becomes Reality in the 1990s</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s and early 1990s, the FCC and Congress began to realize that the problems associated with comparative hearings and lotteries demanded a solution. In 1993, Congress finally gave the FCC authority to auction certain commercial uses of the spectrum, although certain types of spectrum were excluded, most notably broadcast spectrum. In general, auctions present a less costly and more efficient allocation mechanism. 
<ul><p>
<li> As the Congressional Budget Office noted in 1992, "Compared with other methods of assignment... auctions are faster, less costly to society, produce more federal revenues, and are more likely to place licenses in the hands of the applicants who value them most."<sup>36</sup> 
<p>
<li>As Peter C. Cramton of the University of Maryland notes, "Nearly every constituent benefits from auctioning the airwaves. Taxpayers, consumers, and firms are all better off with auctions. The only losers are inefficient firms, which are unsuccessful in the auctions, but have a chance in lotteries or comparative hearings."<sup>37</sup> 
<p>
<li>The superiority of auctioning over alternative allocation mechanisms is perhaps best described in the most recent <I>Economic Report of the President</I>: "When the government does not auction off but simply assigns spectrum licenses for free, it is giving away public resources worth billions of dollars. But more than revenue is at stake. Auctions can help promote economic efficiency, by ensuring that spectrum is deployed in the highest-return uses, including emerging growth industries that entail innovative technologies and services."<sup>38</sup>
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As of early February 1996, spectrum auctions have brought in over $15 billion to the U.S. Treasury. As a recent headline in <I>The New York Times</I> says, "The Sky Seems to Be the Limit."<sup>39</sup>  More important, however, hundreds of spectrum properties have been assigned much more rapidly than would have been possible using comparative hearings or lotteries.
<p>
<b>The Resistance to Auctions </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the enormous success of auctions, Congress continues to allow certain spectrum uses to escape the auction process. Specifically, due to an exemption built into the original 1993 auctioning authority, services that do not collect "compensation from subscribers," such as broadcasting, are exempted.<sup>40</sup>  The broadcast industry, which has lobbied Congress intensely to win and keep this provision, does not want auctions to be applied uniformly to all new uses of spectrum because it would force broadcasters to pay for additional spectrum licenses they are set to receive free of charge from the FCC in the near future as part of a plan put in place a few years ago by the Commission. 
<P>
<b>The Taxpayer Cost of Limits on Auctions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The value of the spectrum to be given away has been estimated by the FCC to be somewhere between $10 billion to $70 billion. Yet the recently passed Telecommunications Act of 1996 did not alter this plan by demanding auctions. Instead of making tens of billions available for deficit reduction or taxpayer relief through auction of this spectrum, Congress will force Americans to shell out more of their own money to pay down the national debt while broadcasters receive a free handout of spectrum assets. Worse yet, by giving additional spectrum away to broadcasters, Congress will not equalize the treatment of communications providers; in practice, it will create a highly uneven telecommunications playing field.<sup>41</sup>  The unfairness of this giveaway is summarized by <I>Los Angeles Times</I> columnist Michael Schrage: "Do we give farmers free farmland when they want to grow new kinds of crops?  So why should the FCC give spectrum to broadcasters who want to grow new business?"<sup>42</sup>  Schrage argues it would be "like giving the Baby Bells and the cable companies `free' fiber optics as they rewire America."<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although this blatant example of corporate welfare became an issue during the waning days of the battle over the comprehensive telecom bill early this year, it did not prevent the legislation's eventual passage, although Senate Majority Leader Dole did hold out for promises of hearings and introduction of a bill this year to rectify this situation.
<P>
<b>Why Auctions Alone Are Not Enough</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is important to note that auctions alone cannot solve the "zoning" problem discussed above. As Hazlett notes, "while auctions can distribute licenses in a relatively low-cost manner, they do nothing to distribute spectrum more efficiently. The federal government still micromanages markets, protecting the interests of incumbent licensees and doling out entry rights to new players only after years of frustration and struggle."<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, while it was wise of Congress and the FCC to move forward with auctions in 1993, Congress should not have allowed the FCC to limit the use of auctioned spectrum merely to personal communications services (PCS) uses. Instead, winning bidders should have been given the right to use purchased spectrum however they wished. Likewise, if Congress decides to reverse its current position and go forward with auctions of additional broadcast spectrum licenses, it should not require the FCC to box winning bidders into providing certain types of digital broadcast programming that may be technologically irrelevant in a few years. Achieving maximum efficient use of the spectrum resource means granting full flexibility in use to winning bidders -- in fact, to all spectrum users.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In sum, the FCC should not be selling licenses at all. It should be selling property rights. Licenses traditionally have restricted use, while property rights would define boundaries within which owners could use their allocations in any way they thought economically efficient and profitable. Moreover, a regime of auctions and property rights could encourage a number of alternative uses for many spectrum licenses, unlike the current system, which is too rigid to allow innovative alternatives to develop freely. As Coase explained in 1959:
<blockquote><P>
	Quite apart from the misallocations which are the result of political pressures, an administrative agency which attempts to perform the function normally carried out by the pricing mechanism operates under two handicaps. First of all, it lacks the precise monetary measure of benefit and cost provided by the market. Second, it cannot, by the nature of things, be in possession of all the relevant information possessed by the managers of every business which uses or might use radio frequencies, to say nothing of the preferences of consumers for the various goods and services in the production of which radio frequencies could be used.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thirty-six years later, Peter Pitsch, an adjunct fellow at the <a href="/pff">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a> and former chief of staff at the FCC, testified before Congress that this was still the case: "[T]he FCC like other central planners lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. [D]etermining efficient use is a complex task requiring vast amounts of continually updated information that is hopelessly beyond the abilities of the administrative process."<sup>46</sup>  In addition, Pitsch notes that this problem has grown worse with time since, "In the case of spectrum, the information required to make the necessary tradeoffs is greater than in most other areas of the economy, because the pace of technological development has created a raft of new uses for wireless communications and new ways in which spectrum can be efficiently deployed."<sup>47</sup>
<p>
<h4>SIDE EFFECTS OF FEDERAL SPECTRUM MISMANAGEMENT: THE "PUBLIC INTEREST" STANDARD AND CONTENT REGULATION</h4>
<hr> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic costs associated with federal spectrum mismanagement are high. Equally as damaging, however, is the degree to which federal regulators have used their authority to intrude on licensees' ability to operate freely once they have received their allocations.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As mentioned earlier, when the Radio Act of 1927 became law, federal regulators were given the power to issue licenses if they found it was in the "public interest, convenience, or necessity."  This meant that regulators were given broad discretion when determining who would receive a license and how they could use that license. Unfortunately, the term "public interest" has never been clearly defined. As Coase noted over 35 years ago, "The phrase... lacks any definite meaning. Furthermore, the many inconsistencies in Commission decisions have made it impossible for the phrase to acquire a definite meaning in the process of regulation."<sup>48</sup>  More recently, critics have pointed out that regulation in the "public interest" has come to mean whatever regulators want it to mean at a given time.<sup>49</sup>  Hence, the "public interest" or "public trustee" model of regulation that sprang up around broadcasting gave regulators the ability to exert unusual influence and require that special demands be met as a condition of license renewal.<sup>50</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For example, using the public interest rationale as a defense, in 1949 the FCC instituted the inappropriately named fairness doctrine. This doctrine required radio and television broadcasters to "afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views of public importance."<sup>51</sup>  Instead of promoting the discussion of conflicting views and free speech in general, however, the fairness doctrine stifled it. In fact, over the span of its 40-year existence, it has been used as a tool of blatant political intimidation and influence backed by the threat of license revocation for failure to comply with the political whims of the day.<sup>52</sup>  The Reagan Administration FCC repealed the doctrine in 1987, citing First Amendment concerns and the fact that program diversity (informational, educational, religious, and entertainment fare) had increased steadily over time.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Likewise, the public trustee model has allowed the FCC both to demand that broadcasters restrict the amount of commercial airtime during children's viewing hours and to require that they air greater amounts of children's programming. Congress made this worse when it passed the Children's Television Act of 1990, which encouraged the FCC to expand regulations demanding a certain minimum number of hours of children's programming.<sup>53</sup>  Despite the noble intentions of policymakers and regulators intent on improving broadcast quality, these efforts have proven futile, even counterproductive. Because the public trustee social compact between broadcasters and regulators is kept intact by noble-minded but ineffective rules, industry competition is discouraged. If Congress continues to be content with half-hearted efforts to squeeze the most out of this regulatory arrangement, broadcast quality will never improve substantially. It is only greater competition within the field of video programming, not more restrictive social compacts and regulations, that can ensure improvement in the overall quality of broadcast fare over time. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Making a Mockery of the First Amendment.</b> Even worse, such rules create an unfortunate schism within communication jurisprudence by ignoring First Amendment protections. Although most government attempts to impose prior restraints or requirements on speech constitute a <I>prima facie</I> violation of the First Amendment's mandate that "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press,"<I>54</I> holders of spectrum allocations do not enjoy similar speech protections.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Basically, once federal regulators rejected property rights and chose instead the public interest paradigm, they found it easier to regulate the electronic press (such as television and radio) in ways they could not regulate the print press (such as newspapers, magazines, and newsletters). As Krattenmaker and Powe argue, "by adopting public ownership of the spectrum and administrative control over its uses, Congress chose a legal regime for broadcasting that differs radically from the law that governs every other mass communications medium in the United States. Congress thus put its imprimatur on the twin myths that scarcity and interference are phenomena unique to broadcasting and that scarcity and interference necessitate administrative control of the quality of broadcasts."<sup>55</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consequently, although the print press traditionally has been accorded strict First Amendment protection from government efforts to manipulate speech and content, the electronic press has been accorded only secondary rights.<sup>56</sup>  First Amendment scholar Timothy Dyk notes that "it is reasonably clear that none of the programming rules or policies [applied to broadcasters] would be constitutional if applied to the print press."<sup>57</sup>  Timothy Dyk points to a number of cases that have invalidated legislative attempts to demand access to print media.<sup>58</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Therefore, Krattenmaker and Powe contend that content regulations such as the fairness doctrine, the Children's Television Act of 1990, and other similar rules should be repealed because "no proffered distinction for treating broadcasting differently from print justifies a different regulatory regime. Accordingly, all content regulation of broadcasting that could not be similarly applied to print or other mass communications media properly ought to be regarded as impermissible under the First Amendment."<sup>59</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Regulators like to pretend they do not violate First Amendment standards. They argue that they are only operating within their statutorily defined powers to issue and renew spectrum licenses under the public interest standard they have sworn to uphold. Yet the license renewal process itself gives the government the ability to censor by threatening license revocation or fines. Although this is rare, it has occurred. It is the equivalent of regulatory extortion and flies in the face of traditional First Amendment thinking, because the government has no more right to demand certain types of speech than it has to restrict them.<sup>60</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A final and equally unacceptable justification for differential First Amendment treatment of broadcasters is that an individual or firm must obtain a license from the FCC before starting a broadcast station, whereas this is not the case with newspapers, magazines, newsletters, and the like. Yet, as mentioned above, licensing itself represented the first unjustifiable intervention by government into this arena and therefore cannot be used credibly to justify further mischief by federal regulators. If a property rights regime had been allowed to develop, no differential treatment would be allowed by the courts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Furthermore, even if one accepts that there might be some role for the government in licensing spectrum, it does not follow that government should regulate its use as it now does. As noted legal commentator and newspaper columnist Bruce Fein says, "A lawyer needs a license to practice law, yet the government does not force a lawyer to spend equal time defending clients of opposite views. It is patently absurd to suggest that a license requirement in an industry is enough to allow the taking away of First Amendment rights."<sup>61</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hence, it is only the continuing belief in the scarcity rationale of federal spectrum management that continues to prop up this unconstitutional house of cards. If this rationale were rejected by the courts, all content regulations would likely fall as well. Although the scarcity rationale has been cited numerous times by the courts and Congress to justify content regulation of electronic media,<sup>62</sup> given the combination of its technological irrelevance and the recognition by the courts and many academics that it fails to justify broadcasting's unique treatment, it obviously no longer serves to justify content regulation.<sup>63</sup>
<p>
<h4>FOUR STEPS TO A FREE MARKET IN SPECTRUM</h4>
<hr>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If policymakers want to bring an end to this disastrous system of spectrum management, piecemeal reforms will not help. Only radical reform can succeed. The four key components of comprehensive and revolutionary spectrum reform are as follows:
<ol><p>
<li><b>Provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum.</b>
<blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Current holders of spectrum should be granted full flexibility to provide whatever type of service they want, however they want, whenever they want to consumers. There is no justification for continuing the rigid zoning restrictions on spectrum use that have evolved through seven decades of bureaucratic mismanagement. Americans are being denied access to countless innovative goods and services simply because spectrum holders have no incentive or ability to offer them. Although the opportunity costs associated with such rigid regulations are unquantifiable, it is reasonable to assume the U.S. economy is losing billions of dollars of economic activity. Providing full spectrum flexibility therefore will guarantee an increase in jobs, exports, and overall economic output. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, as long as spectrum remains a quasi-socialized public resource, it cannot be allocated efficiently or put to the best possible use. In essence, government cannot manage something as complex as the electromagnetic spectrum efficiently because bureaucratic processes are not suited to the task. What is needed, beyond flexibility in use, is a proven allocation mechanism that allows more effective utilization of the spectrum resource. A property right in the spectrum is the answer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to granting full flexibility in use, Congress could privatize the wireless spectrum by giving current holders a property right in their allocation. This means spectrum holders would no longer lease their allocation from the federal government, but instead would own it outright -- able to use it (or sell it) as they see fit. This also means that all arbitrary federal regulatory oversight of the spectrum would end. Federal regulators would be responsible only for enforcing technical trespass violations and disputes that arose between adjoining holders of spectrum.<sup>64</sup>
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Expand the auction and allocation process.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Auctions should be applied across the board to every spectrum use for which there is a mutually exclusive claim or that has not yet been allocated by the government. Congress should create the following three-step process by which spectrum can be allocated more effectively and auctioned off to move toward a property rights regime:
<p><blockquote>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 1: Efficiently assign and allocate underutilized spectrum.</b> Currently, much of the spectrum managed by the FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration is undistributed or underutilized.<sup>65</sup>  Large and valuable parcels that could be deployed for private sector use by the FCC, and especially by the NTIA, are lying dormant or are hoarded by less efficient users. Congress should demand that unallocated private-sector spectrum and underutilized public spectrum be allocated immediately. In essence, any time a party files for claim to such spectrum, that party should be granted the right to use it as it sees fit. However, when competing claims for the same spectrum allocation exist, or when the public sector refuses to give up spectrum, the following two steps will be necessary.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 2: Mandate that auctions be used where any competing claim for spectrum exists.</b> For all potential uses of spectrum for which there are competing claims, auctions should be utilized to allocate the spectrum. Firms would file plans of their bidding proposals with the FCC and then post bonds proving they have enough capital to bid credibly for the given allocation. The Commission also could establish competitive bidding rules (as it did in past PCS auctions) to ensure that bidding collusion does not take place. These auctions would not be limited to one-time events, but would be ongoing as spectrum claims developed and multiplied.<sup>66</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This policy should be employed for all new mutually exclusive claims for use of a particular spectrum allocation. This includes the rights to the second six-megahertz digital channel that broadcasters have requested. Although pressure from broadcaster groups will make it difficult politically to support such an auction, it would be fundamentally unfair for Congress to give such valuable property away while others are forced to compete for their desired spectrum in the open market. In addition, once broadcasters have been given complete operating flexibility, they can use their current six-megahertz allocation to convert to digital television however and whenever they feel it is appropriate. Furthermore, broadcasters and others can borrow against the value of their spectrum to raise funds to purchase any new spectrum they feel is needed to do business. Finally, the auction of this spectrum should not be restricted to any specific type of use, whether it be broadcasting or even more sophisticated digital types of transmission. Congress should make it clear to the FCC that the spectrum being auctioned can be used for whatever purpose buyers desire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>STEP 3: Provide incentives for the public sector to release additional spectrum.</b> Most important, Congress must disgorge much more spectrum from the public sector. One way to facilitate this process without demanding full knowledge of what they are doing with their spectrum is to create a simple incentive mechanism that would give agencies holding the spectrum a cut of the auction proceeds. For example, if the Department of Defense knew that it had been warehousing sizable portions of spectrum that it could afford to release, it might do so voluntarily if it knew it would receive, say, 15 to 25 percent of the auction proceeds. Beyond such incentives, Congress may find it necessary to demand that certain blocks of public spectrum be released immediately to the FCC for private auction, just as it was for previous PCS auctions.
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Redefine (or define for the first time) the "public interest" standard and ensure that First Amendment protections are provided equally to all media.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For over six decades, unconstrained spectrum regulation in the name of the "public interest" has demonstrated that what the FCC determines arbitrarily is in the public interest rarely is truly in the best interests of consumers. The reason is simple: Regulators, not consumers, are making the decision. Congress should scrap this fraudulent public interest paradigm entirely. If, however, lawmakers insist on continuing to rely on public interest FCC oversight, they should define the standard clearly in law. The new definition should focus on three specific criteria:
<p><blockquote><ul>
<li> The maximization of consumer welfare via the broadening of the general scope of individual decision-making within telecommunications markets;
<p>
<li>The utilization of market processes instead of regulatory proceedings whenever possible; and
<p>
<li> The full protection of First Amendment rights and equal First Amendment treatment of all communications media, whether print or electronic.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This "consumer welfare" standard would serve the interests of all Americans. It would guarantee that the federal bureaucracy is not in a position to manipulate and coerce spectrum holders into doing things they do not wish to. On the other hand, it would ensure that no spectrum holder is able to capture the regulatory apparatus and use it to exclude competitors.
</blockquote><p>
<li><b> Transfer remaining spectrum authority from the FCC and NTIA to an independent body. </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once the previous steps have been taken, the need for spectrum oversight by the FCC or the NTIA will be minimized. Because the NTIA soon may be abolished, all spectrum management should be removed from it immediately. Once property rights are established, remaining spectrum responsibilities (enforcement of technical trespass or nuisance violations) could be handled just as effectively by a smaller Spectrum Coordination Council or Board. The Board or Council would sit in the executive branch and be made up of no more than approximately 50 spectrum engineers, economists, and lawyers. The courts would play an important role in the adjudication of spectrum disputes, and private industry groups would be responsible for a large portion of self-regulation, as they are now. Finally, the Board or Council would represent American interests in international meetings or disputes over spectrum allocations so that all remaining authority over such global issues can be transferred from the Department of State.
<p></ol>
<h4>CONCLUSION</h4><hr>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Seven decades of federal spectrum ownership and management have met with predictable failure. While virtually all other resources have been left to private owners to manage in America's free enterprise system, spectrum has remained a quasi-socialized resource. The result: Other resources have been deployed and utilized far more efficiently and effectively while spectrum innovation and entrepreneurialism continue to be held captive by federal regulation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Spectrum socialism should end -- and must end -- if the United States hopes to remain on the cutting edge of wireless innovation. Policymakers must look beyond their myopic focus on older wireline industries and find new ways to encourage entrepreneurship in the wireless arena. Property rights in spectrum will guarantee such a result, since only by granting spectrum holders full flexibility and ownership in their allocation can policymakers expect to witness such a dramatic transformation. Unleashing the spectrum is the only way to ensure that this transformation is successful and the communications revolution is complete.

Therefore, "When a commission is responsible for the performance of an industry, it is under never completely escapable pressure to protect the health of the companies it regulates, to assure a desirable performance by relying on those monopolistic chosen instruments and its own controls rather than on the unplanned and unplannable forces of competition."

<li>    Many decades later, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) assumed responsibility for the management and allocation of all spectrum utilized by the federal government.<p>
<li>    The scarcity rationale was developed primarily through a series of court cases and FCC decisions over the past six decades. Most notably in <I>NBC v. United States</I>, 319 U.S. 190 (1943), <I>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC</I>, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), and <I>CBS v. FCC</I>, 453 U.S. 367 (1981), the Supreme Court argued that scarcity made broadcasting a unique business and that this demanded special treatment to guarantee "the public interest" would be served. Yet the courts also noted similar restrictions on the print medium would be an unconstitutional violation of the First Amendment. See <I>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo</I>, 418 U.S. 241 (1974). Likewise, recent court cases have held that cable television must be accorded more strict First Amendment protections than broadcast, even though cable is also an electronic medium. See <I>Home Box Office, Inc. v. FCC</I>, 567 F. 2d 9 (D.C. Cir. 1977); <I>Midwest Video Corp. v. FCC</I>, (8th Cir. 1978); <I>Quincy Cable TV, Inc. v. FCC</I>, 768 F. 2d 1434 (D.C. Cir. 1985). These cases all were heard by lower courts, however, as the Supreme Court has refused continually to hear such cases. This is due most likely to the fact that the Court realizes technological innovation continues to obliterate traditional media boundaries, making court decisions based on the scarcity rationale increasingly confusing and unjustifiable.<p>

<li>    This does not mean, however, that broadcasters put up a serious fight to end the public trustee paradigm. In fact, on one hand they speak of its importance to ensure that viable competitors are kept out of their market, while on the other they cite its intrusiveness as an excuse to produce mediocre programming. As Henry Geller, fellow at the Markle Foundation, notes, "A broadcaster loves to be considered a public interest figure. Broadcasters generally want the economic benefits of being a public fiduciary without having to meet the burden of adhering to public interest content regulation."

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;During the past year, House and Senate Republicans have been working tirelessly to enact a balanced budget plan that gives America's families much-needed tax relief.<sup>1</sup>  Simultaneously, they have devised a plan to deregulate the U.S. telecommunications industry, freeing it from over six decades of regulatory red tape.<sup>2</sup>  Unfortunately, these efforts 
have come into conflict because the telecom bill potentially would cheat American families and 
taxpayers out of tens of billions of dollars of tax relief merely to appease special interests within the 
multibillion-dollar broadcast industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Buried deep in the almost 300-page telecom bill, which stalled after a tentative conference  agreement was reached, is a clause requiring that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) carry out an ill-conceived plan giving America's broadcast industry additional licenses to use part of  the electromagnetic spectrum to broadcast digital television services. Broadcasters already possess licenses which allow them to provide the traditional analog television programming with which 
most Americans are familiar; now they have convinced Congress and the FCC to give them 
additional licenses to make the transition to superior resolution digital television free-of-charge 
until they can give back their old spectrum licenses for auctioning some time in the future. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) has intervened at the last minute and raised serious questions about the fairness of such an enormous giveaway of federal spectrum property without taxpayer compensation. As he told <i>The New York Times</i> recently, "This is a big, big corporate welfare project. Here we're cutting Medicaid and doing all the painful things while we lend [broadcasters] the spectrum for 12 years. Why shouldn't they pay for it?"<sup>3</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, at a time when Congress is working to balance the federal budget while providing families 
and investors with tax relief, it is ironic that it should give away such a valuable asset to some of the 
wealthiest companies in the country. Experts at the FCC have estimated that auctioning the 
spectrum that broadcasters are demanding could raise as much as $70 billion. To put this into 
perspective, $70 billion would pay for:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Three years of the congressionally approved $500-per-child tax credit that benefits 28 million 
families raising 51 million children.
<p>
<li> The entire economic growth tax package proposed by Congress, including the capital gains tax 
cut.
<p>
<li> $70 billion in debt reduction that would save taxpayers nearly $3 billion each year in interest 
payments on the national debt.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With agreement almost reached on the House and Senate telecommunications bills (H.R. 1555 and 
S. 652), this represents what may be the last chance to alter a disastrous policy which combines the 
worst elements of corporate welfare and industrial policy at the expense of American taxpayers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>A Misguided and Costly Plan.</b> Many things are wrong with this plan. First, it represents 
arrogant industrial planning on the part of the federal government. Legislators and FCC bureaucrats 
are arguing in essence that a single digital broadcast television channel should emerge to replace the 
current analog channel Americans are used to receiving from major networks. This is the equivalent 
of industrial planning, since federal policymakers in effect are attempting to determine a specific 
outcome within the highly innovative telecommunications industry. No one knows what type of 
video services will be demanded or even viable in the future. But, instead of letting the market 
decide, policymakers are trying to pre-determine the shape of competition within the broadcast 
video marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, broadcasters have justified this giveaway by appealing to false fears and technological 
misperceptions. The truth is, broadcasting can survive without a handout. Someone always will find 
a way to deliver television video programming to consumers at affordable rates. If incumbent 
broadcasters feel they really need additional spectrum to compete with their many new rivals 
(cable, satellite television, on-line computer services, for example), they can purchase it on the open 
market in an auction like everyone else. It is difficult to sympathize with firms like the Walt Disney 
Co. (which just spent $19 billion to acquire ABC) and Westinghouse Electric Corp. (which spent 
$5 billion for CBS) when they plead impoverishment as a defense.<sup> 4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, broadcasters also argue that failure to give them a handout will mean the death of "free over 
the air television."  They apparently want legislators to believe that Americans would rather shell 
out billions more in taxes for deficit reduction than spend the small amount that may be required to 
purchase certain video services from competing providers. The idea that television service will be 
too expensive for Americans to afford without a giveaway is a straw man; competition, not 
corporate handouts, will provide more and better quality television programming at extremely 
affordable rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This leads to the fourth and most outrageous broadcast industry justification for the spectrum 
giveaway: that without it, they will not be able to continue to deliver a host of quality "public 
interest" services to the consumer. In other words, they can continue to air quality children's 
programming and other educational fare only if the government gives them additional free licenses. 
This is a questionable justification for free additional spectrum licenses, however, given that 
broadcasters have been criticized so severely in the past precisely for the mediocre quality of their 
television broadcasts. Apparently, they now expect Congress and the American people to ignore 
just how poorly they have lived up to their "public interest" obligations and instead give them just 
one more chance to prove themselves, albeit at substantial cost to the taxpayer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, other spectrum users are justifiably angry at being forced to spend billions in recent 
auctions of other spectrum licenses for non-broadcast services. Cellular firms, telephone 
companies, the cable industry, and other communications companies are asking why broadcasters 
are receiving free spectrum properties from the government when they have been forced to pay on 
the open market in recent auctions for additional spectrum. To date, these auctions have raised 
almost $10 billion for the U.S. Treasury. This is $10 billion less that American taxpayers and 
families will have to pay to help reduce the deficit. Yet the broadcasters, using specious arguments 
and blatant political influence, have convinced Congress to forgo an additional $10 billion to $70 
billion in spectrum revenues and just give this spectrum away to their industry without taxpayer 
compensation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Overwhelming Opposition to Multibillion Dollar "Rip-Off."</b>  Although this giveaway 
has gone largely unnoticed by the public, many critics on both the left and right have voiced their 
opposition. <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> labeled it "a multi-billion dollar handout for wealthy 
TV-station owners," and warned that Republican capitulation on the issue would be "wildly at odds 
with their anti-entitlement ideology."<sup>5</sup>   The <i>Journal</i> also remarks that this giveaway is all the more remarkable since this is a Congress "desperately scrambling to balance the budget, making 
its job harder by voluntarily forgoing billions in spectrum auction revenues."<sup>6</sup>  Karen 
Kerrigan, president of the <a href="/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, also refers to 
the plan as "one of the greatest government giveaways in history," and notes that it "reflects 
wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset."<sup>7 </sup>  Liberal public-interest groups such as the 
Consumer Federation of America, People for the American Way, and the Media Access Project 
also have expressed opposition.<sup> 8</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to <i>Time</i> magazine, "The spectrum handout is a classic example of how 
government subsidies live on after their rationales have expired."<sup>9 </sup>  The editorial page 
of <i>The New York Times</i> also sides with Senator Dole in his effort to stop the "big 
giveaway," arguing that "Mr. Dole is taking the right action to protect taxpayers."<sup>10</sup>  
And <i>Times</i> columnist William Safire calls the giveaway "an outrageous taxpayer rip-
off."<sup>11</sup>  "This rip-off is on a scale vaster than dreamed of by yesteryear's robber barons. 
It's as if each American family is to be taxed $1,000 to enrich the stockholders of Disney, G.E. and 
Westinghouse."<sup>12 </sup>  That is exactly what is about to take place.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Families and Investors Will Pay the Price.</b> As mentioned above, it is unlikely that 
broadcasters will be put out of business if forced to bid on spectrum rights through competitive 
auction. However, if taxpayers are cheated out of a significant portion of the tax cuts promised 
them as an element of the balanced budget, they will be hurt significantly. <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi83.html">Economic analysis</a> 
conducted by Heritage Foundation economists shows that the tax cut element of the Balanced 
Budget Act of 1995 would add some $1,500 per household in higher GDP than the same plan 
without tax cuts. Also, household income would be increased on average by nearly 
$2,000.<sup>13</sup>  There is no justification for forcing individual families and the economy in 
general to lose these benefits while a few well-connected companies benefit from free spectrum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Answer is to Auction.</b> Even if the auctions did not pull in the full $70 billion, 
anything raised to offset the deficit and lower the burden on American taxpayers and families 
would be worth the effort. But it is very likely an auction of this taxpayer property would generate 
such revenues. The spectrum being given away is among the most valuable in the government's 
possession, since it can be used for multiple applications, not just television broadcasting. William 
Safire has even noted that these numbers may be too low, arguing that the sale of additional 
spectrum eventually could raise a staggering half-trillion dollars for the U.S. 
Treasury.<sup>14</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Equally as important will be the effect of an auction on competition within the entire 
telecommunications industry. Selling off the spectrum will ensure it is put to its most highly valued 
use and mean more competition throughout the industry. As Peter C. Cramton of the University of 
Maryland notes: "Nearly every constituent benefits from auctioning the airwaves. Taxpayers, 
consumers, and firms are all better off with auctions. The only losers are inefficient firms, which 
are unsuccessful in the auctions, but have a chance in lotteries or comparative 
hearings."<sup>15</sup>  Like lotteries and comparative hearings, which have been used by the 
FCC to distribute TV licenses in the past, this current giveaway would sacrifice market efficiency 
to special-interest influence. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Clearly, however, the most important aspect of such an auction would be what it would do for 
American taxpayers and families -- lower the burden the federal deficit places upon them. Again, as 
Cramton argues, "The auction outcome is compelling to taxpayers. So long as budget deficits 
remain a problem, it is hard to imagine that Congress would be able to reverse the auction decision 
without setting off a grass-roots rebellion among taxpayers."<sup>16</sup>  Yet this is exactly 
what is about to occur. If policymakers want to do what is in the best interests of American 
taxpayers and families, they must look beyond the self-interested motivations and misperceptions 
being put forward by the multibillion-dollar broadcast industry, which has nothing to lose and 
everything to gain by taking valuable taxpayer property without compensation.

<a href="#five">FIVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL TRULY DEREGULATORY</a><br>
<a href="#conclusion">CONCLUSION</a><p>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

	Following the recent Senate passage of S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition 
and Deregulation Act of 1995, the House of Representatives is ready to act on companion 
legislation, H.R. 1555, the Communications Act of 1995. The chief sponsors of this legislation 
are Representatives Thomas Bliley (R-VA), John Dingell (D-MI), and Jack Fields (R-TX). 
Unfortunately, like the Senate bill, the House bill fails to take the many important steps needed 
to deregulate, completely and comprehensively, all aspects of this industry. Worse yet, the House 
bill actually adds new regulatory powers to an already bloated federal bureaucracy. If Congress 
hopes to produce landmark deregulatory telecommunications legislation this year, the House 
must make important changes in the bill.<p>

<a name="what's"></a><h4>WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG WITH THE BILL</h4><p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents</a> ]<p>
	Although H.R. 1555 does include some positive incremental improvements in current 
law, it needs to go much further to achieve real reform. The bill takes important steps toward 
liberalizing the telecommunications market. For example, like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1555:<p> 
<b>
<ul>
 <li>Eliminates many important barriers to industry-wide competition in both voice and 
video markets,

 <li>Provides incentives to open the traditionally uncompetitive local market to competition,

  <li>Eliminates elements of the 1992 Cable Act, and

  <li>Somewhat liberalizes broadcast ownership restrictions.
</ul>
</b>
However, the legislation also is riddled with unnecessary regulation and new mandates. For 
instance, the bill purports to establish a framework to minimize bureaucracy and regulation, yet 
contains well over 100 new rule-making provisions for the Federal Communications 
Commission alone. According to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, the agency "will need substantial 
resources" to implement the legislation. "We'll need economists, statisticians, and business 
school graduates." (1)  Testifying at a June 19 House hearing, Hundt noted the agency would need a 
substantial increase in funding next year because passage of the legislation would put the agency 
"on the verge of a prodigiously detailed undertaking." (2)<p>  
	This beefed-up activity may be the type of "deregulation" that FCC bureaucrats like, but 
it is very different from what most industry experts and consumers would view as true 
deregulation.<p>

	Among its disturbing regulatory provisions, H.R. 1555:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Establishes excessive entry tests for Baby Bell companies seeking to enter long-distance 
markets.</b> Before removing outdated restrictions on Baby Bell entrance into the long-distance 
market, H.R. 1555 requires the companies to meet a series of standards to prove their local 
market is open to competition. Yet, the bill contains a perverse incentive that makes meeting 
these standards very difficult.<p>

	Before the Bells are deregulated, they must prove they face regional "facilities-based 
competitors" that offer comparable network service to both business and residential 
customers. However, they also must prove they are providing access to their own networks at 
"economically feasible rates" to allow competitors to resale service through the Bell 
infrastructure. This would create a perverse incentive, because competitors are unlikely to 
build a competing network if they can resale off the Bells' network at low rates. Competitors 
will find it more profitable to resale instead of building the competing infrastructure that 
needs to be present for the Bells to pass the "facilities-based" test. Consequently, Bell entry 
into long distance may be delayed for some time.<p>

		Another bill passed by the House Judiciary Committee could further complicate this 
process if it is included in H.R. 1555. The Antitrust Consent Decree Reform Act of 1995 
(H.R. 1528), sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), would add a role for the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) in determining whether a Bell should be granted access to the 
long-distance market. Basically, the DOJ could deny Bells access to that market if it found 
there was a "dangerous probability" they could monopolize another market. Combined with 
the excessively bureaucratic test already contained in H.R. 1555, this would place almost 
insurmountable obstacles on the path to operating freedom. Furthermore, consumers would 
be denied access to new competitors and their services.<p>

 <li><b>Requires that a separate subsidiary be established each time a telephone company 
wants to enter a new line of business</b>. Before a Baby Bell can enter long-distance, video 
services, or electronic publishing markets, it must establish an entirely separate entity to 
deliver that service. This means unnecessary duplication of facilities and staff, higher 
operating costs, and lower overall efficiency. The Bells should be allowed to enter a new line 
of business in any manner they find efficient and profitable, just as any other business can.<p>

  <li><b>Fails to eliminate barriers to international investment.</b>  Although an amendment to H.R. 
1555 allows some opening of the American market to foreign investment, such beneficial 
activity still would be delayed while the executive branch determined whether it was 
warranted. This would give provide American firms time to delay the liberalization process 
to discourage additional competition. Outright repeal would ensure a steady increase in the 
flow of capital to the American telecommunications market and a subsequent increase in job 
opportunities, just as free trade has accomplished in such other areas as computers and 
automobiles.<p>

  <li><b>Expands telecommunications entitlements.</b>  Like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1555 expands 
uncompetitive and ineffective subsidies that flow to corporations instead of to individuals. 
The bill contains broad, open-ended mandates for the FCC and the states to design and 
deliver a more extensive package of communications services to all Americans, in part by 
manipulating the rates consumers pay for those services. <p>

		For example, subsidies generally flow from long-distance to local users, business to 
residential users, and urban to rural users. These overlapping cross-subsidies have destroyed 
industry competition by discouraging market entry, since few potential competitors have the 
capital necessary to take on the subsidized firms. (3)  By artificially elevating prices in the long-
distance market, these subsidies have cost society between $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year 
in higher prices. (4)  Because the House plan preserves and expands many of these mechanisms, 
it distorts market competition and fails to ensure access to more innovative and truly price-
competitive services. (5)<p>

  <li><b>Fails to move toward complete privatization of the radio spectrum.</b> By missing another 
chance to denationalize the government-owned national resource of radio spectrum, the bill 
fails to open the wireless world to even more vigorous competition. Although making some 
minor modifications in FCC licensing authority and relaxing some ownership restrictions, 
H.R. 1555 makes no effort to create property rights in spectrum ownership or to allow 
holders of spectrum the flexibility to use their spectrum as they choose. Spectrum holders 
now can use their allocation only for purposes defined by the FCC. For example, the holder 
of a television station spectrum license may not convert that station into a cellular telephone 
system even if it would be more efficient and profitable to do so. H.R. 1555 does nothing to 
rectify this inefficient policy.<p>

  <li><b>Makes no serious attempt to minimize bureaucracy.</b> Instead of taking the opportunity to 
eliminate entire branches and bureaus of the FCC, the bill will lead instead to an increase in 
the size and power of the federal bureaucracy overseeing the communications industry. The 
FCC will be responsible for the administration of numerous new transitional rules and 
regulations. This will prevent deregulation from proceeding rapidly, because the agency 
works against market liberalization. (6)<p>

	In addition to these many flaws, the bill fails to remove all rate and price regulation; fails 
to lift unnecessary licensing and tariffing requirements; (7)  fails to allow utilities into 
telecommunications markets they currently are prohibited from entering; fails to define what it 
means to regulate "in the public interest" even though many important decisions hinge on such a 
determination; (8)  and fails to include any mention of the First Amendment.<p>

	The legislative approach being taken by the Senate and House is most appropriately 
labeled "deregulatory industrial policy." Supporters of deregulatory industrial policy are 
convinced they can "create" competition in the telecom industry by rigging the rules of the game 
to achieve desired results. Countless safeguards, transitional rules, and continued protections for 
certain industry segments remain in the bills, supposedly to create a "fair playing field." True 
deregulation, on the other hand, would remove the many unnecessary regulations that constrain 
the industry without adding numerous new rules in the process.<p>

	Although creating a more competitive communications market is a desirable goal, it is 
unlikely the existing regulatory apparatus is up to the task. The FCC and state regulatory 
commissions have done more to destroy competitive opportunities than to create them. And it is 
these institutions that will be charged with creating "competition" under the current Senate and 
House approach. Telecommunications' sister industry --  computers  -- is a good example of how 
competition can develop without centralized direction, regulation, or subsidy. Market power is 
constrained by vigorous technological innovation and consumer choice -- not by arbitrary 
bureaucratic edict. This should be the model for telecommunications.<p>
</ul>



  	



<a name="five"></a><h4>FIVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL TRULY DEREGULATORY</h4>
<p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents </a>]<p>
Despite these weaknesses in the bill, proponents argue correctly that it represents 
an improvement over the status quo. But the House should strengthen the framework 
established in H.R. 1555 by more completely and effectively deregulating the industry. 
Five simple changes would accomplish this.
<p>
<b>Change #1: Mandatory Forbearance and the "Most Favored Regulation" Clause</b>
The addition of a mandatory forbearance clause would relieve competitive carriers 
from all regulation and open the market to unconstrained competition. A competitive 
carrier would be defined as any carrier facing either actual or impending rivalry. In 
markets where competition is less pervasive, such as the residential telephone market, 
regulatory constraints would remain in effect until a pre-determined list of requirements 
like those found in the bill is met. For example, after completing the "checklist" 
requirements, Baby Bell companies would be considered competitive and therefore 
eligible for forbearance from regulation.
<p>
The addition of mandatory forbearance should include a "most favored 
regulation" clause similar to the most favored nation (MFN) treatment accorded by global free trade agreements. Countries that are granted MFN treatment can import their goods on identical terms as other countries. In other words, MFN requires non-discriminatory legal treatment in trade. 
<p>
This same concept can be applied to ensure non-discriminatory regulatory treatment of competing providers and technologies in telecommunications markets. Once a carrier seeks to offer a new service, it can be regulated no more stringently than its least regulated competitor. Such a provision would ensure regulatory parity within 
telecommunications markets as the lines between existing technologies begin to blur.
<p>
<b>Change #2: Mandatory Sunsetting of New Rules After Two to Three Years</b>
A second important change in H.R. 1555 recognizes that while there may be a 
need for transitional rules, they should be phased out as quickly as possible. Although the bill clearly contains too many transitional rules, some will probably remain. For these, the House should include language sunsetting their applicability after a two- or three-year transition period. Any perceived need for their continued existence will have to be dealt with in subsequent legislation or the rules will become invalid.
<p>
<b>Change #3: Devolving Telecommunications Entitlements</b>
This change would create a more sensible method of subsidization by transferring full authority over the definition and delivery of universal service to the states, thereby ensuring a more geographically tailored and state-specific subsidization policy that targeted subsidies more precisely to those who need them most. Because H.R. 1555 could be scored as a tax increase by the Congressional Budget Office, this alternative would address the problems raised by the House approach.
<p>
Again, the "most favored regulation" concept would apply to the provision of 
subsidies to ensure that no company received an unfair advantage over a competitor. By requiring non-discriminatory subsidization, this amendment would discourage states from subsidizing corporations and encourage them to design a means-tested, voucher-like mechanism to deliver assistance directly to individuals instead of through companies.
<p>
<b>Change #4: First Amendment Parity for All Media</b>
All media, whether print or electronic, should be accorded the same First 
Amendment protection under the law. It makes little sense to regulate an on-line service provider of news differently than a daily newspaper. As such technologies converge, it will become difficult, if not impossible, to regulate them under different standards. H.R. 1555 makes no mention of the First Amendment or of how electronic technologies should be regulated. Congress should recognize the importance of placing all technologies on equal regulatory footing by mandating they be granted the same First Amendment protections. (9) 
<p>
<b>Change #5: Creating a Free Market for Spectrum</b>
Beyond the incremental reforms found in H.R. 1555, lawmakers should free the 
electromagnetic radio spectrum from its seven-decade-old regulatory constraints. All 
incumbent holders of spectrum should be granted irrevocable, perpetual property rights in their wireless holdings. Like all other property, spectrum could be used as the owner sees fit, subject to common law standards of trespass and interference. More important, the FCC would be directed to auction off immediately all competing claims for unused spectrum. Finally, to encourage the government to disgorge as much of its current spectrum as possible, federal agencies would be provided with a certain percentage of any <p> revenues raised from the sale of their spectrum. This would encourage government spectrum users to place some of their vast spectrum holdings on the auctioning block to be purchased for more efficient uses. This plan, originally laid out in a recent report by the <a href="http://www.pff.org">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>,  would guarantee more efficient deployment and use of wireless communications technologies. 
<p>
<a name="conclusion"></a><b>Conclusion</b><p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents</a> ]<p>
Many supporters of H.R. 1555 argue that adding more radical pro-deregulatory 
language to the bill decreases the likelihood of final passage. However, it is unlikely that a more principled bill would face any more serious opposition than the current bill. 
<p>
Proponents of the current telecommunications bill also point out that it represents 
the first of many efforts at comprehensive deregulation of the telecommunications 
industry and that additional improvements can be made in subsequent legislation. This is unlikely. On June 19, the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee held a single two-hour hearing to discuss the future of the FCC. No budget cuts were recommended and no substantial changes in the FCC's current structure were proposed -- despite earlier public calls by leaders of that committee for a radical downsizing of the agency.
<p>
Although spectrum policy could be dealt with in a separate bill, it is unclear why 
it should be broken out of the current legislation since a competitive wireless sector is 
essential to a more competitive wireline sector. If Congress waits months or even years to deregulate the wireless sector properly, a truly uneven playing field could result, further wireless technological innovation could be repressed, and local telephone competition could be delayed.
<p>
 The House must help the Senate fundamentally reform U.S. telecommunications 
policy. It can do this by removing -- immediately and unconditionally -- all barriers to 
entry, scrapping any overly regulatory language remaining in the bill, effectively 
reforming the universal service subsidy mechanisms as well as wireless spectrum policy, and  guaranteeing that First Amendment protections are enforced equally across all media.
<p>
If the House misses this final opportunity to remove the bill's excess regulatory 
baggage and strengthen its market-oriented elements, it is unlikely that Congress will 
produce a truly deregulatory bill this year.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
       The full Senate is poised to vote on legislation to deregulate the
telecommunications industry.  Unfortunately, the leading bill, while a
modest improvement on current law, misses the opportunity to benefit
consumers by opening the industry to real competition.  If this leading U.S. 
industry is to live up to its potential, and consumers are to reap the rewards
of full competition and innovation, the Senate must make major changes in
the bill.
<P>
       Last year's telecommunications deregulation bill, S.  1822, died in
the Senate because of dissatisfaction with the overly regulatory approach
produced principally by Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC).  Very late in the
legislative session, then Minority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) began
circulating a draft deregulation bill that was a mere 30 pages long --
compared to the approximately 200-page Hollings bill.  Instead of granting
segments of the industry continued protection from competition, as the
Hollings bill did, the Dole draft legislation removed almost all barriers to
competition immediately.  For example, compared with the many pages of
regulation in S.  1822 dealing with Title VI of the Communications Act of
1934 (governing cable regulation), the Dole bill simply stated that "Title VI
of the Communications Act of 1934 is repealed."  This would have
deregulated the cable market completely upon implementation had the bill
become law.
<P>
       A choice of paradigms.  Thus, when members and key
telecommunications staffers on the Senate Commerce Committee began
meeting late last year to craft legislation for this session, they had a clear
choice of models:  S.  1822, which granted certain deregulatory freedoms
while still restraining competition in other ways, or the Dole draft
legislation to deregulate immediately and comprehensively almost all aspects
and segments of the telecommunications market.  Following the Dole model
would mean little to no intervention by bureaucrats and a more rapid
transition to complete market liberalization.
<P>
       Unfortunately, they have tried to craft a hybrid of both models.  The
result:  a bill that fails to create a clear, consistent, and unconstrained
environment for America's telecommunications industry.  During the early
weeks of this year, relatively "clean" legislation was revised many times,
with each revision moving further toward the Hollings model by adding
more regulatory baggage in an apparent effort to appease various segments
of the industry seeking to avoid new entrants into their markets.  Not
surprisingly, therefore, the first formal draft to emerge publicly from
Chairman Larry Pressler's (R-SD) office was, in many ways, already an
unsatisfactory compromise. 
<P>
        When the final bill emerged at a Senate Commerce Committee
mark-up on March 23, it was even less satisfactory than earlier drafts. 
Apparently in a last-minute effort to gain the support of several Democratic
members of the Commerce Committee, most deregulatory elements of the
bill were watered down.  Even so, many Democrats continued to express
reservations, and several pro-regulatory amendments were added to address
their concerns.  At the end of mark-up, the bill being sent to the floor
comprised close to 150 pages and contained almost 100 new rule-making
provisions for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The
capitulation to the Hollings model was complete.
<P>
       To be sure, the bill contains some important improvements over
current law.  For example, the Pressler bill would:
<P>
Eliminate many important barriers to industry-wide competition,
<P>
Provide incentives to open the traditionally uncompetitive local market to
competition,
<P>
Eliminate elements of the 1992 Cable Act,
<P>
Allow somewhat increased foreign investment, and
<P>
Devise a system to scale back FCC powers.
<P>
       
       But these benefits are largely outweighed by provisions that retain
or extend suffocating rules.  For example:
<P>
Arbitrary FCC-administered "entry tests" could cause potentially lengthy
delays before competition is allowed in certain industry segments.
<P>
Some elements of the destructive Cable Act will remain in effect, and rules
regulating the video industry remain confusing.
<P>
Foreign ownership rules are relaxed only for a portion of U.S.  industry and
could be enforced retroactively after repeal.
<P>
No serious effort is made to eliminate the FCC or specific bureaus of the
agency; other rules in the bill could increase its size and power.
<P>
There is no serious reform of the electromagnetic radio spectrum to
encourage increased wireless competition and innovation.
<P>
The bill maintains and expands telecommunications entitlements that
discourage industry competition.
<P>
       After seeing this final bill, more deregulatory-minded legislators such
as Senator John McCain (R-AZ) were left asking, "Why do we need to
make a deal if it's a bad deal?"  Indeed, it is unclear why concessions
were made to industry special interests by the committee.  It is likely that
a bill modeled on the Dole draft of last year could win passage in both
houses of Congress.  However, now that one modeled more closely on the
Hollings approach has been adopted by the Commerce Committee, the
Senate must focus on how to improve S.  652, The Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.  If this legislation becomes law
as structured today, consumers will not be able to look forward to serious
telecommunications deregulation or competition in the short term.
<P>


WHAT IS GOOD AND BAD ABOUT THE PRESSLER PLAN
<P>
       The Pressler bill essentially is the product of two diametrically
opposed models of telecommunications deregulation.  Thus, both good and
bad elements can be found juxtaposed within the bill.  It is important to
separate the unneeded regulatory elements from the more sound deregulatory
components to consider what needs to be changed in the bill to create a
sound deregulatory environment for the industry.  One way to do this is to
compare the bill with a set of criteria for what could be considered true,
free-market-oriented deregulatory reform. 
<P>       
        Seven such general principles can be used to judge the deregulatory
nature of the bill: 
<P>
Creation of sensible interconnection policy to open the local market to
competition; 
<P>
Elimination of regulation and barriers to entry in the telephone market; 
<P>
Elimination of regulation and barriers to entry for the cable and video
market; 
<P>
Elimination of protectionist barriers to foreign investment; 
<P>
Sharp reduction of the telecommunications bureaucracy; 
<P>
Substantial movement toward a free market in spectrum; and 
<P>
Elimination of telecommunications entitlements.  
<P>

       Judged against these criteria, the bill earns a very mixed report card.
<P>
CRITERION #1:  Creation of a Sensible Interconnection Policy
<P>
Grade:  A 
<P>
Good Points:  A "competitive checklist" provides right incentives to open
local market to competition; does not apply policies too broadly.
<P>
Bad Points:  None.
<P>
       The Pressler bill creates a sensible interconnection policy to ensure
the local telephone market is opened to competition as soon as possible.  A
14-point "competitive checklist" is established that allows competitors access
to the "Baby Bell's" local telephone network.  This framework is based on
an "open access" philosophy, which encourages the expansion of rivals to
incumbent monopolistic carriers while preserving the ubiquitous nature of
the American telephone network.
<P>
       In addition, these access requirements are focused narrowly on less
competitive local markets where firms have traditionally been granted
service monopolies.  The Pressler bill wisely does not apply such access and
interconnection mandates on competitive sectors such as the cellular industry
where they would be counter-productive by discouraging the expansion of
infrastructure and competition.
<P>
CRITERION #2:  Elimination of Regulation and Barriers to Entry(Telephony) 
<P>Grade:  B-
<P>
Good Points:  Opens local telephone market to competition; allows new
rivals a chance to enter market.
<P>
Bad Points:  Allows for potentially lengthy and arbitrary FCC delays on
competition in other segments of the telephone market.  
<P>
       The Pressler bill encourages greater telephone competition by
eliminating all entry barriers to local telephone markets immediately.  This
means alternative providers, such as utility companies and cable companies,
would be allowed to enter the phone market.  This will encourage
competition from entirely different sectors and also help ensure that service
to many rural areas becomes competitive, since these firms already have the
needed infrastructure in place.
<P>
       However, many impediments either remain or are established by the
bill for the first time.  For example, the Senate should have allowed the
Baby Bells to enter the long-distance and equipment manufacturing markets
on a specific date or after they had met the "checklist" criteria discussed
above.  But a last-minute compromise in Committee deliberations eliminated
the "date-certain" or "checklist-certain" approach and substituted a new
"public interest" standard.  Thus, after complying successfully with the
checklist objectives, the Bells must face an arbitrary review of the benefits
of their entry into markets from which they are currently are barred.  If, for
any reason, FCC regulators feel Bell entry into these markets is not
"consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity," they can
block it.
<P>
       This is a disturbing and inferior standard upon which to base
telephone deregulation.  Deregulatory language should establish clear,
objective criteria by which firms can understand what must be done to
assure access to new markets.  Placing a "public interest" test within the bill
is an open invitation to anti-competitive special-interest pleading and
regulatory abuse, since the standard is largely subjective.  In addition,
allowing the FCC to interpret what is in the "public interest" introduces a
perverse incentive for FCC officials to slow down deregulation:  smoothing
the way for competition would mean a corresponding decrease in their
workload and little continued need for their agency's existence.
<P>
       The inclusion of this anti-competitive "public interest" test reduces
the grade the Pressler bill receives for elimination of barriers to telephone
competition, since beneficial Bell entry into new markets will be delayed. 
According to the WEFA Group, this delay could result in approximately
$300 billion in lost economic output and 3.4 million lost jobs over the next
ten years.  With such economic costs, it makes little sense to include
language in the bill delaying entry, especially since Baby Bell power in
local markets is dwindling.
<P>
       In addition, although the Pressler bill makes a half-hearted attempt
to eliminate the constraints placed on the seven Baby Bell companies under
the Modification of Final Judgment consent decree of 1982, no attempt is
made to supersede the consent decree that continues to restrain the GTE
Corporation.  Under a 1984 decree struck with the Department of Justice,
GTE is discouraged from entering many of the same lines of businesses the
Baby Bells are via structural safeguards and specific regulatory restraints. 
Thus, the Bells could be granted operating freedoms much sooner than GTE
under the Pressler bill, resulting in an uneven playing field.
<P>
       Finally, the Pressler bill does little to remove more traditional
regulatory barriers to telephone competition.  Elements of the original
Communications Act of 1934, such as licensing, tariffing, and other
operating requirements, have always been a burden on the industry.  For
example, Section 214 gives the Commission the power to approve or deny
the extension of phone lines and services to consumers.  In addition, the
Commission requires that telephone firms file schedules of their rates, or
"tariffs," with the agency for public inspection.  Although it makes little
sense for the Commission to be determining whether a company should be
extending services and requiring firms to reveal their rates to competitors,
the Pressler bill does not eliminate these uncompetitive and costly
regulations. 
<P>
CRITERION # 3:  Elimination of Regulation and Barriers to Entry
(Cable and Video)
<P>
Grade:  B-
<P>
Good Points:  Eliminates cable-telco cross-ownership restrictions.
<P>
Bad Points:  Does not repeal Cable Act outright; maintains asymmetrical
regulatory standard for video delivery.
<P>
       Recognizing that the Cable Act of 1992 has been a failure, early
drafts of the Pressler bill contained language calling for the repeal of the
Act and prohibiting any future cable rate regulation.  Unfortunately, a series
of last-minute compromises resulted in retention of the Cable Act, albeit
with important modifications.  In essence, cable rates under the Pressler bill
will be regulated if they "substantially exceed the national rate for
comparable cable programming services."  However, if a telephone company
provides video services in a cable operator's territory, rate regulation will
not apply.
<P>
       In addition, instead of eliminating all regulations governing the
delivery of video programming, the bill mandates continuation of a
confusing twofold standard -- one for video signals carried by telephone
wires and one for video signals carried over cable systems.  In essence, this
means that an asymmetrical regulatory standard for the delivery of video
programming will continue to exist.
<P>
CRITERION #4:  Elimination of Protectionist Barriers           
<P>
Grade:  C +
<P>
Good Points:  Potentially allows increased foreign investment and
competition in the common carrier market.
<P>
Bad Points:  Retroactive protectionist provisions could be enforced; ignores
radio licenses.
<P>
       The Pressler bill undertakes a long-needed reform of rules restricting
foreign ownership of American telecommunications companies.  Since 1934,
foreign entities have been effectively prohibited from owning more than 20
percent of the shares of a company holding a radio license or more than 25
percent of the shares of a company holding a common carrier telephone
license.  Foreigners also are not allowed to sit on the board or become an
officer of a radio licensee or a common carrier licensee. 
<P>
        The Pressler bill aims to eliminate the 25 percent cap on common
carrier ownership for any country that has opened its markets to American
goods.  But it does nothing about the 20 percent radio ownership ceiling. 
Furthermore, the bill contains a potentially retroactive "snapback" provision
that allows U.S.  regulators to re-impose protectionist barriers on countries
that fail to provide continued market access to U.S.  firms.
<P>
       While the Pressler bill is superior to current law on foreign
ownership, it still falls short of compete reform.  Exempting radio licenses
from the liberalization makes little sense, and the retroactive snapback
clause will likely be used by less-efficient U.S.  firms to close the American
market when foreign competition becomes intense. 
<P>
 CRITERION #5:  Reduction of Telecommunications Bureaucracy
<P>
Grade:  D-

<P>Good Points:  Eliminates some tasks over time and devises a process to
review regulations.
<P>
Bad Points:  Requires increased telecom spending and bureaucracy in short
term; no end in sight for the FCC.
<P>
       The Pressler bill will eliminate some of the telecommunications
bureaucracy simply by eliminating the regulations it enforces.  In addition,
beginning in 1997, it requires a biennial review of regulations by the FCC
to determine which rules are no longer in the "public interest."  Likewise,
the FCC does not have to enforce any regulations it feels are not in the
public interest.
<P>
       However, the bill does not contain any serious discussion of the
future of the Federal Communications Commission.  Policymakers appear
unconcerned with the role the agency plays in the deregulatory process and
apparently do not realize it is part of the problem they hope to correct. 
Congress should follow the model established by congressional Democrats
and the Carter Administration in the late 1970s when they led the battle to
deregulate the airlines.  From the start, the future of the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB), which regulated the airline industry, was on the table.  It was
well understood by most in Congress that deregulating the airlines would
mean eliminating the CAB.  A few years later, the CAB was abolished. 
<P>
        Yet, not only does the Pressler bill fail to mention the future of the
FCC, but many provisions discussed above or found elsewhere in the bill
actually will increase the size of the telecommunications bureaucracy.  For
example, new universal service provisions, "public access" requirements,
content controls, and separate subsidiary safeguards undoubtedly will
require additional FCC enforcement and staff.  Likewise, "public interest"
tests and continued licensing and tariffing requirements probably will require
stable or increasing FCC bureaucracy.
<P>
       Although Section 3 of the Pressler bill is titled "An End to
Regulation," there is no end in sight to the telecommunications bureaucracy. 
Congress could address FCC staffing and funding issues during the
appropriations process, but it is unwise to rely on Appropriations or Budget
Committee members to carry out a task that should be handled within the
bill itself.
<P>
CRITERION #6:  Movement Toward a Free Market in Spectrum
<P>
Grade:  F
<P>
Good Points:  None.
<P>
Bad Points:  No serious reform of the radio spectrum.
<P>
       The opportunities presented by complete liberalization and
privatization of the radio spectrum are enormous.  Billions of dollars in
revenue could be raised through the expansion of spectrum auctions.  More
important, if spectrum was freed for new or alternative uses, consumers
would benefit from more competitive markets, more innovative goods and
services, and falling prices.
<P>
              Sadly, the Pressler bill does not make a serious effort to
exploit these opportunities.  It contains moderate relaxation of national
ownership restrictions on broadcasters, but this falls short of the position,
held even by the FCC, that the rule should be repealed outright. 
Furthermore, many other ownership restrictions remain in the bill which
restrict the ability of broadcasters to operate freely. 
<P>
        Worse yet, the bill makes no attempt to end the nearly seven-
decade-old socialistic spectrum management policies of the FCC.  Spectrum
remains treated as a nationalized public resource to be regulated in the
"public interest" -- meaning, in reality, as the Commission sees fit.  Hence,
spectrum holders will continue to be denied flexible use of their current
spectrum allocation, while no move is made to vest them with property
rights in their allocation.  In addition, although the Pressler bill hopes to
create more efficient spectrum use by instituting a system of fees for
particular uses, the Commerce Committee missed the chance to move to a
superior, efficiency-enhancing system of complete privatization.  This would
have ensured that spectrum was auctioned off to the highest bidder and
owned by the firm that valued it most highly.  It also would have generated
billions of dollars for the federal government.  Moreover, broadcasters will
continue to be regulated under a "public interest model" under the bill, with
only limited First Amendment protections.  Remarkably, the Pressler bill
makes no mention of the First Amendment.
<P>
       As with the scaling back of telecommunications bureaucracy,
spectrum reform technically could take place later in a separate bill.  But the
opportunity for more comprehensive and immediate spectrum deregulation
is missed in the Pressler bill.
<P>
CRITERION #7:  Elimination of Telecommunications Entitlements
<P>
Grade:  F
<P>
Good Points:  None.
<P>
Bad Points:  Expands telecom subsidies; gives FCC larger role; potentially
regulates computer industry.
<P>
       The most disastrous elements of the Pressler bill are the sections
dealing with universal telecommunications service.  Current telephone
subsidy policies redistribute wealth in a highly inefficient manner to provide
cheap local telephone service.  Subsidies generally flow from long-distance
users to local users, business users to residential users, and urban users to
rural users.  These overlapping cross-subsidies have destroyed industry
competition by discouraging market entry, since few potential competitors
have the capital necessary to take on the subsidized firms.  By artificially
elevating prices in the long-distance market, these subsidies also have cost
society between $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year in higher prices. 
<P>
        Instead of attempting to reform or eliminate this destructive subsidy
system, the Pressler bill actually expands its scope.  For example, the bill:
<P>
Maintains current price controls by requiring that services be provided at
"just, reasonable, and affordable rates," and does not define what these
highly subjective terms mean.
<P>
Continues inefficient rate averaging, which requires that rates in rural areas
be roughly the same as those in urban areas, regardless of cost.
<P>
Expands telecommunications entitlements by mandating that, "At a
minimum, universal service shall include access to telecommunications
services that the Commission determines have, through the operation of
market choices by consumers, been subscribed to by a majority of
residential consumers."
<P>
       The continuation of the failed subsidy policies of the past, combined
with the expanding definition of universal service mandated under the bill,
places at risk almost everything else the bill hopes to accomplish.  Once
personal computers, on-line services, set-top boxes, and other future
technologies become part of a package of mandated benefits to which every
American must have access, it is likely these technologies will be regulated,
and thus made less competitive.  Although the bill does not specifically
require that these goods and services be included in a package of mandated
technological benefits, the Pressler draft has provided the FCC with the
incentive to do so by requiring that universal service be considered an
"evolving level of telecommunications service."  It is likely this will
encourage the agency to adopt traditional subsidization and regulatory
measures to extend these technologies to more Americans once they are
included in the evolving definition. 
<P>
        If this occurs and these markets become less competitive, consumers
will have less choice, higher prices, and perhaps even less access to these
technologies.  As the above chart illustrates, it is significant that
unsubsidized and unregulated technologies have been made available to
American consumers much faster than subsidized and regulated
technologies, such as telephone technology. 
<P>
        In addition, it will be more difficult to make the local telephone
market competitive, as the bill aspires to do.  This is because real price
competition will not be allowed to develop freely if subsidies remain in
place.  Further, it is unclear just how expensive it will be to carry out these
new provisions.  And although these mandates may not be considered
technically a tax increase, since the subsidies flow within the industry and
not from a general revenue fund, they will have the effect of a
redistributionist tax and likely will require an increase in the size of the
FCC.
<P>
HOW TO IMPROVE THE PRESSLER BILL
<P>
       If the Senate wishes to correct the flaws in the Pressler bill, several
changes must be made before the bill is passed.  Specifically, to create real
competition in the telecommunications industry, Congress should:
Strip out all unnecessary bureaucratic impediments to immediate
deregulation, such as the "public interest" test, licensing and tariffing
requirements, delays in equipment manufacturing liberalization, separate
subsidiary requirements, and all rate regulation provisions.
<P>
       There is little need to delay the onset of complete deregulation and
competition.  For six decades, consumers and entrepreneurial firms have
been forced to sit on the sidelines and watch bureaucrats conduct a
regulatory experiment that has ended in failure.  Immediate deregulation will
ensure that telecommunications companies face a much more ruthless
regulator -- the American consumer.  Policymakers cannot create
competition with waiting periods and bureaucratic entry tests.
<P>
Strip out retroactive foreign ownership provisions and eliminate
telecommunications protectionism.
<P>
       Instead of continuing to deny American consumers the benefits of
increased rivalry, competition, and service quality, as the Pressler bill would,
Congress should repeal these protectionist provisions in current law.  It
makes little sense to continue restrictions on foreign ownership of American
firms when so many diverse media and communication outlets exist.  Some
countries like the United Kingdom and New Zealand have liberalized
completely their telecommunications markets and enjoy the benefits of
increased capital investment and entrepreneurial foreign competition.
<P>
       To help pry open foreign markets, the White House should pursue
a multilateral trade agreement in this area.  This would be less likely to fuel
the fires of protectionism and avert the chance of a trade war that would
threaten U.S.  investment abroad.  Instead, the Pressler bill attempts to keep
one foot in the protectionist camp while slowly stretching the other toward
the free market.  Unconditionally opening the American telecommunications
sector to foreign investment and competition will lower prices, produce
more innovative products, and create new jobs.  Continuing current
restrictions on foreign access to the American marketplace will hurt U.S. 
consumers more than any foreign firm conceivably might.
<P>
       
Require immediate and unconditional repeal of the Cable Act and all
video regulation.
<P>
       Policymakers must recognize that the Cable Act has done nothing to
advance the interests of consumers.  Although the cable industry has not
been cost competitive in the past, that is due more to misguided regulatory
policies than to any natural market outcome.  The Cable Act of 1992 should
have focused on opening the cable market to competition, not on applying
new price regulations.  Not only have the new regulations resulted in
smaller gains for consumers, but they have restricted the cable industry's
ability to invest in new technologies and to compete in new markets. 
Congress should repeal the Cable Act and all cable regulation and focus on
opening the market to competition from alternative video providers.  In
addition, alternative video providers should be placed on equal footing with
cable carriers to achieve deregulatory parity.  This would serve the interests
of consumers better than any current price or entry regulation.
Define the "public interest" as the best interests of consumers, to ensure that
regulators cannot use the term for other purposes.
<P>
       Throughout the Pressler bill, the FCC is given the ability to regulate
or deregulate according to what the agency believes is in "the public
interest."  Congress would be wise to eliminate any mention of this from the
bill, specifically entry tests based upon the "public interest" standard.  But
if Congress insists on maintaining this standard, it should try at least to
reduce the potential for regulatory abuse by defining the term as clearly and
objectively as possible.  Six decades of unconstrained "public interest"
regulation has demonstrated that what the FCC determines arbitrarily to be
in the "public interest," rarely is in the best interests of consumers.  The
reason is simple -- regulators, not consumers, are making the decision.
<P>
       Congress should define the public interest standard in statute if
lawmakers insist (unwisely) on keeping it in the legislation.  The definition
should focus on three specific criteria:
Maximizing consumer welfare by broadening the general scope of individual
decision-making within telecommunications markets;
Utilizing market processes instead of regulatory proceedings whenever
possible; and
<P>
Protecting property and First Amendment rights in telecommunications
regulation.
<P>
       This "consumer welfare" standard would better serve the interests of
all Americans.  But Congress also should consider defining what would
not be in the public interest.  This should include any action that constitutes
taxation by regulation, such as current universal service mechanisms. 
Other arbitrary regulatory practices could be included in this general
definition.
<P>
Include provisions granting the FCC authority to conduct auctions to
privatize the spectrum and eliminate all ownership restrictions on
spectrum allocations.
<P>
       The Pressler bill missed a rare opportunity to de-nationalize one of
America's most important and valuable natural resources -- the radio
spectrum.  Congress should give the Commission the authority to use
spectrum auctions whenever there are competing interests for a spectrum
allocation.  This will allow the FCC to sell off most if not all of the
remaining spectrum to those who value its use most highly, thereby ensuring
that it will be used much more efficiently.  Once spectrum is auctioned off,
property rights in the spectrum should be created and enforced by a small
panel or the courts.  Holders of spectrum property rights should be given
complete operating flexibility to use their allocation however they see fit. 
Incumbent holders of spectrum licenses should be given an absolute property
right in their holding.
<P>
       Creating spectrum property rights and broadening current auction
authority to include all competing uses would generate potentially hundreds
of billions of dollars in revenue and spur more innovation within wireless
markets.  In addition, it would create more competition for landline voice
and video operators.
<P>
Mandate equal First Amendment protection for all media, whether print
or electronic.
<P>
       Since the inception of electronic communications technologies (such
as radio, TV, and cable), First Amendment protections have been all but
ignored by regulators.  Congress should make it clear that the First
Amendment plays a pre-eminent role in the future of this industry.  To
accord second-class speech protections to the electronic media is a gross
violation of the rights of communications broadcasters and carriers.
<P>
       As traditional print technologies (such as newspapers and magazines)
converge with modern electronic technologies (such as the Internet), it will
become increasingly difficult to determine how to separate the different print
and electronic standards.  For example, will the New York Times be
regulated under a different interpretation of the First Amendment once it can
be delivered to most Americans via computer or cable system?  Existing
regulatory distinctions distort the true meaning and intent of the First
Amendment:  "The First Amendment, after all, does not distinguish one
'press' from another."
<P>
Include a timetable for closing down the FCC.
<P>
       A failure to reduce the size of the bureaucracy that governs the
telecommunications sector is a failure to deregulate this industry.  As long
as regulators have jobs, they will regulate.  If there is to be full deregulation
of this industry, Congress must devise a detailed and workable plan for the
eventual closure of the Federal Communications Commission. 
Unfortunately, with so many provisions in the Pressler bill expanding the
federal regulatory workload, this goal cannot be achieved unless the bill is
amended significantly. 
<P>
        Lawmakers should eliminate the bill's expansionary language and
substitute a plan to close down the FCC.  Congress should begin by
reducing current FCC appropriations and including procedural reforms in the
bill to end destructive regulatory activities.  For example, all licensing and
tariffing restrictions could be repealed immediately, resulting in substantial
cutbacks in bureaucracy.  Likewise, entire FCC bureaus, such as the Cable
Services Bureau, could be eliminated as the rules they enforce are repealed. 
<P>
 Substitute a more pro-competition alternative for the current universal
service sections of the bill.
<P>
       If policymakers fail to eliminate the language in the Pressler bill that
would expand subsidies and entitlements, telecommunications competition
could be stifled and current technologies could be made less competitive. 
Instead of adopting the failed model of the past, Congress should craft
policies in this field that fit the new thinking on entitlement reform on
Capitol Hill. 
<P>
        Just as some other entitlements are being limited and then devolved
to the states, universal telecommunications service policies can be
transferred to lower levels of government.  States and localities can
determine better what their residents need.  Ideally, state or local lawmakers
could create a voucher plan that would deliver a subsidy directly to a
qualified individual, not a company, based on perceived need.
<P>
         The subsidy would be narrowly drawn, means-tested, and more
friendly to competition -- unlike policies today that artificially price service
in rural areas below costs.  By transferring all authority for the universal
service system back to the states, Congress could eliminate the federal
bureaucracy that oversees the universal service system.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
       Although it would be unfortunate if telecommunications deregulation
legislation died this year, as it did last year, it would not be the proverbial
end of the world.  For one thing, technologies and the courts are
undermining or dismantling many of the barriers now in place.  With each
passing year, technological innovation circumvents outdated regulatory
distinctions, and court decisions are eliminating many regulatory barriers
outright.  These trends are likely to continue.  Another reason to reject
flawed legislation is that the Pressler bill actually would make some things
worse.  In particular, the universal service elements place at risk everything
else the bill hopes to accomplish by mandating the continuation and
expansion of failed subsidy policies.
<P>
              Still, supporters of the bill will argue correctly that allowing
the perfect to be the enemy of the good can destroy any chance of freeing
the industry from many statutory constraints on competition and innovation. 
They will cite the length and heavy cost of court-based deregulation and the
economic losses associated with continuing restrictions for longer than
necessary.  However, if supporters feel this passionately about the need for
immediate deregulation, they will act to eliminate the overly regulatory
baggage of the bill and insert more deregulatory, pro-competitive
alternatives in its place.  Without such changes, S.  652 as currently written
is not the landmark telecommunications deregulation bill its sponsors claim,
since it continues to rely more on regulators than consumers to decide which
firms and technologies prevail in the marketplace.

<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A>
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government regulations affect all Americans: from the food  they eat, to the
medications they take, to how they use their  private property, to how they run
their businesses. Excessive  government regulation today is vast in scope and
staggering in its impact,  both on individuals and on the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Government regulation has shown itself to be both  far-reaching and
counterproductive in its impact on American business. It  increases the cost of
doing business and hiring workers, which  results in fewer jobs and lower
salaries and makes U.S.  companies less competitive in world markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The burden is bad enough, but much regulation also is poorly  designed and
thus unnecessarily costly. Federal regulatory  agencies do not have a system for
making rational, well-informed  decisions on how to allocate limited resources
most efficiently to  maximize health, safety, and environmental  protection.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>  Today,
Americans spend approximately $170 billion a year just complying with  rules
designed to protect the environment. The total cost to the  economy of all
regulation is estimated to be between $600 billion and  $700 billion annually.
This represents a hidden tax of more than  $6,000 per year per family. The
regulatory process must be reformed  so 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  that government resources at all
levels can be allocated more  rationally and business can devote its resources
to becoming more  innovative and productive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although the direct costs of regulation typically are imposed  on businesses
and governments, ultimately they are passed on  to American consumers in the
form of higher prices, reduced  quality or availability of products and
services, or higher taxes. In  addition, regulation can increase the cost of
employing workers  and thus act as a tax on job creation and employment. For 
example, American businesses must carry the costs of federal labor laws  that
constrain the freedom of companies to hire and fire workers and  to engage in
negotiations with employees and labor unions.  Similarly, employers often are
required to provide such benefits  as health insurance, unemployment insurance,
workers'  compensation, retirement benefits, paid family leave, or child care  
the costs of which are passed on to consumers through higher prices  or to
workers through slowdowns in the creation of new jobs or  reductions in wages.
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>  Federal
mandates on state and local  governments also may force the diversion of
resources from other  government priorities such as education, police, and fire
services.  To continue providing these services, state and local government  may
be compelled to raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The vast majority of Americans agree that some government  regulation is
desirable and necessary. Most highway regulations,  for example, save lives and
improve the flow of traffic at  minimal cost. Such regulations obviously provide
a huge net benefit to  everyone, but regulations also can be both
counterproductive  and harmful to society. The problem is that regulation today
is  far more costly and less effective than it should be.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservative candidates and legislators should focus on  bringing common
sense to the regulatory process in 1997 by enacting  reforms that incorporate
five key principles:<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#3">3</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Cost-Benefit analysis.</B> Federal agencies should be required  to
consider the benefits and costs of a range of regulatory  alternatives and
choose the options that maximize net benefits to society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Sound science.</B> Agencies should seek the most advanced  scientific
knowledge available.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Risk assessment and risk management.</B> Agencies must  develop more
scientifically objective methods to determine the nature  and extent of a &quot;hazard.&quot;
 The process for assessing risk should be  distinct from the process for
determining what risks are significant  or unacceptable and how they should be
managed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>4. Risk-based priorities and public education.</B> Agencies  should
prioritize their regulatory actions based on a consideration of  risks, how
those risks compare to risks familiar to the public, and  the costs of reducing
them. Agencies also must educate the  public about their risk-setting
priorities.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>5. Market incentives and performance standards.</B> To the  extent
possible, agencies should give regulated parties the flexibility  to meet
established regulatory objectives in the most efficient,  low-cost manner rather
than through a command-and-control,  one-size-fits-all approach.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Even conservative estimates

 This is more than $6,000  per household. By the year 2000, these figures are

<P> <B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In 1995, according to Americans for Tax Reform,
the  average American had to work full time until July 9 to pay the costs 
associated with government taxation, deficit spending, and  regulations. This
means that 53 cents of every dollar earned went to the  government directly or
indirectly.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Estimating the precise cost of federal regulation is extremely  difficult.
Unlike federal spending, regulatory costs are not  accounted for in the budget
process; and while agencies are supposed to  calculate the costs and benefits of
proposed  regulations, <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#5">5</A></B></TT>
their calculations vary in quality and often grossly underestimate the true 
cost or substantially overestimate the benefits of  regulation. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt3.htm#6">6</A></B></TT>  The Contract with America
called for the application of cost-benefit  analysis to new rules and
regulations. The idea was to force  Congress and regulatory agencies to assess
the costs and benefits of  regulations before they are enacted. Critics argue
that too often the  costs and benefits of a regulation are hard to identify and
quantify,  and that it is difficult to place a dollar value on a human life that
 may be saved by a regulation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> <a href="regs_t1.gif">Table 1</a> presents ten examples of how regulations can impose  astronomical
costs relative to the benefits they produce.  Kent Jeffreys, a Senior Fellow at
the National Center for Policy  Analysis, summed it up well in a recent report
on regulatory  reform: 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  &quot;One reason why the cost
estimates appear so outrageous is  that the risks the regulations are trying to
eliminate are so tiny. One  of the advantages of cost-benefit analysis is that
it helps  alert policymakers that the regulation of trivial risks can be very 
expensive.&quot; <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#7">7</A></B></TT>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     We can save more by increasing
medical treatment, and to a  somewhat lesser degree, to curbing fatal injuries.
Trying to save  lives by regulating pesticides or other toxins, on the other
hand,  squanders resources. <a href="regs_1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the cost-ineffectiveness of the 
majority of toxin control measures. To put the numbers in  perspective, Dr. John
Graham, director of Harvard University's Center  for Risk Analysis, notes &quot;the
median toxin control program costs  58 times more per year of life saved than
the median injury  prevention program and 146 times more than the median medical
 program.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     A comparison of regulations for different
federal agencies  shows that there is no consistent cost-benefit standard. In
fact, as <a href="regs_2.gif">Chart  2</a> shows, the median cost effectiveness of federal regulation 
varies; an EPA regulation can cost 100 times more than consumer  product or
highway safety regulations. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#8">8</A></B></TT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The enormous costs of complying with many environmental  regulations often
are not justified by the minuscule health dangers  the rules are meant to
address. As a result, limited financial  resources that could be used more
effectively are wasted in pursuit of  a &quot;zero-risk environment.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt3.htm#9">9</A></B></TT>  As Dr. Graham points out, &quot;Our
 environmental policies suffer from a syndrome of paranoia and  neglect.... We
go after minuscule risks, such as pesticide residue  in food, and at the same
time we're tolerant and neglectful of  major 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  problems in our daily life.&quot;
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#10">10</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A world of competing needs and limited resources requires  rational,
well-informed decisions about how best to allocate those  resources. Using
resources one way means not using them in  other ways that could save more lives
or produce other more  desirable outcomes. For example, the Environmental
Protection  Agency's hazardous waste disposal ban costs $4.2 billion for each 
premature death averted. These same resources could be used to keep  47,890
dangerous criminals in prison for an additional three and a  half years.
Similarly, the $168 million it takes to avert one death  under a benzene
standard could be used to put 3,064 more police  officers on the street. <TT><B><A

<P><B>Loss of Jobs</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another heavy cost of regulation is reduced employment  opportunities for
Americans. This toll is not usually apparent, because  in most instances
regulation merely leads to a slower growth in  employment rather than a more
visible loss of existing jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Regulation destroys jobs in several ways. <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First,</B> reductions in efficiency, productivity,
investment, and  economic growth due to regulation mean fewer jobs created. A 
weak, slowly growing economy creates fewer jobs than a booming,  rapidly growing
one. This effect destroys jobs even in sectors that  are not directly regulated.
For example, because of federal efforts  to protect the northern spotted owl,
millions of acres of land in  Washington, Oregon, and Northern California are
closed to logging  operations. Tens of thousands of loggers have lost their jobs
 because of the regulations and thousands of other jobs have been lost  in
communities that depend on logging as the principal industry.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> regulations may raise the costs of doing business by 
curtailing the number of workers hired. The costs of regulation  may contribute
to forcing a company out of business or preventing  a new company from starting
up and creating new jobs.

<P>The U.S. Health Care Financing Administration's 1,600 pages  of regulations

<P>

<P><B>Third,</B> regulations may raise the cost of employment by  imposing
specific costs tied to each new employee hired. Employers  often are required to
provide various benefits such as health  insurance, unemployment insurance,
workers' compensation, retirement  benefits, paid family leave, or child care.
They then pass their  increased costs on to consumers in the form of higher
prices or  to workers in slower job creation or reduced  wages. <TT><B><A

cumulative effects of existing  regulations, including their deleterious effects
on job creation.

<P>Regulations intended to reduce health and safety risks, and  thereby reduce
premature deaths to Americans, cost billions of dollars  annually. Whether these
regulations are worthwhile depends, in  part, on whether the costs of a specific
regulation induce more  fatalities than the regulation itself is expected to
avoid. <a href="regs_t3.gif">Table 3</a>  illustrates how very large regulatory costs imposed with little 
commensurate benefit actually may result in a net loss of lives. Even without 
taking into consideration the lives lost because of economic  impacts, the more
direct opportunity cost of a regulation such as  uranium mill tailings can be
enormous. If, for instance, $71.6 million  was devoted to additional colo-rectal
blood tests, which save an  estimated one life for every $24,964 spent,

did  not drop the penalty, which constituted about 10 percent of  the church's
$300,000 budget. The dispute eventually landed in  court, only to have the EPA
change its mind and go after the  engineering firm responsible for the work even
though the overall risk  was negligible. In the words of Victor Bras, chairman

<P>As Stephen Breyer discusses in his book, <I>Breaking the  Vicious Circle</I>,
federal regulatory agencies often consider a problem  and end up promulgating a

high costs without achieving  significant additional safety benefits.&quot;
<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#40">40</A></B></TT>  Although
Breyer concentrates  on how regulators handle cancer-causing substances, his 
conclusions apply broadly to all federal regulatory actions. Today,  federal
regulators are seen as out of control because the regulations  they promulgate
produce few benefits at great cost, are often  inconsistent with other federal
actions, and are of little overall  consequence relative to other actions that
might produce greater  benefits to society. In other words, the process is
haphazard and chaotic.

<P>Regulatory actions intended to deal with toxic substances are  the best

Agencies should have a  consistent method for assessing and managing risk. Risk
assessments  should reveal all the assumptions, uncertainties, and value
judgments  in the analysis.
</P>

</P>
<P>For example, when the government identifies a hazard, it  makes assumptions
about the degree of human exposure to  contaminants. Often these assumptions are

<P>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     While President Clinton is critical
of the federal  government's overregulation, his actions do not match his
rhetoric. In fact,  even as Clinton calls for change, his Administration appears
even  more aggressive than its predecessors in wielding its regulatory power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     For example, on October 4, 1993, President
Clinton issued  Executive Order 12866, &quot;Regulatory Planning and Review,&quot;
replacing  a Reagan Administration order requiring executive branch  agencies to
submit proposed regulations with a cost in excess of $100  million to OMB for
review and approval. In the new executive  order, the Clinton Administration
reaffirmed its commitment to 1)  using the best scientific and economic data; 2)
using analysis to  inform decision-making; 3) considering flexible,
cost-effective  performance standards; and 4) allowing early public
participation in  an open and accountable regulatory process. However, there is 
little evidence that the order has had any significant impact or that  the White
House is encouraging agencies to comply. An April  1995 study by the Institute
for Regulatory Policy examined all EPA  proposed and final rules published in
the<I> Federal  Register</I> during the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  second six months after the
Clinton executive order took  effect. Based on an analysis of 222 substantive
rulemakings, the  study found only six for which the demonstrated benefits
justified  the costs involved. In addition, only 14 examined regulatory 
alternatives, and only eight of these specified that the most  cost-effective
rule had been adopted. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#45">45</A></B></TT>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>On February 21, 1995, President Clinton directed federal  agencies to
conduct a page-by-page review of existing regulations to  determine which should
be eliminated and which should be  streamlined, updated, overhauled, or
otherwise improved. By June 1,  the Administration claimed the agencies had
identified over  16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) that they
 would be eliminating. In addition, they supposedly are &quot;reinventing&quot; 
over 31,000 additional pages. The challenge now is for the public  to figure out
what this all really means. While the number  sounds impressive, when put in the
proper context it is considerably  less impressive. Today's CFR is more than
131,000 pages, more  than twice as large as it was twenty years ago. Eliminating
 16,000 pages is only about 12 percent of this total, and that is  assuming that
no new regulations are added in the interim, which is not  the case. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On November 28, 1995, the Administration published its  1,700-page
semiannual agenda of federal regulations, which  presents very brief
descriptions of all planned regulatory actions.  The Administration's lack of
seriousness in achieving real  reductions in burden is evident. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting,  review, and
reporting requirements for a number of programs, the  Clinton 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  Administration is simultaneously
pushing forward with  burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the
universe  of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release 
Inventory. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt3.htm#46">46</A></B></TT> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The Administration has reviewed the Community  Reinvestment Act (CRA) in an
attempt to &quot;strengthen and streamline&quot; the  rules. However, this
streamlining process resulted in more than  140 pages of new CRA rules and
regulations. As Congressman  Bill McCollum (R-FL) notes, &quot;Only in
Washington can streamlining  be defined as going from a rules that takes up 14
pages in the  Federal Register to one that takes up 145 pages.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, a number of agencies admit that they have not  reviewed their
rules for twenty to forty years. Some of the  pages being eliminated are for
rules for which the underlying statute  has long since been repealed, treaties
that no longer exist, etc.  This alone could easily achieve a 10 percent
reduction in the CFR  without accomplishing any real changes in the way in which
the  federal government goes about regulating the public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clearly, the Clinton Administration effort is windowdressing  and does
little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of  regulation. The
Administration is not being completely honest with  the American public when it
claims to be reinventing regulation  but goes about implementing new, burdensome
regulations about  as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has done little to change the  way in which
federal agencies regulate the public. In fact, it has  worked tirelessly to
block the enactment of comprehensive reform  legisla
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  tion that would codify many of
the principles found in  the President's executive order; the Administration
continues to  take the position that fundamental reform can and should be 
achieved through administrative change, not through statute.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 103RD CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the 103rd Congress, Members became more serious  about easing the
burden of federal red tape. Even though the  Democratic leadership and the White
House ultimately killed the main  reform efforts of 1994, four reform measures
either passed one house  of Congress or received serious consideration by
congressional  committees; until 1994, none of these measures was even given a 
hearing by the committee of jurisdiction. The proposals were  intended to reduce
the paperwork and regulatory burdens on  businesses, evaluate the economic and
employment impact of regulation,  and curb unfunded federal mandates. While
federal regulations  would continue to impose costs, the legislative proposals
were  intended to force Congress and the executive branch to consider more 
thoroughly the economic impact of proposed legislation and  regulation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1994, unlike past years, a strong grass-roots coalition  helped rally
bipartisan support for these bills and convinced  reluctant committee chairmen
that they could no longer block the  legislation. The business community became
a key part of this  coalition by actively supporting measures aimed at
controlling the  regulatory burden. Adding extra impetus to this effort was a 
powerful coalition of state and local officials who organized themselves  into a
potent political force to fight onerous federal regulations  and Washington
mandates that fail to provide the funding to  imple
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  ment them. In the end, however,
the efforts of these groups  were not enough to keep the congressional Democrats
and the  White House from blocking passage of any legislation.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Regulatory reform became a real political possibility with  the 104th
Congress. As part of the Contract With America, the  Republican majority made
one of its promises the passage of a number  of reforms designed to enhance
private property rights (see  Chapter 4) and economic liberty and make
government more  accountable for the burdens it imposes on individuals and
businesses.  During the first 100 days, Congress enacted and President Clinton 
signed into law two of its reform priorities:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995.</B> The federal  government
increasingly has been involved in activities considered to  be state and local
in nature. In response to the increasingly  hostile reaction of states and
localities to unchecked and costly  federal mandates, Congress enacted the
Unfunded Mandates Reform  Act of 1995 (Public Law 100-4), in March 1995. The Act
represents  &quot;a bipartisan agreement that something is wrong with American 
federalism as it has evolved in recent  years.&quot; <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt3.htm#47">47</A></B></TT>  The Act establishes a
$50 million threshold on the costs Congress and regulatory  agencies can impose
on state and local governments. A &quot;mandate&quot;  includes any requirement
that a state take an action, under the  threat of penalties or loss of
assistance, that would increase state and  local costs beyond existing levels.
New and reauthorized  legislation would have to specify how programs would be
funded. The  law also requires the Congressional Budget Office to issue an 
analysis of each piece of legislation containing a federal mandate.  The 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  analysis must describe the
mandate, specify its expected cost  to state and local governments, and state
whether it is to be partly  or entirely funded.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In January 1996, the Advisory Council on Intergovernment  Relations (ACIR),
which is tasked under the Act to &quot;investigate  and review the role of
federal mandates in intergovernmental  relations,&quot; issued a preliminary
report with recommendations to  Congress for addressing existing federal
mandates on state and  local governments. State and localities identified more
than 200  separate mandates affecting them which involve more than 170  federal
laws. Among ACIR recommendations: revise the Safe  Drinking Water Act, the Clean
Air Act, and the Endangered Species Act  to promote greater flexibility and
increased consultation betwen  the federal government and states and localities,
and modify  the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Clean Water Act to 
reduce budgetary and administrative constraints. <TT><B><A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995.</B> Intent on lessening  the burden
imposed by the federal government on individuals  and businesses, the 104th
Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass  the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and
President Clinton signed  it into law on May 22, 1995. The Office of Information
and  Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the White House Office of  Management and
Budget (OMB) is responsible for implementing the Act's  objectives. In March
1995, the Office of Management and  Budget estimated that Americans spend more
than 6.4 billion hours  during fiscal year 1994 filling out forms, answering
survey questions,  and compiling records for the federal government.<TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt3.htm#49">49</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The law, which came into effect in October 1995, sets a  govern
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  ment-wide paperwork reduction
goal of 10 percent in each of  the first two years after its enactment and 5
percent from fiscal  1998 through 2001. It also reauthorizes for six years the
Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs, which remains responsible for 
carrying out the law. The Act's most controversial provision  would overturn a
1990 Supreme Court decision holding that OMB's  authority under the Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980 did not  extend to regulations forcing businesses to
provide information to  third parties, including employees and the public. The 
reauthorization provides that all third-party paperwork requirements will be 
approved by OMB, and this is expected to increase OMB's review  of paperwork by
50 percent.

<P><B>Corrections Day.</B> A regular Corrections Day has been  established for
passing corrective and non-controversial legislation with  bipartisan
supermajorities (three-fifths). Through this process,  Congress is able to
revise regulations that have become outdated or  obsolete, correct agency
errors, or simply eliminate regulations that do  not make any sense. In the
House, the Speaker's Correction Day  Advisory Group, chaired by Representative
Barbara Vucanovich  (R-NV), reviews and recommends legislative proposals for 
consideration under the Corrections Calendar. Bills on the calendar can  be
considered at the discretion of the Speaker of the House on  the second and
fourth Tuesday of each month. The following are  two examples of bills passed by
one or both houses of Congress:

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Edible Oil Regulatory Reform Act (H.R. 436)</B> to require  the
government to differentiate between petroleum oils and animal  and vegetable
fats, oils, and greases. The Oil Pollution Act of  1990 places prohibitive
financial requirements on oils and does not  distinguish between non-toxic,
biodegradable animal and  vegetable oils, which are less of an environmental
hazard, and  petroleum products. The Department of Transportation was going to 
implement the Act through regulations that would have required  24 hours of
hazardous material classroom and field training for  workers who responded to
butter or salad oil spill emergencies.

<P><B>Congressional Accountability and Regulatory Relief for  Small Business.
</B>In response to the recommendations of the White  House Conference on Small
Business, Senator Christopher Bond  (R-MO), chairman of the Senate Small
Business Committee,  sponsored S. 942, the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement
 Fairness Act of 1996. This bill passed the Senate with a vote of 100 to 0  on
March 19, 1996. The bill authorizes judicial enforcement of  the Regulatory
Flexibility Act of 1980, allows small business to  recoup expenses and legal
fees incurred when agencies make  excessive demands for penalties that cannot be
sustained in court  and provides for an independent ombudsman to receive 
confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with  federal
regulators. In addition, the bill was amended by Senator  Nickles (R-OK) and
Senator Reid (D-NV) to allow Congress 60 days  to review agency regulations.
This amendment effectively  incorporated a previously approved Senate bill (S.
219) that provided  for such congressional review. The House already had passed
a  similar small business legislation (S. 926) in March 1995. The  House and
Senate finalized the bill and attached it to legislation to  raise

signed the bill on March 29, 1996.

<P>Unfortunately, other important legislative regulatory reform  efforts have

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  the White House.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Four other important reform proposals also were considered by  the 104th
Congress:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. A Moratorium on Regulation.</B> After the November 1994  election,
Republican Members of Congress asked President Clinton  to freeze new federal
rulemaking during the first 100 days of the  new Congress. When President
Clinton refused, the House of  Representatives passed H.R. 450, the Regulatory
Transition Act of  1995, which would freeze regulatory activity retroactively
from  November 20, 1994, until 1996 or the passage of regulatory reform 
legislation. The purpose of the bill was to provide for a &quot;time-out&quot; 
period, during which Congress and the Administration could  debate and study the
large number of regulations currently being  developed and evaluate proposed
efforts to reform the way in  which regulatory decisions are made and
implemented. Although  the Senate bill started out the same way, a substitute
bill requiring  that all federal rules lie before Congress for 45 days to be
reviewed  and &quot;vetoed&quot; before becoming final ultimately was passed. 
Because the two versions turned out to be significantly different, the 
House-Senate conference on the bills stalled.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Comprehensive Regulatory Reform.</B> Just two months into  the first
session of the 104th Congress, the House passed H.R. 1022  on February 28, 1995.
Although the Contract With America was  a Republican election platform, H.R.
1022 was passed with a  substantial bipartisan majority. The purpose of the bill
is to impose  a requirement  on existing statutes and new regulations  that  the
risks, costs, and benefits be considered before implementation  of new rules.
Where the estimated economic impact is $25 million  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  more agencies would be required
to conduct risk assessment,  as necessary, before regulations take effect. In
addition, they  would be required to evaluate the costs and benefits associated
with  the set of regula-tory alternatives, including no government action;  to
show that the benefits outweigh the costs and that the net  benefits to society
would be greater under the proposed rule than  under alternatives; and to assess
the effect on businesses with fewer  than 100 employees and the effect on
employment. A federal  agency's compliance with the requirements of H.R. 1022
would be  judicially reviewable under the statute granting the agency the 
authority to act and, where applicable, under the Administrative  Procedures
Act.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, comprehensive regulatory reform proposals in  the Senate were
killed by the Democrats and the White House.  Two bills in the Senate were the
focus of the debate. The  Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995, S. 343,
sponsored by  Senator Robert Dole (R-KS), started out prescribing the risk and 
cost-benefit studies in a manner similar to that found in H.R. 1022. The  bill
also would allow citizens to petition agencies to apply  cost-benefit analysis
to regulations already on the books. The Regulatory  Reform Act of 1995, S. 291,
sponsored by Senator William Roth  (R-DE), was less prescriptive, giving federal
agencies more latitude  to make regulatory decisions. The standard for weighing
the  costs and benefits of regulation also was less stringent than in the 
original S. 343. Eventually, the Senate's efforts focused on S. 343,  and the
Democrats and the Clinton Administration were successful  in negotiating changes
with Senate Republicans that severely  weakened the bill relative to similar
provisions found in H.R.  1022. Despite the concessions to Democrats, supporters
of the bill  were unable to garner the necessary 60 votes to impose cloture on 
de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  bate, and the bill stalled in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. &quot;Sunset&quot; and Review.</B> Many believe the regulatory 
system would be more reasonable if the law required that agencies  review and
revise their rules periodically and if those regulations not  re-evaluated
within the prescribed time could no longer be  enforced. Senator Dole's
comprehensive regulatory reform bill  contained &quot;sunset&quot; and review
provisions. In March 1996, the House  attempted to incorporate a bill sponsored
by Representative  David McIntosh (R-IN) that would require agency review of 
regulations into a package of reforms that included small business relief  and
congressional accountability. Strong opposition to this type of  review, from
the White House, House Democrats, and public  interest groups, brought the
renewed House effort to move even a  modest regulatory bill in 1996 to a
standstill. The Senate then moved  forward with a bill that included
congressional accountability  and small business relief. This was conferenced
with an earlier  House-passed bill that did not include administrative review
and was  sent to the President and signed on March 29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress must pursue regulatory reform efforts that not  only streamline the
way in which the federal government issues  rules, but also improve the
underlying scientific data, information,  and analysis used to make decisions
about how or whether to  regulate. A major reason regulation imposes such
tremendous costs is  that Congress and the executive branch often regulate
without  adequately weighing the burdens placed on employers and the  increased
cost to the economy in terms of jobs and  competitiveness. The following reforms
can build upon existing regulatory  review 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  mechanisms to force the
government to prioritize regulations,  assess their costs and benefits, and
adopt the least burdensome  approaches.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen White House oversight of executive branch agencies.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Executive branch agencies are required to submit proposed  regulations to
the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs  (OIRA) within the Office of
Management and Budget. OIRA was  created by the 1980 Paperwork Reduction Act to
reduce federal  paperwork burdens, and President Reagan added to OIRA's 
responsibilities by issuing an executive order requiring executive branch 
agencies to submit proposed regulations to it for review. But if the  White
House does not make deregulation a priority, OIRA allows  agencies a long leash.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Legislation should be adopted to establish OIRA's statutory  authority and
responsibility to review regulation. Because  OIRA's regulatory review function
currently is derived solely from  executive order, a new Administration that
disagrees with this  function could withdraw it simply by revoking the
applicable  order. OIRA's authority also should be expanded beyond the  existing
executive orders to cover rulemaking by independent  agencies such as the
Federal Communications Commission and  Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Establish in statute a set of principles to guide  regulatory
decisionmaking.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The regulatory process needs to be reformed so that scarce  economic
resources can be allocated more efficiently to achieve  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  most good. The concept of smarter
regulation is an important  one to understand in the regulatory reform 
debate.50  The following principles are key elements of this concept:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Cost-benefit analysis.</B> Federal agencies should be
required  to evaluate the costs and benefits of all new regulations. Critics 
will argue that costs and benefits can be difficult to identify or hard  to
quantify, and this may be true. Nevertheless, it is very useful  to begin to get
agencies to think more systematically about the  economic impact of new
regulations by requiring an accounting  and weighing of costs and benefits, to
the extent possible, in  making their decisions.

reflect changes in that scientific  knowledge. Unfortunately, agencies use
extremely conservative or  worst-case assumptions to make up for the lack of
data and high degree  of scientific uncertainty that characterize the current
risk  assessment process.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Risk assessment and risk management.</B> Risk assessment  methods need
to be improved (for example, by using sound science),  and agencies need to
establish a clear distinction between  assessing risks and deciding how to
manage them. Federal agencies  should work closely with the scientific community
to improve risk  assessment guidelines. Today, agencies too often allow policy 
decisions about how to manage risk to influence the determination of  risk. Only
when a risk is identified should a policy decision about  how to handle it be
made.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Risk-based priorities and public education.</B> Government has a 
responsibility to inform the public of risks and to minimize the  distortion and
exaggeration of those risks. By using risk  comparisons, federal agencies can
help the public understand the familiar  risks they face every day, such as
being struck by lighting, and  how these compare with unfamiliar risks, such as
exposure to a  particular chemical in the community.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Market incentives and performance standards.</B> Whenever  regulation is
necessary, it should be accomplished to the extent  possible by setting a goal
and allowing the market to decide how it  will achieve that goal. For example,
instead of requiring businesses  to use specific technology to reduce pollution,
a regulation  should mandate the amount of pollution reduction and allow
businesses  to decide how they will achieve that reduction. Each business  then
has the freedom and the incentive to adopt the least costly  means of achieving
the goal for itself, minimizing the total cost  burden that compliance imposes
on the economy. In contrast,  command-and-control regulations provide no
incentive for the regulated  entity to exceed a regulatory goal.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President and Congress should establish a federal  regulatory budget
that places a ceiling on the total estimated cost that can  be imposed on the
economy each year by all federal regulations.  If the budget total was reached
by existing regulations, an  agency wishing to add a regulation with further
costs would have to  repeal or modify an existing regulation imposing the same
or greater  cost. A regulatory budget would place a politically accountable
limit  on 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  the total burden that could be
imposed on the economy by  federal regulation. It also would give agencies a
strong incentive to  review existing regulations to discover which could be
safely  eliminated or modified to reduce costs. Overall, government would be 
forced to prioritize its regulations and abolish the least beneficial.

<P><B>Deregulate specific industries.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although reform of the regulatory decisionmaking process is  necessary,
policymakers also should continue to push for  deregulation of specific
industries. In the late 1970s and early 1980s,  Congress deregulated several
industries, including the airline, railway,  and interstate trucking industries
and natural gas. The 104th  Congress succeeded in making 1996 the year we see
significant  deregulation of the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress should continue the success of the 104th  Congress and take
action to deregulate the following industries:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Banking.</B> Congress should continue to deregulate the
banking  industry. Three specific areas of banking regulation need to be 
addressed. First, structural restrictions such as the Glass-Steagall  Act of
1933 retard bank stability and expansion and limit the  credit opportunities
banks can offer to businesses. Second, the  current 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  federal deposit insurance system
is a government-operated  safety net that distorts the banking industry at a
great cost to the  taxpayer. Finally, direct banking regulations such as the
Community  Reinvestment Act (CRA) cost consumers and businesses millions  of
dollars each year without correcting the perceived problems  which they are
meant to cure. Banking deregulation will mean that  consumers benefit from being
able to make more profitable  investments, and businesses benefit from the more
efficient flow of  capital through the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Utilities.</B> Policymakers should completely overhaul  regulation
within utilities markets. All consumers should have the right  to purchase
electric services in competitive markets, but  customer choice in electricity
requires the deregulation of the existing  monopoly-controlled industry. The
Federal Power Act and the  Public Utility Holding Company Act are the major
federal statutes  that require the regulation of existing electric utility
monopolies.  Competition, not regulation, is the best way to spur innovation and
 the development of new technologies and services. Opening up  the utilities
market will mean lower cost energy that helps spur  economic growth, create
jobs, increase productivity, and improve  international competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Maritime Industry.</B> Congress should repeal the Jones  Act
(Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920), which  increases the
transportation costs of many U.S. businesses by requiring  that when their
merchandise is transported entirely or partly by  water between United States
points  either directly or via a  foreign point  it must travel in US. - built,
U.S.-flagged,  U.S.-manned, and U.S.-owned vessels. That monopoly raises costs.
No  other U.S. industry has such a costly lock on the economy. In  addition, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  the Jones Act contains liability
provisions that expose ships,  shipyards, terminals, and other companies in the
marine industry  to onerous open-ended liability claims.
</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Repeal of the Jones Act should remove the prohibitive  doing-business
restrictions that require all domestic waterborne cargo to  be carried on
U.S.-flagged, owned, manned, and built vessels. In  addition, the rigid labor

be removed to  improve industry flexibility and increase productivity.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't regulatory &quot;reform&quot; just another way of saying &quot;let's
 roll back twenty years of health, safety and environmental protection?&quot;
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Regulatory reform is an attempt to bring common sense  to the
way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how  to regulate.
Effective regulatory reform means smarter  regulation. One of the consequences
of making smarter decisions is that  we may decide a regulation is not needed,
and this means  reducing regulation. Republicans, like Democrats, want clean
air, clean  water, and safe food and consumer products. Unfortunately,  however,
federal regulators have not done a very good job of allocating  our scarce
economic resources efficiently to achieve these goals.  By making sure that
regulators sensibly and consistently  evaluate risks, compare them to the types
of risk faced by people every  day (such as driving a car or getting hit by
lightning), and consider  the costs and benefits of their actions, we can do an
even better  job protecting the environment and public health and safety  while
spending less.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What role should the federal government play in regulation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A. </B>Most Americans want society to regulate who can be a  doctor or
who can fly an airplane, or to decide what pharmaceuticals  are safe enough to
be placed on open shelves. But most also  would agree that there are good and
bad regulations, some that  make sense and others that are silly and
incomprehensible, and that  the benefits of some are simply not worth the cost,
while others  provide no benefit at all. The federal government should be 
required to consider certain questions about regulations to make sure  they
achieve their intended purposes. These questions include  whether the benefits
outweigh the costs, whether the level of risk  justifies the cost, whether the
regulatory solution being chosen  minimizes the disruption of the free market,
and whether the regulation  is understandable and easy to implement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How do you decide when the benefits of a regulation  outweigh its
costs?  For example, how can you decide how much one life  is worth?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Many ordinary daily activities pose a greater threat to  human
life than the hazards that are regulated. Such risks as driving  without a
seatbelt, which individuals can control, generally pose a  far greater risk than
certain pesticides. Yet the public focuses on  the risk from pesticide. A
10-minute bicycle ride poses the same  risk of death  one-in-a-million  as the
lifetime cancer risk  from wood-preserving chemicals. But only the latter is
regulated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because society has limited resources, it makes sense to  apply them where
the risks are greatest. Environmental regulation  alone 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  now costs America approximately
$170 billion annually.  That means lost jobs, which can pose a far greater risk
to the health  of an individual than many of the problems currently targeted  by
regulations intended to protect health. Thus, it is not a case of  putting an
acceptable &quot;price&quot; on a life, but of determining how  much risk is
avoided by one expenditure as opposed to another. Is  health improved more by
forcing firms to spend money on certain  costly pollution controls, for
instance, or by leaving them free to  spend the same money creating jobs and
improving living standards,  or even hiring more police?  A better appreciation
of risk and cost  has led both Democrats and Republicans to support prioritizing
 risks so that the nation's limited resources are used to deal with  the
greatest threats to human health.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What can be done to relieve the tax, paperwork, and other  regulatory
burdens on small businesses?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The message from small business owners is loud and clear:  The
federal government gets in the way of their ability to survive  and thrive.
Following through on tax and regulatory reform will  give small businesses the
relief they need to create jobs and expand  the tax base. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Today's tax system is a disgrace (see Chapter 2). Billions of  hours are
spent each year to comply with an increasingly  incomprehensible maze of tax
forms, regulations, and documents. In  addition, the current system of
deductions and loopholes is too easily  manipulated by special interests for
their own advantage.  Although the 1995 tax legislation makes a small step
toward easing  these problems, the need for fundamental reform is compelling. A 
flat tax would resolve many of the tax problems we face today. It  rep
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  resents a straightforward, fair
system that can be implemented  by two simple postcards, one for individuals and
one for businesses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Similarly, small businesses today face increasing federal  regulatory
burdens. Too often, command-and-control,  one-size-fits-all federal regulations
put small businesses at a disadvantage.  The cost of compliance falls
disproportionately on small  businesses. The 104th Congress took action to
correct these problems by  passing a small business regulatory reform bill in
March 1996.  This legislation takes step to make sure the economic impact of 
regulation on small businesses is taken into consideration. This  includes
evaluating the economic impact of regulations on small  businesses as well as
ensuring that small business interests are  adequately represented in the
development of regulations. Small  businesses, like any other businesses, also
should have the right to  challenge federal regulations in court, and courts
must have the ability  both to block the implementation of harmful and costly
regulations  and to require agencies to reconsider them.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since the early 1930s, no sector of the American economy has been more heavily regulated than the financial services industry, and particularly commercial banks. Addressing an industry conference, Jerry L. Jordan, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, summed up the extent of banking regulations by noting that 
<blockquote>

For more than 60 years, the Glass-Steagall Act has defined what a banking organization has been allowed to do; the Douglas and other bank holding company acts have defined the corporate form required to do it; the national or state banking authorities, deposit insurance agencies, and Federal Reserve have defined how to do it; and their supervisors and examiners have made sure it was done that way. It's a tribute to the perennial optimism of human beings that a conference on the future of banking might talk about anything other than <I>regulation</I>.<sup>1</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Indeed, it is difficult to speak of banking or any other financial service without also mentioning the overwhelming amount of federal regulation that affects the industry. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At the heart of this regulatory web is the Banking Act of 1933, commonly known as the Glass-Steagall Act. Glass-Steagall established barriers between commercial banks and their investment counterparts. It also established barriers between banks and other commercial businesses so that today, a bank that offers loans and checking accounts cannot also directly underwrite securities for its business customers or offer life insurance policies to its consumers. This theory of "separation banking" continued to drive federal regulation for 60 years. Each time the market established a legal connection between banking and another financial or commercial sector, the government stepped in with new regulations preventing such a relationship. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; As a result of legal restrictions, banks have seen their share of the financial services sector slip away to less-regulated competitors. In fact, between 1952 and 1994, banks, thrifts, and credit unions saw their share of the financial sector fall from 67.4 percent to 35.5 percent,<sup>2</sup> largely because banks are prohibited from taking advantage of innovative investment opportunities and offering modern financial options to their customers. In essence, banks are asked to compete in the technologically advanced 1990s using only 1930s investment techniques. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Consumers suffer substantial harm from the forced separation of financial services. Every producer and consumer in the United States is connected in some way to the financial services industry, be it through a simple $100 checking account or by means of a complex, multibillion-dollar corporate merger. Nearly every economic transaction -- millions of them each day -- involves the exchange of money or the promise of a future exchange of money, so every producer and consumer in the country feels the weight of financial service regulations daily. And every day, producers and consumers pay an unnecessary premium for this burdensome system of regulation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the federal financial regulatory system.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress and the President should allow financial services to be provided within a free market by eliminating the many regulations that currently interfere with efficient transactions and savings. The first step in this process is elimination of the artificial barriers that have been created between commercial and investment banking and all other commercial and financial activities.<sup>3</sup>  Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ul><p><li>

Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella bank holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses;

<p><li>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services;

<p><li>Eliminate all federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and

<p><li>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Enacting these recommendations is the first step in ending more than 60 years of harmful financial regulation and allowing the American financial system to take advantage of modern technology. As a guide to policymakers, this <I>Talking Points</I> reviews the history of federal laws that have prohibited integrated financial services, offers recommendations based on a conclusion that these laws are antiquated, discusses the benefits of financial services reform, and reviews current reform efforts.
<p>
<b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The general framework of modern financial service regulation was set by the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), passed by Congress in reaction to the more than 10,000 bank failures or forced mergers between 1929 and 1933. In general, Glass-Steagall prohibits banks from offering a full range of banking services. According to Jonathan Macey and Geoffrey Miller, authors of <I>Banking Law and Regulation:</I> "Responding to political charges that the Depression had been caused by bank speculation in securities, the Glass-Steagall Act separated commercial banking from investment banking. Securities firms were not to accept deposits or affiliate with deposit-taking institutions; and commercial bank members of the Federal Reserve System were barred from participating, either directly or indirectly, in many aspects of the securities business."<sup>4</sup>  This separation evolved from a fear by politicians that commercial banks were commonly engaged in risky investments using the deposits of individuals and small businesses. From their perspective, banks were gambling with the life savings of an unsuspecting public.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortly before final passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, Senator Carter Glass expressed the depth of this fear: "The main purpose of the bill as passed by the Senate last spring, as Senators will recall, was to prevent, under penalty, the use of Federal Reserve banking facilities for stock-gambling purposes. I use that term in its harshest sense, realizing that it touches the sensibilities of a great many people who persist in calling it 'stock-investment purposes.'"<sup>5</sup>  These comments by one of the Act's principal sponsors epitomize the heated rhetoric that surrounded banking regulation in the early years of the Depression. It is ironic that these words are still used by legislators to justify expansion of strict banking regulations.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The driving fear behind passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 has continued to guide banking regulation ever since. Every time the banking industry found a legal way to link commercial banking with investment services or other commercial activities, federal regulators blocked the path. For example, after the passage of Glass-Steagall, many bankers created bank holding companies or umbrella organizations that owned a share of several different companies. A holding company might have owned a commercial bank, an investment bank, and an insurance company. Because these holdings were separate entities, such an arrangement was legal. And although such an arrangement was not very efficient, it did offer bank holding companies many of the advantages of integrated banking.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, however, was passed to prevent these bank holding companies from simultaneously owning such diverse financial entities. Specifically, the Act "was intended to make bank holding companies subject to federal regulation and, more specifically, to get all of them out of commerce."<sup>6</sup>  Moreover, the same fears about bigness and the safety of individual savings that led to passage of Glass-Steagall also led to passage of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. The principal sponsor of the 1956 Act, Senator Willis Robertson of Virginia, did not hesitate to invoke the shade of his fellow Virginian and predecessor, Carter Glass, recalling that "as early as 1938 Glass realized that the restrictions provided were not adequate to protect independent bankers from possible monopolistic situations and he sought to have them strengthened.... My own efforts to pick up and carry on the attempts of my predecessor to regulate bank holding companies more effectively began in 1949."<sup>7</sup>  As John Kareken notes, "Revealing its fear of bigness, a fear linking it to Congresses past and future, the Eighty-fifth Congress responded with the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956."<sup>8</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This fear of bigness and belief that integrated banks were too risky with individual deposits were evident throughout the 1960s and 1970s as federal courts and regulators continued to separate commercial and investment banking. In a 1981 decision, the Supreme Court declared: "Congress was persuaded that speculative activities, partially attributable to the connection between commercial banking and investment banking, had contributed to the rash of bank failures [leading up to the Great Depression]."<sup>9</sup>  As recently as March 1995, these fears continued to influence congressional action (or in this case, inaction). Testifying before the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services, James L. Bothwell, Director of Financial Institutions and Markets Issues for the General Accounting Office, asked: "How would the public respond if a major company that owned a bank got into trouble?  How would regulators be able to maintain adequate supervision of the company as a whole?"<sup>10</sup>  Because lawmakers evidently found this possibility disconcerting, federal law has continued to prevent banks and bank holding companies from engaging in any other commercial or financial activity, in hopes of preventing bank failures and the loss of depositor money.
<p>
<b>THE CASE FOR REFORM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Two main fears have guided the mandatory separation of commercial banking and investment banking: risk of loss and conflict of interest. These fears have guided federal policy at least since the Depression. However, studies undertaken over the past 35 years have demonstrated that these fears are groundless. This research has demonstrated that integrated banking, a free market in which financial companies are free to engage in any activity they wish, leads to banks that are both safer and less prone to failure. Moreover, most banks carefully avoid a possible conflict of interest because to do so is in the best interest of the company and its investors. The natural conclusion is that laws and regulations which prohibit integrated banking should be eliminated and that commercial banks, bank holding companies, insurance providers, investment banks, and other commercial firms should be allowed to enter a full range of financial and commercial activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Risk of Loss.</b> Perhaps the greatest fear lawmakers have expressed concerning the relationship between commercial banking and investment or other financial activities is that the inherent risk of such endeavors places deposited money in jeopardy. A loss could destroy the financial security of people who have deposited their life savings in the bank.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nor has the bank holding company structure been viewed as any safer with respect to investment money. It is feared, for example, that a bank might simply transfer capital to an affiliated investment bank or insurance company. Considered equally dangerous, "a bank might purchase securities from its affiliate at greater-than-market prices or sell securities and make loans to facilitate securities purchases from the affiliate at less-than-market prices."<sup>11</sup>  In any case, the concern is that bankers would worry first about their own financial interest and only then about the security of bank depositors' money.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If these risks indeed were a threat, or if bankers really were concerned only about their own financial security, banks that engaged in stock market investment before passage of Glass-Steagall would have failed at a greater rate than those which did not involve themselves in such activities. However, this was not the case. In fact, studies have shown that banks involved in securities activities were less likely to fail than those not involved in investing. Eugene White investigated and found that "while 26.3 percent of all national banks failed in this period [from 1930-1933], only 6.5 percent of the 62 banks which had [investment] affiliates in 1929 and 7.6 percent of the 145 banks which conducted large operations through their bond departments closed their doors (see Chart 2)."<sup>12</sup>  On average, banks that engaged in investment activities failed less frequently than those that did not.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reason for the relative stability among integrated banks, as White notes, was their ability to diversify financial activities during a period of slow commercial banking. "This diversification allowed banks to gain new business as their more traditional activities stagnated and to take advantage of significant complementarities in the production of financial services."<sup>13</sup>  Also, integrated banks, primarily from necessity, tended to have larger asset bases which allowed them greater economies of scale during difficult economic times. Ironically, one of the regulators' greatest fears -- bigness -- was actually an asset to banks during the early years of the Depression.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Conflict of Interest.</b> Another important concern of bank regulators is that integrated banks would represent a clear conflict of interest that could lead bank owners and managers to put their own financial interest before that of depositors. For example, many fear that a bank underwriting equity in a company faces a perverse incentive to influence its depositors to invest in that company, even if such an investment is unsound. Banks would have an easy time persuading investors, often considered na<ve, to make risky investments. Senator Robert Bulkley summed up this belief in 1932: "The banker ought to be regarded as the financial confidant and mentor of his depositors. Obviously, the banker who has nothing to sell to his depositors is much better qualified to advise disinterestedly and to regard diligently the safety of depositors than the banker who uses the list of depositors in his savings department to distribute circulars concerning the advantages of this, that or the other investment."<sup>14</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Securities issued by commercial banks or affiliates would have underperformed when compared to securities issued by investment banks if the fear expressed by Senator Bulkley and others were well-grounded. However, evidence from the period before passage of Glass-Steagall indicates otherwise. Randall Krozner and Raghurm Rajan, professors at the University of Chicago, have found that between 1924 and 1940, "investment bank underwritten issues experienced roughly 40 percent more defaults than [did] affiliate underwritten issues."<sup>15</sup>  Additionally, they found that commercial banks and their affiliates tended to underwrite "higher-quality issues" of larger companies that were inherently safer.<sup>16</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated banks tended to underwrite safer securities because the market corrected for the exact fear that legislators wished to regulate away: a risk of individual savings. Most depositors at integrated banks looked very closely at the investment portfolio of their bank to ensure a desirable level of security. Contrary to Senator Bulkley's fears, depositors made informed, sound investment decisions. Investors who were concerned not with safety, but with the potential for a greater return generally went to investment banks. Krozner and Rajan conclude:<blockquote>

Indeed, our results suggest that the public markets and rating agencies were aware of the potential for conflicts (or weak reputations) of the affiliates. The affiliates appear to have responded to the market's concerns by  underwriting primarily more senior securities and securities of older, larger, and better-known firms than did the investment banks.<sup>17</sup></blockquote>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thus, the market during the 1920s -- before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act -- was acting efficiently, with integrated commercial banks serving small investors concerned with safety and investment banks serving larger investors seeking a substantial but openly risky return.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of this evidence leads to a conclusion far different from the one historically driving federal banking regulation: Integrated banks tend to be safer and less averse to conflicts of interest than a combined system of purely investment banks and purely commercial banks.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advancing Technology</b>. The historic evidence by itself is enough to warrant a change in federal financial regulations. However, there is an additional impetus to action. Modern technology has allowed expansion of the financial services sector to the point where banks as traditionally defined are rapidly becoming obsolete. Yet institutions unfortunate enough to be classified as banks are unable to capitalize on new financial opportunities because federal regulations are still guided by laws and principles derived in the 1930s. Not only are banks hurt, but consumers are unable to take advantage of more profitable opportunities made possible by technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider the following:<ul>
<p><li>An average money market mutual fund earns a 4.76 percent annual rate of return,<sup>18</sup> and many offer free checking services. The average commercial bank checking account earns less than 4.0 percent interest annually, and consumers often must pay a service charge for each check or transfer. Although mutual funds are growing in popularity, many consumers do not take advantage of these financial instruments because, with rare exceptions, commercial banks are prohibited from offering them. In many cases, these consumers simply are unaware of the mutual fund option.

<p><li>Many small businesses cannot expand (or even start) because equity capital is difficult and expensive to secure. Such companies are limited in their expansion potential because they cannot incur additional debt. Moreover, these difficulties place small businesses at a disadvantage in comparison to larger corporations that enjoy ready access to investment services and are more able to afford the overhead costs of obtaining equity. Integrated financial service provision would allow local banks and providers to underwrite small local businesses and finance entrepreneurs.

<p><li>Many commercial companies have created financial service departments or affiliates. Banks, on the other hand, are prohibited from entering other commercial sectors. Therefore, they cannot take full advantage of the technology that has made it possible for companies such as General Electric, Ford, and Sears to offer various financially related services such as commercial loans, credit cards, and personal insurance.

<p><li>Technology renders many of the services to which commercial banks are limited obsolete. Today, even small investors can take advantage of large potential earnings by pooling their funds. Additionally, computers and the Internet make financial services more accessible -- but not nearly as accessible as they might be in a world without federal regulations against integrated banking. Commercial banks have the infrastructure to provide an efficient retail market. There are banks in every town in America, often on every corner in larger cities. And while the percentage of the population owning a personal computer with access to the Internet is increasing, nearly 100 percent of the population currently has easy access to a bank. If these banks were allowed to offer a full range of financial services, millions of consumers could take advantage of increased earnings. The economy as a whole also would benefit from a more efficient allocation of financial resources.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The rate at which technology is capable of changing also makes deregulation necessary. As mentioned above, for each federal regulation that aims to prevent integrated banking, the private sector devises a legal bypass. This process is like a perpetual motion machine: As the pace of technological advance quickens, federal regulations become obsolete all the more rapidly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consider just two facts:
<ol><p><li>The pace of technological change over the past ten years has tended to follow Moore's Law. Named for Intel founder Gordon Moore, this law dictates that the power of advanced technology will double roughly every 18 months. In other words, the life cycle of most modern technology is less than two years.

<p><li>The average regulation takes more than two years to conceive, develop, and implement. And this does not include the time needed to legislate changes in major regulations and the time consumed by court proceedings to interpret those regulations.
</ol>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taken together, these facts lead to one overriding question: How can government possibly keep pace with such rapidly changing technology?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the best example of the change technology will bring to the financial services sector is the creation of digital money, often referred to as "e-cash."  E-cash, in its purest form, represents an on-line account that can be used in a manner similar to a debit card. Often called stored-value cards, e-cash accounts are being developed by many non-bank entities. Should non-bank providers be subject to the same reserve requirements and regulations as banks, and will e-cash accounts be covered under federal deposit insurance?<sup>19</sup>  These questions will have to be answered as electronic commerce becomes increasingly popular. But the first question that needs to be addressed is: Will a government-run regulatory structure that takes years to promulgate even a simple rule be able to respond to a technology that has the potential to emerge and change within months?  The answer is that it will not.
<p>
<b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b>
 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The ultimate goal of financial modernization must be to eliminate all barriers that exist between commercial banking, investment banking, and all other commercial and financial activities. It is impossible to repair a system as broken as the current federal financial regulatory system. The only sensible course is to sweep away 60 years of government intervention in financial services and begin anew with a free and open financial market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specifically, Congress and the President should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Repeal the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, which prohibits umbrella holding companies from owning diverse financial businesses, and the 1970 amendments that expand these restrictions to commercial businesses.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first logical step in financial modernization is to allow diverse firms to affiliate under a single umbrella company. Currently, any company that owns a commercial bank is prohibited from owning any other financial service company such as an insurance firm or investment bank. The intent of this restriction is to prevent companies from using the commercial bank's deposits to subsidize risky investments. In reality, however, the Bank Holding Company Act has increased savings and investment costs by preventing an efficient delivery of financial services.

<p><li><b>Repeal the Banking Act of 1933 (the Glass-Steagall Act), which prohibits financial service companies from offering a full range of financial and commercial services.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;True free-market reform would not stop at allowing only affiliations between diverse companies. Individual financial service firms should be permitted to provide a whole range of services, financial and otherwise. This can be accomplished only by repealing the Glass-Steagall Act.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is unclear whether financial service companies, if given the opportunity would choose to structure themselves as individual firms or as financial service holding companies.<sup>20</sup>  However, a single corporate structure should not be imposed by federal fiat. Instead, companies should be free to chose the structure that best suits their customers and shareholders.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are several reasons why financial modernization legislation should include repeal of both the Glass-Steagall Act of 1993 and the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956: <b>First</b>, smaller financial institutions would benefit. These small companies, many serving rural communities, would find it difficult to affiliate with other financial service companies. In order to take advantage of the opportunities flowing from deregulation, small companies might have to "go it alone" and provide insurance, underwriting, and other services within the structure of an individual company.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Second</b>, economic efficiency might require an individual firm to offer a full complement of financial services. A firm with an extensive retail network could find it more advantageous to offer expanded services within its existing structure. For example, a commercial bank with an extensive branch system in place might not want to purchase an insurance company with an entirely separate network of branches. Instead, the bank might find it more efficient to expand services available at existing branches. This would benefit customers by increasing convenience and decreasing transaction costs. The most important goal of modernization should be to ensure that choices about diversification are left to individual firms and not mandated by the federal government.

<p><li><b>Eliminate federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is not enough simply to remove statutory restrictions against integrated banking. Sixty years of federal regulations, rules, and tedious oversight also must be rolled back. And while statutes such as the Banking Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 have set the general framework for federal involvement in financial services, it has been the daily actions of federal regulatory agencies that have tightened the grip on America's financial system.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As with all government agencies, the federal financial regulatory agencies are slow to change. Beginning in the mid-1980s, federal regulators did begin to allow some "well-capitalized" banks to provide limited investment and commercial services. These are steps in the right direction, but because they are exceptions to the rules and are applied somewhat arbitrarily, they create distortions in the financial services market. These exclusions also complicate the regulatory structure so that similar banks with identical characteristics often are treated differently. Moreover, banks without political clout are denied the opportunity to diversify their operations and subsequently are placed at a competitive disadvantage. Finally, it is increasingly difficult for federal regulators to keep pace with changes in technology.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Rolling back the regulatory powers of the various federal financial agencies is every bit as essential as repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 and Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. Only when financial service companies are free from both statutory restraints and regulatory burdens will they be able to take full advantage of the free market.
<p>
<li><b>Allow commercial companies to offer a full range of financial services, including individual savings and checking accounts, small business loans, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services.</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Once existing regulations are eliminated, there will be no restrictions on the financial or investment opportunities available to commercial firms. Any future regulation or federal government action should be concerned only with securing a minimum safety net for individual depositors. Every other transaction and financial service company should be left to the free market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has been much talk recently of creating a two-way street between insurance companies and commercial banks. True free-market financial modernization would go well beyond this to create a virtual autobahn of activity. Financial service companies should be allowed to offer any service they wish and to choose for themselves the companies with which they want to be affiliated. Likewise, commercial firms should be allowed to enter the financial market at any point that seems most advantageous for them. This integration and free entry will breed entrepreneurship, which in turn will produce lower costs and make available more consumer services.</ol>

<p>
<b>Benefits of These Recommendations</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 <b>Increase the safety and soundness of all banks.</b> First-year economics students learn that diversity helps increase stability. Likewise, any investor who desires a safe portfolio diversifies his investments. The past 60 years of financial regulation have ignored this basic economic understanding, and banks have continued to fail as a result. Integrated financial service provision will increase the safety and soundness of all financial companies by allowing them to diversify their operations just as individual investors and other commercial companies do.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History proves that banks with diverse operations are less likely to fail than those restricted to specific activities. Research by Eugene White, for example, has demonstrated that in the 1920s, before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act, banks engaged in investment activities were less likely to fail than banks engaged solely in consumer activities (see Chart 2).<sup>21</sup>  In fact, the majority of banks that failed during the late 1920s were small banks with limited investments and activities. No witnesses testifying in 1931, including the Comptroller of the Currency, the chairman of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and numerous bank executives, mentioned securities-related activity as the cause of any bank failures.<sup>22</sup>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A second example is provided by the failure of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s. As early as 1982, analysts were predicting a bleak outlook for S&Ls. Brookings Institution economist Andrew Carron wrote that "As a result of this decline in net worth and asset values, between 15 and 27 percent of the federally insured firms in the [savings and loan] industry would find themselves in an untenable position: without drastic cost cutting, good fortune, or a cash infusion from the government, they would be unable to return to break-even operations. Ultimately, they would fail."<sup>23</sup>  Indeed, between August 1989 and the end of 1992, 642 savings and loans failed. The primary reason, again predicted by Carron, was that "[t]ax laws and regulatory practice have forced savings and loans and mutual savings banks to hold fixed-rate long-term residential mortgages as their principal assets and to accept the short-term deposits of households as their major source of funds."<sup>24</sup>  Looking back on the crisis, Alan Gart wrote that the number one reason so many S&Ls failed was "a combination of mismatched maturities of fixed-rate mortgages and variable-rate short term deposits during a period of rising interest rates."<sup>25</sup>  In other words, savings and loans were not allowed to diversify their services or their assets. As long as mortgage rates and consumer interest rates were compatible, this was not a problem. But as soon as the housing market turned sour, many S&Ls failed because they had no offsetting profitable activities.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Integrated financial service provision would allow financial service companies to diversify their investment portfolios so that downturns in one sector could be offset by upturns in others. In economics, this is known as vertical integration. Integrated financial service provision also would allow diversification of services, permitting financial service companies to move resources from inactive services to those that are active and profitable. For example, when the real estate market is in a downturn, companies could move resources from the mortgage industry to a more profitable sector, such as life insurance.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow regional banks a more diverse operating arena to serve their clients better.</b> Many analysts believe that financial service deregulation would drive small local banks out of business and that would be the end of personal banking. On the contrary, integrated financial service provision would allow local financial companies to expand the arena in which they operate, thereby increasing the number of services they can offer their local community. Local financial companies are best able to understand the unique needs of the communities in which they operate, and expanding the opportunities of these companies will allow them to meet their community needs more effectively.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Also, integrated financial service provision would allow many small, regional financial service companies to diversify their activities, which is inherently more stable. The evidence cited above shows that banks with diverse portfolios are less likely to fail. The reason for increased stability with diversification is simple. Diversity allows a financial service provider to offset slow times in one market area with growth in another. Diversity is the key to any stable investment strategy and should be allowed in the banking industry.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This would be particularly important in rural areas for two reasons. First, it is accepted increasingly that the future success of the American agriculture industry will depend on exports. Farmers and the agriculture community will need to take advantage of efficient foreign exchange markets, financial futures trading, and other mechanisms to increase export opportunities for their commodities. This is possible only if regional financial service companies are allowed increased access to these financial activities through integrated financial service provision. Second, regional rural banks historically have been subject to economic swings in the agriculture industry. Because current law limits banks to narrow fields of operation, such natural events as a drought or freeze can cause the failure of a rural bank limited to agriculture lending, and this failure can exacerbate the problems faced by a rural community. The ability to provide integrated financial services would allow rural financial service companies to diversify their activities, thus decreasing their susceptibility to swings in the agricultural industry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow small businesses and entrepreneurs to secure capital more easily.</b> One of the primary benefits of integrated financial service provision would be the ability of commercial banks to underwrite equity for businesses. This would allow small businesses to go directly to local banks to secure equity rather than being forced to go to a separate investment bank, thus incurring higher transaction costs. Also, many investment banks today do not concentrate on reaching small businesses because of the high costs involved. Capital markets would become more accessible to all businesses, especially small or regional companies, once all financial service providers were given the option of underwriting securities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Allow greater access to capital markets for individual investors.</b> Eugene White has noted that many commercial banks entered investment banking in the 1920s because they "had established extensive retailing networks among their depositors during [World War I]. Unlike investment bankers who generally had a small clientele of the well-to-do, commercial banks had large numbers of potential customers, each of whom could invest a small amount in securities."<sup>26</sup>  These banks saw an underdeveloped market in small investors and reacted in a typical market-oriented manner until Congress prevented such a move by passing the Glass-Steagall Act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same opportunity exists for commercial banks today. Integrated banks would be able to take advantage of their extensive network of local branches and affiliates. Gerald O'Driscoll, Vice President and Director of Policy Analysis for Citicorp, recently wrote that "The homework banks do to process a loan application frequently duplicates that needed to write an insurance policy. Further, the distribution system is already present in every bank lobby."<sup>27</sup>  Likewise, insurance agents and other networked financial service providers would be able to offer their customers more services at lower cost. This all means that consumers who have access to a local bank or insurance agency, but not to the Internet or an investment bank, will be provided with more options when investing their savings.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Require fewer transaction costs for customers.</b> Not only would integrated financial service provision provide greater access to financial markets for all investors and businesses, but it would do so more efficiently in many instances. As mentioned above, commercial banks have an extensive network of local offices, affiliates, automated teller machines (ATMs), and branches. Accompanying this structure is a communications and managerial infrastructure that must be duplicated by a separate investment bank and a separate insurance agency. By combining these services, consumers would be able to take advantage of economies of scale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many of the administrative duties required by banks also duplicate those required by insurance agents or investment companies. For example, a loan mortgage application contains much the same information as a homeowner's insurance contract. Likewise, a business loan application requires much the same financial information as a request for securities underwriting. If a single financial institution could offer all of these services, many of these duplicated efforts would be eliminated and costs reduced. Reduced costs allow individuals and businesses to make more valuable purchases and more investors and entrepreneurs to enter the financial markets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, integrated financial service provision would lead more financial service institutions to offer discount brokerage service, mutual funds, and other similar opportunities. Many individuals unable to reach these markets in the past because of high transaction costs were forced to settle for a single savings vehicle, even if that vehicle was not ideally suited to their needs. These investors, often of the lower working class, would be able to access a greater selection of investments and would soon realize a higher rate of return on their savings. Additionally, the market in general would perform more efficiently because a larger part of aggregate savings would be invested in more efficient and profitable avenues.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  <b>Allow capital to flow through the American economy more efficiently.</b> Many economists believe that prohibiting integrated financial service provision is a drag on the American economy because savings are not allocated efficiently. As Michael Porter has written, "The United States possesses an enormous pool of investment capital. The problem lies in how this capital is allocated -- at what rates and into what kinds of investments."<sup>28</sup>  For example, restrictions on the activities of commercial banks prevent them from informing investors about the full range of opportunities available to them. Also, the transaction costs of dealing with two separate banks (one commercial and the other investment) prevent many investors from moving their capital from a less profitable investment to a more profitable one because it is simply too inconvenient. The result is that investment is not directed toward its most efficient end.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Demand and supply of capital investment would be met better if financial service companies were allowed to offer a full range of investment opportunities and commercial businesses were able to offer financial services. More investors would have access to a broader range of investment vehicles. Increased consumer selection would lead more individuals to make better choices in the investment methods they employ. And the increased competition would force financial service providers to improve the quality of their products and increase the efficiency with which they deliver those products to the market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
  <b>Decrease the cost of capital faced by American companies.</b> A more efficient allocation of investment would lead to a lower cost of capital. First, transaction costs would decrease. Transaction costs constitute a significant component of the cost of capital faced by companies in the American financial market. An integrated financial services system would enable a company to complete more financial transactions through a single broker-dealer, eliminating the need for duplicate paperwork and other such administrative expenses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closely related to a decrease in transaction costs is a more efficient allocation of economic resources. Current financial regulations, by definition, obstruct the natural market flow of capital, thus creating an inefficient distribution system. Capital would be allocated more efficiently if unhindered by artificial government barriers. A more efficient delivery system would produce less expensive capital for American businesses.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, a closer relationship between banks and commercial interests would form because banks would be both lenders and owners of companies. A financial service provider that owns stock in a company through the underwriting process has a stake in the success of that company and is more likely to work closely with the other owners to avoid bankruptcy. Large companies also would be able to carry a greater amount of debt (in relation to equity), which would lower the cost of capital because debt is usually less expensive than equities. The lower cost of debt would lead to a lower cost of capital.<sup>29</sup>  This, and the decreased risk of bankruptcy, would produce more stable companies and lower prices.
<p>

<b>THE MYTHS AND REALITY OF REFORM</b>
<p>
<b>MYTH: Independent insurance agents will be driven out of business.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: The future is not bright for independent insurance agents, even without significant financial modernization.</b> Technology has made it possible for insurance companies to sell policies directly to consumers without relying on distribution by agents. For example, some insurance companies are offering their services on the Internet. This technological bridge between producer and consumer makes the independent agent an expensive -- if not unnecessary -- intermediate. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
True integrated financial service legislation would allow a single company to offer any financial or commercial service or, optionally, to affiliate with any financial or commercial entity. A "two-way street" would be created whereby commercial banks could begin to offer insurance products and insurance agents could provide banking services. Thus, insurance agents and bankers would be equally free to engage in a full range of financial services. Insurance agents, for this reason, and with the impetus of an otherwise bleak future, should support full deregulation so they can diversify their operations and increase their customer base.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Small local banks will be eliminated as large national financial service providers become more powerful.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Local banks will always have a place in the financial services industry.</b> The personal service and unique products they can provide will allow small banks to fill a market niche. A recent <I>Wall Street Journal</I> article highlighted the story of Catawba Valley Bank, a new local bank opened on November 1, 1995, in Hickory, North Carolina.<sup>30</sup>  The bank, which prides itself on individual attention and local investments, was launched by Steve Aaron, who left his job as an executive officer of a large statewide bank. The story of Catawba Valley is not unique: New U.S. bank charters rose to nearly 150 in 1995, almost 300 percent more than during the previous year.<sup>31</sup>  Clearly, there is a demand for local banks that can deal with customers in a personal manner. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, integrated financial service provision would give local banks the ability to offer more services to their customers, thus increasing their ability to survive. Just as General Motors and Ford are able to offset slow sales of luxury sedans with increased sales of all-purpose trucks or gas-efficient compacts, so would financial service providers be able to offset slow mortgage loan sales with increased mutual fund investments. The increased stability of integrated financial service provision benefits not only the financial institution itself, but also the consumers. A stable financial institution precludes the cost and inconvenience of changing financial vendors and opening new accounts.
<p>
<b>MYTH: Integrated banks will make risky investments with deposited money.</b>
<p>
<b>REALITY: Economic theory and historic evidence both indicate that integrated financial service companies would make safe investments with deposited money or else pay a premium for risky activity.</b> Many investors are interested in earning a high rate of return on their deposits, and willing to accept the risk that accompanies the possibility of such a payoff. On the other hand, many investors seek a safe harbor for their funds (or at least a minimal portion of them) and prefer financial service providers that make only secure investments. And while safety-seeking investors cannot expect as high a rate of return on their deposits, they can be sure of the safety of their investments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This system is essentially a pricing system for financial services. It would operate just as the pricing of automobiles does. Buyers who want a safe car that gets good gas mileage are willing to pay more than somebody looking for the economy of a used motorcycle. The important point is that the market will deliver the services (in this case, financial investment tools) that consumers demand. And because many investors seek a secure harbor for at least part of their savings, the market will deliver financial service providers that make such secure investments possible. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The work of Kroszner and Rajan indicates that before passage of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1933, commercial banks engaged in equity underwriting made more secure investments in larger businesses than did pure investment banks.<sup>32</sup>  Thus, banks free to invest in any manner they wished realized that their customers expected a degree of safety and therefore made relatively secure investments.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
<b>RECENT CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Two major reform proposals were advanced during the first session of the 104th Congress. These bills represent the third time in the past five Congresses that repeal of financial service separation laws has been attempted. Compromise legislation failed in 1988 and 1991. Both of last year's proposals would amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 by allowing bank holding companies to affiliate with other financial service providers, although neither bill would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Representative Jim Leach (R-IA), Chairman of the House Banking Committee, introduced H.R. 1062, the Financial Services Competitiveness Act of 1995, on February 27. Chairman Leach's bill would allow a "financial services holding company" to own both banking and investment affiliates. This would lead to a greater integration of commercial banking and investment banking. Chairman Leach's original bill would not have allowed a financial services holding company to own an insurance affiliate, however. Also, any holding company that currently has an insurance affiliate would be required to disassociate from that firm if it wanted to acquire a commercial bank. There would be no "two-way street" and no full integration of financial services.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second bill was introduced by Senator Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY), Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and Representative Richard Baker (R-LA), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities, and Government-Sponsored Enterprises. The Depository Institution Affiliation Act (H.R. 814 as introduced by Representative Baker) would allow a commercial bank to affiliate with any other financial services company or commercial entity, including an insurance provider or an investment bank. The D'Amato-Baker proposal, because it would allow a greater range of affiliation, would lead to greater and more efficient integration of financial services than Representative Leach's bill.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The D'Amato-Baker bill presents a much purer approach to financial service integration by allowing affiliation among all financial and non-financial companies. It also would allow greater flexibility of affiliate interaction by creating fewer "firewalls" between a holding company's affiliates. For example, under Chairman Leach's bill, senior officers of one affiliate would be prohibited from simultaneously serving as senior officers of another. The D'Amato-Baker bill would extend no such restrictions. Also, and perhaps most important, the Leach bill would require holding companies themselves to be "adequately capitalized."  The D'Amato-Baker bill would place such capitalization restrictions only on insured depository affiliates.<sup>34</sup>  The overall greater freedoms allowed in the D'Amato-Baker proposal are vital first steps toward a free-market approach to integrated financial service provision. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Neither the Leach nor the Baker bill moved beyond the full Banking Committee in the House during 1995. The progress of both bills was stalled as representatives of the banking industry and the insurance industry failed to reach agreement on the integration of their services. This disagreement ultimately stalled all banking reform legislation. Senator D'Amato's bill was never marked up in committee as the Senate awaited action by the House.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent Supreme Court ruling in <I>Barnett Bank v. Nelson</I><sup>35</sup> clears the way for federal banks to sell insurance in small towns. The decision held that federal laws allowing such transactions pre-empt state laws preventing insurance sales by banks. The decision has given Chairman Leach the opportunity to push for significant reform again this year. Leach also has modified his bill to allow affiliation of banks and insurance companies, thus creating a more complete integration of financial services. However, the bill still has a number of weaknesses, including burdensome firewalls and the exclusion of non-financial commercial companies from the integration process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Neither the new Leach bill (H.R. 2520) nor the D'Amato-Baker bill is perfect. Neither one would allow a single company to engage in a full range of financial service provisions. Affiliations would allow greater efficiency but not complete freedom for financial service companies. True reform would use the D'Amato-Baker proposal as a transition to elimination of all restrictions on financial integration. 
<p>
 <b>CONCLUSIONS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The financial service sector is the most ubiquitous sector of the modern American economy. Commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, securities trading markets, credit card providers, and other financial services are both the backbone of the commercial market and the fuel in the American economic engine. Every day, every American depends on the financial services sector to pay bills, purchase goods, pay for education, prepare for retirement, or create a business. For this reason, it is imperative that America secure an efficient and modern financial service system.

It is impossible to create such a system within the confines of the current statutory and regulatory structure, the guiding principles of which have not changed since the early 1930s. The impetus for change is made even stronger by the rapid pace of technological change. The current regulatory structure depends on being able clearly to define a bank, an insurance agent, and a security issue. But should a shopping mall-based ATM that can process loan applications be considered a bank?<sup>36</sup>  If so, how can a machine be accused of racial bias in its decisions?  Should an Internet World Wide Web site, through which anybody can apply for an insurance policy, be considered an agent?  And if so, how can one state regulate that web page, which is globally accessible?  Even if these questions are answered within the context of the current regulatory regime, they will be replaced by others. 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The only solution is to sweep away the past 60 years of financial regulation and begin the process of market-oriented modernization. Current financial service regulations and the thinking they embody were misguided at their creation and are certainly misguided and outdated today. A free-market approach to financial deregulation also would benefit American consumers and businesses. More profitable investments would be available; capital would be easier to obtain, and its cost would be reduced; and the financial services sector would enjoy more stability and security. These advantages would resound through the economy every day as individual investors and companies took advantage of this more efficient and secure financial sector.<p><b>ENDNOTES</b><p><ol><li>

<h2>Taking a Byte out of Disability</h2>
<b>by John Hood</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While cleaning up the hard disk on my computer recently, I came 
across an accessory that I had never noticed before called "Text to Speech." Intrigued, I opened it and 
discovered that my relatively low-end computer could convert standard text files into speech. It can read 
aloud whatever I wish, from a brief newspaper column to a massive document.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The voice sounds very much like the one you hear throughout A Brief 
History of Time, a movie based on the book by scientist Stephen Hawking. Struck down by a debilitating 
illness that robbed him of speech and most of his mobility, Hawking has nevertheless become the world's 
most celebrated physicist and cosmologist. His extraordinary accomplishments were made possible by 
technologies that allow him to operate a computer -- and even, through it, to speak to movie audiences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's amazing to me is not that such technologies exist, but that they 
are so commonplace as to be installed in a run-of-the-mill personal computer like mine. In fact, 
inexpensive programs and devices have dramatically expanded the economic opportunities of disabled 
Americans, not only improving their own lives but allowing all of us to benefit from previously untapped 
talents and resources.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mark Beckwith of Greenville, Maine, is a quadriplegic. But he is also a 
draftsman for the Log Home Co., thanks to innovative products from a Massachusetts firm called Dragon 
Systems. For less than a thousand dollars, you can purchase DragonDictate and run sophisticated computer 
programs by voice. The system converts each word it hears into text by piecing together the word's 
components and then comparing the combination with acoustic models in its built-in vocabulary list. By 
speaking key commands such as "Shift-Alt-F4," the user can operate spreadsheets, word processors, and 
even the drafting programs that Beckwith uses to design house-building plans.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other low-cost computer devices that aid disabled users include screen-
magnification software ($200 to $600), Braille-output printers and translators ($2,100 to $4,000), and 
head-pointer or Morse-code systems that allow severely disabled people to issue computer commands 
($500 to $1,400).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Toward the opposite end of the cost scale is another product that helps 
quadriplegics accomplish tasks, called EyeGaze. Developed by LC Technologies in Fairfax, Virginia, it 
allows users to turn on appliances, run machinery, type letters, and play video games with eye movements. 
The device uses beams of light to translate movements into computer commands. Even at a price of 
$25,000, EyeGaze offers many seriously disabled people opportunities they never thought they had.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The market for products to enable physically handicapped workers -- 
ranging from speech synthesis and voice-input systems to robotics, deaf relays, Braille text displays, text 
telephones, monitoring devices, and environmental controls -- includes such major players as IBM, AT&T, 
Xerox, Nynex, Digital Equipment, and Apple. Thought of more broadly, products ranging from 
pharmaceuticals to ergonomic office furniture are also part of this effort to empower the disabled. Prozac 
and other antidepressants have helped many workers keep their jobs and improve their performance. Pain 
relievers allow employees with arthritis and similar ailments to perform work without enduring 
excruciating pain. Redesigned desks, chairs, and other equipment have done the same for those with 
chronic back problems, who make up about 15 percent of all people considered "disabled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Many observers who have taken notice of American businesses' 
interest in this market have attributed it to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), enacted in 1990 and 
fully implemented in 1994. The ADA, among other things, requires businesses with 15 or more employees 
to give "equal access" to all disabled workers and consumers. Portrayed as a civil-rights measure no less 
important than the 1960s legislation against racial discrimination, the ADA may have attracted the 
attention of some firms that otherwise wouldn't have entered the market for disabled-enabling products. 
But its overall effect on the employability of the disabled is a great deal more complicated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For one thing, the ADA has mainly affected not hiring but firing. In its 
first two years, about half of all ADA claims involved alleged wrongful discharges, while only 12 percent 
charged discrimination in hiring disabled workers. In one case, a senior executive with terminal brain 
cancer who had been fired was awarded $222,000 because his employer could not prove in court that he 
was unable to perform the essential functions of his job. In all too many cases, it appears, workers 
discharged for a variety of reasons have added the ADA to their other legal means of obtaining large 
severance payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Second, the targeted beneficiaries of the ADA include very few of the 
seriously disabled Americans that both proponents and opponents of the law tend to talk about. About half 
a million Americans are wheelchair bound, but almost 50 million Americans are considered "disabled" for 
the purposes of the ADA. They include those with relatively minor physical or mental infirmities. And they 
make up the vast majority of plaintiffs in ADA lawsuits alleging wrongful termination.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Third, the ADA may actually hinder rather than advance opportunities 
for disabled workers. It's harder to prove discrimination in hiring than wrongful termination -- that's why 
lawsuits alleging the latter are so much more common. Rather than face the potential legal consequences of 
letting a disabled worker go, even for perfectly appropriate reasons, some employers may well want to 
limit their exposure to such suits by not hiring the disabled in the first place, accepting the risk of 
noncompliance on the hiring side in order to avoid the much greater risk of wrongful termination suits. 
And their caution may be vindicated by the rash of spurious ADA claims by people claiming to be disabled 
by obesity, kleptomania, sex addiction, severe body odor, and "multiple chemical sensitivity." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is that efforts to expand opportunities for disabled people far 
predates the ADA. The term "disabled" is itself relative, meaningful only according to the tasks one wants 
to perform and the technology available to help one do so. We now have more people living with physical 
and mental infirmities than ever before. In the past, those born with birth defects often didn't make it past 
infancy. Injuries that today lead to loss of limbs or motor control used to be deadly.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On the other hand, the number of people who are functionally disabled, 
especially as it relates to employment, is surely lower. For most of human history, persons lacking nimble 
fingers or strong backs had little prospect of making a living. The advent of farm implements and simple 
devices such as looms increased the number of people who could perform work quickly and easily, thus 
increasing the standard-of-living for all. Similarly, until the invention of eyeglasses, an enormous number 
of human beings became virtually unemployable at an early age.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thanks to modern machinery and appliances, many jobs no longer 
require great physical strength and endurance. Now, the Information Age promises to expand the 
boundaries of human potential even further, as the mind -- not the body -- becomes the most valuable asset 
a worker or entrepreneur can bring to the marketplace.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is true even for the hardest cases. Researchers at Rutgers and 
Princeton universities have found that computers have significantly enhanced job opportunities and 
boosted earnings for many people with spinal-cord injuries. The researchers found that, all else held equal, 
people who have computer skills at the time of their injuries generally return to work more quickly than 
those without such skills. They also discovered that disabled workers with computer skills suffer no 
disparity in pay versus their counterparts without disabilities, while those without such skills do get paid 
less.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Modern computer technologies are mostly the product of competitive 
private markets, not government programs or regulations. By decisively shifting the source of economic 
value to ideas and away from physical exertion, computers and other information technologies have helped 
Americans with serious disabilities far more than has the ADA. Indeed, while the percentage of the 
disabled who are employed rose, especially among women, in the 20 years preceding the passage of the 
law, it has since leveled off. The National Organization on Disabilities studied the issue in 1986 and again 
in 1994, finding that the percentage of working disabled stayed roughly the same, given the margin of 
sampling error: 33 percent in 1986 versus 31 percent in 1994. Of course, there could be many explanations 
for this, but as Brian Doherty of Reason magazine concluded, "there is certainly no evidence, despite all 
the costs, that the ADA has helped" the disabled gain employment.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Private firms have incentives to develop, manufacture, and market 
products to empower disabled workers regardless of government regulation. There is already significant 
consumer demand for these items. The disabled want them to improve their own prospects and quality of 
life. And their potential employers have an incentive to create jobs for the most talented and hard-working 
individuals. Long before the advent of the ADA, companies such as Du Pont and Marriott discovered that 
efficiently accommodating the needs of disabled workers can boost performance and employee morale.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Many employees with disabilities have really overcome many 
obstacles to being successfully employed and have shown lots of perseverance and creativity in showing 
how a job can be done," says Lana Smart of the National Center for Disability Services.
Indeed, there is an important qualitative difference between the way regulators approach workplace 
disability and the way private firms and individuals do. For regulators, the disabled represent a cost that 
must be imposed on unwilling businesses. In the private market for labor, however, finding ways to 
unleash the creative talents of the disabled can yield significant returns for firms, workers, and consumers. 
The disabled are viewed as potentially valuable assets, rather than potentially costly liabilities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It may be true that some severely disabled individuals cannot be 
profitably employed today, because the costs of doing so exceed the value of the work they can do. But 
they used to think that about the nearsighted, the slender-bodied, and the club-footed. It must not be 
forgotten that people have always found ways to eliminate those barriers to employment, without the 
prodding of government regulators.

<h2>Charlotte, the Queen of Southern Banking</h2>
<b>by <a href="/heritage/staff/hood.htm">John Hood</a></b>
</CENTER>
<P>
	In the early 1980s, the Texas banking industry seemed like a sure winner. The oil industry 
was booming. The state's population was growing rapidly as workers came in search of Sun-Belt 
prosperity. Major Texas-based manufacturing and retail enterprises burgeoned. Not surprisingly, 
some of the fastest-growing U.S. banks were located in bustling Houston and Dallas.
<p>
	But then the bottom fell out of gas prices -- and the banking industry. By 1990, the state's 
largest banks no longer existed, resulting in billions of dollars in bad loans and leaving bank 
customers confused and angry. Suddenly, the dominant players in the state's banking industry 
were those that hailed from faraway places like North Carolina and Ohio.
<p>
	It was not pleasant to be a bank customer in Texas back then. If you were a depositor in a 
bank that collapsed, you may have gotten all or part of your money back from the FDIC -- but 
you lost other things, such as convenience and a sense of security. If you owned a small business 
and badly needed a loan to expand, the picture looked even bleaker. Failing banks aren't likely to 
lend you money or cut you slack when you need it most.
<p>
	Other states have seen downturns in their dominant industries without suffering the double-
whammy of bank failures. The difference is government regulation. Until recently, Texas 
imposed strict geographical and size restrictions on its banks. Statewide branching was 
prohibited. These regulatory barriers kept Texas banks tethered to particular cities or regions, 
protecting them from competition and giving them little incentive to embrace innovation and 
serve consumers better. Lacking the diversification necessary to weather the oil glut of the 1980s, 
the state's banks either went under, saw the value of their equity drop, or were bought by 
stronger banks from more competitive, less regulated markets.
<p>
	One such market was Charlotte, North Carolina, home to NationsBank and First Union, two 
of the nation's 10 largest banks. At first glance, the idea that Charlotte would be one of 
America's leading financial centers seems absurd. With one-fifth the population of Houston, 
Charlotte has no obvious advantages in commercial influence or financial acumen. Yet Charlotte 
has become the banking capital of the Southeast. And NationsBank has become the largest bank 
in Texas.

<P>
	A major reason for the ascension of North Carolina banks to the upper tier of the industry is, 
once again, regulation. The state has some of the least restrictive bank regulations in the country. 
The state legislature authorized statewide branching in 1814; at the beginning of this century, the 
state began to charter banks and allowed them to sell insurance and other financial services. In 
the following decades, banks in the largest cities established branches across the state and began 
selling such products as annuities, commercial insurance, and securities.
<p>
	By the 1980s, a bank customer in North Carolina enjoyed many benefits unavailable to his 
peers in Texas. He could transact business with the same bank virtually anywhere in the state, 
which accelerated routine tasks such as clearing checks, depositing funds, and seeking balance 
information. He could purchase more services at lower cost than in Texas, because statewide 
banks can spread fixed administrative expenses over more branches and customers and can hire 
more experienced bankers. He was much more likely to have access to national ATM networks 
and bank credit cards with low interest rates. Most importantly, he had security. With a 
diversified loan portfolio and depositor base, his bank was less dependent on the economic health 
of dominant local industries.
<p>
	The benefits of competition in banking have become increasingly clear. In 1960, the year that 
NCNB (NationsBank's predecessor) was created from the merger of two small banks, North 
Carolina was one of 16 states with statewide branching. Over the next 20 years, there were only 
17 bank failures in those states, compared with 45 failures in the states that allowed limited 
regional branching and 66 failures in the states that prohibited branching altogether. 
<p>
	During the 1980s, a combination of economic turmoil and bad policy decisions created even 
more banking risk. In the first four years of the decade, more than 500 savings-and-loans and 
almost 200 commercial banks failed. Then things got worse. In 1988 alone, 200 banks and 233 
savings-and-loans closed or were liquidated. Most failures occurred in highly regulated states.
<p>
	By 1990, most states had figured out what North Carolina already knew: Competition is better 
than protection. Only three states continued to prohibit branching, while 33 allowed it statewide. 
Furthermore, Texas and other states dropped their longtime aversion to interstate banking and 
allowed banks in nearby states to acquire failing institutions.
<p>
	For banks in North Carolina (as well as in Ohio, New York, and California) that were bred in 
fiercely competitive statewide markets, even this limited form of interstate banking represented a 
golden opportunity. NCNB went into Florida in 1981, South Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland in 
1986, and Texas in 1988. A subsequent merger with C&S/Sovran in Virginia created 
NationsBank, which continued to enter new markets in the Southeast, most recently 
consolidating its position in Georgia by acquiring Bank South.
<p>	
Charlotte's other big bank, First Union, has also pursued numerous acquisitions in the new era of 
interstate banking. Most recently, it purchased First Fidelity Bancorp, making it the largest bank 
in New Jersey and sixth largest in the U.S.
<p>
	The First Fidelity deal illustrates why competition and interstate banking have much to offer 
consumers. As with statewide branching, interstate banking makes it easier for customers to do 
routine things. Travelers to another state can often bank at their own institution, which is usually 
cheaper and easier. Checks clear faster and are accepted at more businesses. Firms with 
operations in various states can work with a familiar institution rather than learning new rules 
and developing new relationships every time they expand. And according to economist Steven 
Horwitz of St. Lawrence University, both business and residential borrowers find it easier to get 
credit. "Banks in states with more liberal branching laws use a greater proportion of their 
resources for loans than do banks in states that limit branching," he says.
<p>
	For Garden State customers, the differences will be immediately noticeable, say banking 
analysts. "First Union, Nationsbank, and Wachovia [another major N.C. bank] offer customer 
service that is clearly superior" to the New Jersey norm, says Anthony Davis of Dean Witter 
Reynolds. Many New Jersey banks still close at 3 p.m., and few offer customers automated 
systems for checking balances or conducting transactions by telephone. With the arrival of First 
Union, New Jersey's mutual-fund investors can also enjoy one-stop shopping at their local bank.
<p>
	Of course, bigger is not necessarily better. It is competition, not size per se, that has allowed 
banks in less regulated markets to serve their customers better. Although North Carolina has 
fewer separate banking institutions per capita than most states, its competitive climate allows 
plenty of mid-sized and small banks to continue to battle successfully with large banks for 
market share across the state. 
<p>
	"I think community banking will always have a future because a number of people want to be 
known by name," says Bill Graham, the former banking commissioner of North Carolina. By 
identifying niche markets and improving customer service, home-grown banks in such states as 
Texas and Florida have thrived even as out-of-state banks have moved in. Post Oak Bank in 
Houston, for example, specializes in private banking and trust services for middle- and upper-
income professionals. "We felt the five big banks would be very dominant in the mass retail 
market," says chairman Kent Anderson, "but we felt opportunities existed to work the personal-
services business."
<p>
	Actually, the best way to keep community banking healthy may well be to push for even more 
deregulation. Sidney Bostian, former chairman and CEO of Investors Savings Bank, the   
second-largest thrift in Virginia, says that community banks are hurt most  by costly state and 
federal regulatory burdens and by high taxes and fees, because larger competitors can spread 
such costs over a greater number of workers and customers. "While consolidation is a desirable 
outcome in our banking system," Bostian says, "policymakers should take care not to create 
artificial incentives for bank mergers."
<p>
	In 1994, Congress extended interstate banking across the U.S. to speed the development of 
interstate branching, which means even more convenience for consumers. Paul Calem, senior 
economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, argues that interstate branching would 
also "enhance competition in banking, benefiting consumers through more favorable interest 
rates and fees."
<p>
	But some people never learn. Despite the benefits of banking freedom, Texas and a few other 
states may opt out of interstate branching, as the federal law allows. For the most part, though, 
bank customers everywhere are starting to enjoy the benefits of competition that states like North 
Carolina have long produced. And improbable Charlotte, not Dallas or Houston, is likely to 
remain the financial powerhouse of the South.

<P>American labor law is largely a product of the conditions and  perspectives
of the 1930s. It needs to be reformed. Today's  economy, labor market, and
labor-management relations are very  different from the time when most of
America's major labor laws  were passed. Instead of modernizing labor law in
recent years,  however, the federal government has continued to place more 
regulations, mandates, and taxes on employers and workers. The result:  fewer
job opportunities and slower real wage growth.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past 25 years, the United States has moved from a  manufacturing to
a global service economy, competition has  increased, and more American women
are working than ever before.  Workers are demanding more flexible hours,
working conditions,  compensation packages, and workplace involvement than
current laws  and regulations allow. Employers are straining under 
unnecessarily burdensome regulations, mandates, lawsuits, and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Reform of America's labor laws is long overdue. The  primary objectives of
this reform should be to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Reduce</B> excessive burdens on businesses, job
opportunities,  and real wage growth while maintaining workplace health and
safety;
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Improve</B> labor-market flexibility while maintaining basic  employment
protections; and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen</B> and expand workers' rights to work at home, to join  or
not join unions, and to form employee-employer committees  to improve
productivity, quality, and customer service.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Fundamental changes that focus on these objectives would  free workers and
employers to create a family-friendly labor  market, increase productivity, and
improve real wage growth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Reforming the administration and enforcement of America's  archaic labor
laws, moreover, could save taxpayers $10.5  billion over five years.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#1">1</A>  This could be accomplished by
closing the  Department of Labor as a Cabinet-level department and moving 
certain of its key national functions into sub-Cabinet agencies or  other
departments. Other functions that are not national in scope  should be devolved
to the states, or in some cases to the private  sector. Obsolete, ineffective,
and wasteful rules and programs should  be repealed or closed down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1992 the main issue was the economy. Specifically, it was  the jobless
recovery that resulted from President Bush's tax and  regulatory increases.
Although job security continues to concern  many workers, since the end of the
recession the resilient  American economy has created over 8 million jobs and
the major labor  issues have shifted to wage growth and income inequality. The 
idea that workers are falling down the economic ladder and no  longer can afford
to raise families has become conventional wisdom.  The debate also has developed
a disturbing class warfare tone  that clouds the issue and unnecessarily
polarizes Americans. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Conservative candidates need to deal with these issues  head-on. They must
reject class warfare arguments as economic  nonsense. And to the extent that
real wages are falling for some  workers, candidates must point out that the
solution is not higher  taxes, more mandates, or job-killing increases in the
minimum  wage. Instead, what is needed are lower taxes for families and  reforms
that will increase worker productivity and job opportunities  for Americans
through such things as improving basic education  and encouraging more
investment.

<P>America's economy, labor market conditions, and  labor-management relations

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Congress enacted the Davis-Bacon Act in 1931, 
unemployment insurance and the employment service in 1935, the National  Labor
Relations Act in 1935, the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938,  and the Labor
Management Relations Act in 1947. Even the  Occupational Safety and Health Act
was passed a quarter century ago,  in 1970.

<P>-     Women now account for over 45 percent of the labor force,  up from 29
percent in 1950. The labor force participation rate  for married mothers with
children under 6 years of age has  increased from 11 percent in 1950 to over 47
percent today. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Manufacturing now accounts for 16.4 percent of all jobs,  compared
with 33.7 percent in 1950. Unions now represent only  15.5 percent of workers,
down from 35.5 percent in 1945. Exports  have increased from 3.8 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP)  in 1950 to 11.6 percent in 1993, and imports have
increased from  3.2 percent to 12.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Two recent national polls revealed that 65 percent of  Americans favor
changes in labor law that would allow for more flexible  work schedules and 58
percent would choose paid time off more  often than overtime wages; 63 percent

 laws.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#2">2</A>

<P><B>The Impact of Regulations, Mandates, and Taxes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal regulations, mandates, and taxes have slowed  productivity and real
wage growth, and have limited job opportunities.  Since 1970, the expansion of
federally mandated benefits and  worker protections has taken a heavy toll.
Several studies point to the  job-destroying effect of the regulatory and
mandate explosion in  recent years.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#3">3</A>
 For example:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     There are at least three million fewer jobs in the 
American economy today because of the growth of regulations over the  last 20
years.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#5">4</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     A 1990 study estimated that environmental regulations alone  had
caused national employment to be 1.2 percent less in 1990 than  it otherwise
would have been.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#5">5</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>With each Congress, Washington has placed tougher  requirements 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  and restrictions on employers and
the labor  market.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#6">6</A>  Although
current workplace policies and regulations are well  intentioned, their benefits
are outweighed by their negative consequences  for both workers and employers.
Further, the growing regulatory  burden has made federal workplace inspectors as
feared as IRS  auditors, and most businesses very cautious about hiring 
additional workers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     In 1994, legally required benefits<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#7">7</A> accounted for 8.9 percent  of total
employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and 3.5  percent in 1951.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#8">8</A>  These mandated benefits are not &quot;free&quot;
to  the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies  indicates that, on
average, the cost of 88 percent of all legally required  benefits or payroll is
shifted to workers in the form of reduced  cash compensation.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#9">9</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Mandated requirements, such as family and medical leave, add  to the
cost of hiring and managing workers and directly affect  an employer's decisions
about whether and when to hire a  worker, which worker to hire, how much cash to
pay the worker, and  how long to keep that worker. The rise in nonwage labor
costs is one  of the most important forces leading employers to lay off workers,
 as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract  labor.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#10">10</A> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-    The increase in mandated benefits does not include the cost to 
employers and workers of complying with workplace safety  and health
regulations.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#11">11</A>  One study has
estimated that 19 percent  of the productivity slowdown during the 1970s is
directly  attributable to regulations published by the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration (OSHA).<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#12">12</A> 
Further, since productivity and  workers' pay and benefits rise together, OSHA
regulations are  directly 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  responsible for some part of the
slowdown in wage growth.

<P><B>Tax Increases.</B> Since the end of the last recession in March  1991,
employment has increased by  8.3 million to 125.1 million, and  the unemployment
rate has declined 1.2 percentage points to 5.6  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#13">13</A>  Compared with past recoveries,
however, the  U.S. economy is performing below expected  levels.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#14">14</A>  Whereas employment growth in
previous post-war recoveries averaged  12.9 percent 55 months after the end of a
recession, employment in  the current recovery has grown only 7.2 percent over a
similar  period of time. One factor that aided employment growth in  recoveries
during the 1960s and 1980s was a reduction in tax rates. But  the Bush/Clinton
tax increases of 1990 and 1993, which burdened  a stalling economy, have limited
job growth significantly  since 1991.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#15">15</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     After the severe recession of the early 1980s,
manufacturing  jobs increased 7.7 percent from November 1982 to March 1989. 
Since the 1990 tax increase, manufacturing jobs have declined by  6.0 percent.

professional specialty occupations. From 1990 to  1994, however, there was no
employment growth in mechanic and  repair occupations or administrative and
clerical occupations.  Employment actually declined in construction trade
occupations and  machine operator and assembler occupations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Since the end of the last recession, not all states have seen  jobs
increase. While non-farm jobs in the U.S. increased by 7.9  percent, California,
Connecticut, Hawaii, and New York all lost around  1 percent of their jobs. The
Rocky Mountain states of Arizona,  Colo

<P><B>Rising Living Standards Despite Higher Taxes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A decline in average real cash wages since 1973 falsely suggests  a decrease
in the American standard of living. Some politicians  are using this narrow
definition of economic well-being to promote  the failed redistribution and
regulatory policies of big  government. Most workers are better off today
because their real  compensation and real per capita income continue to
increase. Real  compensation is a more accurate measure of the &quot;pay&quot;
American  workers receive because it includes benefits, such as health care and 
pension payments, as well as cash. The reason for this is that  workers are
taking home more of their pay in the form of tax-free  benefits than ever
before. Employee benefits accounted for 41.3 percent  of payroll costs in 1993,
up from almost 18.7 percent in 1951  and 36.6 percent in 1979.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#16">16</A>  Stagnating cash wages are a
concern,  but government should be focusing on policies that increase 
productivity and economic growth to raise take-home pay instead of  imposing
mandates, taxes, and regulations that limit employment  opportunities and wages.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>How have wages and compensation changed in recent years?   Specifically:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     After growing from 1948 to 1973, the average real hourly 
wage (that is, adjusted for inflation) has declined 10.1  percent.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#17">17</A>  This decline, however, has not
occurred in all industries. Real  average hourly earnings in the service,
finance, insurance, and real  estate industries have increased 1.6 percent and
6.7 percent since 1973.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     From 1978 to 1994, average annual pay adjusted for inflation 
increased 1.0 percent.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#18">18</A>  This
long-run increase, however, hides  significant growth differences in the
intervening years and  between states. For example, average annual pay decreased
3.0  percent from 1978 to 1980, then increased 5.9 percent from 1980 to  1988,
and then declined 1.7 percent from 1988 to  1994.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#19">19</A>  Further, since 1988 average
annual pay has increased in 13 states and the  District of Columbia and declined
in 37 states.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As noted, hourly wages do not account for the increasing  frequency with
which employees receive their &quot;pay&quot; in the form  of untaxed fringe
benefits. Further, hourly wage data are limited  in the types of employees they
cover (68 percent of all  payroll jobs).<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#20">20</A>
 Compensation  or wages plus benefits  is a more  complete measure of the pay
American workers receive. Real  compensation, by any measure, continues to
increase. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     From 1950 to 1973, real hourly compensation increased an 
average of 3.2 percent per year.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#21">21</A>
 Since 1973, real hourly  compensation has increased an average of 0.4 percent
per year. The  problem is not that the average wage has declined, but that total
&quot;pay&quot;  has grown more slowly since 1973. This can be attributed to the
 slowdown in the growth of productivity, resulting in part from  the growth of
government regulations, mandates, and higher taxes   all of which reduce the net
value of a worker's output, leading to  a slowdown of wages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Comparing the Bush/Clinton economic expansion with the  Reagan
expansion reveals that most measures of workers' pay and  compensation were
affected negatively by the two largest tax  increases in history.

<P>The dynamic U.S. economy is characterized by an  extraordinary

has been all but ignored in the  recent minimum wage and declining wage
controversy. The  notion that low-income or high-income groups are composed
mostly  of the same people over time is an illusion. Data on income  mobility
reveal that most workers' incomes increase over time. The  comparison of average
incomes by group would be meaningful only  if America were a caste society in
which the people comprising  one group remained constant over time. This is one
reason why  Americans with modest incomes tend to resist &quot;soak the rich&quot;
class  warfare arguments  they hope to be rich one day.

</P>
<P>President Bill Clinton urged Congress in 1995 to pass  legislation to raise
the hourly minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 over  two years. Although the
President and other proponents of an  increase argue that a higher minimum wage
is needed to achieve &quot;a  minimum decent living wage&quot; for working
Americans, a  minimum wage hike in fact will destroy entry-level job 
opportunities<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#35">35</A> for the very
unskilled Americans proponents claim to be helping.  Further, it will do nothing
to increase the income of nonworking  families, while raising prices for both
the poor and non-poor. Instead  of considering a minimum wage hike, Congress
should focus on  tax and regulatory reforms to increase take-home pay and reduce
 the cost of creating jobs. Doing that will promote economic  growth with low
inflation, and increase employment opportunities  and wages for all Americans.<A

new  hiring and postpone the replacement of employees who quit. They  will tend
to reduce hours (particularly for unskilled workers) or  replace lower-skilled
workers with higher-skilled workers as  low-skilled workers quit. They also may
consider reducing or eliminating  pay raises and bonuses for their other
employees.

declined by 45 percent.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#42">42</A>  This is

contractors receiving 90 percent of federal contracts  and will raise the cost
of federal contracts as these employers  are forced to take into account the
potential cost of settling labor  disputes. The Employment Policy Foundation
estimates the  annual economic cost of implementing the order at between $520 
million and $2 billion.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#51">51</A> 
Further, the order increases the likelihood  of strike activity at federal
contractors, hurting both union  workers and employers through lost wages and
output, and may  discourage unionized employers from even bidding on federal
contracts.  By increasing the incentive for businesses to set up nonunion 
subsidiaries and encouraging the use of nonunion subcontractors, it  ultimately
hurts union workers' income and job opportunities.

overhead  and ends duplicative costs by merging OSHA and MSHA. S. 526 
essentially proposes to codify many of OSHA's reinvention  initiatives.
Although, the Senate Labor Committee has reported out  S. 526, the House has not
yet marked up H.R. 1834. In  February, Vice President Al Gore promised the
AFL-CIO that  President Clinton would veto either bill this year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Davis-Bacon.</B> Both the Senate and the House have introduced  bills to
repeal the Davis Bacon Act. Davis-Bacon was enacted  during the Depression
explicitly to prevent low-skilled nonunion  workers  chiefly blacks and
Hispanics  from competing for  federally funded construction jobs. Unfortunately
for these workers, it  has succeeded. This Depression-era law promotes racial 
discrimination in the construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers billions
 of dollars each year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special  interests.
Moreover, states are beginning to investigate reports  of fraudulently submitted
data that inflate U.S. DoL prevailing  wage determinations.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#60">60</A>  The Senate Labor Committee
reported out  its Davis-Bacon repeal bill last year, but the House has not yet 
acted on its version. Additional House hearings on Davis-Bacon  are scheduled
for 1996.  
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Collective Bargaining.</B> Both the Senate and the House also  have
introduced bills to reform the National Labor Relations Act.  The House-passed
Teamwork for Employees and  Management (TEAM) Act would enable businesses to
establish  employer-employee involvement committees as a way to give workers a 
voice in business operations to help improve productivity, safety,  and customer
service. Currently, the only discussions of  workplace issues between employers
and workers that are clearly legal  are those that occur during traditional
collective bargaining;  businesses that establish employee-employer committees
risk  litigation and significant legal costs. The Senate is expected to vote on 
its version of the TEAM Act in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The National Right-to-Work Act (S. 581 and H.R. 1279) seeks  to preserve and
protect the free choice of individual employees  to form, join, or assist labor
organizations, or to refrain from  such activities. Congressional hearings on
this bill are planned for  1996, and the bill faces strong opposition from
organized labor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>ERISA.</B> The Employee Retirement and Income Security  Act (ERISA) was
enacted in 1974 to protect the assets in  employee pension and welfare plans<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#61">61</A> that provide workers with 
retirement benefits promised by their employers. Reform legislation in  the
104th Congress has focused on the regulation of health  insurance benefits. In
the House, Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL)  introduced a bill (H.R. 995)
which would provide for health  insurance portability between jobs, increased
participation, and other  consumer protections for workers. In the Senate, Nancy
 Kassebaum (R-KS) has introduced S. 1028, which incorporates sections  of H.R.
995 dealing with increasing access to health care  benefits, providing for
greater portability of health insurance between  jobs, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  increasing the security of health
care benefits for workers,  and increasing the purchasing power of individuals
and small  employers. S. 1028 was approved by the Senate Labor Committee in 
October 1995. It is highly likely that health insurance reform will  be enacted
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A few bills reforming ERISA's pension provisions also were  introduced in
Congress. The most comprehensive (H.R. 2037 and  S. 1006), introduced by
Representative Rob Portman (R-OH)  and Senator David Pryor (D-AR), would
simplify pension  provision and distribution rules and improve access to pension
plans  for small employers. It is highly likely this pension law reform will  be
enacted by the 104th Congress in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Labor Department Reforms.</B> Congress also used the budget  process
last year as a vehicle for reform. The House voted to reduce  FY 1996 DoL
discretionary spending by 13.8 percent and  instituted several important
reforms. Among these, the House budget  prohibits the issuance of two
unnecessarily burdensome OSHA  regulations on ergonomics and fall protection,
and bars DoL from  promoting &quot;economically targeted investments&quot; by
private  pension plans.  Both the Senate and House most likely will pass a 
continuing resolution that will fund DoL for the remainder of FY  1996 with a 15
percent spending cut from FY 1995.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress should undertake a fundamental reform of  America's labor laws.<A

<P>

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Specifically, Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Close down the Department of Labor.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to achieve reform is to close down the  Cabinet-level
department and move its legitimate national functions into  sub-Cabinet agencies
or other departments. Other functions that are  not national in scope should be
devolved to the states, or in some  cases to the private sector. Obsolete,
ineffective, and wasteful rules  and programs should be repealed or closed down.
The Department  of Labor has gone far beyond its original  mandate<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#63">63</A> and has become a burdensome and
feared regulatory agency that presents  significant barriers to creating jobs
and increasing real wages. The  proliferation of mandated benefits and workplace
requirements  makes most small businesses think very carefully before hiring 
additional workers. Overzealous enforcement has made DoL the enemy  of American
business and the American worker. Congress should  do what the Clinton
Administration promised but failed to do   reform this overgrown and intrusive
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Devolve the unemployment insurance system to the states. 
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moving the unemployment insurance system to the states  should be part of
the closure strategy. This would enable states to  take action to decrease the
duration of unemployment, reduce  payroll taxes, and increase jobs. Devolution
should include the  Veterans Employment Service, labor market information
projects, the  one-stop career center concept, and the administration of 
unemployment insurance. Congress also should devolve the Federal  Extended
Benefit program, repeal Trade Adjustment Assistance,  and provide incentives for
states to overhaul and integrate  employment services and to reduce the duration
of unemployment payments  by moving the unemployed into new jobs more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Consolidate more job training programs into state block grants  and
focus funding on job placement assistance. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress recently consolidated over 70 of 163 job training  programs into
state block grants.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#64">64</A>  Although
this was a good  first step, more programs should be consolidated and the
funding  focused on job placement assistance. Conventional wisdom says  that
most job training programs work. Unfortunately, they do  not.65  Rather than
consolidate ineffective programs, Congress  should recognize that federal job
training programs simply do not  work and end them.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#66">66</A>  One thing is clear from the few
rigorous  studies that have been done: Government can do little, if anything, to
 alter the effect of its citizens' neglecting their first 12 years of 
education. The billions of dollars spent on government job training  and public
assistance programs are too much too late. What is  needed is fundamental reform
of the school system so that young  Americans enter the workforce with the basic
skills and attitudes  they need to succeed.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) and
transfer the Mine Safety and Health  Administration (MSHA) to OSHA. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This reform is needed to redefine the federal government's role  in
workplace safety and health and &quot;refocus the responsibility  for ensuring
worksite safety and health on the  workplace.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#67">67</A>  Merging MSHA with a reformed OSHA
is a sensible first step toward  improving workplace health and safety, limiting
unnecessary  government intervention, and reducing inefficient, wasteful 
government spending. Businesses already have much stronger financial  incentives
than OSHA penalties, such as the costs of lost  productivity, workers'
compensation, and liability claims, to maintain and  continually improve the
safety of their workplaces. Thus, the role  of the federal government should be
redefined from that of  heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner.
Congress  also should spin off the &quot;new&quot; OSHA as a separate 
sub-Cabinet agency.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Repeal Davis-Bacon and the Service Contract Act. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Davis-Bacon Act was enacted during the Depression  explicitly to prevent
low-skilled nonunion workers  chiefly blacks  and Hispanics  from competing for
federally funded  construction jobs.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#68">68</A>
 This Depression-era law contributes to racial  discrimination in the
construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers  billions of dollars a year,
stifles productivity, and subsidizes  special interests. Moreover, states are
beginning to investigate reports  of fraudulently submitted data that inflate
U.S. DoL prevailing  wage determinations and drive up the cost of federally
funded  construction projects.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#69">69</A> 
If Davis-Bacon were not already law, it  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  never be passed today. Proponents
would be denounced as  supporting discrimination; it would be pointed out that
the  bill's worker protection provisions are unnecessary because they exist  in
other statutes; and lawmakers would object to the heavy,  unnecessary budget
costs imposed by the legislation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Service Contract Act (SCA) artificially inflates the cost  of federal
service contracts by as much as $500 million per year  and, like Davis-Bacon,
creates an unfair barrier for many unskilled  entry-level workers, who tend to
be poor and minorities. DoL  has long been criticized for the way it operates
under this law.  Despite two amendments,<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#70">70</A>
the SCA continues to suffer from  statutory ambiguity, administrative problems,
arbitrary requirements,  and capricious enforcement.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#71">71</A>  The General Accounting Office 
has recommended repealing the SCA because of DoL's &quot;inability  to
administer the act efficiently and effectively&quot; and because &quot;it  is
impractical, in our opinion, to make `prevailing wage'  determinations under the
act in a consistently equitable  manner.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#72">72</A>  Outdated by extension of the Fair
Labor Standards Act to service  workers, the SCA has become an unnecessary and
costly bureaucratic  burden that should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the Fair Labor Standards Act to allow employers to  offer
flexible schedule and compensation options.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted to protect  unskilled,
low-pay workers. But in today's economy, where  both parents are likely to be
working, its rigid and inflexible  provisions hurt more than they help. The FLSA
deprives workers of the  right to order their daily lives, both on and off the
job, to meet the  responsibilities of work and home. For example, a worker  who

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  wants to work 35 hours one week
in exchange for working  45 hours the following week to attend a child's
parent-teacher  conference must forgo five hours of pay or else have an employer
 willing to pay overtime for working more than 40 hours the second  week.
Congress should extend the same freedom to private workers  that federal
employees have  flextime  and allow employers to  offer flexible schedule and
compensation options to their  workers.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#73">73
</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act to remove union special  privileges.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Norris-LaGuardia Act (NLA), passed in 1932, exempts  unions from the
Sherman Antitrust Act, makes union-free  employment contracts unenforceable in
federal courts, and prohibits  federal judges from issuing injunctions to
interrupt violent strikes.  The NLA is special privilege legislation for
organized labor and  should be repealed.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#74">74</A>
 If there are to be antitrust laws, they ought to  apply equally to all
combinations in restraint of trade, whether by  employers or by workers. The
right of workers and employers to  enter voluntarily into union-free contracts
should not be abridged,  and workers and employers should be able to petition
the courts to  stop union-related violence. While there is room in a free
society  for voluntary unionism, there is no room for the special  privileges
granted unions under the NLA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reform the National Labor Relations Act to remove restrictions  on the
ability of employers to create employee involvement  structures and to protect
the free choice of individual workers to form  and join unions, or to refrain
from such activities.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Employer-employee involvement (EI) committees are a way  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  give workers a voice in business
operations to help improve  productivity, safety, and customer service. Under
current law,  however, the only discussions of workplace issues that are clearly
 legal between employers and employees are those that occur in  traditional
collective bargaining arrangements. In practice,  employers can listen to their
nonunion employees but cannot respond to  their views without risking litigation
and significant legal costs.  The Commission on the Future of Worker-Management 
Relations<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#75">75</A> has recommended &quot;removing
the legal  uncertainties&quot;<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#76">76</A>
on the EI committees that take a broader, more systemic approach to 
participation that the evidence suggests has the greatest long-term  positive
effects on economic performance. Congress should reform  the National Labor
Relations Act (NLRA) to exempt EI  committees formed to address issues of
quality, productivity, safety, and  customer service.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Section 7 of the NLRA limits the right of workers to refrain  from union
activities if there is a collective bargaining agreement  that requires union
membership as a condition of employment.  Forcing a worker to join or pay dues
to an unwanted union amounts to  deprivation of the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of  association. According to the NLRA, a worker has full freedom of 
rights except when compulsory unionism enters the picture. The  exception clause
in Section 7 should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Ban the diversion of union dues for political or ideological  purposes
to which employees object.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1988 that unions, as  exclusive bargaining
agents, may not use proceeds from dues to pursue  political or ideological goals
over the objections of affected  employ
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  ees. The proceeds from those
employees, said the Court, are to  be used strictly for collective bargaining
and contract  administration, including grievance adjustment.<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#77">77
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Dues are mandatory even for employees who are not members  of the union but
who may be required, under the NLRA principle  of exclusive representation, to
support it. Federal legislation  is needed to require the written authorization
of workers for  unions to use dues or dues equivalents for political purposes.
Such  legislation should place the burden on unions to prove that no funds  are
being diverted without written consent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Take action to boost productivity, thereby increasing  compensation.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Contrary to the practitioners of class warfare, employers do not   indeed,
cannot  unfairly keep down the wages of their  lower-skilled and entry-level
employees. Employers, as well as  employees, operate within a competitive labor
market in which wage  rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers  
<I>less </I>the costs of government-imposed mandates and taxes associated with
employing  a worker. The more productive a worker is, the more that  worker will
be paid. Congress should focus on policies that will  increase wages and job
opportunities for Americans by improving  labor productivity and reducing the
cost of employing workers.  Specifically, Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Balance the budget.</B> This will increase total domestic
saving,  lower interest rates, and increase investment. The growth in capital 
per worker is closely associated over time with the growth in  labor
productivity.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut the capital gains tax.</B> This will increase investment in the 
U.S. and provide an incentive for both American and foreign firms  to put their
capital to work here with American workers. A  capital gains tax cut also will
make more venture capital available  for emerging technologies and for research
and development that  will improve future productivity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increase the skills of the workforce.</B> What is needed is  fundamental
change aimed at improving basic education through  school choice, strengthening
core curricula, and enabling local  educators to improve discipline and set high
expectations. Congress  also should consider tax-deferred or tax-free education
savings  accounts similar to individual retirement accounts, or enabling  states
and individuals to use lump sum unemployment insurance  benefits for education
and training.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Enact significant regulatory reform.</B> The explosion of new 
regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital,  created
barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs, and  raised the cost of
employing Americans. This higher cost of  employment in turn means that in a
competitive economy, the return to labor  in the form of wages is reduced. The
regulatory burden needs to  be rolled back, not only to allow wages to rise, but
also to  decrease the cost of hiring workers.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The White House also should take action. Specifically, the  President
should:
</P>
<P><B>Rescind the striker replacement executive order. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Executive Order 12954, signed by President Clinton in  March 1995, was an
attempt to bypass Congress and establish new  labor 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  policy by executive fiat: a gift
to a constituency that could not  get its way through the legislative process.
The order will drive up  the cost of federal contracts and hurt workers. The
$100,000  annual threshold effectively extends coverage to contractors receiving
 90 percent of federal contracts and will raise the cost of federal  contracts
as employers take into account the potential cost of  settling labor disputes.
The economic cost of implementing the order  will be between $520 million and $2
billion.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#78">78</A>  Further, the order 
will increase the likelihood of strike activity that hurts both  union workers
and employers through lost wages and output, and  may even discourage unionized
employers from bidding on federal  contracts in the future. It also will
increase the incentive for  businesses to set up nonunion subsidiaries and
encourage the use of  nonunion subcontractors  both of which ultimately hurt
union workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia unanimously
set aside President Clinton's striker replacement  executive order,<A
HREF="ftnt5.htm#79">79</A> the President has instructed the
Justice  Department to take all appropriate steps to have the decision
overturned.  The President should not waste Justice Department resources on 
this appeal and should rescind E.O. 12954.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should the government do to create and keep jobs in  this
country?  What do you say to the millions of Americans  looking for work?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>  Outdated labor laws, mandates, and heavy taxes lock  workers out
of jobs the private sector otherwise would create.  Congress needs to balance
the budget, cut taxes, and eliminate  unnecessarily 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  burdensome regulations. This will
improve economic growth,  create more job opportunities, and increase the
take-home pay  of American workers. Government mandates and wasteful rules  are
strangling job creation, making employers think twice before  hiring additional
workers. Americans want jobs, and employers  want to hire them. Red tape and
taxes get in the way.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Compared with the 1980s, the burden of higher taxes and  more regulations
has limited job growth significantly. Since the  1990 and 1993 tax increases,
manufacturing jobs have declined by  6.0 percent. We need to reduce government
spending, cut taxes  for American families, and reduce the capital gains tax to 
increase investment, productivity, wages, and jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support cutting taxes and regulations on big  business
when wages are falling, corporate profits are up, and  executive pay is
excessive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A. </B>The problem is not that profits are too high; profits are  needed
to invest in new ventures which create jobs and raise  productivity  and wages.
The problem is that taxes, mandates, and  regulations are keeping workers' pay
too low. Cutting individual taxes  will increase the take-home pay of working
Americans. If you look  at your paycheck, you'll see that the real culprit is
the  government, not your employer. Cutting taxes boosts take-home pay  without
cutting job opportunities. For instance, Congress's  $500-per-child tax credit
would put $22 billion per year back into family  budgets so that working parents
can provide for their children in a way  no government program can. The other
key to higher wages is  productivity. Lowering the capital gains tax will
increase  investment, improve productivity, and increase wages. Balancing the 
budget 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  and cutting taxes will help poor
and middle-class Americans  more than any other factor.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The minimum wage is too low. You can't make ends meet  unless you
work two jobs; what's the harm in raising the  minimum wage?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>  It's a job killer and will hurt the very people it is suppose 
to help. The reason: Telling an employer that he or she must  pay higher wages
to low-skilled, entry-level workers simply means  the employer will hire fewer
such workers. Minimum wage laws  presume that politicians are morally justified
in destroying  some people's jobs and their opportunity to begin living the 
American dream in order to inflate other people's wages. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't allowing companies to use replacement workers  during strikes
just a ploy to break unions?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is striker replacement law that ultimately hurts union 
workers and drives up the cost of federal contracts. Outlawing  replacement
workers will simply increase the incentive for businesses to set  up nonunion
companies and encourage the use of nonunion  subcontractors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Most conservatives said that NAFTA would be a good thing  for U.S.
workers. What do you say now to those Americans who  have lost their jobs to
cheap Mexican labor?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Policies that cause the economy to change and grow  always mean
some jobs are lost while many new ones are created.  Some jobs indeed have been
lost because of NAFTA, but many  more 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  have been created. NAFTA is good
for American workers  because free trade creates jobs, increases wealth, and
offers  consumers more and better goods at lower prices. It is protectionism
that  ultimately destroys jobs, reduces wealth, and limits consumer  choice.
Free trade may lead to the demise of some businesses and jobs,  but so does
local competition. What is most important is that free  trade fosters higher
productivity, and higher productivity  generates higher wages, more wealth, and
more jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't curbing OSHA mean more worker injuries and deaths?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Everyone wants better workplace safety and health. The issue  is
how you get there. A new approach is required to improve the  incentives for
workplace health and safety. The role of the  federal government needs to be
changed from that of heavy-handed  regulator to that of cooperative partner.
Today's army of OSHA  inspectors focuses on fines and penalties. That does not
mean  work. Instead, the government should work cooperatively with  businesses
and employees to improve workplace safety. OSHA's  own Maine 200 program has
proven that emphasizing compliance  assistance over enforcement can improve
workplace safety  and health dramatically. If we take this course, Americans
will  get more workplace health and safety for their tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't somebody who has worked all his life and is  suddenly laid
off deserve help with some job training?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes. The problem is that today's federal job training  programs
are ineffective. The 104th Congress is working on legislation  that consolidates
over 70 of the 163 federal job training programs  scattered across 15 agencies
into state block  grants.<A HREF="ftnt5.htm#80">80</A>  This
will help, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  because states will have the
flexibility to design unified  employment, education, and economic development
programs that  meet the job training needs of their workers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do conservatives want to close down the Department  of Labor? 
Who will protect workers' interests in Washington?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> American labor law is largely a product of the conditions  and
perspectives of the 1930s and needs to be reformed.  Today's economy, labor
market conditions, and labor-management  relations differ significantly from
those that existed when most  of America's major labor laws were passed. Workers
are  demanding more flexible hours, pay, and working conditions than current 
laws and regulations allow. Employers are straining under  unnecessarily
burdensome regulations, mandates, lawsuits, and taxes.  American labor laws
should be reformed to empower workers to  protect themselves. The problem is
that the whole philosophy and  organization of the Department of Labor is
steeped in the 1930s and  resists modernization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Conservatives are not calling for the elimination of  everything DoL does.
Instead, they are calling for functions to be carried  out elsewhere. Some of
DoL's key national functions, like  workplace health and safety, would remain at
the federal level. Other  functions that are not national in scope should be
turned over to  the states, or in some cases to the private sector where they
can be  run more effectively. Obsolete, ineffective, and wasteful 
bureaucracies, however, should be closed.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Throughout most of its history, America sought to avoid  entanglement in the
affairs of other countries, focusing instead on  peaceful avenues of trade.
America has grown into an industrial giant  partly because of international
trade, which now accounts for some  23 percent of the national wealth. With
increased reliance on  global markets, the U.S. is trying to expand its exports
by involving  itself in agreements such as the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While America has been largely a free-trade nation, the  principles of free
trade today are under siege. On the one side of the  argument are those who
advocate free trade because it creates  jobs, promotes economic growth, and
maximizes efficiency and  individual wealth. On the other are those who argue
that free  trade forces American manufacturing overseas, and leads to lost 
jobs, declining wealth, and increased national suffering.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To its proponents, free trade is a matter of principle.  Individuals should
enjoy the right to buy lawful products, wherever  made, without governmental
interference. Free traders believe that  governments should not dictate to
individuals what clothes they  will wear, what food they will eat, and which
cars they will drive  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  benefit domestic producers.
Tariffs, import quotas,  discriminatory regulations, and other forms of
protectionism are unwarranted  infringements of individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents also believe that free trade promotes economic  growth and
creates jobs for Americans. Virtually all economists argue  that free trade
increases competition, spurs innovation, lowers  prices, accelerates economic
growth, and on balance creates more  jobs than are lost to foreign competition.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of free trade advocate closed borders and argue  that cutting off
or restricting trade with other nations is in  America's interest. While they
admit that tariffs and import quotas raise  consumer prices, they believe such
measures also safeguard jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps no other recent public figure has advocated trade  protectionism
more vigorously than Patrick Buchanan, who says  he would impose stiff tariffs
on imports and withdraw America  from almost all of its international
agreements, including the  North American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada
and  the World Trade Organization (WTO), a global trade organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The outcome of this debate is vitally important to America's  future. The
choice before the U.S. is whether to continue or  abandon its standard of living
and its position as the world's  leading economy. A false move on the trade
front could have  disastrous consequences for the U.S. economy. It should be
recalled that  the protectionism of the 1930s was a major factor in bringing 
about the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The challenge for America is whether it will embrace free trade  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  a key to its continuing
prosperity. Linked to this challenge are  such issues as expanding NAFTA to
include Chile and other  countries, expanding free trade in Asia through the
Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, expanding trade across the 
Atlantic with Europe, and dealing with the entry of the People's  Republic of
China (PRC) and Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) into  the World Trade
Organization. Generally, free traders have been  disappointed in President
Clinton's handling of all these trade  issues. They accuse him of dragging his
feet on expanding NAFTA  to include Chile and of trying to force &quot;managed&quot;
trade deals  with the Japanese over auto parts.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     America is the largest exporter of goods and
services in the  world. It exports over $700 billion in goods and services each
year,  and over 14 million Americans are employed producing these exports.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     One out of every five American workers owes his or her job  to
international trade.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     America's trade deficit is minuscule when compared to the size
 of the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services is  a mere
1.5 percent of America's overall economy (gross  national product). America's
annual budget deficit  2.5 percent of GNP   is almost twice the size of its
trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. trades with Asia more than any other region in the 
world. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with Asia in 1994 was  $424.9 billion, or
36.1 percent of total U.S. two-way merchandise  trade worldwide. Merchandise
exports to Asia support 3.1  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  American jobs<B>.</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     <B></B>The U.S. exports over $120 billion in goods to Europe,
not  including the newly independent states of the former Soviet  Union. These
exports support over 2 million U.S. jobs. Removing  barriers to U.S. exports to
Europe means creating more American jobs in  a number of different sectors,
including agricultural goods,  automobiles, electric power and natural gas
equipment, information  technology products, medical devices, pharmaceuticals,
and  telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is America's second-largest foreign market, importing 
more goods and services from America than any other country  except Canada. In
1994, Japan imported some $70 billion worth of  goods and services from the
U.S., supporting some 1.4 million  American jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is a big customer for the U.S. manufacturing  industry.<B>
</B>Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan are manufactured goods,  and
Japan's purchases of these goods support over 840,000  American manufacturing
jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. exports nearly $98 billion in goods to Latin  America
each year. These merchandise exports represent 19 percent of  all U.S.
merchandise exports and support 1.96 million U.S. jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, U.S. 
merchandise exports to Mexico and Canada have soared. During  NAFTA's first year
in 1994, U.S. merchandise exports to Canada,  America's largest trading partner,
grew by more than 13 percent to $114  billion. Likewise, U.S. merchandise
exports to Mexico grew over  22 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  percent to $51 billion.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the expansion of  free trade has
been the cornerstone of U.S. policy toward  Latin America and the Caribbean. The
Enterprise for the Americas  Initiative launched by former President George Bush
in 1989 laid  out the goal of creating an American-led free-trade area 
encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere, from Alaska in North America  to
Tierra del Fuego in South America. The first step in creating  a Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA) was taken by the  Bush Administration in 1990 with the
announcement that the U.S.  would negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
The North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was approved by the  U.S.
Congress in 1993 and implemented as of January 1, 1994.  Subsequently, at the
Summit of the Americas held in Miami,  Florida, from December 9-11, 1994,
President Clinton and all of the  democratically elected leaders of Latin
America, the Caribbean,  and Canada pledged unanimously to create an FTAA by the
year  2005; President Clinton also pledged that Chile would become  NAFTA's
fourth member by 1996, thus confirming to the region's  leaders that the U.S.
was firmly committed to hemispheric trade  expansion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In April 1994, the United States signed the Uruguay Round  trade agreement,
which went into force on January 1, 1995. The  Reagan Administration initiated
these trade negotiations in 1986 as part  of an ongoing series of talks under
the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This was the seventh &quot;round&quot;
of GATT  trade talks that started in 1947. Prior to World War II, many 
countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  established barriers to
international trade which contributed to  the Great Depression in the U.S. and
Europe. Following the war,  many of these barriers remained in place. The first
GATT round  was held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947 and resulted in some 
45,000 separate agreements that reduced tariffs on manufactured  goods and some
agricultural goods. Since GATT's inception, world  trade has expanded from less
than $100 billion in the late 1940s to  over $3 trillion today. Among other
things, the Uruguay Round  agreement creates a new body called the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). This organization is a forum in which countries can  seek
peaceful solutions to trade disputes without resorting to trade  protectionism.
Thus, instead of occasional international trade  negotiations like the seven
rounds GATT talks, the WTO allows for  ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  is America's
institutional link to fast-growing Asian  economies. Formed in 1989, APEC
encompasses Australia, Brunei,  Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. The  leaders of
APEC's member economies, including President Bill  Clinton, in 1994 set as their
goal achieving &quot;free trade and investment  in the Asia Pacific&quot; region
by 2010 for developed members and  by 2020 for developing members.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, while paying lip service to free trade, the Clinton  Administration
has pursued a policy that isolates America from  the international economy and
thus threatens Americans whose  jobs depend on international trade. For example,
NAFTA's  expansion to include Chile has stalled because the Administration and 
Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  gress cannot agree on the language
of a new fast-track  negotiating authority. The Administration insists on
language that would  allow trade sanctions to be imposed against countries that
violate  labor and environmental rules contained in the side agreements  to
NAFTA. Republican leaders in Congress reject this demand,  arguing that
extraneous issues unrelated to trade should not be  confused with trade. Without
a new fast-track negotiating  authority, NAFTA cannot be expanded to Chile, and
it is unlikely that  free-trade agreements could be negotiated with any other
country.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton snubbed other government heads and  reduced American
prestige in the region when he skipped the  November 19, 1995, Leaders' Meeting
in Osaka, Japan. The leaders will  meet in November 1996 in Subic Bay,
Philippines, and again in  November 1997 in Canada to review the each member's
progress  toward achieving APEC's free trade goal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has vacillated between free trade and  managed trade in
Asia. On one hand, he agreed to create a vast APEC  free-trade area, including
China and Japan, and help China join  the World Trade Organization (WTO). On the
other, he has  tightened import quotas on Chinese apparel and textiles and has
tried  unsuccessfully to force Japan to consent to new managed trade  agreements
on autos and semiconductors. Additionally, since  Clinton became President, the
U.S. has threatened to impose trade  sanctions on such imported products as
steel, textiles, cellular  telephones, consumer electronics products, and a host
of other  manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The path of trade protectionism paved by the Clinton  Administration should
be reversed. America needs to be put back on the  road to free trade. In 1997,
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Establish free-trade areas between the United States
and its  trading partners.</B> NAFTA should be expanded to incorporate Chile 
and other Latin American countries, and Caribbean nations should  receive
trading parity with NAFTA members. The U.S. should  cooperate with other APEC
members and take more concrete steps  at the next two Leaders' Meetings to
achieve a free-trade area in  the Asia-Pacific. The U.S. also should encourage
other Latin  American economies to join Chile and Mexico in APEC in 1997. 
Finally, the U.S. should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested
European countries, including the recently freed nations in  Eastern and Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Propose a free-trade area &quot;framework agreement&quot; with 
European countries interested in a free-trade area with the U.S.</B> A 
framework agreement precedes a free-trade agreement, allowing both sides  to
propose which items and topics they wish to pursue as part of  the formal
negotiating process. It is a necessary first step toward  formal negotiations to
create a free-trade agreement with  European countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free trade area with Europe would make it easier for U.S.  companies to
sell their goods there.<B> </B>Most European countries still  have their own
peculiarities regarding product standards, testing,  labeling, and
certification. These differences often increase the cost  of U.S. products as
companies must alter their products to meet  these differing requirements. A
free-trade area with Europe would  allow the U.S. and Europe to seek common
product standards,  testing, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  labeling, and certification
requirements, thereby reducing the  costs of doing business.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free-trade area with Europe also would increase America's  access to
Europe's agricultural market. Even though the U.S.  and Europe reached an
agreement in 1994 to reduce some  agricultural subsidies as part of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), Europe still maintains a host of
subsidies, trade  quotas, and import bans that restrict or prevent U.S.
agricultural exports  to Europe. Likewise, the U.S. still maintains agricultural
 subsidies, import quotas, and other restrictions that restrict agricultural 
imports from Europe. A free-trade agreement would allow U.S.  and European
negotiators to reduce barriers and promote  agricultural exports on both sides,
benefiting all parites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-    Support the accession of both the People's Republic of China  and
the Republic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade  Organization on a
commercially viable basis.</B> In 1986, Beijing applied to  resume China's seat
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  the predecessor of the WTO,
which the Republic of China on  Taiwan had abandoned in 1950. In 1990, Taiwan
also applied to join  the GATT. Following Hong Kong's example, Taiwan elected to
 apply as the autonomous customs territory of &quot;Chinese Taipei,&quot; 
rather than as a sovereign country. This move was intended to  finesse Beijing's
sensitivities over questions of sovereignty. Beijing  insists that Taiwan not
join the WTO before the PRC, but has offered  as its first act as a WTO member
to sponsor Taiwan. Joining  the WTO is an economic, not political, act.
Therefore, Beijing  should not be allowed to block Taiwan's entry; each
application should  be considered on its own merits. Although negotiations with 
Taiwan have progressed further, neither China nor Taiwan has offered  suf
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ficient concessions to warrant
WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Demand an end to China's practice of forcing foreign firms  to
transfer technology as a condition of investing.</B> The leverage  that China
can exert with its huge market makes it difficult even  for large industrial
firms to resist this form of  government-sponsored theft. The U.S. must also
insist that all existing bilateral  trade agreements, especially the 1995
Intellectual Property  Rights Memorandum of Understanding, be fully enforced
before  approving China's accession to the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal the outdated Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade  Act of
1975.</B> The Jackson-Vanik Trade Act was designed to  encourage the Soviet
Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift  restrictions on Jewish
emigration to Israel and the U.S. It  withdraws America's most-favored-nation
trading status from any  country that restricts immigration. Threatening to deny
MFN status  to China because of human rights abuses has become an annual  ritual
in Congress. But maintaining MFN with China is clearly  in America's economic
interest. At stake are billions of dollars  in trade. It also encourages the
liberalization of China's political  system. Trade forces China to open up to
the outside world and  therefore serves the long-run cause of human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Approve fast track for Chile before the 1996 elections.</B> Chile 
has enjoyed the fastest economic growth and the greatest  economic stability of
any country in Latin America since the mid-1980s. It  is in the forefront of
economic and democratic reform in the  Americas, having successfully achieved
the transition from military  dictatorship to civilian democracy. Chile is a
member of the APEC;  it is a strong candidate to join Mercosur (the South
American  Com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mon Market comprised of
Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay)  when Mercosur's members can reduce their
tariffs to match Chile's;  and it has a working bilateral trade agreement with
Mexico.  However, Chile cannot join NAFTA before 1997 if Congress does not 
approve fast-track negotiating authority. Under fast track,  trade agreements
negotiated by the Administration are submitted  to Congress for a straight
up-or-down vote; however, Congress  may not change or amend any portion of the
proposed agreement  before voting. Chile is the benchmark against which the rest
of the  region will measure America's hemispheric vision and leadership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Submit more accurate trade reports.</B> The United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) produces an annual report on foreign  trade barriers. This
report is important because it identifies the  barriers that U.S. exporters face
when selling their products  overseas. However, it tells only one side of the
story. America maintains  a host of import restrictions such as trade quotas,
high tariffs,  and import bans that are not described in the report. They should
 be. By including such information, the U.S. government would  be presenting a
more open picture of the status of free trade and  of where reforms are still
needed, including within the U.S.  Moreover, such USTR reports should
incorporate a scorecard of  the current cost to the economy of each of these
U.S. restrictions  on trade.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support free trade when our huge trade deficit  is
destroying jobs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America's trade deficit is only 1.5 percent of the size of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  overall U.S. economy. The U.S.
budget deficit is 2.5 percent  of America's GNP. Thus, while much is made of
America's  trade deficit, it is nearly half the size of the U.S. budget deficit.
The  budget deficit hinders America's economy far more than does  the trade
deficit. Free trade creates jobs: One of every five U.S. jobs  is the result of
U.S. trade. Besides, free trade provides  Americans with greater consumer
choice, adds to the national wealth, and  is responsible for the fact that
American businesses are the  largest exporters in the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Free trade is fine, but shouldn't America require a level  playing
field with its trading partners?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Countries that maintain trade barriers harm their  own
economies for more than they harm America's. Rather  than threaten to close
America's markets to foreign countries if they  do not remove barriers to U.S.
exports, America should seek to  use free-trade areas and the newly created
international dispute  settlement forum, the World Trade Organization, to
encourage  open markets. Under the WTO, the U.S. would be able to seek the 
opening of foreign markets through negotiations rather than threats  and
destructive retaliation. Even if the U.S. could not achieve  open markets abroad
through such means, it would be better  for America and its consumers to
dismantle U.S. trade  protectionism unilaterally than to impose higher barriers
to foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Shouldn't America tell countries like Japan that if they do  not open
up, we will close our borders to them?

<P><B>A.</B> No. That would be self-defeating. Japan is America's  largest
overseas market. It imports more goods and services from the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  than the United Kingdom and
Germany combined and  is America's largest overseas market for agricultural
goods. Also,  the average Japanese person buys more goods and services from  the
U.S. than the average U.S. citizen buys from Japan. Why  does America have a
trade deficit with Japan?  There are many  factors, including the stubbornness
of American companies in refusing  to design products for the Japanese market.
But the main reason  is that there are twice as many Americans as there are 
Japanese. Even the Clinton Administration agrees that if Japan removed  all
supposed trade barriers to U.S. imports, the deficit would  shrink only
marginally.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican crisis. The peso  collapsed on
December 19, 1994, because the Mexican economy is not  sufficiently free, and
because Mexico's political system is  undemocratic. Moreover, former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari refused to make needed monetary and
exchange  policy adjustments in advance of Mexico's 1994 presidential 
elections. When investors lost confidence in Mexico, they fled to safer 
markets. Mexico was unable to retain the confidence of investors  because it
lacked strong economic and democratic  institutions. Thanks to NAFTA, however,
President Ernesto Zedillo is  implementing economic and political reforms that
should create the  institutions Mexico lacked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is fast track, and why is it important?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Fast-track negotiating authority consists of special  legislative
rules adopted by Congress. These authorize the President to  nego
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  tiate trade agreements and submit
them to Congress for an  up-or-down vote without the addition of any amendments
by  Congress. Fast track accelerates the process of negotiating free trade 
agreements with other countries, while providing them the  assurance that
agreements they reach with the U.S. government will not  be changed subsequently
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why is it important that fast track be approved before the  1996
elections?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> On four separate occasions since 1990, the U.S. has  pledged
officially that Chile would become the fourth member of  NAFTA. If Chile is not
admitted to NAFTA until 1997, America will  lose the opportunity to take the
lead in negotiating free-trade  agreements with other major economies in South
America,  including Argentina and Brazil. By 1997, Chile's interest in joining 
NAFTA may weaken, and America's chances of consolidating U.S.  leadership in
South America may be diminished. Chile cannot  join NAFTA until Congress has
granted fast-track negotiating  authority to the President. This authority is
needed to expedite negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Since NAFTA has not worked, why would a free-trade  area with Europe
work.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA has worked. Exports to Mexico increased by 20  percent
during the NAFTA's first year in 1994. Due to the  Mexican peso crisis, U.S.
exports to Mexico dropped slightly during  1995, but they were still higher than
the total for 1993, before  NAFTA was implemented. Moreover, the &quot;giant
sucking sound&quot;  predicted by Ross Perot never did occur. In fact, some
companies  that moved to Mexico prior to the NAFTA now are moving back to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  U.S. Why?  Because even though
Mexican workers may get  paid less, some companies are finding it harder to get
their products  out of Mexico because its roads, ports, and transportation
networks  are costly and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens if some members of the European Union want  a free-trade
area with the U.S. but others do not?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should extend an offer for a free-trade area directly 
to the European Union. At the same time, it should extend an offer  to
non-European Union members in Central and Eastern Europe,  and even to the newly
independent states of the former Soviet  Union. If the EU drags its feet in
negotiating with the U.S.,  America should pursue a free-trade area with such
non-EU members as  the Czech Republic and Estonia, two of Europe's most rapidly 
growing market economies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What U.S. industries could be expected to benefit from  freer trade
with Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A host of industries would benefit from freer trade with  Europe.
These would include those involved in agriculture,  telecommunications, and the
manufacturing of automobiles, medical  equipment, and pharmaceuticals.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Asia-Pacific region is becoming increasingly important to the United States. In 1995, U.S. two-way merchandise trade with the Asia-Pacific region rose to $503 billion, 38 percent of America's global two-way merchandise trade. Despite such economic intensity, however, Asia-Pacific trade remains susceptible to political upheaval that could endanger American security. The People's Republic of China is building a large military which could be used to enforce its territorial claims on the Spratly Islands and Taiwan. North Korea simultaneously poses the threats of military aggression and internal collapse. In Southeast Asia, Cambodia and Myanmar continue to repress their citizens.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region, America needs partners. The U.S. already has a number of defense partners in Asia; but some, like Japan, are not very good at liberalizing trade and other commercial activities in the region. Australia, however, in addition to being a military ally, could function effectively in helping to advance America's interest in liberalizing trade in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Australia became a major player in the Asia-Pacific region only recently. For most of this century, the government in Canberra purposely developed a strong Western cultural and economic identity; but its protectionist policies also brought the country to the edge of economic ruin by the 1980s. Following the Labor Party's victory in the March 1983 elections, Prime Minister Bob Hawke began to deregulate the economy and dismantle protectionist trade barriers. Over the next decade, Australia was transformed from the developed world's second most protected economy into a leading proponent of free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Under Hawke, Australia embraced the Asian market, welcomed Asian immigration, and reoriented Canberra's diplomatic and economic ties away from Europe and toward Asia and the United States. The result has been economic vitality, and newly elected Prime Minister John Howard is continuing these successful policies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, Canberra has developed especially close relations with countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).<sup>1</sup>  As an outside superpower, the U.S. cannot easily duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and dedication have presented to Australia. By cooperating with Canberra on trade and security issues, Washington can benefit from Australia's unique relations with other Asian countries to secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, however, the U.S.-Australian relationship is not living up to its potential. While Canberra and Washington are cooperating more closely on defense matters,<sup>2</sup> the U.S. often pursues counterproductive agriculture and trade policies that cost Americans and Australians dearly. For example, President Bill Clinton's vacillating trade policy is undermining Canberra's hopes for trade liberalization at the upcoming meetings of APEC ministers in the Philippines on November 22-25 and of the WTO in Singapore on December 9-12. The U.S. should be working with, not against, Australia to make these meetings a success for free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Improving relations with Australia will help the U.S. better protect its interests in the caldron of economic opportunity and geopolitical danger that is Asia. To accomplish this goal, the President should:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Ask Congress to eliminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs</b> that together cost American consumers and taxpayers more than $10 billion every year.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> The current Jones Act requirement that intracoastal shipping use U.S.-built, U.S.-operated, and U.S.-owned vessels adds between $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs of American firms.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> Fast track is needed to bring Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to present a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization in APEC, and to participate in any future round of WTO negotiations.
<p>
<li><b> Support Australia's initiative to harmonize such existing free trade agreements</b> as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER), and ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) within APEC. This would enhance the prospects for expanding liberalization within APEC itself.
<p>
<li><b> Participate fully in APEC's "concerted unilateralism" process.</b> Under concerted unilateralism, each APEC member prepares its own action plan to liberalize trade and investment, with each plan then subject to peer review to help assure compliance in achieving the ultimate goal. At present, there still are too many differences among APEC members for formal trade negotiations to succeed. Concerted unilateralism allows APEC members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if members gain confidence in each other can a more formal negotiating process be successful.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).</b> These include sector agreements to liberalize trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport, and new negotiations to liberalize agricultural trade.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b>
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra Tomahawk long-range cruise missiles and by including Canberra in the development any future Asian missile defense network.</b>
</ul>
<p>

<b>AUSTRALIA: A RISING POWER IN ASIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is easy for Americans to overlook Australia when thinking about Asian countries. Both stable and prosperous, Australia demands little attention from the crisis-dependent U.S. media. Moreover, most Americans do not really think of Australia as an Asian country. Unlike Asian countries with exotic cultures and languages, Australia and the U.S. share a common culture and language. It can be argued that Australia is more like the U.S. than any other country in the world.
</td></tr>But to overlook Australia when examining the Asia-Pacific region is a serious omission. There are four reasons for drawing this conclusion:
<p><blockquote>
<b>REASON #1: Australia is a major market for American goods and services</b>, with a large and vibrant economy. For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia's gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995 was $347.6 billion, making Australia's economy the fourth-largest in Asia and the 14th-largest in the world.</b> Despite Australia's relatively small population of 18 million, its GDP is larger than that of India, Taiwan, or any Southeast Asian country. Only China, Japan, and South Korea have larger economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia is the world's 21st-largest trading power and America's 20th-largest trading partner.</b> Merchandise trade between Australia and the U.S. was $13.4 billion in 1995. In fact, the U.S. enjoyed a $7.5 billion merchandise trade surplus with Australia -- the largest such U.S. surplus with any of the world's trading powers.
<p>
<li><b> Australia hosts American direct investments of $24.7 billion.</b> Australia is the ninth-largest host to U.S. direct investment in the world and the second-largest in Asia, ranking only behind Japan.
<p>
<li><b> Trade and investment liberalization has expanded U.S. exports to Australia significantly in recent years.</b> U.S. merchandise exports to Australia have grown by 94 percent, from $5.5 billion in 1986 to $10.8 billion in 1995, and currently provide jobs to approximately 215,000 American workers. Under Canberra's liberal economic policy (especially its policy of privatization), U.S. direct investment in Australia has exploded by 165 percent, rising from $9.3 billion in 1986 to $24.7 billion in 1995.
</ul><p>
<b>REASON #2: Australia is a major proponent of free trade and investment.</b> For example:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Australia led the fight to include agricultural trade liberalization in the Uruguay Round Agreements.</b> In 1986, Australia organized the Cairns Group of 14 agricultural exporting countries to promote free trade in farm products.<sup>3</sup>  Under Australian leadership, the Cairns Group succeeded during the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations in winning the first multilateral agreement to liberalize trade in agricultural products. Along with Brazil, the European Union, Japan, and the U.S., Australia is widely considered to be one of the five most influential members of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
<p>
<li><b> Australia founded the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> In January 1989, Prime Minister Bob Hawke proposed a meeting of government ministers from the Asia-Pacific region to establish a framework for economic cooperation. This led to the formation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Canberra in November 1989.<sup>4</sup>  In November 1994, at Bogor, Indonesia, Australia and the other APEC member economies established the goal of "achieving free and open trade and investment" by 2010 for developed economies and by 2020 for developing economies.
<p>
<li><b> Australia and New Zealand were the first countries to outlaw antidumping procedures in a free trade agreement.</b> In 1988, Australia and New Zealand agreed to revise the original Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement (CER) to make it the world's most comprehensive trade agreement. The CER removed all tariffs and quotas on trade in goods by 1990, established free trade in services, abolished antidumping procedures in bilateral trade, created a common labor market, and harmonized business and trade practices laws. As tariffs have fallen, protectionists in the U.S. and elsewhere increasingly have been employing antidumping procedures to curb imports. By abolishing antidumping procedures, the CER prevents such abuses.
<p>
<li><b> Unlike the U.S., Australia has lowered its trade barriers unilaterally.</b> In May 1988, Australia announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be lowered from 15 percent to 10 percent by July 1992. In March 1991, it announced that tariffs on most manufactured goods would be reduced further to 5 percent by July 1996, and that tariffs on textiles, clothing, and footwear would be reduced from 55 percent to 25 percent by July 2000. 
</ul>

</table>
<p>
<b>REASON #3: Australia is a strong military ally.</b> Australia is one of America's most steadfast military allies. Australian and American troops fought together in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. Australia and the U.S. also are parties to a mutual defense treaty: the Australia, New Zealand, and United States Security Treaty, commonly known as ANZUS.<sup>5</sup>  Australia and Japan are among America's major military allies in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, the Howard government recently has shown its willingness to enhance cooperation with the United States on defense and regional security issues. On July 26, 1996, Canberra agreed to host a new series of biennial military exercises called "Tandem Thrust."  The first war game in March 1997 will involve 17,000 U.S. Marines and 5,000 Australian troops near Shoalwater Bay in Queensland. Subsequent American military training exercises will occur in the Northern Territory of Australia. Because of this cooperation, the U.S. can shift much of its Asian battle training away from densely populated Japan and Korea to sparsely populated areas of Australia (and possibly help to defuse local political tensions over American bases in Japan and Korea as well).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Canberra and Washington also have agreed to cooperate on missile defense issues. China is modernizing its missile forces and twice in the last year has used its missiles to threaten democratic Taiwan. During a July 1996 meeting in Canberra, Australian Minister of Defense Ian McLachlan and U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry signed a new ten-year lease that will allow the U.S. to use a jointly manned intelligence facility at Pine Gap. The functions of this base will expand to include intelligence satellite downlinks now at the Nurrungar, Australia, facility, which soon will be closed. The Nurrungar facility enabled the U.S. Space Command to help Patriot missile operators defeat Iraqi Scud missiles during the Persian Gulf War, and Pine Gap could help the U.S. provide defense support that Israel can use to defeat missile threats. Such capabilities also could help Australia defend itself from missile threats.<sup>6</sup>  Australia is in an ideal position to facilitate regional missile defense cooperation, and the facilities at Pine Gap could be expanded to provide intelligence information that might help the United States verify a future arms control agreement to limit the number of missiles deployed by Asian countries.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>REASON #4: Australia maintains close diplomatic ties to Asia.</b> Australia can influence economic policymakers in Asian countries in ways the U.S. cannot. Canberra originated the concept of a regional economic forum that led to the formation of APEC in 1989. It also worked closely with President Suharto of Indonesia to persuade more reluctant APEC members to agree to the 1994 Bogor Declaration, which set as APEC's objective "achieving free trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for developed economies and 2020 for developing economies."  Australia's successful trade liberalization encouraged the ASEAN countries to create their own ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in January 1992 and to reduce the period for its implementation from 15 to ten years in October 1995. Canberra's cooperative attitude toward trade with Asia has increased Australian influence in Asian capitals. For example, the Howard government is working closely with ASEAN leaders to coordinate strategy in APEC and the WTO.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>HOW AUSTRALIA TRANSFORMED ITS WORLD PRESENCE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This remarkable new role for Australia has not occurred overnight. It is the result of a long transformation with deep roots in Australian history.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's proximity to Asia, for most of its history it has thought of itself as a European country. Because of this self-conception, Australian governments pursued policies known collectively as the "Australian Settlement."  Among other things, the Australian Settlement encompassed a "whites only" immigration policy, dependence on the United Kingdom for defense and markets, and a highly protected and regulated domestic economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Throughout most of this century, Canberra tried to promote industrial development through a system of high tariffs and subsidies to Australian manufacturers. But this protectionism caused a protracted decline in Australia's economy relative to the economies of other developed countries. In 1900, Australia had the highest per capita gross domestic product in the world. Over the next 80 years, it experienced the slowest growth in per capita GDP of all developed countries. By 1980, Australia had fallen to 14th place in per capita GDP.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1970s, Australia's defense and trade ties to Great Britain diminished. The United Kingdom's accession to the European Union in 1973 denied Australia preferential access to its historically most important export market. Meanwhile, the economic rise of Japan and the other "Asian tigers" provided Australia with vast new markets for its agricultural and mineral products. The integration of separate national economies into a single global economy made Australia's inward-looking economic policies increasingly burdensome.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thus began a gradual backing away from the Australian Settlement policies. In 1973, Prime Minister Geoff Whitlam ended the "whites only" immigration policy. The result was significant Asian immigration, which caused Canberra slowly to begin to see itself more as an Asian country. Asian immigrants, with their cultural knowledge and language skills, have become a major asset for Australian firms doing business in Asia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, the decisive break with the Australian Settlement came in March 1983. Suffocating from double-digit inflation and unemployment rates, Australian voters elected a Labor Government led by Prime Minister Bob Hawke and Treasurer Paul Keating. Contrary to what people normally expected of a Labor government, Hawke and Keating, driven by fear of an economic crisis, began to liberalize Australia's economy. Keating himself best summarized the challenges facing Australia:
<p>
<blockquote>
	We must let Australians know truthfully, honestly, earnestly, just what sort of international hole Australia is in.... If this government cannot get... a sensible economic policy, then Australia is basically done for. We will end up being just a third rate economy....  Then you are gone. You are a banana republic.<sup>8</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hawke and Keating boldly rejected Australia's traditional policy of protectionism. The Labor government exposed Australia's domestic economy to global market forces through deregulation, privatization, and trade liberalization. The Hawke (1983-1991) and subsequent Keating (1991-1996) governments reoriented Australia's trade policies toward Asia, and Australia began to think of itself as an Asian country. Labor sought to broaden and deepen Australia's diplomatic and economic ties to China, Japan, South Korea, the countries of Southeast Asia, and the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies have made Australia a major player in the Asia-Pacific economy. Japan is now Australia's largest trading partner (receiving 24.3 percent of total Australian exports in 1994-1995), followed by South Korea (7.9 percent), New Zealand (7.1 percent), and the United States (6.9 percent). Australia annually hosts 43,000 foreign students (mainly Asian) in its universities, earning more than $1 billion annually in service export income.
<p>
<b>THE LEGACY OF U.S. POLICY: NEGLECT AND ABUSE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite Australia's growing importance in Asia, U.S. policy toward Australia is best described as benign neglect punctuated with occasional abuse -- even though Australia and the United States are long-standing allies with shared interests in commercial and military travel on oceans and seas, promoting access by American and Australian firms to domestic markets in Asia, and preventing the domination of Asia by a hostile power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However, it is undeniable that the U.S. has pursued agriculture and trade policies that have soured its relations with this emerging power. This may not have been intentional; American leaders simply did not pay adequate attention to the effects their decisions had on Australia. But the consequence has been undeniable: a missed opportunity to advance mutual economic interests in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>U.S. Agriculture Policy: A Losing Proposition.</b> Over the past decade, the most serious dispute between Australia and the United States has been over agriculture policy. American and Australian farmers produce a wide range of agricultural commodities that compete with each other on world markets. Because of America's role as a large, if not dominant, producer and consumer of many farm commodities, U.S. agriculture policy profoundly affects world agricultural markets. Therefore, the level of agricultural protection and subsidies that Washington gives its farmers not only determines U.S. food production, consumption, and trade patterns, but also sets world prices for major agricultural commodities.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By contrast, Australian farmers receive world prices for most of their agricultural products.<sup>10</sup>  Thus, to the extent that U.S. agricultural subsidies distort world prices, Australian farmers are affected adversely by U.S. agricultural policy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem was particularly serious in the 1980s when falling commodity and land prices caused agriculture subsidy costs to soar both in Australia and in the United States. Prime Minister Hawke and President Ronald Reagan chose radically different responses to this farm crisis. Hawke initiated a phaseout of Australia's agriculture price supports and subsidies. With the exception of its dairy industry subsidy (which will have been phased out completely in 2000), Australia now limits government agriculture assistance to inspection, quarantine efforts, pest control, education, and research.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By contrast, President Reagan created new export subsidies to improve the price competitiveness of American farm exports. Through the Food Security Act of 1985, the Reagan Administration established the Export Enhancement Program and the Dairy Export Incentive Program to subsidize U.S. agricultural exports. President George Bush later expanded these programs through the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the years since 1990, the attitude of American farmers toward federal agriculture programs has changed. Convinced in part by the successful transition of Australian farmers to subsidy-free agriculture, many American farmers have realized that they would be better off producing for the market instead of relying on government subsidy programs. When Congress began considering the reauthorization of federal agriculture programs in 1995, a revolution in American farm policy was at hand. The result was passage of the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996. In addition to granting wheat, feed grain, rice, and cotton farmers fixed but declining subsidies through seven-year transition contracts, the FAIR Act terminates production controls on wheat, feed grains, rice, and cotton. While the Act made progress toward a free market in agriculture, however, the dairy and sugar programs were modified only slightly, and the export subsidy programs were left intact. Thus, many subsidies remain. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Dairy Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains high domestic prices for dairy products through a complex and interlocking system of support prices, milk marketing orders, and tariff rate quotas. This system severely restricts access to the American market by foreign competitors such as Australia.<sup>11</sup>  The dairy program costs American consumers approximately $9 billion annually through high prices for milk, butter, and cheese, and American taxpayers will pay another $1.6 billion to maintain this program over the next five years.
<p>
<li><b>The Dairy Export Incentive Program.</b> The Dairy Export Incentive Program provides subsidies to exporters of dairy products.<sup>12</sup>  In addition to the fact that it will cost taxpayers approximately $120 million over the next five years without increasing the American dairy industry's international competitiveness, the Dairy Export Incentive Program depresses world dairy prices and reduces Australian dairy exports to third country markets.
<p>
<li><b>The Export Enhancement Program.</b> The Export Enhancement Program has paid out more than $6 billion since 1986, mainly to assist wheat exports. Intended to make American grain more competitive abroad, the Export Enhancement Program is counterproductive. U.S. export subsidies depress world grain prices (to the obvious objection of Australian farmers) while raising domestic U.S. grain prices, thereby discouraging American farmers from exporting.
<p>
<li><b>The Sugar Program.</b> The U.S. government maintains a high domestic price for sugar through a system of import tariff rate quotas.<sup>13</sup>  In 1993, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the sugar program hiked the domestic price of sugar to twice the world level and cost American consumers $1.4 billion a year. Higher U.S. prices caused sugar's share of the domestic sweetener market to fall from 79 percent in 1981 to 55 percent in 1994, forcing American sugar refiners to close processing facilities. Higher domestic prices also have driven American candy companies to move confectionery plants overseas to obtain cheaper sugar. At the same time, the sugar program has reduced world prices by an average of 4.8 cents per pound and caused Australia to export 89 percent less sugar to the U.S. since 1981. Thus, this program costs Australian exporters $274 million annually.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>The Jones Act: A Burden on the American Economy.</b> Another burden on both the U.S. and Australian economies is the Jones Act. Contained in Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, this law restricts maritime commerce between points within the United States to ships that are American-built, American-operated, and American-owned. In September 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission found that the Jones Act adds from $3 billion to $10 billion annually to the logistics costs borne by American business firms.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Jones Act also is a major irritant in relations with Australia. Canberra complains that this law prevents the sale of competitively priced Australian-made high-speed vessels to U.S. firms. On a broader scale, the Jones Act is an impediment to reaching an agreement in the WTO on liberalizing trade in maritime services. It prevents the President from opening intracoastal shipping to foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels. Because the U.S. refuses to liberalize its maritime industry in areas in which foreigners are competitive, many other countries are unwilling to liberalize their maritime industries in areas, such as logistics and port management, in which Americans are competitive. As a result, WTO negotiations on liberalizing maritime services have stalled.

<P>
<b>THE IMPACT OF U.S. PROTECTIONISM ON RELATIONS WITH AUSTRALIA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Australia has opened its economy, protectionist voices in the U.S. are urging Americans to shield themselves from the global economy. President Clinton's trade policy has been a series of mixed signals which have caused anxiety and confusion in Canberra. On the one hand, Clinton supported both the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993 and the Uruguay Round Agreements in 1994. He also signed the FAIR Act in 1996 to dismantle some protectionist and trade-distorting U.S. agriculture programs. On the other hand, however, Clinton appears to have strayed from his support of free trade in a number of different areas. For example, the President has:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Blocked an agreement with Congress to reauthorize fast-track negotiating authority for trade agreements.</b> President Clinton let fast-track authority for negotiating new trade and investment liberalization agreements expire in 1994. Under fast-track authority, trade and investment agreements negotiated by the President are submitted to Congress for a straight up-or-down vote; Congress may not amend any portion of a proposed agreement before voting on it. For two years now, the Clinton Administration has insisted that any bill reauthorizing fast track must allow the President to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This position has caused fast track to stall in Congress. Republican leaders fear that environmental and labor rules in trade agreements could be misused to protect certain industries. Republicans in Congress therefore offered to pass a "clean" fast-track bill without the authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues, but the Administration rejected this approach. Without fast-track authority, no country will enter into serious trade and investment liberalization negotiations with the U.S.<sup>14</sup>  The result: Canberra fears that the failure to pass fast track will stall progress on trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
<li><b> Pushed for managed trade.</b> The Clinton Administration attempted to impose managed trade policies on Japan in the automotive parts and motor vehicles dispute of 1995 and with respect to semiconductors in 1996. This strategy alarmed Canberra. Although Tokyo and Washington ultimately reached agreements in 1995 and 1996, respectively, which avoided mandatory quotas, Clinton's approach to the conflict alienated Australia and other Asian countries. The result: American influence over the direction of trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific region has been diminished.
<p>
<li><b> Shown ambivalence toward the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</b> Canberra is happy that President Clinton embraced Australia's APEC initiative and hosted the first APEC Leaders' Meeting near Seattle in 1993. It also is pleased that in 1994 the United States agreed to create a free trade and investment area in the Asia-Pacific by the year 2020. President Clinton and the other APEC leaders adopted a process known as concerted unilateralism to achieve the goal of a free trade and investment area in this region. Under this process, instead of negotiating a formal trade agreement like NAFTA, each member proposes its own action plan for realizing the common goal of free trade prior to the 1996 APEC meetings; each action plan is then subject to peer review to help assure that all will work toward the ultimate goal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nevertheless, President Clinton's actions in the last two years have caused Canberra to question America's commitment to the APEC process. First, President Clinton skipped the 1995 APEC Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, because of the budget stalemate with Congress. This decision disappointed Australia's Prime Minister at the time, Paul Keating, and raised questions among other leaders in the region. Second, the Clinton Administration has yet to offer a substantive U.S. action plan for APEC liberalization; its proposed plan is confined merely to a list of liberalization commitments previously made in the Uruguay Round Agreements. Canberra fears that the Clinton Administration's failure to offer anything new will discourage other APEC members from making substantive trade liberalization commitments.
<p>
<li><b> Failed to keep its commitment to liberalize trade in the WTO.</b> One of the Uruguay Round Agreements, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), established a general framework for liberalizing trade in various services in 1994. It also established a timetable for reaching specific agreements covering the financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport sectors.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration backed away from its WTO commitments in 1995 and 1996. Claiming that India, Japan, Korea, and certain ASEAN countries had not made adequate offers to open their financial services markets, the Administration unexpectedly withdrew from the WTO negotiations to liberalize financial services markets on June 29, 1995, the day before the agreement was to be completed. When Australia and the European Union were unsuccessful in persuading the Clinton Administration to return to the bargaining table, they joined with other WTO members and signed a two-year interim financial services agreement excluding the United States. For the first time, a multilateral trade agreement was reached without U.S. consent. This demonstrates President Clinton's declining influence over the course of world trade liberalization.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While GATS established rules to be used in opening markets for certain telecommunications products such as electronic mail, voice mail, on-line information and data base retrieval, and electronic data interchange, Uruguay Round negotiators were unable to fashion rules covering such other basic products as long distance and international services. Therefore, the WTO continued the negotiations on trade liberalization in these basic services. Once again, claiming that offers from India and the ASEAN countries were inadequate, the Clinton Administration withdrew American support for a WTO telecommunications agreement on April 30, 1996, the day negotiations were scheduled to conclude. When Australia and the European Union failed to broker a compromise, the WTO extended its negotiating deadline to February 15, 1997.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Howard government interprets this failure to reach sector agreements as evidence of President Clinton's unwillingness to subordinate the special interests of certain American firms to the general benefits of trade liberalization. At the same time, Canberra feels that Clinton Administration policies are fueling deep division within the WTO by attempting to link trade with issues related to environmental and labor standards. Australia and other Asian countries see this as nothing but thinly veiled protectionism and a brake on global trade liberalization. Not only has the Clinton Administration once again alienated potential allies (as it did in APEC), but it may have forfeited America's leadership role in the upcoming December 9-12, 1996, WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore as well.
<p>
<b>BUILDING A STRONGER U.S.-AUSTRALIA RELATIONSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite Australia's growing economic and geopolitical importance in the Asia-Pacific region, President Clinton continues to ignore Canberra. His agriculture and trade policies have hurt Australia needlessly. Moreover, the Clinton Administration's opposition to renewing fast-track authority, its campaign for managed trade with Japan, and its vacillation regarding APEC and the WTO have raised doubts in the Howard government about America's commitment to free trade.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These policies must be changed if the United States is to build a stronger relationship with Australia. Australia has changed greatly over the last decade. While maintaining its defense ties to the United States, it has developed closer diplomatic and economic ties to its neighbors in East and Southeast Asia and stands today as a leading advocate of free trade and investment. This new approach creates new avenues for cooperation between the U.S. and Australia. To facilitate this relationship and to enhance U.S. security and economic interests in Asia, there are several important steps that the Administration and Congress can take. Specifically, the President should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ask Congress to terminate the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs.</b> With passage of the FAIR Act, the U.S. began to wind down many economically irrational programs. However, the Dairy Program, Dairy Export Incentive Program, Export Enhancement Program, and Sugar Program survive largely intact. These programs raise U.S. consumer prices, cost American taxpayers billions of dollars annually, and decrease world prices for agricultural commodities. Eliminating them would remove a major impediment to improved U.S.-Australia relations and strengthen both economies.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress to allow intracoastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels.</b> Repealing the Jones Act would help both the U.S. and Australia by allowing the use of competitively priced, Australian-made high-speed ships in U.S. waters. The result would be to lower logistics costs for American business firms and consumers.
<p>
<li><b> Ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues.</b> The U.S. needs fast-track authority to offer a substantive action plan for trade and investment liberalization at APEC, to harmonize NAFTA with other regional free trade agreements, and to commence a new round of WTO negotiations. The President should drop his insistence that authority to negotiate on environmental and labor standards issues must be included in any fast-track legislation. Environmental and labor standards issues may have an international dimension, but they should be addressed in separate negotiations on their own merits.
<p>
<li><b>Support Australia's initiative to harmonize existing free trade agreements within APEC.</b> At upcoming APEC meetings, Canberra will urge members to harmonize existing free trade agreements such as NAFTA, the CER, and the ASEAN Free Trade Area. The President should support this Australian initiative. Harmonizing NAFTA, CER, and AFTA is a practical step toward trade and investment liberalization in the Asia-Pacific.
<p>
<li><b>Participate fully in APEC's concerted unilateralism process.</b> There are too many differences among APEC members at present for negotiations on an APEC free trade and investment agreement to succeed. Before work can begin on a region-wide free trade zone, the APEC process must be strengthened. The strategy of concerted unilateralism allows members to take small but concrete steps each year toward APEC's ultimate goal of free trade and investment by 2020. Only if APEC members gain confidence in each other over the next few years can a more formal negotiating process be expected to succeed.
<p>
<li><b> Work with Australia to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round of GATT talks.</b> At the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore, the President should support Canberra's proposal to complete unfinished items from the Uruguay Round. Washington must work with Canberra to reach agreements on liberalized trade in basic telecommunications and maritime transport services by 1997. They also should work together to prepare for the new negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization that are scheduled to begin in 1999.
<p>
<li><b> Propose convening a new WTO round with the goal of achieving a global free trade and investment agreement by 2020.</b> The President should exercise bold leadership and press other WTO members at Singapore to convene a new round of global trade liberalization talks by 1998. The new WTO round should subsume APEC's goal of free trade and investment by 2020 as its own. This policy could encourage APEC to accelerate the liberalization of trade and investment in Asia. It would not be the first time that trade liberalization in one set of negotiations spurred liberalization in another. In the early 1990s, for example, the creation of APEC helped bring the Uruguay Round negotiations to a successful conclusion.
<p>
<li><b> Enhance American military ties to Australia.</b> The agreement to stage military exercises in Australia will provide U.S. forces with a better location than Japan and Okinawa for training. Relocating training exercises from these highly populated areas also may reduce public opposition to critical U.S. defense bases there. A renewed lease on the Pine Gap intelligence facility will benefit U.S. strategic goals in Asia and the Middle East. In return, the U.S. should offer to sell Canberra <i>Tomahawk</i> long-range cruise missiles for Australia's new <i>Collins</i>-class submarines. The U.S. also should include Australia in the development of any future Asian missile defense network.
</ul>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Like Rip Van Winkle, who slept through the American Revolution, an Australian who dozed off 20 years ago and suddenly woke up today would find a very different country. For many years, Australia resisted developing an Asian Pacific identity. That resistance has given way to acceptance of Australia's destiny as a country embracing Asia and immersing itself in the Asian market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Australia's transformation benefits the United States in ways that should not be overlooked by U.S. policymakers. By opening its economy, Australia has expanded the market for American exports and investments. It also is a well-positioned ally that can help the United States promote trade and investment liberalization throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The U.S. has an unprecedented opportunity to help itself by working more closely with Australia in the Asia-Pacific region. Washington should take the fullest possible advantage of this opportunity by making every effort to remove irritants in its bilateral relations with Canberra. Chief among these irritants are counterproductive agriculture programs and the Jones Act, which hurt not only Australia farmers and shipbuilders, but also American consumers. The U.S. and Australia also should cooperate closely to ensure the success of the upcoming APEC and WTO meetings. Finally, the U.S. should continue and strengthen its military ties to Australia to help maintain peace in the Asia-Pacific. In these ways, the U.S. can expand markets for American goods and services while reversing the dangerous perception of declining American influence in Asia.

<li>    Prior to 1996, U.S. agricultural programs were like a dike separating two bodies of water. One body is domestic prices; the other, world prices. When the U.S. increases agricultural subsidies and import barriers to maintain domestic prices at a higher level than world prices, foreign production that would have been sold in the U.S. is sold in other markets, and the larger supplies in other markets drive down world prices. But when the U.S. lowers agricultural subsidies and import barriers, American food imports increase. Thus, removing the dike simultaneously lowers domestic agricultural prices and raises world prices until they become identical.<p>
<li>    Dairy products are an exception.<p>
<li>    To maintain domestic prices of butter, cheese, and powdered milk, the federal government purchases any surplus of these products from processors at a fixed price ($10.35 per hundredweight in 1996). The federal government and the state of California use milk marketing orders that restrict the sale of fluid milk between different regions to maintain domestic milk prices. To limit foreign competition, the U.S. employs a tariff rate quota system that establishes country-by-country quotas for dairy imports. Under this system (as distinguished from a pure quota system), exporting countries may exceed their dairy import quotas, but the U.S. levies a prohibitively high tariff on dairy imports exceeding the quota.<p>
<li>    American exporters receive cash or surplus dairy products from the federal government as a bonus for exporting dairy products to targeted markets. This moves dairy products from the domestic market to targeted foreign markets such as Algeria, Brazil, Jamaica, India, Iraq, and Mexico, simultaneously raising domestic dairy prices while reducing dairy prices in targeted foreign markets.<p>
<li>    A tariff rate quota system differs from a pure quota system. It permits imports above the quota but also levies a prohibitively high tariff rate on them. Thus, imports effectively are limited to the quota amount in most circumstances. <p>
<li>    If Congress were allowed to amend trade agreements, Congress would likely accept the concessions that foreign governments made to reach a deal while voting to reject U.S. concessions. Such an outcome obviously is unacceptable to any foreign government. To encourage foreign governments to negotiate trade agreements with the United States, Congress devised the fast-track procedure to force itself to accept or reject trade agreements as a whole.<p>
<li>    The most important dispute concerns how to prevent telecommunications firms with monopolies in their home market for international services from undercutting other suppliers in competitive markets for international services. As a compromise, Australia proposed a safeguard that would allow a country to revoke a foreign firm's license to provide international services if that firm distorts the market with such cross-subsidies.<p>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the Mexican peso on December 20, 1994, but the United States has not. The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization policies, and efforts to create a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). However, the U.S. appears to have turned its back on Latin America. As free trade has faded from the foreign policy agendas of both the Clinton Administration and the 104th Congress, U.S. relations with Latin America have deteriorated significantly. On issues such as Cuba, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, and even the creation of the FTAA, America today is increasingly at odds with important hemispheric trading partners such as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Colombia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's flight from enlarging the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has damaged U.S. leadership and economic interests in the Western Hemisphere, but hemispheric trade expansion has not been interrupted. Mexico has signed free trade agreements (FTAs) with Chile, Bolivia, and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur),<sup>1</sup> and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral FTA with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include the five members of the Andean Community.<sup>2</sup>  Mercosur also wants to sign an FTA with the European Union. Clearly, no one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free trade express in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations established the closest and strongest relationship with Latin America that the U.S. has enjoyed in more than a century. The bases of this new hemispheric partnership were democracy and the creation of a hemispheric free trade area, as provided for in the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) and the NAFTA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But since 1993, the Clinton Administration has dissipated the achievements of more than a decade by pursuing a policy of neglect and indifference toward Latin America. Since the collapse of the Mexican peso at the end of 1994, NAFTA has become a political football for politicians who claim that free trade is the cause of such domestic problems as increased drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Instead of responding by making a strong case for NAFTA, however, some previously strong supporters of free trade have scaled back their support for its enlargement, and for the FTAA process in general. America's retreat from NAFTA's expansion is hurting American consumers and workers, undermining U.S. economic interests in Latin America, and weakening U.S. leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If this situation is not reversed, U.S. interests in Latin America could suffer lasting damage. To regain America's leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America, the U.S. Administration should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b> Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial, to be held during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte, will be marginal at best.
<p>
<li><b> Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b> The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC), and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<p>
<li><b>Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>3</sup> H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, would improve market access for U.S. exports to Caribbean and Central American markets. It also would require CBI beneficiaries to strengthen rules relating to investment, labor standards, and the environment, among other improvements that strongly favor U.S. interests.
<p>
<li><b>Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b> The goal of such talks should be to deepen and harmonize trade disciplines between NAFTA and Mercosur as both groups take on new members; the ultimate objective should be to merge these two regional groups into a single hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b> Western Hemisphere nations should define quickly whether the FTAA will include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the World Trade Organization (WTO). America should insist on FTAA trade disciplines that improve on NAFTA and the WTO.
<p>
<li><b>Implement reforms that do not require negotiations,</b> including unilateral cuts in tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, simplification and harmonization of existing rules and regulations affecting the flow of goods and services in the region, removal of barriers to trade in services, enactment of world-class protection for intellectual property rights, and revision of investment regulations.
<p>
<li><b>Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade,</b> such as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, labor standards, and preserving the environment. The action plan approved at the Summit of the Americas on December 11, 1994, outlines such a framework; in practice, however, the Clinton Administration has sought consistently to establish conditions and linkages between free trade and other issues. As a result, tensions between the U.S. and Latin America have increased in the past two years, and U.S. leadership and credibility have suffered.
<p>
<li><b>Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b> The negotiation of bilateral free trade agreements with these countries could create momentum for the convergence of the FTAA and APEC processes into a single free trade area encompassing more than 2 billion consumers.
<p>
<li><b>Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b> Strong leadership is required to prevent regionalism from derailing the FTAA process. The goals of a second Summit of the Americas should include creation of a WTO-type entity to advance negotiations, expansion of FTAA technical working groups to propose policies and specific actions, and a commitment by all democracies in the Western Hemisphere to a specific timetable and pathway for launching the FTAA by 2005.
<p>
<li><b>Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b> U.S. protectionism is the greatest impediment to free trade and creation of an FTAA. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers over $70 billion a year and encourage U.S. trading partners to retaliate with measures that hinder free trade and penalize American consumers and exporters.<sup>4</sup>
</ul><P>

<b>TRADE POLICY BLUNDERS IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The greatest failure of U.S. Latin American policy in recent years has been in the area of trade policy. The U.S. no longer leads the Western Hemisphere FTAA process, primarily because the Clinton Administration has chosen to retreat from free trade and NAFTA's enlargement rather than defend the trade pact's record of success. As a result, the FTAA process has lost momentum and the U.S. has surrendered leadership and negotiating advantage to Brazil, which has tilted the FTAA process toward the enlargement of Mercosur into a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil and capable of challenging U.S. economic interests and leadership in the Americas.
<p>

This retreat from free trade is severely damaging to U.S. relations with Latin America, not to mention economic and security interests in the Western Hemisphere. Without the goodwill and greater economic interaction that come with increased trade and investment, it will be more difficult for the U.S. and Latin America to develop and implement effective policies for managing such hemispheric problems as drug trafficking, corruption, illegal immigration, and environmental destruction. Moreover, Washington's reluctance to expand NAFTA means that American companies and workers risk missing out on the fast-paced trade expansion occurring today throughout Latin America. Opportunities missed by U.S. companies will be seized by investors from other countries. Exports, jobs, and wealth creation possibilities lost in Latin America by U.S. firms will accrue to others.
<p>

<b>NAFTA: TWO YEARS OF SOLID GROWTH</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994 -- only nine days after the Summit of the Americas concluded in Miami -- critics of NAFTA have been claiming that the trade pact is a failure. Many critics also blame NAFTA for the growing problems of drugs, illegal immigration, and declining real wages in U.S. manufacturing. But NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis and is not responsible for America's social problems. Moreover, far from being a failure, NAFTA has scored some impressive trade and investment successes during its first two years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA helped Mexico overcome the peso crisis. The international obligations created by NAFTA and by Mexico's membership in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) enabled the embattled government of Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to rebuff intense political pressure to roll back Mexico's economic reforms after the peso collapsed. As a result, the Mexican economy now is recovering from the crisis, although years will pass before per capita income returns to pre-peso crisis levels.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During NAFTA's first two years, trade and foreign direct investment among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada have increased. Since 1994, the average U.S. tariff on Mexican products has fallen from 3.5 percent to 1.5 percent, while average Mexican tariffs on U.S. products have dropped from 10 percent to 4.9 percent. As a result, trade among the three NAFTA countries rose by 17 percent in 1994 to $350 billion, and bilateral U.S.-Mexico trade grew by 20.7 percent, surpassing $100 billion for the first time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, despite the recession caused by the peso's collapse, overall U.S.-Mexico trade increased 8 percent to $108 billion, while total intra-NAFTA trade grew 10.6 percent to $380 billion.<sup>5</sup>  Moreover, after declining by 8.9 percent in 1995 to $46.3 billion, U.S. exports to Mexico increased by 12.1 percent during the first three months of 1996, compared with the same period in 1995.<sup>6</sup>  More than 75 percent of all U.S. states reported a rise in exports to Mexico during the first quarter of 1996.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico during 1995 totaled $33.49 billion, compared with a 1994 trade deficit of $14.69 billion with Canada and a trade surplus of $1.34 billion with Mexico. Critics have used these figures to defend their claim that NAFTA is costing jobs in America. The reason Mexico imported fewer U.S. goods in 1995, however, is simply that the peso's collapse reduced the buying power of the Mexican people by more than 50 percent, and poorer people buy fewer goods. Americans consumed more Mexican products in 1995 because the average American is much wealthier than the average Mexican. The truth is that more jobs in America today rely on imports than exports, since nearly 90 percent of American manufacturers utilize imported materials or components in their production.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the $80 billion jump in three-way trade during the first two years of NAFTA's implementation added over 1.6 million new jobs to the North American economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
NAFTA is restructuring the North American economy as firms in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada create cross-border enterprises that lower manufacturing costs, improve productivity, and expand the volume and diversity of products at lower prices for consumers in all three countries. A recent study by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) found that half of Mexico's total exports to the U.S. are manufactured by U.S.-owned firms, or by production-sharing partnerships<sup>9</sup> whose products have an average U.S. content of 50.2 percent, compared with 35.3 percent for Canada, 32 percent for Taiwan, and 27.8 percent for Korea. As the output of Mexico-based co-production ventures increases, the volume and value of U.S.-made inputs imported by Mexican firms also increase, creating more jobs in America. Moreover, the rise in U.S.-Mexico co-production ventures is diverting investment away from alternative co-production sites in Asia. In 1994, Mexico was America's largest production-sharing partner, accounting for $22.9 billion, or 39.1 percent of all U.S. co-produced imports.<sup>10</sup>  U.S.-Mexico production partnerships increasingly play a prominent role in such key industries as motor vehicles, auto parts, computers, televisions and other electrical products, and textiles and apparel, among others.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>NAFTA Aiding Mexico's Recovery.</b> Only 18 months after the peso's collapse, the Mexican economy is showing signs of a promising, if uneven, recovery. Following five consecutive quarters of decline, the Mexican economy grew sharply during the second quarter of 1996 as real gross domestic product (GDP) rose 7.2 percent compared with the second quarter of 1995. For all of 1996, Mexico is expected to grow about 3 percent, compared to a contraction of 6.9 percent in 1995.<sup>11</sup>  Moreover, despite a 22 percent rise in the peso against key currencies during the first seven months of 1996, Mexican exports of manufactured goods have gained 22.8 percent, while imports have increased 22.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>  Nevertheless, about 70 percent of all economic activity in Mexico is tied to the domestic economy, which may not feel the overall, export-driven economic upturn for at least another year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Political and social instability have increased in Mexico as a result of the economic crisis, the spread of drug trafficking, a weak judiciary incapable of fighting corruption, and entrenched political and economic dinosaurs that continue to block democratic reform and true economic freedom. However, NAFTA is not responsible for Mexico's current social and political difficulties. In fact, NAFTA has provided Mexico with a strong anchor and a stable point of institutional reference on the road to true capitalist democracy. Meanwhile, there is reason to be optimistic about Mexico's political future.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Impressive Growth in U.S.-Canada Trade.</b> Canadian exports to the U.S. and Mexico have risen impressively since NAFTA was implemented. Foreign investment in Canada from all sources also has increased significantly. In 1995, two-way trade between the U.S. and Canada grew nearly 12 percent to $272 billion, while total foreign direct investment in Canada increased by 10 percent to $168 billion. The U.S. is the largest foreign investor in Canada. Direct investment in Canada by American firms increased by 11 percent to $113 billion in 1995, representing 67 percent of total foreign direct investment in Canada. Similarly, the U.S. remains the destination for the largest share of Canadian foreign direct investment, with a total of $76.5 billion invested.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada's exports in 1994 represented 30.1 percent of its total GDP, compared to 21.6 percent in 1991. Canada's strong export performance during the 1990s was closely related to the growth in Canadian exports to the U.S., and Canadian production of goods for international markets is closely linked to the U.S. through the intra-firm trading of U.S.-controlled firms operating in Canada.<sup>14</sup>  Transactions between related firms account for 57 percent of Canadian exports to the U.S., and 72 percent of exports by U.S.-con-trolled Canadian firms are related-party transactions. According to one survey, "U.S.-controlled [multinational companies] are responsible for the largest share of sales by the Canadian manufacturing and wholesale firms studied, and account for the largest share of their imports and exports."  Overall, the Canadian economy is "linked intra-regionally to the U.S. economy."<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>A Hemispheric Free Trade Emporium.</b> When Mexico defaulted on its external debt obligations in 1982, it triggered the Latin American debt crisis and plunged the region into a decade of negative growth and falling per capita income. However, when the Mexican peso collapsed in December 1994, Latin America was hardly affected. Economic growth in Latin America and the Caribbean slowed to 0.8 percent in 1995 as the effects of the Mexican peso crisis rippled through the region's financial markets. However, U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean rose to $102 billion in 1995, up 12 percent from 1994 and 72 percent higher than total U.S. exports to the region in 1990. Although individual countries such as Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico are struggling to resolve diverse economic, political, and social difficulties, the region overall has shrugged off the aftershocks of the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The World Bank predicts that Latin America and the Caribbean will grow by 3.1 percent in 1996 and 4 percent in 1997, with Chile leading the region at 6.5 percent this year while Venezuela lags at 0.5 percent.<sup>16</sup>  The bank also predicts that average GDP growth should rise to 3.8 percent in 1996-2005, compared to average growth of 2.4 percent during the past decade.<sup>17</sup>  Free trade and foreign direct investment are driving the region's growth. Latin America's exports and imports increased rapidly as tariff barriers dropped from 50 percent a decade ago to 12 percent in 1993, one year before NAFTA went into effect. For years, U.S. exports to Latin America have increased twice as rapidly as exports to any other region of the world. Intra-regional trade between Latin American countries and trade with Asia also are growing rapidly. For example, intra-Mercosur trade doubled in four years to $15.8 billion and today accounts for 22 percent of the group's total world trade, up from 14.3 percent in 1992.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some World Bank economists believe that Latin America can achieve annual growth rates of 6 to 6.5 percent within a decade if governments in the region raise exports significantly by avoiding overvalued exchange rates; increasing investments for infrastructure such as roads, ports, and telecommunications; and attracting larger amounts of foreign direct investment.<sup>18</sup> However, while democracy, hemispheric economic integration, and trade expansion are progressing rapidly, Latin American and Caribbean countries are still struggling to resolve a host of structural impediments to faster growth and greater stability and economic prosperity. Economic reforms have not advanced sufficiently anywhere in the region, including Chile, which is routinely hailed as Latin America's star performer. The widespread absence of economic freedom is reflected in the region's high levels of poverty, illiteracy, and illegal immigration. Judicial systems are generally weak, politicized, and corrupt. Effective legal protection for individual property rights does not exist. Moreover, drug traffickers have emerged in the 1990s as major threats to the stability of countries such as Colombia and Mexico. Organized violence by subversive guerrilla organizations is increasing in Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The difficulties confronting Latin America and the Caribbean today defy easy or quick solutions. They represent both a daunting challenge to the region's expectations for a brighter economic future and a threat to U.S. economic and national security interests. The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, NAFTA, and Free Trade Area of the Americas were proposed by the U.S. as the foundations of a hemispheric partnership and a new American Century based on democracy, free trade, and the economic integration of the U.S. and Latin America. This vision has not been realized. Nine days after the FTAA was launched at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, the Mexican peso collapsed and the U.S. retreated from NAFTA's enlargement.
<p>
<b>TEN INITIATIVES FOR RESTORING U.S. LEADERSHIP TO THE FREE TRADE AREA OF THE AMERICAS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure to enlarge NAFTA to involve Chile and the Caribbean countries during 1995 was a major setback for U.S. economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. The momentum and direction of the FTAA process have changed significantly since the Mexican peso crisis. Brazil has filled the vacuum in the FTAA process created by America's retreat from free trade, and has won regional support for an alternative trade agenda that sidelines a NAFTA/WTO-plus process to create the FTAA in favor of a more limited regional approach based on the expansion of Mercosur to create a South American Free Trade Area (SAFTA) centered on Brazil. Brazil also favors negotiating a trade pact with the European Union before engaging the U.S. in talks to establish a framework for the future merger of Mercosur and NAFTA into an FTAA.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although Mercosur has its share of internal problems that could slow its expansion, the process is well underway. Chile has become an associate of Mercosur, and Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador expect to join before the end of 1996. Mexico is negotiating an agreement with Mercosur while simultaneously blocking U.S. and Canadian efforts to launch early talks between NAFTA and Mercosur. The proposed enlargement of Mercosur and creation of a SAFTA appeals to many Latin American politicians, intellectuals, and business leaders who support higher levels of protectionism and the notion of a united Latin American front capable of maintaining its economic and political independence from U.S. pressure and interference. Latin American integration is one of the oldest dreams in the region, and it is closer to being achieved today than ever before. Meanwhile, as the free trade express in Latin America picks up speed, the U.S. lags behind even the caboose.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The new U.S. partnership with Latin America celebrated by President Clinton at the Summit of the Americas has developed serious cracks. For example, entities such as the Rio Group and the Organization of American States (OAS) have condemned the U.S. for enacting the Helms-Burton Act against Cuba and for decertifying Colombia in the war on drugs. U.S. policy against Cuba also has raised tensions significantly with NAFTA partners Mexico and Canada. Mexico has attacked recent changes in U.S. immigration policy. A pattern of mutual recrimination has emerged. The U.S. criticizes Latin America's coddling of Fidel Castro's regime and punishes countries like Colombia and Mexico for not doing enough to control drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Latin American governments criticize what they perceive as the return of U.S. "big stick" unilateralism and feel betrayed by Washington's bipartisan stampede away from NAFTA's expansion and the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Leading by Example.</b> If the U.S. expects Latin America and the Caribbean to cooperate on policy issues viewed as important to U.S. economic and security interests, it must assert its leadership and set the example. Abandoning trade commitments like adding Chile to NAFTA is the antithesis of leadership, and it sets a bad example. Instead of building a bridge to the 21st century that would unite the U.S. and the democracies of the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. retreat from NAFTA's expansion and the U.S. government's managed trade policies have dug a moat between Washington and the rest of the Americas.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To restore American leadership to the FTAA process and repair the recent damage to U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean, the U.S. Administration should carry out the following ten initiatives:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Approve a new fast-track negotiating authority.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track in hand, the Administration cannot enter into serious trade negotiations with Chile or any other country. Chile has claimed that it will not negotiate its entry into NAFTA until fast-track is renewed. Suggestions that fast-track is not necessary to enter into trade negotiations are mistaken. No country will invest the time or the human and financial resources in negotiating with the U.S. if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Without fast-track, U.S. participation in and influence at the third post-Summit of the Americas Trade Ministerial during the second quarter of 1997 in the Brazilian city of Belo Horizonte will be marginal at best; moreover, U.S. proposals are more likely to be rejected. Symbolically, making renewal of fast-track one of the first actions of a new Administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the U.S. has re-engaged in the FTAA process. The dynamics of the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial could be altered completely if the U.S. delegation arrives with fast-track negotiating authority. Without fast-track, however, the U.S. risks being left behind again as Brazil's vision of turning Mercosur into a SAFTA stokes the enthusiasm of other Latin American governments.
<p>
<b>2. Expand NAFTA during 1997 to include Chile.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the greatest mistakes made recently by the U.S. in Latin America was postponing the inclusion of Chile in NAFTA until after the 1996 elections. The failure to add Chile to NAFTA weakened American leadership and influence in the FTAA process.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is no reason to delay the admission of Chile to NAFTA. Chile's total gross national product is equivalent to about 1 percent of the American economy. Chile has enjoyed positive economic growth for 14 consecutive years. Growth during the past six years under a democratic civilian government has averaged 7.5 percent annually. Chile has pre-paid a large chunk of its external public sector debt, has no balance-of-payments problems, and has enjoyed single-digit inflation since 1994. Its investment and savings rates are approaching those of the Asian Tigers. The inclusion of Chile in NAFTA would confirm America's commitment to leading the FTAA process, open a new gateway for U.S. exports to markets in South America and APEC, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage for future convergence talks with Mercosur.
<P>
<b>3. Include the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries in NAFTA.</b><sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
H.R. 553, stalled in Congress since 1995, is intended to correct an imbalance created by NAFTA that directly affects the interests of U.S. producers, importers, retailers, and consumers. The bill was developed to assure "parity" for producers in CBI countries with the market access provided to Mexican producers under the NAFTA. Such parity is badly needed. The Bush and Clinton Administrations mistakenly assumed that NAFTA would not divert trade and investment from the CBI countries. Since the implementation of NAFTA on January 1, 1994, U.S. imports of certain products (such as apparel) produced in the CBI countries by American firms have been affected adversely. The trade advantages created by NAFTA have enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the U.S. As a result, the rate of growth for apparel imports from CBI countries into the U.S. fell from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996, while apparel imports from Mexico during the same five-month period grew by 41 percent.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
<b>4. Launch a dialogue to integrate NAFTA and Mercosur.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dynamics of the FTAA process have changed. The U.S. has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing. Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade disciplines as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1995, the Clinton Administration has been trying without success to establish a formal dialogue between NAFTA and Mercosur. The problem is a series of disagreements among the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.<sup>21</sup>  Mexico opposes a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue, arguing that it is not needed to achieve an FTAA by 2005 and that NAFTA should focus instead on granting real negotiating powers to the 11 technical work groups involved in the FTAA process.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Canada supports the U.S. proposal for a NAFTA-Mercosur dialogue but is reluctant to proceed without Mexico. The Canadians also oppose creating an FTAA as a pathway to NAFTA-Mercosur convergence by 2005. Instead, the Canadians favor replacing NAFTA and Mercosur with a new agreement negotiated simultaneously by all 34 democracies in the Western Hemisphere. Further complicating matters, enactment of the Helms-Burton Act has divided NAFTA, as Mexico and Canada are bitterly opposed to its implementation. As a result, the U.S. and Brazil announced in late August that an overdue report on the status of their ongoing bilateral trade review would be delayed. Several rounds of technical talks failed to achieve any breakthroughs on bilateral issues, such as improving the implementation of anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in both countries. In addition, the July 1996 deadline for holding the first formal meeting between NAFTA and Mercosur was missed.
<P>
<b>5. Define a pathway and timetable for creating the FTAA.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. should urge Western Hemispheric nations to decide quickly whether the FTAA should include commitments that go beyond those already made in NAFTA and the WTO or should be abandoned in favor of merely removing tariffs on goods traded within the region.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defining the timetable and pathway for the FTAA would advance the regional trade process in three ways: 1) It would focus the efforts of the 11 FTAA working groups set up to prepare for future negotiations; 2) it would help establish priorities for the FTAA agenda; and 3) it would help set a better stage for the difficult negotiations of the details of an FTAA agreement. The U.S., Canada, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Costa Rica at various times have supported an FTAA based on WTO-plus disciplines in which, by 2005 when the FTAA is scheduled to go into effect, all of the commitments and trading disciplines established under the WTO would be implemented. However, Brazil has forcefully opposed proposals for an FTAA that goes beyond the WTO.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A fast-track negotiating authority in hand before the third post-Summit of the Americas trade ministerial next year in Brazil would improve the prospects for faster trade liberalization based on NAFTA/WTO-plus trading disciplines. Without fast-track, U.S. hopes of accelerating and enriching the FTAA process may be stillborn at the Belo Horizonte trade ministerial in 1997.
<p>
<b>6. Implement reforms that do not require formal negotiations.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many unilateral actions that governments in the Western Hemisphere could take without engaging in formal state-to-state negotiations. Moreover, these reforms could yield swift benefits for both the U.S. and Latin America, since they would improve market access by injecting more transparency into the government rulemaking process and by dismantling tariff and non-tariff barriers to the faster and more efficient movement of goods, services, and capital throughout the region. For example, governments could simplify and harmonize rules and regulations relating to customs practices, sanitary standards, and technical barriers to trade. They also could pledge to avoid imposing new tariff and non-tariff barriers or raising existing barriers to the flow of goods, services, and investment within the region.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A third area in which governments should move quickly is revision of national investment laws to guarantee the right of establishment and national treatment of foreign investors, no restrictions on repatriation of profits and capital and access to convertible currency for all such transactions, protection against expropriation and compensation at fair market value in the event expropriation occurs, and phaseout of all performance requirements. Yet another area in which swift reforms are possible is the enactment of laws and policies that provide world-class protection for patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. Moreover, barriers to trade in services should be removed quickly, particularly in the areas of finance, telecommunications, and transportation. In addition, governments in Latin America should eliminate requirements and preferences in their purchase of goods and services, reduce market-distorting subsidies, and strengthen national competition laws.<sup>24</sup>  These reforms would accelerate the momentum of the FTAA process and yield tangible benefits in the form of faster trade growth and increased foreign direct investment flows in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<b>7. Establish separate negotiations on issues unrelated to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Both the expansion of NAFTA and U.S. leadership in the FTAA process have been undermined by the Clinton Administration's insistence on linking trade agreements to issues unrelated to free trade, such as labor standards and the environment. The Administration has threatened to impose trade sanctions against Colombia because President Ernesto Samper financed his 1994 election campaign in part with $6 million contributed by the Cali drug cartel. It also has delayed the implementation of a NAFTA obligation to allow Mexican trucks to circulate freely in the American Southwest, alleging concern about drug trafficking and U.S. national security.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
However, while hemispheric negotiations may be required to find common solutions to problems such as drug trafficking, illegal immigration, the environment, and labor standards, such pressure tactics work against U.S. interests in the region. Trade sanctions generally are not effective. Moreover, Latin American governments are unwilling to accommodate the Clinton Administration's demands for labor and environmental linkages to trade agreements; as a result, they will likely seek alternatives to NAFTA, such as Mercosur, SAFTA, the European Union, and Asian countries like Japan and Korea.
<p>
<b>8. Negotiate FTAs with New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many free traders believe that the pathways followed in creating the FTAA do not matter as long as a hemispheric free trade area is up and running by 2005. However, the recent breakup of the FTAA process into smaller regional trade agreements such as NAFTA and Mercosur is not a positive development. Smaller regional trade agreements may encourage increased trade and investment among the respective members of each group, but higher external tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade with countries that are not members of these groups hinder the efficient global movement of goods, services, and capital. The U.S. should refocus on multilateral trade liberalization and use regional free trade areas such as NAFTA to spur even larger trade zones. Negotiating bilateral NAFTA/WTO-plus trade agreements with Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore could energize the FTAA process, spur faster progress in APEC, and create momentum for merging the FTAA and APEC into a single free trade area.
<p>
<b>9. Convene a second Summit of the Americas in 1997.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A second Summit of the Americas should be convened in Chile in December 1997 to put the FTAA process back on a fast track to completion by 2005. However, before the second summit is held, the U.S. should renew fast-track, Chile should be included in NAFTA, and the CBI countries should be granted trading parity with NAFTA members. At this summit, the leaders of the hemisphere's democracies should agree on three things: 1) a specific pathway and timetable for achieving an FTAA; 2) creation of an institutional entity similar to the WTO to coordinate the FTAA negotiations; and 3) empowering the 11 technical working groups to negotiate firm FTAA proposals related to their respective areas of responsibility. In addition, APEC countries should be invited to participate as observers.
<p>
<b>10. Dismantle domestic U.S. barriers to free trade.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The greatest impediments to free trade and creation of the FTAA are found in Washington. For decades, the federal government has operated a vast and complex protectionist machine that has cost American taxpayers and consumers hundreds of billions of dollars. This protectionism comes in many forms, including traditional tariffs, quotas, "voluntary" restraint agreements, orderly marketing agreements, antidumping duties, countervailing duties, tax regulations, technology controls, anti-trust laws, and many other anti-trade weapons used against foreign exporters seeking greater access to the U.S. market as well as American firms and investors trying to compete globally.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of protecting American consumers, preserving jobs, strengthening American manufacturing, encouraging new technology development, and improving American competitiveness in the global economy, this protectionism weakens U.S. companies in the international marketplace, promotes investment in noncompetitive sectors, enshrines low-skilled workers, and hinders productivity growth. American consumers pay a high price for these misguided policies. For example, the Federal Reserve Bank has estimated that import-protection schemes amount to the equivalent of a 23 percent income tax surcharge for low-income American families, or 10 percent for the average family. The Federal Trade Commission has determined that it costs the U.S. economy nearly $90 for each dollar saved by protected American firms. Overall, congressionally mandated protection and managed trade policies cost American consumers at least $70 billion a year and encourage America's trading partners to retaliate in kind, especially in the areas of anti-dumping and countervailing duty legislation.<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1993, the Clinton Administration has preached the gospel of free trade in international forums such as the WTO, APEC, and the FTAA. In practice, however, the Administration's "strategic trade policies" have laid the foundations for even greater U.S. government protectionism and interference in the economy. For example, the Administration's National Export Strategy<sup>26</sup> and Big Emerging Markets (BEMs) Initiative<sup>27</sup> outline the twin pillars of an industrial policy and an expanded federal government role in the international marketplace. The basic premise of these strategies is that "U.S. firms will need the U.S. government at their side to win a fair hearing" in the global marketplace.<sup>28</sup>  According to President Clinton, the BEMs Initiative "streamlines Administration resources to focus on the markets in which government involvement can truly make a difference for America's businesses and workers."<sup>29</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Where trade policy is concerned, the Clinton Administration is making big government even bigger. The Administration has targeted domestic "clusters" of high-technology industries for export to key foreign markets where the U.S. government can help American firms secure market access, obtain financing, and win contracts for major projects in which foreign governments help competing bidders or play an important decisionmaking role in awarding projects.<sup>30</sup>  In addition, the Administration has established new divisions at the International Trade Administration and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to monitor and enforce foreign compliance with U.S. trade laws and agreements.<sup>31</sup>  The Administration also wants other trading nations to adopt a core set of labor principles as part of any future trade liberalization, and continues to insist that any new fast-track negotiating authority must contain strong negotiation provisions on both labor and the environment even though Latin American governments have strenuously opposed such linkages.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The U.S. has lost its once-respected leadership role in Latin America. The Clinton Administration turned its back on Latin America when the Mexican peso tumbled in December 1994. The expansion of NAFTA has stalled, and the U.S. no longer leads the FTAA process. Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton Administration and many in Congress are reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on a fast track. Instead, they are behaving as though the American economy ends at the Atlantic and Pacific continental shelves, with nothing beyond the continent but an economic void that threatens America.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
From 1980-1992, the Reagan and Bush Administrations forged the closest friendship with Latin America that the U.S. has ever enjoyed. However, it took the Clinton Administration less than three years to dissolve that exciting new relationship in acrimonious recriminations and unkept American promises. If the Administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
On May 20, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to extend unconditionally China's most-favored-nation trade status for another year. At the end of this month, Congress will vote on a resolution to revoke MFN trade status for the People's Republic of China. Legislation also may be proposed to make MFN status contingent on improvements in China's human rights conditions or its implementation of international commercial and security agreements.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

As Congress considers extending or revoking MFN status for China, it is important to focus on what MFN is and is not. A fundamental principle of the Bretton Woods trading system created at the end of World War II,<sup>1</sup> MFN was intended to protect the U.S. from protectionism. It is not a special privilege for any country, including China. Rather, it is the norm for trade between countries. Thus, revoking MFN for any country is the equivalent of imposing enormous punitive sanctions. But trade sanctions are not an effective tool for achieving such non-trade objectives as ending human rights abuses.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration's decision to extend MFN treatment is the right decision, but it should be only one element of a comprehensive strategy for dealing with China. This strategy should consist of a series of policies that directly protect or promote long-run U.S. interests in Asia, such as free access to markets or peace and stability. As important as having the right strategy is creating a constructive environment within which policies can operate. This environment has not been created by the Clinton Administration. The zig-zags in its China policy have undermined the credibility of its strategy and raised serious questions in the minds of friend and foe alike as to America's future role in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To protect its interests in peace and stability, freedom of the seas, and access to markets in Asia, the U.S. must create an environment that encourages China to integrate into the international system as a responsible member. Given its size and rate of growth, China is certain to have an enormous impact on the international system and American interests in Asia. For China to become a full participant in the international system and uphold international rules and norms, Chinese leaders must see that doing so will best serve China's interests. This can be accomplished only if Americans interact with, rather than isolate, China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 


To advance American interests in Asia, the President and Congress should:<ul>
<p><li>Renew China's MFN status. This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress.

<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> This gesture could help avoid future misunderstandings by directly communicating America's fundamental Asian interests and concerns at the highest level.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia.</b> Rather than confront China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement in China for granted.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> When China violates a U.S. law or international agreement, the U.S. should apply the penalty prescribed in that law or agreement. In other words, if China violates the Missile Control Technology Regime, the U.S. should coordinate its response with other MCTR members and apply the sanctions outlined in the law that ratified U.S. membership in that regime. The U.S. should not revoke MFN or impose sanctions that are not relevant to the specific broken law or agreement.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> This amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. Its primary target no longer exists, and its freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. </ul><p>


<b>AMERICA'S STRATEGIC INTERESTS AND MFN</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Over the past two centuries, the U.S. has sought consistently to protect three fundamental interests in Asia: 1) regional peace and stability, 2) freedom of navigation on the high seas, and 3) free access to the region's markets. These interests provide a firm foundation for a healthy and growing American economy. They also help promote a stable and secure world in which political and economic freedom, human rights, and democratic institutions can flourish. These interests allow the U.S. to maintain a system of healthy, cooperative, and politically vigorous relations with allies and friendly nations.<sup>2</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

MFN plays a fundamental role in advancing these enduring American interests in Asia. Most-favored-nation treatment is the normal tariff treatment that the United States provides to all but a handful of its trading partners.<sup>3</sup>  It is a principle which undergirds the open international trading system that the U.S. has labored for decades to expand, not merely a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China relationship that holds America's trade and economic interests around the globe hostage to the ups and downs of its political relationship with China. MFN has been, in fact, a key ingredient of America's global strategy since World War II. The purpose of this strategy has been to build a cooperative free-trade environment within which America's businesses and economy can prosper. It also has been to protect the United States and the world from reliving the tragic consequences of the isolationism and protectionism that plagued the 1930s.
<P>

<b>HISTORICAL ROOTS OF MFN STATUS FOR CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The U.S. first introduced the notion of most-favored-nation trade status into the U.S.-China relationship in the 19th century to ensure the survival of American commercial interests in Asia. After the Opium Wars of the mid-19th century, several foreign powers won concessions from China and sought to establish exclusive areas of influence along China's coast. American leaders considered these actions a threat to the U.S. interest in free access to the markets of Asia. In order to keep Britain, Germany, Japan, or China from excluding the U.S. from the Chinese market, the U.S. induced China to agree to an MFN provision in its treaty obligations with the U.S.<sup>4</sup>  This provision required that any future concession that the Chinese government granted to a third power would be extended simultaneously and automatically to the U.S. as well. MFN was not considered a tool by which America would realize the full potential of the enormous Chinese market. Rather, it was one means by which the U.S. could guarantee itself equal access to that market.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The United States extended MFN status to all of its trading partners as a matter of statutory policy in 1934. The scope of this policy narrowed as the Cold War intensified. Section 5 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 required President Truman to suspend the MFN status of the Soviet Union and all countries under the control of international communism. In accordance with this act, the President suspended China's most-favored-nation status on September 1, 1951, approximately two years after the establishment of the People's Republic of China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Trade Act of 1974 set forth new conditions for the restoration of MFN to "nonmarket economy" countries such as China.<sup>5</sup>  According to Title IV, in order to grant MFN status to China, the President must satisfy two conditions:
<ul> 

<p><li>Condition #1: A trade agreement that includes MFN for the U.S. Under Section 405 in Title IV of the 1974 Trade Act, in order to conclude a trade agreement with China, the President must first determine that any reductions in U.S. trade barriers are reciprocated by China. In other words, as the U.S. lowers tariffs on imports from China, China simultaneously will reduce tariffs on U.S. exports to China.

<p><li>Condition #2: Freedom of emigration. This second requirement is much more contentious. Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, was intended to pressure the Soviet Union to allow Jews to emigrate.<sup>6</sup>  Over time, this provision has become, albeit inadvertently, the legal basis for the current annual debate over renewal of China's MFN status. The Amendment calls on the President to deny MFN treatment to any nonmarket economy country which the President determines denies, seriously restricts, or burdens its citizens' right to emigrate. This freedom of emigration requirement can be waived annually, and it is around this annual waiver that the current debate over China's MFN status revolves.</ul>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

In the process of normalizing relations with the PRC, President Jimmy Carter in 1979 used presidential authority to conclude a three-year bilateral trade agreement with China in which China granted MFN status to the U.S. This satisfied the first requirement for granting MFN to a nonmarket economy country. The U.S. trade agreement with China, which entered into force on February 1, 1980, provides for automatic three-year extensions. Since China is subject to the conditions set forth in Section 405 of the 1974 Trade Act, however, these "automatic" extensions require the President to certify that China reciprocates reductions in U.S. trade barriers. Thus far, the trade agreement has been renewed five times.<sup>7</sup>
<P>


<b>MFN Procedures and China</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The  problem is that President Carter did not completely resolve the second requirement for extending MFN status to China. To grant MFN to China, the President must determine that China permits free and unrestricted emigration of its citizens or waive for 12 months the requirements for full compliance with Jackson-Vanik. President Carter in 1980 waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements for 12 months rather than certify China's full compliance with its freedom of emigration strictures. This has been done by every President since then. In every June since 1980, the President has had to decide whether or not to waive for another 12 months the freedom of emigration requirements in the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Moreover, each year after the President's decision has been made, Congress has had an opportunity to review the President's decision and to decide whether to vote on a resolution to discontinue MFN.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

According to the procedures outlined in Section 402 of the 1974 Trade Act, once the President has waived the Jackson-Vanik requirements, he must submit to Congress a recommendation for a 12-month extension of the waiver authority. This recommendation, along with the President's reasons for granting it, must be submitted to Congress during the final 30 days of the current waiver. The President's recommendation traditionally has been sent by June 3 of each year. Extension of the waiver authority is automatic unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted into law within 60 days after the expiration of the previous waiver authority, which typically is by the end of August. Although resolutions of disapproval have been considered by Congress, MFN treatment for China has continued uninterrupted since 1980 under annual renewal of the waiver.
<p>

<b>ISSUES ENTANGLED IN MFN DEBATE</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Automatic extension of the three-year U.S. trade agreement with China and the annual presidential waiver of Jackson-Vanik requirements went smoothly throughout the 1980s, as China embarked on massive and largely successful economic reforms. Market capitalism was introduced incrementally into the Chinese economy to improve efficiency and to hasten modernization. Many in China readily admitted the failures of socialism and looked to the West for new methods to improve living standards. President Ronald Reagan visited China in 1984 and declared the dawning of a new era of freedom for the Chinese people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

But this honeymoon in Sino-American relations came to an abrupt halt on June 4, 1989, when the People's Liberation Army used deadly force against the students and workers who had gathered in protest at Tiananmen Square. In response, President George Bush invoked a series of sanctions against China. These included restrictions on arms and munitions sales, military exchanges, transfer of dual-use technologies, and U.S. government financing for projects in China. The objective was to punish the government of China without unnecessarily injuring the people of China. This same rationale was advanced to explain the continuation of MFN status for China. Revoking MFN would have injured a wide range of people in China that the U.S. wanted to help, including economic reformers and entrepreneurs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

A majority in Congress, however, did not agree with the President's decision. Each year, from 1990-1992, Congress voted to disapprove extension of MFN status to China. President Bush repeatedly used his veto authority to defeat these congressional resolutions. Members of Congress argued that the U.S. should make China's leaders pay for their brutality and that it was immoral for Americans to seek profit under such circumstances. Every year, this "automatic" procedure has provided a forum for a well-orchestrated recitation of all the ills for which China's government is held responsible.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Four years ago, candidate Bill Clinton scolded President Bush for "coddling tyrants" and vowed to make the "butchers of Beijing" pay by attaching requirements for improved human rights conditions to the continuation of MFN for China. This was his intention when on May 28, 1993, President Clinton issued an executive order which continued China's unconditional MFN status for another year but attached new conditions to China's renewal in subsequent years.<sup>8</sup>  The executive order required China to halt exports of prison labor products to the U.S. and mandated that the Secretary of State determine whether China had made "significant progress" on human rights.<sup>9</sup>  After a year of strained diplomatic relations, President Clinton, despite his campaign threats, renewed China's MFN status on May 26, 1994. He did so without declaring that China had made significant progress in human rights protection, effectively de-linking human rights from trade issues.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Although human rights has been the most prominent rallying cry for those who wish to discontinue MFN for China, there are a number of other issues that give Americans cause for concern: China's military adventurism, proliferation of missiles and nuclear technology, piracy of intellectual property, and unbalanced trade. These concerns are legitimate and are being addressed in varying degrees through diplomacy. The danger in the political debate over China is that the U.S. will try to use MFN, one of the fundamental principles of international trade, as a policy tool to advance unrelated economic, political, and security interests.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Revoking China's MFN status clearly is not an effective way to advance these interests. Certainly, China's bullying of Taiwan with missile tests interfered with international air and sea lanes and had the potential to draw the U.S. into military conflict with the PRC.<sup>10</sup>  It also put at risk peace and stability in Asia as well as freedom of navigation -- two of the three historical U.S. interests in Asia. However, revoking MFN would do nothing to stop these provocative acts. Nor would it improve the prospects for peace and stability or freedom of navigation generally. But it would violate the U.S. interest in free access to markets and free trade. Thus, while revoking MFN will affect neither China's position on human rights nor its intimidation of Taiwan, it certainly will violate a vital U.S. economic interest.
<p>

<b>Policy Solutions That Fit Policy Problems</b>

<p><b>Human Rights.</b> Rather than revoke MFN, the U.S. should craft a policy that deals as directly as possible with the source of the problem. On human rights, for example, the U.S. has been following a pattern of publicly demonizing China's leaders and then trying to negotiate quietly with these leaders for release of high-profile political prisoners and changes in PRC law. The problem with this approach is that by threatening and demonizing the PRC government, the U.S. cuts off access to those whom Americans seek to help. This tactic does not leave Chinese leaders in the mood to find consensus on these issues, and by focusing attention on a few high-profile dissidents, the U.S. risks being viewed by the Chinese people as caring only for a few superstars while ignoring the interests of the many ordinary people.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way to address human rights concerns in China. The U.S. should create a positive public relationship with China's leaders while vigorously raising these legitimate moral concerns in private. To reach the people Americans seek to help, the U.S. could send more volunteers and supplies to provide direct assistance to China's orphans and poor. The U.S. also should seek to increase as much as possible people-to-people contact between the two countries, whether through business or education, to increase cross-fertilization of cultural values and understanding.

<p><b>Weapons Proliferation.</b> The U.S. intelligence community has reported Chinese sales of nuclear technology to Pakistan and nuclear capable missiles to Pakistan and Iran. The Administration is required to confirm these reports and to determine whether such transactions violate U.S. law and international agreements such as the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.<sup>11</sup>  If violations of U.S. law and international agreements are confirmed, the U.S. is obliged to invoke sanctions against China. While the Clinton Administration has threatened to impose sanctions, it has yet to determine officially whether actual violations have occurred. In addition, the threatened sanctions would only take funding away from American-run projects and would have little effect on China, as European and Japanese competitors would immediately fill the void.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The more effective approach to curbing China's proliferation problems is to work through the multilateral dispute resolution mechanisms within the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Unilateral enforcement of U.S. law, while justified if violations are confirmed, may not have the intended effect on China's behavior. Non-proliferation is an area in which cooperation with treaty partners and allies is not only critical, but also possible. A security threat is much more likely to produce international cooperation than is an economic or trade issue. Without the support of Europe and Japan, any sanction will quickly be undercut and rendered ineffective. Thus, to maximize the likelihood of success, it is important for the U.S. to have its allies' support in dealing with China, working as much as possible through the mechanisms built into international non-proliferation treaties and regimes. 

<p><b>Selling Pirated Goods.</b> With regard to intellectual property rights, officials in the U.S. software, motion picture, and computer industries have accused dozens of factories in China's southern Guangdong Province of illegally copying U.S. products and selling the pirated goods abroad. These officials estimate the damage to their industries in lost sales at $2.3 billion. In 1992, in 1995, and again in 1996, China signed agreements with the U.S. Trade Representative promising to crack down on these pirates. In May 1996, in an effort to motivate Chinese enforcement of its agreements, the U.S. Trade Representative threatened to impose sanctions totaling $2 billion on Chinese textile exports from Guangdong Province.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

Indirect sanctions on textile manufacturers in Guangdong Province, while consistent with the spirit of enforcing the rule of law, do not address the source of the problem. Many of these illegal compact disk producers are operated solely or jointly by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen, and some have ties to organized crime. Thus, the U.S. cannot hope to press China alone to deal effectively with this problem. Only a carefully planned, well organized cooperative effort by the PRC, ROC, Hong Kong, and U.S. governments can possibly be successful.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

There is a more effective way for the U.S. to address the piracy problem. If American companies can locate these illegal manufacturers, they should also be able to identify the shipping container in which the pirated goods are packaged for export. With the consent of PRC and Hong Kong officials, once the container is identified, port authorities in Hong Kong can locate and seize the pirated goods that are targeted for export markets. Seizing the goods would affect the perpetrators but very few others, unlike indirect sanctions which, like a swinging axe, harm many in the hope of punishing the guilty few. In addition, international markets serviced by Hong Kong's exporters are the appropriate target. China's own consumers lack sufficient computer and audio hardware to generate the sustained demand necessary to make these pirates profitable.

	Since MFN is so fundamental to U.S. global commercial strategy, there are several reasons why the U.S. should continue to extend it to China. Revoking MFN for China would:<ul>

<p><li><b>Harm American workers.</b> In 1995, the U.S. exported over $12 billion in goods and services to China. American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional American jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies. The loss of exports from the inevitable Chinese retaliation against MFN revocation would seriously threaten the employment of these Americans.

<p><li><b>Threaten U.S. business and investment.</b> The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated China that will require nearly $750 billion in new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies are poised to get the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment, with American jobs lost to overseas competitors.

<p><li><b>Jeopardize economic reform in China.</b> The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of 25 percent of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to open China's economy and society even more. MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but does it keep China open to influences and pressures from the outside world. It fosters the development of a middle class and a civil society that in the future will have the means and the will to demand more responsiveness from its government.

<p><li><b>Damage the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong.</b> The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong depends to a significant degree on investment and export production in China. The revocation of MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. Although this point is rarely discussed, billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by the recent tensions. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Threats of across-the-board tariff increases, MFN revocation, and boycotting of Chinese goods ignore the fact that many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by companies based in Hong Kong and Taiwan, both friends of the U.S.

<p><li><b>Not improve human rights conditions in China.</b> History shows that China oppresses its people far more during periods of isolation. This clearly was the case in the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. It is a process that does not lend itself to annual review. Nevertheless, Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this transition is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.

<p><li><b>Not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction.</b> China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its commitments to the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Non-Proliferation Treaty. The Administration must investigate these allegations and, if such sales have taken place, apply sanctions as required by U.S. law. The law, however, needs to be changed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be targeted specifically on the responsible Chinese enterprise rather than indiscriminately on all U.S.-financed projects in China as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further than the sanctions called for under current law, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial interaction with China. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan or criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to unstable regimes. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. In the area of non-proliferation, MFN is the wrong tool.

<p><li><b>Unnecessarily set the U.S. on the road to prolonged confrontation with China.</b> Abandoning MFN for China would make it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States to realize its policy objectives most effectively, Beijing should not be an enemy. If U.S. policymakers wish to see China behave in a way that is consistent with international norms and agreements, they should work for multilateral cooperation with allies rather than engage in ineffective bilateral browbeating. How best to promote China's integration into the international commercial and security system will be among the most important challenges for American foreign policy in the foreseeable future. It warrants more deliberation and care from the President, his administration, and Congress.

<p><li><b>Violate a U.S. interest in free trade and a more open China.</b> The term "MFN" is misleading and should be changed. "General trading status" (GTS) would be a good alternative. Together with national treatment, MFN is a fundamental principle by which the World Trade Organization operates. It is normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries -- North Korea, Cuba, Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam -- none of which has any substantial global trade. It is the foundation of basic international commercial relations, and in the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, commercial relations are now the foundation of U.S.-China relations. Revoking MFN means seriously undercutting America's relationship with China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

For more than a century, U.S. policy has aimed at free access to the markets of Asia. For over half a century, the U.S. has labored to build and strengthen the current liberal international system of trade. In addition to being consistent with these long-term U.S. interests, MFN trade status for China demonstrates American goodwill to the people of China, if not to the government, by extending the U.S. system of free enterprise to raise their living standards and increase their economic freedoms and choices.</ul>
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON RECORD ON CHINA</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	The President should never have threatened revocation of MFN over human rights concerns when neither he nor the country was prepared to pay the cost of such action. The Secretary of State, ignoring congressional and public interest, should not have assured Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui would not be granted entry into the United States only days before the visa was granted. Similarly, Administration officials should not have equivocated, delayed, and apologized for action taken in support of U.S. interests in Taiwan. Each of these blunders severely damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with China and created a negative bilateral environment that renders the correct policies ineffective.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

The Administration says one thing but does another. It has managed the relationship with China badly. The Chinese are told that the Administration is following a policy of engagement. Engagement, however, is not a policy; it is simply another word for diplomacy. The U.S. needs engagement -- and diplomacy -- with a purpose. The Clinton Administration now lacks such a purpose. The purpose of U.S. policy toward China should be to communicate to Chinese leaders that China's interests will be served best by integrating into the international system, observing its norms and standards, and pursuing peace and stability in Asia in ways that are commensurate with the interests of the U.S. and China's Asian neighbors.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

To deliver this message, President Clinton needs to meet personally with Chinese leaders. The President received Gerry Adams and Yasser Arafat in the White House, but forced the PRC head of state to meet instead in New York without the fanfare of a full state visit. This message is not lost on the Chinese leadership, and the mere promise of frequent high-level summits to take place in a second Clinton Administration, as proposed by Secretary of State Warren Christopher this May in New York, is little consolation. Frequent face-to-face interaction between the leaders of the United States and China at the highest levels is critical for the protection of American interests in Asia. This interaction should take place in both capitals and in a formal setting that reflects the importance the U.S. attaches to achieving these American interests through cooperation.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

This strategy is the best way to make progress on areas of concern to the United States. Americans frustrated with the lack of progress in China on human rights, missile proliferation, or intellectual property rights, instead of more promises, need a clear, consistent, and predictable China policy to avoid miscalculation in the Taiwan Strait and to make progress on these issues.

<p>
<b>TOWARD A CHINA POLICY THAT WORKS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	There is much that can be done to work more effectively toward American goals in Asia. China's cooperation in areas which do not conflict with its own interests will make U.S. efforts easier and less costly. There is little chance of charting a policy course that follows common interests without regular and consistent communication, at the highest levels, of what each county's objectives and vital interests are in bilateral and regional relations. To create an environment more conducive to an effective policy toward China, the U.S. should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Renew China's MFN status.</b> This is the right decision and should be supported by the Congress. MFN promotes the U.S. interest in free access to Asian markets and provides Americans with greater opportunity to act as an influence for good within China.
<p><li><b>Invite China's President Jiang Zemin to the White House for a full state visit.</b> There is little reason to think that China is fated to become an enemy of the United States. It could happen, but the chances are reduced by dealing directly with China and by maintaining American strength. This is a gesture that could demonstrate that the U.S. is truly "engaged" with a purpose.

<p><li><b>Follow a more broad-based strategy toward Asia</b> The U.S. should avoid putting too many eggs in the China market basket. Rather than confronting China directly, the U.S. should seek to expand investment and trade with India and Indonesia. Both countries are very populous, and both are seeking foreign investment to improve their infrastructure and sustain a high rate of economic growth. Knowing that the U.S. has credible alternatives to the China market, China's leaders will no longer be able to take American involvement as a given.

<p><li><b>Use policy tools better suited to the problem.</b> China must obey the rules of the road in international commerce and security. It is right for the U.S. to seek the enforcement of U.S. law and international agreements, but it should use the dispute resolution mechanisms built into the relevant international regime or apply the recourse outlined in the bilateral agreement or U.S. law that has been violated. The remedy should target as specifically as possible the source of the problem and not cut too broadly across the spectrum of competing American interests in China, Asia, or the world.

<p><li><b>Repeal or amend the Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the 1974 Trade Act is outdated. The Soviet Union, Jackson-Vanik's primary target, exists no more, and China is no longer dominated by international communism. It is even becoming difficult to say that China's is a nonmarket economy. In addition, the amendment's freedom of emigration requirements are inappropriate for China. If China were to permit or encourage free emigration, what countries would be prepared or willing to accept tens or hundreds of millions of Chinese migrants?  Certainly the U.S. would not be willing to accept them. The already strained U.S. immigration and welfare system would be overwhelmed by the vast numbers of Chinese people seeking greater opportunity in America.</ul>
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The question of whether to continue China's MFN status is once again before the Congress. As Members take this opportunity to assess U.S.-China relations, they should replace the mixed signals sent by the Clinton Administration with a consistent strategy for promoting America's long-term interests in Asia. Because of its size and rate of growth, China will have an enormous impact for good or for ill on U.S. interests. Therefore, it is prudent to improve the management of this critical relationship and to seek China's cooperation before forcing the American and Chinese people to pay the enormous security and economic costs of revoking MFN.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The MFN debate unfortunately is caught up in two mistaken beliefs: 1) that MFN is privileged treatment and 2) that revoking MFN would be an effective way to force a favorable change in China's behavior. These beliefs have no basis in reality. Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Moreover, discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China but would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. For these and many other reasons, most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<h3>CHINA: FRIEND OR ENEMY?</h3>

<b>By The Honorable Barbara Hackman Franklin</b>
<P>Barbara Hackman Franklin is the former U.S. Secretary of Commerce, and spoke at <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a>, on June 20, 1996.
<p>
	China has always held a special fascination for Westerners. This vast, populous country is thought by many to have the oldest culture on Earth. Certainly it was the center of Eastern civilization. China was already a sophisticated society when Marco Polo traveled there in the 14th century, bringing back such treasures as silk, tea, spices, noodles, fireworks, exquisite porcelain, jade, and wood block printing.
<p>	But our captivation with China has not translated into a smooth and predictable relationship over the past few centuries. To us, China has been alternately open, then closed, and then reopened again. The result is that we Americans do not understand China very well--its ancient roots, its history, its people, its way of life, political structure, or place in today's world. Nor do the Chinese understand us. To them, the West has seemed imperialistic and exploitive, caught up with colonial designs on their territory and disrespectful of China as a great nation.
<p>	But it is imperative--even urgent--that we learn to understand each other better. I believe the U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important--perhaps the most important--of all the bilateral strategic relationships in the world today and that we have reached a defining moment in that relationship.
<p>
<b>China's Place in the World Today</b>
<p>	Today, China is a country in transition. Much change is occurring, and it is occurring at a phenomenal pace.
	<p>This was brought home to me forcefully when President Bush sent me to China in December of 1992 to normalize commercial relations that had been disrupted with the imposition of sanctions on China after the crackdown at Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989. I was the first Cabinet Secretary to visit the country officially since that sad day, and my mission removed one of the sanctions--the one prohibiting ministerial contacts between our two governments. Together, my then counterpart, Minister of Foreign Economics and Trade Li Lanqing (now Vice Premier), and I reconvened the nearly moribund Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade. In addition, $1 billion worth of new contracts for U.S. companies were signed, and much additional business followed.
<p>	During this trip, I saw firsthand the hunger of the Chinese for prosperity, their intense desire to move quickly into the ranks of the world's strongest economies, and the fervor with which they were applying themselves to achieving this goal. Since that trip in December of 1992, I have been back to China regularly. Each time, I am struck again by the rapid progress the Chinese are making toward this objective.
<p>	Of course, the path of dramatic change is never smooth; semi-controlled chaos might be one way to describe it. Nor is such change always clearly discernible to those outside the country. But the outcome in China has tremendous significance for us in the United States, for the whole of Asia, and indeed for the rest of the world. There are many reasons why.<ul>
	<p><li>China is an emerging great power. It is the world's most populous country--1.2 billion people.
	<p><li>It is strategically positioned as the geographic center of Asia. China shares a border with 14 different countries. It has more common borders than any other country in the world.
	<p><li>China has the world's largest standing army, and it holds one of the seven permanent seats on the United Nations Security Council. This means that China has a voice in-- and a veto over--the decisions made by this organization.
	<p><li>Finally--and most importantly, given my view of the world today that economic concerns are primary drivers of global politics--we now have China's growing economic clout. China's economy is the fastest-growing large economy in the world. The World Bank already ranks China as the third-largest economy in the world behind the United States and Japan. Predictions are that China's economy will grow somewhere between 8 and 10 percent this year, and economists expect China's economy to continue growing at least 6 to 8 percent annually for the foreseeable future. That means China is well on the way to becoming the world's largest economy within the next 15 years.
	<p><li>China is the largest market in the world for aircraft, for telephones, for construction equipment, for agricultural products, and increasingly for consumer goods. The country needs virtually everything we produce and sell. And demand is growing rapidly. In cities like Shenzhen in the south of China, the first of the Special Economic Zones created by Deng Xiaoping's reform drive, one can stand on the street corner and feel the dynamism and the energy as the Chinese people build another Hong Kong. The same can be said for Shanghai, reportedly sporting nearly 25 percent of the world's cranes, or Tianjin or Zhuhai. The whirlwind pace of growth and change is awe-inspiring.</ul><p>
	Now for the flip side.<p>
	Despite the dynamic economic growth, GDP per capita in China is only about $300. Some parts of China, especially in the north and the west, have not yet been touched by the freedom of the Special Economic Zones and are still very poor. In contrast, GDP per capita is much greater--probably far higher than $300--for people living along the coast and in the south of China, where the change has been the greatest.
<p>
<b>China--A Place of Contradictions</b><p>
	China today is, in some ways, hard to describe. Contradictions abound, starting with the government's self-description of the country as a "socialist market economy." Such contradictions pop up constantly as the leadership tries to put a Communist rationale and a Chinese face on activities that would make Karl Marx turn over in his grave.
	<p>China today is not a police state like Stalin's Russia; nor is there the indiscriminate violence and intolerance of the Cultural Revolution. But neither is it a democracy. There is a ruling elite in Beijing, but the central government is no longer as powerful as it once was. The provinces are flexing their muscles, and some officials are candid about wanting "Beijing off our backs." Besides the greater economic freedoms in China today, there is greater mobility, the beginnings of better job opportunities, greater tolerance for and interest in education, and greater freedom of discussion.
<p>	China is governed by a collective leadership in Beijing. Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, is still alive but not active in governing. His hand-picked successor, President and General Secretary Jiang Zemin, seems to have consolidated his power for the near term. But his word is not law; he must gain consensus among the others in the collective leadership. That is sometimes difficult and makes for erratic reactions, arrogant posturing, slow decisions, or no decisions on occasion.
<p>	Some people seem to believe that when Deng finally passes away there will be a great skirmish for power. I think not. I think the post-Deng era has already begun and that the collective leadership will stay in place at least for awhile.
<p>	One indicator of the course China may take in the near future will come within the next year to 18 months. Premier Li Peng is due to move out of the premiership, according to Party rules, and the Party Congress will choose his replacement. Who the Congress chooses could be an important signal. Much jockeying is going on now behind the scenes. From the U.S. perspective, the best choice would be someone committed to reform and familiar with the United States to replace the more nationalistic Li Peng.
<p>	Longer term, the real questions are: Will the Communist Party continue to enjoy legitimacy among the populace? Will it continue to satisfy the growing appetite for prosperity? Will there be another paramount leader, such as Deng and Mao? Or will China have opened up too much for one person to be able to command so much respect and power? And if there is no paramount leader, will a collective leadership survive? If not, what form will the leadership structure take, and how will the leadership be chosen? Or will China regress? Will there be a leadership change by force? What role might the military play?
<p>	History is little help to us here. Despite the tendency of China to have "paramount leaders" throughout its long civilization, the paradigm has changed significantly, thanks to the new economic freedoms, the march of technology, instantaneous communication globally, and a more closely integrated world.
<p>	Within China, the central government and the provinces are attempting to deal with myriad problems and issues. They are working now with the Ninth Five Year Plan. This one stresses a number of goals, including strengthening China's agriculture and bringing prosperity to the rural economy; creating infrastructure and building basic industries to address such needs as water conservation, greater energy production, and reliable communications; promoting science and technology; reforming state enterprises; expanding education; and moving toward a rule of law.
<p>	A big concern is the migration of people from rural areas to the cities in search of prosperity with the attendant possibility of social unrest. There are potential shortages of water and of oil. There is corruption. There is pollution. And these are just a few of the challenges and obstacles confronting China's leadership today.
<p>	What happens in China will bear close watching. I believe the drive to free the economy may well be irreversible. The Chinese people want prosperity and material things. They want to get rich. Political freedom and democracy seem not to be at the top of most people's agendas--prosperity is. Perhaps as material needs are better met, the Chinese people's desires will change. We will just have to see.
	<p>However, I believe that the U.S. posture toward China and the tone of the U.S.-China governmental relationship can have an influence on which way things go. It will also help determine whether China is an ally, a belligerent friend, or an enemy.
<p>
<b>The U.S.-China Relationship</b><p>
	Our relationship with China is anchored on three communiques, signed between 1972 and 1982, and the Taiwan Relations Act that was passed in 1979. The 1972 communique--the Shanghai Communique--was agreed to by President Richard Nixon and Chairman Mao Zedong. This was when the "one China" policy was first articulated. It has been the bedrock of the United States' diplomatic posture toward China ever since.
<p>	Currently, the relationship between our two governments is at the lowest point it has been in many years. It is characterized by distrust and misunderstanding on both sides. Let's just review what has happened since the Clinton Administration took over management of this critical relationship.
<p>	After charging President Bush with "coddling dictators" during the 1992 campaign, candidate Clinton changed his tune once he became President. Following an entertaining spectacle of dithering and public hand-wringing of the sort that has characterized this Administration, President Clinton adopted the very same "engagement" policy espoused by President Bush. Funny how one's perspective changes after one becomes the leader of the free world, isn't it?
<p>	The problem with President Clinton's change of heart and new policy began when the Administration didn't follow it. Three years later, the policy has become so muddled by ad hoc decisions and inconsistent actions that it is hard to ascertain what it is. And because of the mixed signals sent by Clinton and his Cabinet, many Chinese now have come to believe that our policy is the "containment" of China--an idea they deeply resent.
	<p>The big turnaround on President Clinton's part occurred during the 1994 annual battle over renewing most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China. The President announced that he would certify MFN renewal without the conditions regarding human rights that he had attached the preceding year. His decision was correct on the merits; trade and human rights should not be linked. Punishing trade does nothing to correct human rights abuses. But because the Administration made this decision unilaterally, without first gaining concessions on other trade issues from the Chinese, the policy change actually created confusion and caused the Chinese to think they had "won," that the Clinton Administration had backed down in the face of business pressure, and that they did not have to do anything else to satisfy the U.S. on trade. In fact, the Administration did give China a big victory--and got nothing in return.
<p>	Currently, from the Chinese perspective, the greatest obstacle to improving relations between our two countries probably is the question of Taiwan. One of the biggest flaps over this issue was sparked by something that to many here seemed rather unimportant--the granting of a visa to Lee Teng-hui, the President of Taiwan, in June of last year so that he could attend a reunion at Cornell University.
<p>	Again, this situation was badly handled. After promises had been made to China that such a visa would not be issued, President Clinton apparently changed his mind (what a surprise). He reversed this decision, thus pulling the rug out from under his own Secretary of State, who had made assurances to his counterpart, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, that the visa would not be granted. Needless to say, Beijing reacted angrily and promptly recalled its ambassador. The decision to allow President Lee to visit the U.S. was interpreted by the Chinese as a violation of the spirit of the "one China" policy, and therefore an infringement on Chinese sovereignty. Sovereignty is a gut issue with the Chinese and has been ever since the "one China" policy was first articulated.
<p>	Another strain on the relationship was added earlier this year. Our country was incensed at the saber-rattling missile exercises and military maneuvers the Chinese  government carried out in the Taiwan Straits prior to the Taiwan elections. In response, the U.S. sent aircraft carriers to the region. Now, in the aftermath of the Taiwan election, tensions have been lowered, but some here in the United States are still distrustful of China's intentions toward Taiwan.
<p>Countless other examples could be cited to illustrate the inconsistency of U.S. policy, the mixed signals, and the escalating tensions which have characterized the Clinton Administration approach toward China. And although the two presidents have met on more than one occasion, they have not established anything that resembles a personal or a working relationship.
<p>
<b>Renewal of Most-Favored-Nation Trading Status-Again</b>
<p>	And now here we are again, debating the subject of most-favored-nation (MFN) renewal for China one more time. The annual discussion is under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974. The amendment denies MFN to any "non-market" economy which restricts free emigration unless the President makes the determination to waive the restrictions. This amendment was aimed originally at the USSR during the Cold War era. But in recent years, since Tiananmen Square, the annual MFN debate has become the vehicle through which a variety of discontents with China have been raised. This year is no different, except that the number of issues with China has increased.
<p>	The President has certified to Congress his desire to renew MFN without conditions. Senator Dole, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, has stated his strong pro-MFN position. The Republican leadership in Congress agrees. Now the action is with Congress, which has 60 days to debate and vote. Congress should concur with renewing MFN for China. Denying it or attaching unrelated conditions makes no sense.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the economic consequences would be profound. Denial of MFN would impede trade, raise tariffs, and make it more costly to do business in China. At least 170,000 U.S. manufacturing jobs were directly dependent on U.S. exports to China last year, and thousands of others in such areas as transportation and finance are indirectly linked. Denying MFN would slow China's reform progress as well.
	<p><li>Second, such action would send a negative message to the Asia-Pacific region, a place where some countries already are concerned that the United States is planning to withdraw despite the fact that our presence is viewed as critical to ensuring stability in that part of the world.
	<p><li>Third, denial of MFN to China would harm the economies of Hong Kong and Taiwan, the two largest investors in the mainland--and both places in which we have a considerable stake.
	<p><li>Finally, denial of MFN will not correct or erase any of the concerns we have with China, whether they be human rights, nuclear proliferation, anti-Taiwan saber-rattling, or something else. Seeking to punish China through this vehicle simply does not serve our national interest.</ul><p>
	Furthermore, I think the time has come, before MFN renewal comes up again next year, to make MFN for China permanent. After all, we accord permanent MFN status to most other countries, including some considered rogue states, such as Iraq and Libya. Our strategic and economic relationship with the world's most populous country is too important to continue engaging in an annual mud-wrestling event around this issue. Doing this means changing or repealing the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an action that should be high on the agenda of the President and Congress next year.
<p>
<b>Challenges</b><p>
	There are challenges to getting this done. Many people have serious and very real concerns about China.<ul>
	<p><li>First, the issue of human rights, which has cropped up every year since the crackdown at Tiananmen Square, raises everyone's sympathy and creates outrage among all of us who value personal liberty and freedom. All of us flinch at the reports about the detention of some dissidents, Chinese methods of population control, and allegedly poor treatment of children at orphanages. Needless to say, we disagree with the way in which China deals with many of these matters, but using trade as a weapon to try to force the Chinese into adopting more respect for human rights is not the way to make progress.
	<p><li>Second, nuclear proliferation looms as a major worry. Intelligence reports over the past few years--some apparently substantiated, some not--indicate that China has shipped missile technology and parts to Pakistan and Iran. Most recently, allegations that China shipped ring magnets to Pakistan caused some people to claim that China had violated the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1994. This act calls for mandatory sanctions once a finding of violation has been made. Specifically, this means that the U.S. Export-Import Bank could not make or guarantee any loans for projects in China. The Administration recently declined to make such a finding, in exchange for China's assurance that it would strictly observe its obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.
	<p>Once again, using trade as a weapon to address these concerns will not eliminate the problems. In addition, we have to question whether this sort of law punishes U.S. exports, and therefore U.S. jobs and well-being, more than it punishes the offending nation. This is a law which ought to be revised in the next Congress as well.
	<p><li>Third is the issue of intellectual property rights. A trade war was just averted on Monday by an 11th-hour finding by acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky that China had made substantial progress in complying with a 1995 agreement to protect intellectual property rights. The Administration had threatened sanctions if the Chinese did not take concrete steps to enforce the agreement; the Chinese had threatened to retaliate. So the good news is that we found that China had closed 15 factories that had been producing 30 to 50 million pirated CDs and videos yearly, shuttered six distribution centers, and instituted a ban on the importation of equipment needed to produce these products. The bad news is that this action does not solve the problem. It is a step in the right direction, but it is just a step and an incremental one at that. We are going to have to keep consistent pressure on the Chinese to continue making progress on the matter of safeguarding intellectual property rights until the rule of law is firmly established in China.
	<p><li>Fourth is another commercial dispute--our mounting trade deficit with China. The deficit, growing at nearly 20 percent annually in recent years, could reach nearly $40 billion this year. The worry is that China's market is still too closed and that U.S. jobs are disappearing to places around the world, like China, where labor is much cheaper.
	<p><li>Fifth is the question of Taiwan. Some Taiwan advocates want to punish China for the recent saber-rattling and for other things. Despite this--maybe even because of it--President Lee Teng-hui won handily, making Taiwan a shining example of economic freedom leading to political freedom. The United States does indeed have commitments to Taiwan, and we should honor them. But we need to be careful not to overstep and involve ourselves in the Beijing-Taipei debate when we have no reason to be there. It should be noted that the Independence Party candidate garnered barely 20 percent of the vote in the March election.
	<p><li>Then there is Hong Kong, which reverts to China on June 30 next year. How Beijing handles this situation will be viewed by many as a precursor to the way in which reunification with Taiwan, if it is to occur, would be handled. Already Beijing is making many people uneasy with such actions as announcing its intention to close down the Hong Kong Legislative Council and replace it with another body and issuing confusing statements about its intentions to respect freedom of the press in Hong Kong.
	<p><li>Finally, another strategic concern is the intentions of China's military. Some people also worry that U.S. products now sold in China could be diverted for military uses.</ul><p>
	Finding ways to deal with all of these very tough issues in a constructive manner is the challenge before us today.
	<p>One interesting obstacle to getting this done is posed by the fact that the majority of the American people are viewing China through an old stereotype. They either envision a Stalinist-type police state or think of peasants and water buffalo in rice paddies. Part of the challenge for those in China--and I believe there are many--who want to have a better relationship with the United States is to make Americans understand how China is changing and what the Chinese people want in their future.
<p>
<b>The Future</b><p>
	So where do we want our relationship with China to go from here? <p>
	Currently, the U.S. policy--or, more accurately, non-policy--is fraught with inconsistencies. This has led to confusion on the part of the Chinese about what we really mean. They, in turn, often behave in ways that we have difficulty understanding, and seem sometimes to be both arrogant and paranoid.
<p>	The business relationships, however, between the two countries are much more cordial and productive. That is good and it is hopeful.
<p>	However, the tension in the governmental relationship can and does negatively affect some commercial activity. Every time tensions increase, there are large projects which are held up. Some contracts U.S. firms hope to get go to other countries. The approval of licenses and branches, particularly in the financial services area, has slowed. All of this creates a climate of uncertainty and heightens the risk for American businesses.
<p>	There is one clear example of where Administration policy, which some think politically motivated in this election year, has hurt U.S. business prospects: the enormous Three Gorges Dam project, which the Chinese have been talking about for 50 years. Administration objections to this project on environmental grounds have caused the Export-Import Bank to announce that it will not help finance U.S. companies bidding on the project.
	<p>None of this helps our overall relationship with China. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Administration to get its act together and make every effort to improve the bilateral relationship. The President and the executive branch must do it. Congress has a say, but Congress is not empowered or equipped to manage foreign relations day to day.
<p>	Engagement with China is the right policy. But the policy must be more than just words. Consistent actions speak far louder than words.
<p>	What we urgently need is a strategic framework for our relationship. This does not mean that we are going to be soft on China. It does mean that we have to define a clear set of goals, objectives, and expectations for our relationship and clearly articulate this to the Chinese. And they must have the opportunity to do the same. This is what has been missing from our relationship for the past three-and-a-half years. We must have a meaningful dialogue at the highest levels in order to push for what we want to achieve.
<p>	In putting this framework in place, we should concentrate first on areas where we have common interests and some agreement. The commercial sector is a good place to start.
	<p>Currently, thousands of U.S. companies are doing business in China. That number has increased significantly between my mission in 1992 and now. U.S. companies have about $26 billion invested in China, making the United States the third-largest investor after Hong Kong and Taiwan. Eighty percent of this investment was made since 1992. And, of course, the U.S. has considerable investment in Hong Kong as well--$12 billion at last count. In fact, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong is the largest AmCham in the world.
<p>	The U.S. needs to work with the Chinese to bring about increased market access; to enforce intellectual property rights--a crucial issue for us; to reduce the overemphasis the Chinese government currently places on technology transfer and exporting by investor companies; and to help bring about a consistent rule of law.
<p>	The U.S. also needs to work with China to bring that country into the World Trade Organization (WTO) on reasonable terms. We need to help find a way around the current impasse: that China claims to be a developing country while we maintain she is not because of the clout associated with her sheer size. It is in our interest to have China join the WTO, on acceptable terms; that way, we could pursue our trade agenda multilaterally and would have added support for getting China to conform to the rules governing world trade.
<p>	Let me digress a moment and comment further on that. I think the Clinton Administration generally has been too unilateral in its approach to trade and often has been too knee-jerk confrontational in its style--a style which has not achieved results commensurate with its bluster. I suggest that we change our approach to trade negotiating. We should concentrate on a desired objective and then decide which tools and which negotiating style will best achieve the results we want. Talking tough to win political points at home is hardly a rational trade policy.
<p>	I also believe that the Chinese want a peaceful, stable world. Their primary objective right now is to industrialize and spread prosperity throughout their land. Wars and conflicts divert resources from this objective. Here is another area where I believe there is room for us to work with the Chinese, on non-proliferation concerns as well as on other strategic issues.
<p>	For other matters about which we have had disagreements in the past, we could look for items where we have a common interest and where we could agree. In those places where we cannot agree, we should still maintain a dialogue and make every effort to manage these problems.
<p>	Some predict the U.S. and China will become enemies over time. This is, of course, possible. But if it occurs, and I hope it does not, let us hope our policies--or lack thereof--do not contribute to such an outcome. Instead, our vision of the U.S.-China relationship ought to be rooted in making allies and friends of the Chinese. Withdrawing or doing nothing is simply not an option. An American presence is critical to maintaining a balance in Asia. Thus, the United States must remain engaged, both militarily and economically, in that part of the world.
<p>	We must keep in mind, too, that many in China are concerned about the deteriorating relationship with the U.S. Despite what we might think some days, the Chinese people admire America. They covet our products and much about our way of life. This is underscored by the fact that so many of them want to come here and send their children here to school.
<p>	Much work needs to be done to repair the U.S.-China relationship. The best way to promote progress is to stay engaged, to encourage China's economic reform and integration into the world community. To do this, we need to exercise the best diplomatic judgment and skills, to disagree with the Chinese when we must, be tough-minded when necessary, but do so in the context of fostering an important friendship. We need to encourage, cajole, and coax the Chinese forward instead of blustering, threatening, and shouting at them in public as the Clinton Administration has been doing. Above all, we need to treat our Chinese friends as we would any other friends: with dignity and fairness.
<p>	The road will not be easy. The Chinese, caught up in the process of great change, at times will be difficult. They will do things we do not agree with. We need to handle these matters in the context of our broader objective.
<p>	China has made astonishing progress in the past 17 years. If that progress toward economic reforms, prosperity, and a general opening up of the country continues for the next 17 years, China will indeed be perceived as a great power. The American people need to learn this. They must become better educated and more aware of what is going on in China today.
<p>	We cannot turn our back on the possibility of helping free markets and democracy along in China. If we are short-sighted and fail to adopt a long-term vision about our relationship, if we continue our current schizophrenic approach to China policy, who knows what direction change could take? The U.S. and the world cannot afford to take this risk.

<h3>LET THE U.S.-JAPAN SEMICONDUCTOR AGREEMENT EXPIRE </h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 277<br>
May 30, 1996<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p>

(Updating <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 805, "The U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement: Keeping Up the Managed    Trade Agenda," January 24, 1991.) 

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Clinton Administration and some Members of Congress argue that the decades old U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement has helped save America's ailing semiconductor industry and increase previously slumping sales in Japan. They are wrong. The semiconductor agreement, signed in 1986 by the Reagan Administration, nearly destroyed America's computer industry, forced higher prices on American consumers, and has had little to do with the U.S. industry's rebound in this crucial technology. The President and Congress should let this agreement expire as scheduled on July 31, 1996.

<p>
<b>The 1986 Agreement</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The United States and Japan agreed in 1986 to monitor foreign semiconductor market share in Japan. There were two reason for this. First, the U.S. industry complained that Japan was protecting its semiconductor market from foreign competition. Thus, they argued, the U.S. was not selling as many semiconductors in Japan as it could. Second, the U.S. industry argued that Japanese semiconductor manufacturers were selling these products in the U.S. at prices below their cost of production.1  The result was the 1986 trade agreement with Japan, which sought to monitor both the level of foreign semiconductor market share in Japan and the prices of Japanese semiconductors sold in the U.S. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Some supporters of the semiconductor agreement argue that it established a "guarantee" by which foreign semiconductor manufacturers are granted a 20 percent market share in Japan. If foreign market share falls below the 20 percent figure, the U.S. and others can impose trade sanctions on Japan. Yet the 1986 agreement makes no such guarantee. In fact, the market share number is based on a secret side letter that the Japanese government supposedly sent the U.S., stating that it would work to help American companies achieve higher market share in Japan. The U.S. treated the Japanese pledge as binding, but the Japanese were more ambiguous, preferring to make it in private. The Japanese government refuses to confirm the existence of this side letter.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Unsatisfied with America's slow progress on increasing market share in Japan, the Reagan Administration had imposed some $4 billion in penalties on the Japanese industry in the mid-1980s. Most of these penalties were suspended in 1986. The Reagan Administration, however, applied some $165 million in retaliatory duties to Japanese imports in 1987. The Japanese were compelled to raise prices for their semiconductors sold in the U.S. in order to avoid the imposition of special tariffs and duties resulting from U.S. antidumping investigations. As a result, Japanese computer chips cost American computer manufacturers 30 percent to 40 percent more in the late 1980s than before the agreement. Personal computer prices shot up drastically in the late 1980s, almost destroying America's competitiveness in this crucial high-tech product area.

<p>
<b>The 1991 Agreement</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
When the semiconductor agreement expired in 1991, it was clear that foreign market share had grown only marginally in Japan, from about 9 percent in 1986 to only 14 percent. Nevertheless, the Bush Administration sought to extend the agreement for five more years. This time, the strategy was different. Rather than focus on numerical targets and guaranteed market shares, the Administration backed off the claim that the 20 percent market share number was a guarantee which, if not met, could invoke sanctions. The Administration sought to include a reference to the 20 percent foreign market share figure, but both it and the Japanese government specified that this figure was not a guarantee. The 1991 agreement states:<blockquote>

	<p>The Government of Japan recognizes that the U.S. semiconductor industry expects that the foreign market share will grow to more than 20 percent of the Japanese market by the end of 1992 and considers that this can be realized. The two Governments agree that the above statements constitute neither a guarantee, a ceiling, nor a floor on the foreign market share.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Thus, the 1991 agreement should have removed any doubt that the 20 percent foreign market share figure was to be used as a benchmark in measuring the openness of the Japanese market to foreign semiconductors. Yet, despite the text in the negotiated agreement, both the U.S. government and U.S. semiconductor industry continued to focus almost exclusively on this number, leading many economists to call this a managed trade agreement. Even so, the agreement paved the way for U.S. and Japanese firms to enter joint ventures. Both the U.S. and Japanese agreed not to enforce strict antitrust laws which could stifle such relationships, and to sponsor meetings between U.S. and Japanese companies to arrange such relationships. These joint ventures were beginning to occur, even without the agreement, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They would continue to occur without the agreement. After the 1991 agreement, instead of promoting the use of numerical targets, the Bush Administration focused on private sector solutions. The foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market has increased from 14 percent in 1991 to more than 29 percent today.

<p>
<b>The Cause of U.S. Success </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The U.S. semiconductor industry is more competitive and prosperous today than it was before the U.S.-Japan agreement. It now is the world's largest producer of semiconductors. The question is: How much does this success have to do with the agreement, and how much is the result of market forces and the sound business decisions of private companies?  The answer is simple: America's renewed success in Japan has occurred because of private sector initiatives by U.S. and Japanese companies to work together, and despite the U.S. government's managed trade policies.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The 1991 agreement emphasized the use of "long-term relationships between Japanese semiconductor purchasers and foreign capital-affiliated producers, including joint product development with Japanese customers."  This statement gave rise to an avalanche of trans-Pacific strategic alliances or joint ventures between U.S. and Japanese semiconductor companies. Some of these alliances could have been challenged under America's antiquated antitrust laws. But the emphasis on joint ventures in the agreement eased the concerns of many U.S. companies seeking partnerships with Japanese firms. In 1991, for example, there were fewer than a dozen such partnerships between U.S. and Japanese companies. Three years later, in 1994, there were more than three dozen.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Located in Japan, many of these alliances gave U.S. firms direct access to Japan's complex distribution system, advanced manufacturing techniques, and new and innovative marketing techniques. Moreover, they allowed U.S. and Japanese firms to pool resources, thereby reducing the research and development costs of new and advanced semiconductor products, and helped U.S. firms gain access to the Japanese semiconductor market. U.S.-Japanese joint ventures and strategic alliances therefore are the principal reason not only for America's regaining its role as the largest producer of semiconductors in the world, but also for America's increased market share in Japan.

<p>
<b>Misguided Focus on Market Share </b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The semiconductor agreement is both a failure and an unwise policy. It is based on a fundamental misconception about trade: that because Country A's market share in Country B is significantly lower than Country A's global market share, Country B must have a closed market.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
This assumption is fallacious. Japan has 47 percent of the world market in semiconductors, excluding North America, but only 23 percent market share in semiconductors in North America. Japan also has 33 percent of the world market share in microprocessors, excluding North America, but only 6 percent share of the microprocessor market in North America. Few would argue that the North American (including the U.S.) semiconductor or microprocessor market is closed to Japan. American computer companies dominate the U.S. market because they are more competitive than the Japanese, not because the U.S. government protects them from competition.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
There is a danger that extending the semiconductor agreement could cause the U.S. to be held to the same standard of market openness as it expects of Japan. If other countries were to decide that America is closed, they could retaliate by imposing tariffs and duties on America's exports, further harming U.S. businesses and threatening American jobs. Under these circumstances, the U.S. would have no ground on which to stand against foreign retaliation.

<p>
<b>Objectives Fulfilled</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
Even if the semiconductor agreement's goal was to give foreigners a 20 percent share of the Japanese semiconductor market, as its supporters contend, this goal has been exceeded, thanks largely to U.S.-Japanese joint ventures and strategic alliances. Today the foreign market share for semiconductors in Japan is over 29 percent. Moreover, while total foreign sales of semiconductors in Japan in 1986 amounted to only $900 million, foreign sales today are worth over $6 billion -- a sevenfold increase.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
The Clinton Administration believes that the recent success of America's semiconductor industry is the result of the U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Agreement. It is not. The U.S. semiconductor industry is successful today because it sought joint ventures with Japanese firms which gave American companies access to the Japanese market, advanced manufacturing techniques, and reduced research and development costs. The semiconductor agreement sets a bad precedent by focusing on market share numbers. If other countries applied the same policy to the U.S., many of America's exports could faced increased tariffs abroad. The President should let the agreement expire.

<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<p><li>While the U.S. International Trade Commission found that many Japanese companies were selling their semiconductors in the U.S. at prices below their production costs, there is little evidence that this was done to undercut the prices of U.S. producers. Instead, it was more the result of intensive competition within Japan and a drop in demand for personal computers in the mid-1980s, which caused the prices for semiconductors to fall rapidly. In order to cut their losses, many Japanese semiconductor firms which had overproduced and had bulging inventories sought to cut their losses by quickly selling off their stockpiles of semiconductors.

<title>Eight Good Reasons to Continue MFN for China - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3>EIGHT GOOD REASONS TO CONTINUE MFN FOR CHINA</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 449<br>
April 30, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recent crisis in the Taiwan Strait has reignited the annual debate over whether to continue China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trade status. As the debate heats up, Washington policymakers should consider carefully the reasons why continuing MFN for China serves U.S. interests. While granting MFN status does not solve all of America's problems with China, revoking it causes more problems than it solves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are eight prinipal reasons why Congress should approve an extension of MFN status for China.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #1:</b> Revoking MFN will harm those America wants to help. Discontinuing MFN status for China would harm U.S. workers. The U.S. exported over $12 billion of goods and services to China in 1995, and American trade with China supports over 200,000 high-wage American jobs, as well as tens of thousands of additional jobs in U.S. ports, retail establishments, and consumer goods companies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #2:</b> Revoking MFN would threaten U.S. business and investment. The International Monetary Fund estimates that China is now the world's third-largest economy after the United States and Japan, and could emerge as the world's largest economy in the 21st century. The World Bank has calculated that China will require nearly $750 billion in new investments to fund new industrial infrastructure over the next decade. China needs new aircraft, power generators, telecommunications, computers, and other high-skill, high-wage technologies that must be supplied from overseas. American companies should be getting the contracts to build these projects. Continued American leadership in these key technology sectors is vital to sustaining long-term U.S. economic growth and creating high-wage, high-skill American jobs. If MFN is revoked, China's needs will be filled by Japanese and European business and investment. The result will be American jobs lost to competitors overseas.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #3:</b> Revoking MFN would jeopardize economic reform in China. The last 15 years of economic reform in China have increased economic freedom and improved the livelihood of one quarter of the world's population. American companies operating in China have contributed to a significant expansion of economic freedom and choice for the Chinese people. The U.S. must build on this foundation to encourage the further opening of China's economy and society. To be sure, MFN will not guarantee the rise of democracy in China, but at least it keeps China open to influences and pressures from the outside world.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #4:</b> Revoking MFN would harm the economies of Taiwan and Hong Kong. The prosperity of both Taiwan and Hong Kong is heavily dependent on investment and export production in China. Abandoning MFN would cut Hong Kong's economic growth in half. It also would harm Taiwan's economy. Billions of dollars in Taiwanese investment and labor-intensive industries have moved to the mainland, unabated by current tensions with China. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle depends are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the United States and other markets. Many of the goods marked "Made in China" actually are produced by countries the U.S. seeks to support -- Hong Kong and Taiwan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #5:</b> Revoking MFN will not improve human rights conditions in China. History shows that China is far more oppressive against its people when isolated from the outside world. This was clearly the case during the Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. Human rights improvement is a long-term process that requires U.S. attention, but also U.S. patience. Taiwan's success in improving the economic and political well-being of its citizens demonstrates that this is both possible and desirable in a Chinese society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #6:</b> Revoking MFN will not encourage China to adhere to international limitations on transfers of nuclear technology or weapons of mass destruction. China should answer the charges that it is supplying Pakistan with key nuclear and missile components in violation of its obligations under the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The MTCR monitors and controls missile components and capabilities, while the NPT is a framework for control and reduction of nuclear weapons. In the past, China has shown its displeasure with America's overtures to Taiwan and criticism of China's human rights record by selling dangerous technology to such unstable regimes as those in Pakistan and Iran. Revoking MFN could generate another series of sales. The U.S. must investigate the recent allegations of missile sales to Pakistan, and it has every right to ask China to explain itself. If such sales have taken place, American law dictates that technology and commercial sanctions be imposed. These sanctions, if not waived by the President, should be specific and targeted on the responsible Chinese enterprise, to avoid jeopardizing unrelated U.S. activities in China, rather than targeted on all U.S.-financed projects in China, as the law requires. Revoking MFN would go even further, adversely affecting all U.S. commercial transaction with China. In this area, MFN is simply the wrong tool.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #7:</b> MFN is not special treatment. MFN trade status is a fundamental principle on which the World Trade Organization operates. The WTO is the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. MFN is the normal trade status granted to all but a handful of countries. In the absence of the Cold War strategic framework, it is the foundation of basic international commercial relations. Discontinuing MFN to China is tantamount to imposing trade sanctions on China. Such sanctions should be imposed only when a country poses a special threat to American security. As difficult as China now is, it does not present such a threat.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Reason #8:</b> Revoking MFN would set the U.S. on the road to confrontation with China. Abandoning MFN for China would lead to Beijing's isolation, making it less likely that China would integrate into the international system in a way that is favorable to U.S. interests. For the United States and its allies to deal effectively with nuclear weapons proliferation, unfair trade practices, and human rights violations, China must be engaged, not an enemy.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Even though the U.S. should continue MFN trade status for China, however, it should not ignore Beijing's recent bellicose actions against Taiwan. To demonstrate displeasure with Beijing's missile diplomacy against Taiwan, and to reward Taiwan once it meets economic criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization, the U.S. should expedite Taiwan's bid to join the WTO ahead of the PRC. In the past, China has insisted that the PRC should accede to the WTO ahead of, or at the same time as, Taiwan. The U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for Taiwan's entry into the WTO, even in the face of China's determined opposition.
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Conditioning or revoking MFN under current circumstances would eliminate any possibility of cooperation from Beijing, rendering the U.S. less effective in its efforts to limit transfers of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, correct unfair trade practices, and foster development of the rule of law in Asia. Discontinuing MFN would not improve social and commercial conditions in China, but it would come at great cost to Americans and their friends in Hong Kong and Taiwan. For the U.S., revoking or conditioning MFN gains too little and risks too much. Most-favored-nation trade status for China should be renewed unconditionally.

<h3>Beyond Rhetoric: A Renewed U.S. Commitment To Hemispheric Free Trade</h3>

By Cresencio Arcos<br>
April 8, 1996

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the Italian adventurer Amerigo Vespucci landed on the eastern coast of South America, he never could have imagined that the entire Hemisphere one day would carry his name. Nor could he have envisioned what we see today -- that after 500 years of starkly different histories among its many nations, the Hemisphere finally may be finding a common future. There is, however, no guarantee that Vespucci's Americas will realize their full potential. In fact, it is more accurate to say there are far more roadblocks ahead of us than those we have already cleared away. History may well look back on the '90s in the Americas as a decade of opportunities lost. I strongly hope this is not the case, but recent events do not engender confidence that we are well on the road to a robust commercial and economic integration of the Americas. 

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

This is all the more frustrating given that the U.S. has the power and the influence, if it wishes to use them, to be a force for positive change in the Americas. Our market dwarfs all others in the Hemisphere, and is arguably more open than any other country's, with perhaps the exception of Chile's in some areas. This huge U.S. market is extremely attractive to Latin American countries and can give us enormous leverage in opening markets in the region. However, we are on the verge of losing this strategic advantage by shirking our role as the natural leader in promoting economic liberalization.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It does not have to be this way. There is still time for the U.S. to alter its course and reassert itself. But in order for us to do that, we must take an honest look at what has gone wrong and how to fix it. First, a look at what has gone wrong. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Contrary to the many accounts that the vision of the Summit of the Americas (in reference to the Hemispheric Summit in Miami in 1994) is being fulfilled, the Hemispheric trade agenda is in a holding pattern. That nothing of tremendous substance came out of the Cartagena meetings should be of no surprise. In fact, that they even agreed to meet again next year to continue the dialogue should give us great cause to celebrate. There are several reasons why the Hemispheric trade agenda at this moment appears to be a rudderless ship, being pulled here and there by the daily tides: the peso crisis in Mexico, election year politics in the U.S., and the increased influence of Brazil in promoting a Hemispheric trade regime different from the NAFTA.
<p>
<b>U.S. RETREAT AFTER NAFTA</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Coming off an all-time high from the negotiation and passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, we perhaps overlooked the fact that there would be bumps in the road and occasional setbacks. So when the peso crisis hit Mexico in December 1994, the free trade opponents like Ross Perot and Pat Buchanan said it only showed that they were right all along -- Mexico was just waiting to trick the U.S. into signing the NAFTA so it could devalue the peso and flood the U.S. with Mexican goods. Of course, it didn't show that at all. In fact, without a NAFTA the U.S. would have seen its exports to Mexico drop by over 50 percent, like it did in 1982 when Mexico devalued, instead of the 17 percent drop we experienced last year. But the Perot/Buchanan accusations were superficially appealing, and so they stuck, and politicians in the U.S. began to worry about coming out too strongly in favor of trade in the Americas. Then the economic situation in Mexico deteriorated rapidly and the U.S. came to their aid as the leader of a $48 billion loan guarantee package. This had the unintended consequence of splitting the free trade coalition in Congress (many of the supporters of the NAFTA were opposed to the loan guarantees), and placing the Clinton Administration in the unenviable position of defending the loan guarantees during an election year in which the vast majority of Americans opposed the loan package. From that time forward it was apparent that we would see little if any action from Congress or the White House to advance the FTAA until after the elections, in 1997. When the election cycle kicked into high gear several months ago, it became even more apparent that free trade would be under attack when Pat Buchanan made trade the focus of his political campaign. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

With the U.S. stepping back, a political vacuum was created in the Hemisphere. This vacuum has now been partially filled by the ascendance of the Brazilians, who favor a "go slow" approach to an FTAA. They believe that NAFTA-styled free trade would hurt Latin American countries, and instead have proposed a South American free trade agreement first, which would then be able to negotiate with the U.S. on much more so-called favorable terms. I say so-called favorable, because that type of a trading regime most likely would not be favorable to U.S. businesses, nor do I believe it would be favorable to South American economies in the long run. It would, however, most likely be favorable to the economic interests of the status quo that I will describe later.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, as much as I am worried about the Brazilian initiative, I am far more troubled by the lack of U.S. leadership. After all, we are the ones holding most of the cards, and we cannot blame the Brazilians for pursuing their own interests once we have stepped back from the table. And although U.S. retrenchment may be understandable given our domestic political situation, we must realize this carries a price: namely, that Latin American countries will not unilaterally open their markets without reciprocity from the U.S. Ironically, the "opening" the U.S. needs to make is rather minor, given our already low tariffs and non-tariff barriers. But without providing a secure market for Latin American goods under a NAFTA-styled trade agreement, we will not be able to wrest political concessions from our Hemispheric trading partners. Why?  Because the commercial status quo is so hard to change. We only need to look at our own textile or agricultural industry to be convinced of that. 
<p>
<b>THE POLITICAL NATURE OF TRADE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Let's be honest, free trade is not good for everyone. It is not good for monopolies and it is not good for those seeking special favors or protections through government laws or regulators. Just to give you one example from my own industry. Up until just a few years ago, most local, long distance, and international telephone services in foreign countries were owned by government monopolies. In several countries in Latin America that still is the case. These monopolies produce poor service at high prices and reap windfall profits for doing so. In contrast, in Chile today telecommunications service is good, prices are down, and competition flourishes. In Argentina, competition in local service has also increased service, while its monopoly service for international long distance continues to keep prices well above market rates. So why don't the other Latin American countries quickly adopt the Chilean model?  Because there is more money to be made, and more political interests to be protected, by keeping things as they are. This rule works in Argentina and Mexico just like it works here in the U.S. In other words, although global competition may encourage market liberalization, the decision to open markets or keep them closed ultimately is a political one.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is neither good nor bad that market liberalization depends on politics. It is only bad when we fail to realize trade in this political context, and then wonder why our policies are ineffective. In other words, leaders in Latin America cannot place some of their protected industries in jeopardy under a free trade pact unless they can at the same time provide their competitive industries with access to our markets. The same political dynamic applied to President Clinton and Bob Dole when they sought passage of NAFTA. So if our agenda to create an FTAA by 2005 is seen in Latin America as harming more political and commercial interests than it helps, it will most likely be unacceptable. This is what is happening now. As Latin American politicians have come to believe we will not provide them the political cover they need -- consistent entry into the world's largest market through accession to NAFTA -- they have either postponed or withdrawn plans to make concessions to open their markets to our products and businesses.
<p>
<b>FOUR KEY AREAS OF U.S. TRADE POLICY </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Assuming we can once again commit ourselves to this agenda, there are four areas on which we need to focus our efforts as we attempt to create an FTAA. They are: 1) intellectual property rights, 2) procurement, 3) competition policy, and 4) services, and a fifth issue that covers all of them -- transparency. Let me describe the challenges we at AT&T and U.S. businesses face in each area. 
<p>
<b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Although most of the debate of IPR has centered on the pharmaceutical company, there is much more at stake. Lax or nonexistent enforcement of intellectual property rights robs U.S. businesses of billions of dollars worldwide. The growing U.S. software and entertainment industries and what could be termed its emerging "information-based" industries are not protected in many Latin American countries. Although some Latin American countries believe they are benefiting from this lax enforcement, they are undermining a respect for property rights in general, and that will ultimately undermine the growth of their own nascent technology-based industries.
<p>
<b>Procurement</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Procurement of government services plays a much larger role in Latin American economies than it does in the U.S., with some Latin American governments controlling directly or indirectly the majority of the spending power in the country. And although the issue of procurement in the trade arena has generally dealt with how government contracts would be awarded, the telecommunications industry is particularly interested in a broader definition. The telecommunications industry is such a highly regulated field that its very existence depends on a clear and concise regulatory regime in the awarding of government contracts -- that is, in the awarding of concessions for the right to provide a wide range of telecommunications services. Our trade negotiators must attempt to remove any barriers that would prevent U.S. businesses from getting a fair chance in bidding on these "contracts." 
<p>
<b>Services</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The services industry in the U.S. employs far more workers than any other sector of the economy. And a larger percentage of our exports are now in services. Over 20 percent of exports to Latin America are in services, and that number would be much higher if we were provided all the protections our industries are provided here in the U.S. In Latin America many services industries, like telecommunications and financial services, still are considered "strategic," and as such are controlled by the government. In many Latin American countries, foreign investment is limited to a minority stake. For example, Brazil is liberalizing its telecommunications industry by allowing competition in cellular phone services. However, it is limiting foreign investment in those projects to 49 percent. If it maintains that restriction, it will limit the ability of AT&T and other U.S. companies to invest; but it will also limit the ability of the Brazilians to have the most advanced and well capitalized telecommunications system available. Lifting all restrictions on foreign investment would truly be a win/win proposition for both parties. A Brazilian official recently mentioned that his government might change this limitation. This is encouraging, and we hope the changes are made, but the U.S. would be in a much better position to influence the outcome if it were actively engaged in the process. 
<p>
<b>Competition Policy</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Competition policy is perhaps the most important area of interest. It was finally included as a legitimate subject of inquiry at Cartagena, when a working group was formed to study its implications. Broadly defined, competition policy is a set of principles that will foster competition at the local as well as international level. One of those principles is the creation and protection of long-term property rights, including contract rights. This requires a judicial process where contracts are respected and enforced. Contracts that extend beyond a five-year period are rare in Latin America, and you will hardly ever find contracts beyond ten years. This is mainly because businesses and people in the region have little confidence that their governments will respect property rights over the long term. In the case of AT&T, we have had an ongoing problem with contractual obligations we have entered into with various government or private sector monopoly phone companies. In international telecommunications, calls traditionally have been delivered by international carriers, like AT&T, which must hand off telephone traffic to the monopoly carrier in the foreign country. The payments regime for these "hand-offs" is known as the accounting rates process. Historically, accounting rates have not reflected market rates, with monopoly foreign carriers reaping windfall profits. AT&T and other U.S. foreign carriers are in the process of renegotiating contracts with these foreign carriers to get these rates down, but many of these carriers use their monopoly position to violate their contract rights or discriminate against U.S. carriers in violation of prior agreements. We should include strong provisions for the respect for property rights and the adjudication of property rights disputes in any trade agreement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Another aspect of competition policy deals with the elimination of monopolies. In the case of accounting rates, monopoly carriers have the power to reduce the profitability of AT&T and other U.S. carriers, and thus the ability of our companies to create wealth and jobs here in America. Monopoly foreign telecommunications carriers also raise the prices for U.S. customers who end up subsidizing the programs of the foreign monopolies, such as lower domestic rates in the foreign country. The result is often poor quality and limited services for both U.S. and Latin American customers. U.S. carriers must pay hundreds of millions of dollars annually in settlement payments to these Latin American carriers, with few benefits flowing to the customer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As liberalization occurs in Latin America, competition policy will play an even larger role as the regulatory issues become more complicated and subtle. The telecommunications industry is a perfect example of this. As foreign governments allow competition in international long distance, the big issue now is how will the costs for interconnection into the local network be decided. In Mexico, we see this very process going on today. AT&T and the other international carriers are preparing to enter the Mexican long distance market. We are asking to interconnect with the local monopoly at what we believe is a cost-based rate. However, there is a great disparity between what the long distance carriers believe is a cost-based rate and the current position of the telephone monopoly. We obviously don't agree on what the rate should be at this time, but that is why competition policy becomes so important. As markets are liberalized, businesses become ever more susceptible to market pricing, and so our cost structure must realistically reflect what the market demands. AT&T CEO Bob Allen has taken some harsh criticism recently about his decision to lay off thousands of workers in what people are describing as heartless and unnecessary. But as economist and <I>Washington Post</I> writer James Glassman said recently, AT&T must change because it cannot survive with its old monopolistic structure -- it is no longer a monopoly. We fight for market share on a daily basis against companies like MCI and Sprint that continue to grow. As competition in telecommunications increased here in the U.S., it became imperative to operate the company on a cost-based structure. In fact, critics five years from now may well say the restructuring was not radical enough. Consequently, since most U.S. businesses work under these exacting conditions of the market, we must insist that equal competition exists in the countries with which we will be trading under an FTAA. So our trade negotiators must insist on including mechanisms in any future FTAA
 that will limit the discretion of governments to impose political criteria on what needs to be a cost-based, market-driven process. In this particular case, that would mean establishing a clear set of rules and standards for cost-based interconnection fees. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To show how active U.S. engagement can make a difference in this particular area, we can look to Mexico. Because of our close relationship with Mexico through NAFTA, Mexico has recently announced it will follow an FCC-styled bidding process for the allocation of PCS services throughout Mexico. This process establishes a clear set of rules and procedures for bidding, and requires an open process.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There is one other area that tends to influence all commercial activities in Latin America, but does not clearly fit into any of the categories above. That is the issue of transparency. Until all government decisions are open to public scrutiny there will always be room for corruption and behind-the-scenes deals. This environment may help a select few businesses with the right connections, but it harms the economy overall and it is extremely inefficient because it injects uncertainty into the commercial transaction. This way of doing business has serious costs for U.S. businesses. The Department of Commerce recently concluded that since 1994 there have been over 100 instances of foreign firms using bribery to undercut U.S. firms' efforts to win international contracts worth roughly $45 billion. Foreign firms that bribe win bids approximately 80 percent of the time. U.S. trade negotiators must establish clear and concise rules of commercial conduct when governments are involved, and we must insist on opening up the process to public scrutiny. 
<p>
<b>REVIVING THE TRADE AGENDA</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So how do we bring about these very difficult changes in Latin America?  We do it through active and aggressive engagement. We do it by showing the American people why we need Hemispheric free trade to remain internationally competitive. We do it by showing how free trade can be a win/win for those who are not seeking special favors from governments. We don't do it by folding our hands and talking a good line about how everyone wins under free trade. We don't do it by failing to reward those countries, like Chile, that have done their utmost to open their markets. Chile is the crown jewel of Latin America. Many sectors of its economy are more open than ours. Its international telecommunications industry is so competitive, there have been times this year when it was cheaper to call from New York to Santiago, than from New York to Los Angeles. It has a strong democracy and a flourishing middle class. What kind of message do we send to the rest of Latin America when we fail to even engage Chile in negotiations? 
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

What happened in Cartagena was inevitable given the direction of our current trade policy. But that direction can be altered with sufficient political will. One thing is certain. Good intentions by the U.S. are not enough. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

I met with Commerce Secretary Ron Brown in Nicaragua last week. I believe he is committed to free trade in the Americas, as is U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, but personal commitment is not enough. The forces against Hemispheric integration are simply too strong. And much more is at stake here than Hemispheric integration. U.S. global leadership rests on our ability to create a trading model at home, that we can then export to the rest of the world. Imagine how much more influence we would have with our Asian trading partners if we had just concluded a Hemisphere-wide, comprehensive, NAFTA-style FTAA?  The benefits would be enormous for U.S. businesses and the world economy as a whole.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But the reality today is that our trade agenda is still in a holding pattern. I sincerely hope we can remove the obstacles from the runway before we run out of gas.

<title>How to Bring China and Taiwan Into the World Trade Organization -- Heritage</title>

<h3>HOW TO BRING CHINA AND TAIWAN INTO THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION</h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Both the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) have applied to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), the multilateral organization that sets the rules for international trade. Taiwan has made substantial progress in its accession negotiations. Although several important economic issues remain, the most significant obstacle to Taiwan's membership in the WTO is not economic, but political. China insists that Taiwan should not join the WTO before China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. prefers that China and Taiwan become members of the WTO simultaneously. Simultaneous accession is, of course, the best possible outcome, but China is not as far along as Taiwan in meeting the criteria for membership. The U.S. should not let China's political sensitivities over Taiwan's membership slow U.S. negotiations with Taiwan. Once Taiwan meets the requisite economic criteria for WTO accession, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwan's membership, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Indeed, a clear signal to Taipei that the U.S. is willing to exercise such leadership could encourage Taiwan to meet the economic criteria for membership. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also needs to clarify its position toward the PRC's prospective membership in the WTO. China wants to join for economic and political reasons. It wants not only the benefits of trade, but also the political recognition of its status as a world economic power and its primacy over Taiwan. In contrast, the European Union (EU), Japan, and the United States insist that WTO membership is a commercial contract, not an act of political recognition.<sup>1</sup>  Along with the Europeans and the Japanese, the Clinton Administration correctly insists that China can join the WTO only on "commercially viable terms."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Substantial disagreements remain over the terms of China's accession. In particular, China disagrees with the EU, Japan, and the U.S. on the size and scope of tariff reductions; when China's export-import licensing scheme, known as trading rights, should be abolished; how China's investment and industrial policies should be brought in line with international agreements; whether China should accede to the WTO as a developed or developing country; and what safeguards should be available to limit import surges while the WTO accession agreement is being implemented.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China's desire to join the WTO is an opportunity for the U.S. In addition to ensuring that China meets certain economic standards before acceding to the WTO, the U.S. could offer Beijing permanent, unconditional most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status in exchange not only for economic concessions, but also for dropping its political demands on Taiwan with regard to the WTO. It is in America's interest that membership in the WTO, both for China and for Taiwan, be treated as an economic question.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To further American economic interests, President Bill Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li> Support Taiwan's accession to the WTO after it meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues. Taiwan's accession should not be held hostage to demands by the PRC.
<p>
<li> Work closely with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms. In the face of a unified position on the part of the world's major trading nations, Beijing will be more likely to make economic concessions.
<p>
<li> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions. The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Allowing the President to trade unconditional, permanent MFN status, which Beijing would value highly, for concessions on Taiwan's membership in the WTO and on economic issues benefitting the U.S.would increase America's negotiating leverage with China.

</ul><p>
<b>FROM GATT TO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both China and Taiwan want to join the World Trade Organization because membership facilitates trade and enhances economic growth. Superseding the General Agreement Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the WTO establishes the legal framework for international trade. It also is the international organization which administers such multilateral agreements as GATT, the General Agreement on Trade in Services, and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The WTO requires that member states and territories adhere to certain trade rules. Each member must apply the same tariffs and trade regulations to goods and services from all other members. This is known as the most-favored-nation (MFN) principle.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, members may not discriminate against imported goods in favor of "like" domestically made products. This is known as the national treatment principle. All WTO-related trade agreements are based on these two fundamental principles.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The World Trade Organization is a direct descendent of the International Trade Organization (ITO), which allied leaders attempted to create at the end of World War II. The ITO was intended to prevent a recurrence of protectionism and to set the rules for international trade in the post-war era. In 1946-1947, President Harry Truman negotiated an "interim" agreement, the GATT, with other countries to reduce tariffs and establish a legal framework for international trade.<sup>3</sup>  The GATT was not intended to be a permanent organization, but a temporary instrument of the ITO. However, because the U.S. Senate failed to ratify the ITO charter, the ITO died stillborn in 1950, leaving the GATT forced to function as the world's multilateral trade organization until the WTO was established on January 1, 1995.<sup>4</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Since 1947, there have been eight successful rounds of trade liberalization negotiations under the GATT. The eighth was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, in September 1986 and concluded in Marrakesh, Morocco, on April 15, 1994. U.S. legislation implementing the Uruguay Round was signed into law on December 8, 1994.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As in previous rounds, the Uruguay Round achieved substantial tariff reductions in developed countries. It cut tariffs by 38 percent, dropped the average tariff to 3.9 percent, and eliminated some tariffs altogether.<sup>5</sup>  The Uruguay Round also broke new ground in a number of areas:
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Agriculture.</b> For the first time, trade in agricultural products was placed under the GATT. The Uruguay Round mandates the conversion of non-tariff barriers on agricultural products into tariffs. This means that import quotas on foodstuffs must be lifted and replaced by tariffs whose rates are set to allow at least the same volume of imports as under the quota. The Uruguay Round also reduces government financial support for agriculture by 20 percent and cuts the value of export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years.<sup>6</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Apparel and Textiles.</b> Import quotas on apparel and textiles manufactured in developing economies such as China or India are being phased out over 10 years.<sup>7</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Services.</b> Trade in such services as advertising and tourism is governed by a new General Agreement on Trade in Services, which establishes an MFN principle for all services. However, this agreement applies the national treatment principle only to those services listed by a WTO member in its trade liberalization commitments.  This agreement also mandates additional negotiations on opening markets in such service sectors as financial services, telecommunications, and maritime transport.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Trade-Related Investment Measures.</b> Modest progress was made toward liberalizing foreign investment. Regulations which require that a minimum percentage of a product's "added value" (i.e., that portion of its value normally subject to a value-added tax) be produced within a country are banned. Such regulations are known as local content requirements. Also banned are regulations which require that a minimum percentage of finished goods be exported in exchange for allowing imports.<sup>8</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Intellectual Property Rights. </b>Finally, the Uruguay Round establishes global rules for the protection of copyrights, trademarks, industrial designs, trade secrets, semiconductor layouts, and geographical indications.<sup>9</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the Uruguay Round, GATT members recognized the need for a permanent multilateral organization similar to the stillborn ITO to supervise global trade. As a result, the World Trade Organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, was established to supersede the GATT. The WTO oversees the implementation of trade agreements negotiated under auspices of the GATT or WTO, periodically evaluates the trade practices of its members, organizes future multilateral trade negotiations, and adjudicates trade disputes arising from WTO-related trade agreements.
<p>
<b>HOW TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A knowledge of the WTO's structure and procedure helps explain the difficulties facing Taiwan. The WTO is governed by a Ministerial Conference, which is composed of the trade ministers of all WTO members and must meet at least once every two years. Between meetings, the Ministerial Conference delegates the power to run the WTO to a General Council composed of representatives of all WTO members and a Director-General appointed by the Ministerial Conference.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article IX of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization states, "The WTO shall continue the practice of decision-making by consensus followed under GATT.... [W]here a decision cannot be arrived at by consensus, the matter shall be decided by voting."  The preference for consensus is very strong. Fewer than a handful of votes have been taken in almost 50 years. When a vote does occur, each WTO member has one vote.<sup>10</sup>  Accession of new members requires a two-thirds vote of the membership. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Article XII of the Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization provides that a member may be either "a [sovereign] state or a separate customs territory possessing full autonomy in the conduct of its external commercial relations."  A state or territory applying for membership must submit a memorandum detailing all of its laws, regulations, and policies affecting trade and investment. Once this memorandum is submitted, negotiations for entry start on two tracks. In Geneva, the General Council appoints a Working Party composed of trade negotiators from WTO members, including the U.S., to bargain with the applicant on bringing its domestic laws into line with WTO rules. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Simultaneously, the applicant begins bilateral discussions with individual WTO members on tariff reductions and other market-opening issues. Only after the applicant concludes all bilateral negotiations may the Working Party submit a Protocol of Accession to the Ministerial Conference for approval. The Protocol of Accession is a statement which details all of an applicant's trade liberalization commitments. Consequently, the bilateral negotiations are a choke point in the membership process; any member can veto an applicant simply by failing to conclude the bilateral talks.
<p>
<b>TAIWAN'S BID TO JOIN THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because GATT and its successor, the WTO, allow either sovereign states or autonomous customs territories to apply, Taiwan applied on January 1, 1990, to become a contracting party to the GATT as "The Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu," or "Chinese Taipei."  This lengthy designation was chosen to soothe Beijing's sensitivities about Taiwan, over which it claims sovereignty.<sup>11</sup>  Taiwan was following the example of Hong Kong, which became a contracting party on April 23, 1986. On September 29, 1992, the GATT accepted Taiwan's application and appointed a Working Party to begin membership negotiations.<sup>12</sup>  Since then, Taiwan has participated in eight Working Party sessions and has conducted bilateral negotiations over tariff reductions and market access with 25 WTO members.<sup>13</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China does not object to "Chinese Taipei's" accession to the WTO, provided it does not join before China. In fact, China has offered to sponsor Taiwan's membership as its first act as a WTO member; at the same time, however, because China considers accession to be a political act, it has warned WTO members that it will firmly oppose admitting Taiwan first. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both bilateral and Working Party negotiations with Taiwan have progressed farther than they have with the PRC. Taiwan has agreed to enter the WTO as a developed economy, meaning it would comply with the same standards as the European Union, Japan, and the U.S.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Taiwan has promised to implement all WTO commitments immediately and fully with only a few exceptions, related principally to agricultural products. Taiwan has offered not only to lift all import bans, but also to cut average industrial tariffs from 5.2 percent to 3.8 percent and average agricultural tariffs from 13.3 percent to 11.4 percent. It also has agreed not to raise tariff rates in the future without compensating other WTO members; such compensation may include lowering other tariff rates, removing non-tariff barriers, or liberalizing trade in service sectors.<sup>14</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, five important economic issues remain unresolved in the bilateral negotiations with Taiwan.
<p><ul>
<li> Market Access for Alcohol and Tobacco. The Taiwan Tobacco and Wine Monopoly Bureau currently maintains a legal monopoly on the manufacture and distribution of alcoholic beverages and tobacco in Taiwan. The European Union and the U.S. are seeking to end the monopoly's discriminatory practices and expand export opportunities.
<P>
<li> Market Access for Agricultural Products. Australia, the European Union, New Zealand, and the U.S. are not satisfied with Taiwan's offer to reduce tariffs and liberalize quotas for agricultural products, especially beef, milk, rice, and various fruits and vegetables.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Motor Vehicles. Japan, South Korea, and the U.S. have yet to reach agreement with Taiwan on cutting tariffs and removing strict quotas on automobile imports.
<p>
<li> Intellectual Property Rights Protection. The European Union and the U.S. find that Taiwan does not sufficiently protect intellectual property rights. Taiwan still requests a two-year phase-in period for implementing the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights, while American and European negotiators insist on full implementation immediately upon accession. Taiwan also has failed to meet the American and European demand for full protection of copyrighted materials produced in the last 50 years.
<p>
<li> Market Access for Services. Taiwan's proposal on such services as telecommunications and legal services is also inadequate for the U.S. For example, American negotiators want to remove Taiwan's suffocating restrictions on foreign investment in the telecommunications industry.<sup>15</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During the December 1995 meeting of the Taiwan Working Party, U.S. negotiators handed their Taiwanese counterparts a discussion paper on these unresolved issues. Taiwan is expected to reply before the Working Party's next meeting, tentatively scheduled for late spring 1996.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The optimum outcome would be the simultaneous accession of China and Taiwan to the WTO. However, the slower pace of the negotiations with China may be affecting the pace of talks with Taiwan. Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Winston Lord told a November 9, 1995, briefing at the Foreign Press Center that "we have not reached a point where we have to worry about sequence,"<sup>16</sup> but a more accurate (and perhaps more candid) statement of where things actually stand came from another American official. This official, who requested anonymity, commented after Taiwan's Working Party meeting on December 14, 1995, that "no one in the Working Party has the stomach" to propose delinking the accessions of the PRC and ROC.<sup>17</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

When the question of who should go first does come up, the Clinton Administration merely follows the crowd. As Lord noted, "[the sequence of accession] will be a collective decision of the WTO, not just the United States."  Lord went on to say that "we believe each case should be decided on its own merits" without "any political consideration."<sup>18</sup>  As a European official observed anonymously after the conclusion of the Working Group meeting on December 14, however, "Bilateral concerns with Taiwan should be easy to conclude, [but] the EU is not keen to conclude them because there is a clear sentiment among WTO members that Taiwan's accession cannot take place before China's."<sup>19</sup>  Thus, without determined American leadership, it is doubtful that Taiwan will be permitted to enter the WTO before the PRC. The WTO's consensus-based approach to decision-making gives China a tacit veto over Taiwan's accession.
<p>
<b>THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will be more difficult for China to join the WTO than it is for Taiwan, if only because Beijing will have to make more fundamental changes in the structure of its economy.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China is now the world's third-largest economy behind the U.S. and Japan. Since 1978, the People's Republic of China has transformed its once-stagnant command economy into a growing mixed economy. Markets have been liberalized, and prices are set largely by the market. While currency inconvertibility and poor statistical data make a precise determination of China's gross domestic product impossible, estimates of its 1994 GDP range from $474 billion to $3.0 trillion.<sup>20</sup>  China's annual real GDP growth rate has averaged more than 9 percent in the last decade.<sup>21</sup>  Furthermore, China's high savings rate, high degree of literacy, and low population growth rate suggest the ability to sustain high productivity and per capita income growth rates in the future.<sup>22</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Economic reform also has stimulated international trade. China's global two-way trade was $20.7 billion in 1978, making the PRC the world's 27th-largest trading economy. In 1994, with two-way trade of $236.4 billion, China became the world's tenth-largest trading economy. Two-way trade between China and the U.S. also has grown, rising from $4.8 billion in 1980 to $48.1 billion in 1994, making the PRC America's sixth-largest trading partner.<sup>23</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Coming to Geneva.</b> China has been seeking to join the GATT and now the WTO for almost a decade. Although the Republic of China was an original contracting party to the GATT in 1948, Taiwan's government withdrew in 1950, following the Communist victory on the mainland and the Nationalist retreat to Taiwan; later, once economic reforms were underway on the mainland, the PRC sought to resume the seat itself. China won observer status in the GATT in November 1982 and formally requested accession to the GATT on July 11, 1986. On February 13, 1987, China submitted the required memorandum describing its trading system, and on March 4, 1987, the GATT Council established a Working Party to negotiate China's accession.<sup>24</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round, China launched a major campaign to join the GATT before the end of 1994. Beijing wanted to become a founding member of the WTO because it saw this as political recognition of China's status as a world economic power. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insisted that China's accession must be accomplished on "commercially viable terms."  Because negotiators were unable to bridge the wide gap between these two positions, the talks failed to produce an agreement on China's accession.<sup>25</sup>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Almost one year later, on November 10, 1995, Deputy United States Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky laid out a secret 13-page "road map" on Chinese accession to Beijing negotiators. This document outlined the full range of WTO commitments and identified the basic issues that China must resolve before it can enter the WTO on a commercially viable basis.<sup>26</sup>  These issues include:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Reducing tariffs and opening markets.</b> A wide gap remains between China's current offers on reducing tariffs and the minimum demands of the major trading powers. During the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum Leaders' Meeting in Osaka, Japan, on November 19, 1995, Chinese President Jiang Zemin announced that China would cut its average tariff rate from 36 percent to 24 percent as a "downpayment" on APEC trade liberalization.<sup>27</sup>  China also has indicated a willingness to cut its average tariff rate to 17 percent within three years for industrial products and six years for agricultural products.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
China has not released detailed information on what the new tariffs would be. Therefore, it is difficult to know the exact value of this offer. However, China's average tariff rate, even after this second reduction, would remain high compared to other developing countries such as Brazil (14.3 percent) or Malaysia (9 percent). Moreover, China indicated not only a desire to maintain an industrial policy to protect "infant" industries, but also an unwillingness to liberalize foreign investment rules and import restrictions in the automotive and telecommunications sectors of its economy.<sup>29</sup> 
<P>
<li><b> Trading Rights.</b> China controls imports and exports through a licensing system known as trading rights, which requires companies to receive Beijing's approval for each of their imports or exports. Under the WTO, firms may import or export any product they wish unless that product falls under certain narrowly defined government exceptions. Eliminating trading rights is important because they allow China to negate the value of any tariff concession by refusing to grant import licenses.<sup>30</sup>  In December 1995, China offered to phase out trading rights within five years instead of the eight years it had offered in July 1995.<sup>31</sup>  The U.S. has pushed for a shorter phase-out, possibly two or three years, provided China does not favor domestic firms over their foreign rivals in granting trading rights during the phase-out period.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Investment and Industrial Policies.</b> China's investment and industrial policies violate GATT's national treatment principle. For example, China forbids foreign investment in some industries (such as motor vehicle assembly), requires local partners in others, and discriminates against foreign firms in granting trading rights. China also violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Investment by requiring that foreign investors in China use domestic components in manufacturing of their products and also by requiring that foreign-owned firms export a large percentage of the products made at their Chinese factories. Finally, China violates the Uruguay Round Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights by requiring the transfer of patented technology as a precondition for approving foreign investment. The European Union, Japan, and the U.S. insist that China terminate these practices upon accession, but the Chinese want a much longer phase-out period.
<p>
<li><b> Developed versus Developing Country.</b> China seeks to enter the WTO as a so-called developing country. The WTO tries to help developing members adjust to global competition by allowing them to adhere to less demanding standards and to take a longer time to implement trade liberalization than is required of developed members. For example, in agriculture, while developed members must cut the value of their export subsidies by 36 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 21 percent over six years, developing members are allowed to reduce the value of their export subsidies by only 24 percent and the volume of their subsidized exports by 14 percent over ten years. Similarly, developed members must implement the Agreement on Intellectual Property Rights within one year, while developing members may take up to four years to implement the provisions.
<P>
China argues that it qualifies for admission as a developing country because of its low per capita income. The U.S. and other developed countries counter that China's economy is not small and weak like those of other developing countries; China is already a major exporter. Therefore, the PRC should enter the WTO under the more demanding standards of a developed country.
<P>
<li><b> Protection Against Import Surges from China.</b> The only significant disagreement among the European Union, Japan, and the U.S. concerning China's entry to the WTO is over safeguards against import surges from China during the phase-in period. WTO members may raise tariffs temporarily or impose quotas for up to four years (1) when an import surge threatens a domestic industry and (2) when relief from the import surge may "prevent or remedy serious injury and facilitate adjustment."  This practice is known as a "safeguard."  Generally, safeguards may not be targeted at a specific country; they must be applied equally to all exporting countries.
<P>
Europeans insist that during China's transition period, WTO members must be permitted to impose "safeguard" tariffs or quotas on Chinese exports without having to apply them at the same time to exports from all other WTO members. Furthermore, they want to be able to apply these safeguards against either specific Chinese products or all Chinese exports. The Japanese, on the other hand, have shown little interest in safeguards.
<P>
The American position is more ambivalent. The United States wants a strong accession agreement and would like to have China move rapidly to liberalize its market and adopt strict rules on investment and intellectual property rights. At the same time, the U.S. "road map" suggests a willingness to consider safeguards if necessary.
<P>
China objects to safeguards as a violation of the MFN principle but does not rule them out entirely. It would allow WTO members to invoke safeguards only when the volume of imports of a specific Chinese product grew substantially faster than the volume of imports of similar products from other countries.<sup>33</sup> 
<p>
<li><b> Import Quotas.</b> Referring to Poland's accession to the GATT in 1968 as a precedent, the U.S. "road map" suggests that China should consider adopting import quotas while implementing its WTO commitments.<sup>34</sup>  During Poland's accession negotiations, GATT members struggled over how to create trading opportunities between Poland's non-market economy and their market economies. To solve this problem, Poland agreed to increase its imports from GATT members by seven percent each year and to subject its exports to GATT members to special safeguards. These import quotas encouraged Polish central planners to permit more imports and to abandon some protectionist policies.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
China feels that import quotas are inappropriate during the implementation period. A Chinese negotiator recently stated that "China is in transit from a planned economy to a market economy. Today's China is totally different than Poland thirty years ago."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
<li><b> Jackson-Vanik.</b> The Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act complicates the U.S. discussions with China over WTO accession. Passed in 1975, this law requires the President to certify annually that countries with non-market economies are allowing free emigration. Congress may overturn the President's certification by passing a joint resolution. Jackson-Vanik was intended to increase the flow of Jewish emigrants from the former Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to Israel and the U.S. However, following the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989, Congress began to apply it to China by attempting to revoke China's MFN status.
<P>
The WTO requires that the U.S. grant China unconditional, permanent MFN trade status once it joins the WTO. By preventing this, Jackson-Vanik will force the U.S. to conduct separate negotiations with China to try to duplicate the terms of its WTO accession in a separate bilateral trade agreement. This reduces America's negotiating leverage, allowing China to offer less generous economic concessions to the U.S. in a parallel bilateral trade agreement than other countries would receive under the usual WTO accession agreement.<sup>37</sup>
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Reactions to the U.S. Position.</b> Chinese negotiators greeted the U.S. "road map" as a "positive initiative," but they also warned that substantial differences remain unresolved. An informal meeting of the Working Party convened in Geneva on December 7-8, 1995, and China-U.S. bilateral talks were held the following day. Chinese negotiators agreed to reply to the "road map" by the next meeting of the Working Party on March 18, 1996.<sup>38</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

During a February 12, 1996, meeting with Deputy USTR Charlene Barshefsky, Vice Minister Sun Zhenyun delivered China's reaction. Sun reaffirmed that the "road map" was a positive step, but criticized parts of it for making what he claimed were demands that exceed what is required of other WTO members. Sun rejected a U.S. proposal for safeguards against surges of Chinese imports. He also opposed a U.S. suggestion for import targets. China is expected to respond to the other issues raised in the "road map" at the next Working Group meeting.<sup>39</sup> 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

So far, American, European, and Japanese negotiators have remained remarkably united in their talks with China. The three major trading powers have insisted that China may not join the WTO as a matter of political recognition; accession must occur on a "commercially viable basis."

<p>
<b>BRINGING CHINA AND TAIWAN INTO THE WTO</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It will take China longer to join the WTO than it will Taiwan. The PRC has to make fundamental structural changes in its economy to meet WTO standards. The economic concessions Taiwan must make, while significant, are more limited, affecting only certain sectors of its economy. Nevertheless, even if the Taiwanese government decides to make concessions, Beijing's determined opposition to Taiwan's accession before China's and the apparent U.S. willingness to accede to Beijing's desires will hold Taiwan's application hostage to China's wishes.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

WTO-related trade agreements are commercial contracts, and WTO accession is an economic, not a political, act. Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTO's economic criteria should be free to join. As the world's largest exporter, the U.S. has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO applicants. Therefore, to further American economic interests, President Clinton should:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Support the accession of Taiwan to the WTO after Taiwan meets U.S. demands on outstanding issues.</b> If China is making enough progress in the WTO negotiations, the Clinton Administration should help China and Taiwan join at the same time. This would be the best outcome for all parties. However, if the talks with China fail and accession appears unlikely in the near future, the Clinton Administration should support the accession of Taiwan on its own merits, even though this would face China's determined opposition. 
<p>
<li><b> Cooperate with the European Union and Japan to ensure that China becomes a WTO member on commercially viable terms.</b> Close cooperation among the European Union, Japan, and the United States will prevent China from playing one against the others in the accession negotiations. Therefore, cooperation will increase American leverage in negotiating with China. At a minimum, President Clinton must insist that China agree to: 
<p><ol>
<li><b> Implement</b> the principal WTO commitments, publish all trade regulations, and provide an open and fair legal process for adjudicating trade disputes immediately upon accession.
<p>
<li><b> Accept</b> strong safeguard provisions in exchange for a longer time to phase out trading rights and implement other WTO commitments.
<p>
<li><b> End</b> the PRC's practice of forcing foreign firms to transfer technology as a condition of doing business in China. China's market is so huge that Beijing has the leverage to force large industrial firms to surrender to this form of government-sponsored theft.
<p>
<li><b> Enforce</b> fully all existing bilateral trade agreements, especially the 1995 Intellectual Property Rights Memorandum of Understanding.
</ol><P>
<li><b> Offer to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment in exchange for concessions.</b> The President should ask Congress for discretionary authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Beijing highly values gaining unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in the U.S. However, keeping China on conditional MFN status subject to annual renewal, as mandated by Jackson-Vanik, provides the U.S. with few benefits. By granting the President the discretionary authority to exempt China from Jackson-Vanik, Congress would strengthen substantially America's leverage in WTO accession talks with Beijing. The President then could offer Beijing unconditional, permanent MFN trade status in exchange not only for relaxing its political demands on Taiwan's membership in the WTO, but for economic concessions that benefit American exporters and investors.
</ul><P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Jackson-Vanik Amendment harms American interests in a number of ways. First, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is based on a faulty premise. The PRC is no longer a stagnant non-market economy. Rather, it is a growing mixed economy. Proponents of applying Jackson-Vanik ignore the economic reforms that have occurred in China since 1978.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, applying Jackson-Vanik to China is inappropriate. Jackson-Vanik was designed to encourage the Soviet Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift restrictions on Jewish emigration to Israel and the U.S. However, it is American immigration law, not Chinese emigration policy, that restricts the flow of Chinese emigrants. While millions of Chinese would willingly emigrate to the U.S., American immigration law limits the flow to approximately 25,000 annually. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Third, Jackson-Vanik's threat to withdraw MFN is at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive. MFN tariffs are not a special privilege granted to specific countries; they are the standard rates that the U.S. extends to all but a handful of small countries. Withdrawing MFN would compel the U.S. to apply Smoot-Hawley tariffs on Chinese exports. After the inevitable Chinese retaliation against American exports, there would be a virtual cessation of China-U.S. trade.
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Finally, Jackson-Vanik weakens the U.S. bargaining position in the WTO accession talks with China. By preventing the U.S. from granting China unconditional, permanent MFN, it would force the U.S. to conclude a separate bilateral trade pact with Beijing, paralleling China's WTO accession agreement and allowing the PRC to offer the U.S. smaller tariff cuts and fewer market-opening measures than it would grant to other WTO members in its accession agreement.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China are seeking to join the WTO, the former as a sovereign state and the latter as an autonomous customs territory. Although Taiwan is closer to the goal, both have yet to meet the economic criteria for membership. Taiwan sees WTO membership as a commercial contract, while the PRC regards it as an act of political recognition. Beijing therefore opposes Taiwan's accession before its own. 
<P>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because China's accession is more complicated, negotiations with China may take longer to complete than those with Taiwan. Taiwan's accession to the WTO could be held hostage to the process of internal change in China. Given the commercial nature of the WTO, this would be manifestly unfair. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its accession, even in the face of China's determined opposition. Taiwan should join the WTO when it is ready, not when Beijing says it can.

<li>Technically, only sovereign states and autonomous customs territories may join the WTO. However, in the Treaty of Rome, member states ceded their authority over international commercial relations to the European Union.

<li>There are several important exceptions to the most-favored-nation principle. Customs unions such as the European Union and free-trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are permissible exceptions to the MFN principle. Likewise, developed WTO members may abolish or reduce tariffs on certain industrial goods imported from least developed members. This is known as the generalized system of preferences (GSP). <p>

<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  "Advancing American Business Interests Through APEC" is our topic this morning. It is an important topic. We have three excellent panelists who will approach it from different points of view.
<p>
This program is a joint production of the Heritage American Trader Initiative (ATI) Advisory Council, newly formed in the last year, and the <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Heritage Asian Studies Center</a>. The ATI brings together the <a href="/heritage/library/index/g3.html">foreign policy</a> and <a href="/heritage/library/index/l1.html">international trade</a> aspects of Heritage's work, which are considerable, and we have created a new advisory council of private-sector business and policy leaders, which I am pleased to chair. I'm Barbara Franklin, former U.S. Commerce Secretary. The other half of the equation is Heritage's Asian Studies Center, which has been going on for some time and which really is excellent. I know <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">Jim Przystup</a> is here; he is the director of that program. So, with this bit of introduction, we will begin.
<p>
The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum (APEC) was founded in 1989, at the instigation of Australia. The United States has been a member ever since, and in 1993 hosted the first meeting of the leaders of the member countries in Seattle. There are now eighteen countries that belong to APEC. The obvious ones are in the Pacific Rim, plus the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and Chile. Ten working groups have been activated as a part of the APEC framework, and there is a secretariat today in Singapore.
<p>
That this group was formed at all is, I think, a reflection of the dynamic growth that is prevailing in Asia today, with economies growing, in many cases, in double digits. That part of the world is a very important marketplace for the U.S. In U.S. terms, our exports to Asia grew 12 percent in 1994 from the preceding year, to over $153 billion. Our direct investment climbed 17 percent in that region, to over $108 billion in 1994. Our exports to Asia now support 3.1 million jobs here at home.
<p>
There was an historic event at the APEC leaders' meeting in 1994. In fact, it was so historic that some of us wondered whether it was possible. At last year's meeting, on November 15, the heads of the APEC governments decided to set a goal for themselves:  to create "free and open trade and investment" in that region by the year 2020. President Suharto of Indonesia, where that meeting was held, deserves a great deal of credit for overcoming a lot of differences in points of view, economic realities, and cultures. He did quite a magnificent job.
<p>
Now we have before us this year's meeting coming up in just a few weeks in Japan, with the Japanese as hosts and with Prime Minister Murayama as the chairman. I think it would be fair to say that our Japanese friends have not been as aggressive in putting this meeting together as we might have hoped. After last year we began to have high hopes for what might be possible, and the hope was that we would come out of this meeting with a framework for implementing this free trade concept in the Pacific Rim by the year 2020.
<p>
Right now, we have a bit of a split, and that is what I hope some of our panelists will address. We have a split in the ranks, with the Japanese having proposed a "flexibility" that would allow the membership to exclude certain sectors, mainly agriculture, from the trade liberalization discussions. This concerns us. The U.S. is not in that camp. The "flexibility" group includes -- in addition to Japan -- China, Korea, and Taiwan. On the other side we have ourselves, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, New Zealand, Singapore, and the other countries.
<p>
In just a few short weeks, on November 19, we will have this meeting in Osaka. So the real question is:  Can this division over "flexibility" and the exclusion of agriculture be overcome at this meeting?  That is really the biggest question. I have read articles recently that would indicate that maybe APEC doesn't matter, that business will flourish with or without it. It did before APEC was formed in the Pacific Rim, and some say business activity will overtake and outrun the APEC process. We have two representatives from our business community here, and we will be very interested in your answers to that question. And with that, let me introduce the panelists.
<p>
First of all is Stuart Allan, who is Director of the Office of Economic Policy, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, at the Department of State. This is the office that interacts with APEC and is involved in planning this conference. Mr. Allan is a career foreign service officer, having joined the department in 1971. He has served as Counselor of Economic Affairs at our embassy in Australia and has also served in the Netherlands, Taiwan, Pakistan, and Mexico. He is a graduate of Davidson College in North Carolina, with an M.A. in economics from the University of Wisconsin.
<p>
<b>STUART ALLAN:</b>  Thank you very much, Barbara. It's a great pleasure to be here today to talk about this very important question of free trade in the Asia Pacific region and the prospects for moving forward on that. Sandy Kristoff, my boss, does extend her sincere regrets. She had been scheduled to come, she wanted to come, but as we move closer to ministerial and summit meetings, the leaders' meeting, she gets pulled over to the White House quite frequently. So she extends her regrets.
<p>
In Canberra in 1989, when Secretary of State Baker joined the other foreign ministers for what was to be a very informal discussion on shared interests in the region, there was a lot of skepticism about the Australian initiative to pull the meeting together. There was some doubt in the region, particularly among some in Southeast Asia, as to the utility of the idea. But after the ministers met for a couple of days of fruitful discussion, they discovered that indeed they had a lot in common, that there were a lot of things they would like to pursue. They sketched out a work program in particular sectors where there might be prospects for cooperation to enhance trade and to enhance the ability of firms to do business in the region. From that slow and hesitant start, APEC has really burgeoned.
<p>
Barbara has pointed out the seminal event in Seattle in 1993, when President Clinton really elevated APEC from a meeting of foreign ministers and trade ministers to an annual meeting of leaders of the APEC economies. Then President Suharto last year hosted a similar meeting in Bogor, just outside of Jakarta, where APEC took another very important step forward. President Suharto, as an important leader of the developing member economies in APEC, and as a leader of the developing world as head of the non-aligned movement, was able to convince all the member economies of APEC to undertake this commitment to achieve free trade and investment in the region by specified dates. Those specified dates were 2010 for the industrialized members of the group and 2020 for the developing member economies.
<p>
So the challenge before the APEC members this year has been to frame an action agenda which the leaders requested. They asked the ministers to come forward with specific, detailed proposals on how to get from where we are to where they have committed us to be in 15 to 25 years. That has proved to be a major challenge over the past year. The Japanese have worked very hard, and it has been difficult. The situation in Japan is such that Prime Minister Murayama, as a member of a coalition government, is doing what he can to provide leadership. Within Japan there are competing bureaucracies that sometimes affect the Japanese ability to do things; but even with those constraints, they have worked very hard this year to try to frame an action agenda, working with the 17 other member economies, that could be finalized by the foreign and trade ministers in their ministerial meeting in Osaka and then promulgated by the leaders in their meeting on November 19 in Osaka.
<p>
The draft, as it now stands, is maybe 70 to 80 percent agreed but still has some very important components that have yet to be concluded. The draft includes a section of general principles that the APEC member economies will seek to adhere to as they move forward to the free trade goal. Those principles include things like the main point that Barbara mentioned, the question of comprehensiveness. Under that principle, the question is:  As we move forward, will it be to comprehensively liberalize trade and investment, or will there be exceptions?  In the leaders' declaration last year, they did not mention any exceptions. They said "free trade and investment in the region" by specified dates.
<p>
But as we've engaged in this initiative this year, moving from the political commitment to the practical reality, a number of member economies have found that it begins to be very hard to swallow. I think the reasons are quite understandable. They were quite evident at the closing days of the Uruguay Round, for example. We found with a number of the member economies, particularly Korea and Japan, that the problem of agricultural liberalization was a major difficulty for them, but they moved forward.
<p>
Our approach is that the APEC leaders did not state any exception to comprehensive free trade and investment liberalization, and the leaders did not say anything about special consideration for sensitive sectors. The one understanding the leaders had was a recognition of the different levels of development, and that was reflected in the two different target dates, with the industrialized by 2010 and the developing by 2020.
<p>
How do we deal with this problem at this point?  That has yet to be decided, but my sense is that in the run up to the ministerial meeting there will be intensive discussions in advance in Osaka. If the issue cannot be resolved at the working level, it will probably go to the ministers. And if the ministers are unable to reach agreement on this question of comprehensive coverage, I think it will ultimately have to go to the leaders. After all, it was leaders who made the commitment, it was leaders who did not say "except for sensitive sectors," and if there is some clarification required for the ministers and the rest of us, then maybe the leaders will have to do that. So the jury is out on this question of comprehensiveness and whether there might be an exception for agriculture.
<p>
The reason we are fairly firm on this, quite firm on it, is that once we start making exceptions for sensitive sectors -- again, agriculture in the case of Japan and Korea -- we will find that everybody has a sensitive sector. And if everyone was able to identify one sensitive sector for exclusion -- I could imagine, for example, elements in the U.S. would be happy for the Japanese to exclude agriculture -- we might exclude textiles, the Chinese might exclude automobiles, the Southeast Asians might exclude financial services. Pretty soon, if everyone takes one thing off the table, you don't have much left. It's quite easy to picture an unraveling of the objective. Moreover, agriculture is an important trading commodity, one that we are very efficient at exporting, so agriculture is an important issue. We will have to see where that comes out.
<p>
Other items in the principles section of the draft action agenda include things like the question of nondiscrimination; that is one that has to be worked out. The question of comparability is critical as member economies move forward to achieve the free trade goal:  How do they do it, and how does one assure that the efforts and, more important, the market access results are mutually beneficial and comparable?  These are open issues, and I think we will be able to reach agreement on them, but they are not yet agreed.
<p>
The second part of the draft action agenda addresses the central question of the process:  How do we do this over the next 15 to 25 years?  To generalize, there have been roughly two different approaches to this question. On one side, a number of member economies would prefer more of a voluntary and unilateral effort, whereby they accept the goal but move forward in their own way over the next 15 to 25 years to open up the different sectors, to address the different issues, so that they achieve the commitment. At the other end of that spectrum is a group of countries that think you cannot depend entirely on voluntarism, although some member economies have indeed been doing a lot unilaterally. Many of the countries in Southeast Asia, for their own benefit, have been deregulating, lowering tariffs unilaterally, to help open up their economies and continue to enjoy the rapid growth that they have enjoyed, in part because of wise, market-oriented policies.
<p>
On the other hand, there are other member economies in Asia where the track record is less encouraging. Therefore, for all the member economies to be confident that we are going to achieve the goal, some believe that we cannot depend solely on voluntarism and unilateralism, that we also need some collective action where we sit down and talk through some issues and agree on where we are going and how fast we are going to get there.
<p>
In the actual action agenda, what I think we will find is perhaps a mix of these different methods that might include unilateral and voluntary actions, might include some collective actions by member economies, ongoing actions in the context of the WTO to meet multilateral commitments which will also be beneficial in an APEC context. In APEC we have this notion of "18 minus X."  Of the 18 members of APEC, perhaps a subset of 12, for example, might be able to agree on action in a particular area. And if the other six cannot move forward in the near term, subsets of the whole group can move forward. This is copied from a technique that is used in ASEAN, where they have a "6 minus X" approach. If some parts of ASEAN, say five of the six, can move forward, you don't hold out for absolute consensus; the other one basically catches up later and the five move ahead.
<p>
After principles and a process section, the key part of the action agenda will be a section that identifies specific sectors and issues that we will be focusing on at the outset and consistently over the 15 to 25 years. These issues include things like trade in services, intellectual property protection, government procurement, regulation and deregulation, competition policy, tariffs, and non-tariff barriers. There is an enumeration of 14 or 15 specific sectors and issues where the member economies are going to focus their efforts as they pursue liberalization individually, collectively, in the WTO, 18 minus X -- the different methodologies.
<p>
That is where we stand. The senior officials of APEC -- this is the group just below the ministers level -- have met six times or so this year, both in a special restricted negotiating context and in the general meetings they routinely have. The action agenda draft is, as I say, about 80 percent toward where we need to be, but a lot of important work has yet to be done.
<p>
I would like to turn a little bit away from what I have been talking about, which is what has seized the headlines and focused the attention of a lot of people in the last 12 months, and understandably so, to look at another aspect of APEC:  the more short-term, the more practical, concrete kinds of things that APEC has been doing and will continue to do to provide some tangible benefits for business. This is what APEC really started on back in 1989, with these working groups looking at tourism, looking at telecommunications, looking at transportation, looking at energy -- some of the sector-specific working groups looking at ways the member economies could cooperate.
<p>
Let me just mention a few of the kinds of things that have happened or will be happening in this area, in different categories. One is activities that increase transparency. This is important. I think it is fair to say we have one of the most transparent trade and investment regimes in the world. But in the Asian part of APEC -- and, again, think of Southeast Asia, think of China, developing economies -- transparency is a problem for businessmen. To the extent that through APEC we can be clear in terms of what the business rules, procedures, and so forth are, and make that information more readily available to businessmen, that should make it easier to do business.
<P>
A couple of examples. One is the customs guidebook, a publication by the APEC Customs Subcommittee with information on the regulatory regimes, non-tariff barriers, and so forth, all collected in one place, in English, available globally for exporters of all the member economies. Another transparency measure seems kind of small and very specialized, but is quite important for one sector, and that is the fish inspection system handbook. There is a Fisheries Working Group looking at both health and safety and trade issues in the fisheries area. The U.S. is an exporter of seafood products, and seafood is traded widely in the APEC region. This is one of the most highly regulated sectors because of safety and health concerns. Now, through this working group, a handbook has been published that identifies what the rules, regulations, contact points, and so forth are to import and export shellfish and seafood products.
<p>
Another type of practical measure I would characterize as in the "doing business" category. This differentiation between "doing business" measures and "transparency" measures may seem a little artificial, but just let me give you a few other examples. Through one of the working groups of the Committee on Trade and Investment, over the last year the APEC member economies have developed a tariff database. It is now on a CD-ROM and can be purchased for $50 or $60 from the APEC secretariat; I can give you a contact point in the Commerce Department that can tell you exactly how to do it. Here on a CD-ROM, which will be updated annually, are all the tariff schedules for all the member economies, easily accessible on a common tariff description. I think it is BTN or the standard tariff classification. The key thing here is for American businesses, or any other businesses that are considering exporting a product into the APEC region, to find the tariff level. Is it a prohibitive tariff?  Is it something they could deal with and still be competitive in that target market?  Here is a key "doing business" question, with the information readily available.
<p>
Another one that we kicked off a few years ago was called the APEC Partnership for Education. I think this was initiated about 1991. The idea was that there are lots of foreign students studying in the United States, including many from Southeast Asia. They come here for four or five or six years and learn excellent English, become familiar with American education and the way we approach business and so on. There also are a lot of American multinationals working in Southeast Asia or in Asia that would like to offer employment to many of these students that have the language and American orientation. Many of those graduates, as they go back to their home countries, would like to offer their services as employees of those companies. So it was really a matchmaking exercise that was set up with some seed money from the U.S. Agency for International Development. I think in recent years that seed money has been removed, and the latest I heard is it is now self-sustaining by the two parties, the buyer and seller. I'm not sure who pays most of the costs, but it is an ongoing effort.
<p>
Each year for the last several years, in advance of the APEC ministerial meetings, there has been a customs symposium. I think we kicked this off in Seattle and found it to be very useful, where customs officials sit down and talk with importers and exporters about practical problems faced by firms doing business in that country. I sat in on a small part of this in Jakarta last year, and this was an incredibly well-attended event:  a roomful of probably three or four hundred businessmen talking with Indonesian customs officials. They had the director-general and the other customs officials, as well as some international customs officials from the GATT and the World Customs Organization, talking about practical problems in an actual forum where businessmen could go into some of the problems in terms of importing and exporting in Indonesia:  good contacts and a good way to exchange information and seek to improve procedures and solve problems.
<p>
Another example is mutual recognition agreements. This is something that is still being worked on. Member economies have different product standards, and products typically will have to be tested and approved by different testing organizations. Even though individual economies may have their own standards for their own reasons, the ideal is to have a harmonized standard, but in many cases that will not be possible. In terms of testing and testing conformance to standards, is it fruitful and efficient to test every product in every place, or can we in APEC come up with an approach where we agree to test it once and accept it everywhere and, if so, this really facilitates movement of products in the region?  Again, I think this is probably less a problem in the United States, but I know that many American exporters, as they try to ship a product into Japan or into China, face tremendous problems. Sometimes each product has to be tested. So if we could somehow simplify testing procedures, recognize the results of tests regionwide, that should really facilitate the movement of products in the region.
<P>
Finally, there is another category of tangible, near-term, and practical benefits for business, and I put it under the business promotion rubric. I'll give just a couple of examples. One example is simply showcasing technologies. This year Secretary of Transportation Pea hosted an APEC Transportation Ministerial meeting. All of the transport ministers from around the region met here in Washington for two days for an excellent session in one of the conference rooms of the State Department. Day One of that session was a symposium of the ministers with the business communities. Every minister was invited, and most of them brought a group of businessmen concerned with the transportation sector. For a day, the ministers sat down and talked with businessmen about transportation issues in the region.
<p>
There was an official ministers-only session the next day, and then Secretary Pea invited all of the ministers to go with him on a short tour through the United States in order to showcase some of the transportation technology of the U.S. They went to the new Denver airport, which Secretary Pea knew a lot about, as well as to Seattle to look at Boeing, look at some of the infrastructure there, and I think down to San Francisco:  a good opportunity to showcase American technology to ministers from the region. We all know that infrastructure growth in the region, particularly transportation infrastructure, is very important and offers a lot of opportunities. So the post-ministerial tour provided a good exposure for U.S. transportation technology.
<p>
There was another, similar event in Vancouver a couple of years ago, when APEC environmental ministers met under Canadian chairmanship and there was a showcase of environmental technology. I think many American environmental technology companies showed their products at that time. I would hope that there will be more opportunities of the business promotion kind.
<p>
Another impact of APEC, in my opinion -- and this may be more important for the United States than most other member economies -- is to raise the profile of the opportunities in Asia. This is not a conscious objective of U.S. policy, but it is really an important byproduct. In the United States, we have very competitive multinationals, very active globally and in the region. But in the United States, we also have lots of small and medium-sized enterprises which are accustomed to doing business in their state, maybe nationally, but they are not sufficiently oriented to international exports and international investment opportunities. To the extent that the President of the United States and the Secretary of Commerce go to the ministerial and APEC leaders' meetings and thereby draw attention to the opportunities in Asia, they can stimulate the interest of small and medium-sized enterprises in exploring opportunities in Asia that they might not have thought about before.
<p>
Small and medium-sized business here is one of the great generators of new technology, of jobs and so on, and to the extent we can get small business more internationally oriented, that is good for the United States. This is true also in most of the other member economies. Small business is an important component of many of the developing economies, and many of the practical results in APEC that I described earlier really are more beneficial to small businesses, which face these big expenses in lack of transparency and lack of knowledge, than to IBM or General Motors, which are much more comfortable working internationally.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  Next is Philip Vaughn, Director of Government Relations for Fluor Corporation, a very large, diversified engineering and construction company operating in over 50 countries. Prior to joining Fluor, Phil was vice president of International Business Government Counselors, a consulting firm here in the District. Before that, he was on the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee when Dan Rostenkowski was the chairman and with the Peace Corps in Zaire. He graduated from Georgetown, with a B.S. in foreign service and an M.A. in Arab studies, and speaks French, Arabic, and Italian.
<p>
<b>PHILIP VAUGHN:</b>  Thank you very much for asking me to be here today. As a real believer in APEC, I was very pleased to be a part of this program this morning. Actually, Fluor is very active in Asia. We have offices in all the APEC countries except for Brunei, New Zealand, and Papua New Guinea.
<p>
Our involvement in this started last year, when the President asked our chairman, Les McCraw, to be part of the Pacific Business Forum, which is the business advisory group to the APEC leaders. The Pacific Business Forum is made up of two members from each APEC economy, one from a large business -- in the case of the U.S., Fluor Corporation -- and one from a small business. The small business representative for the United States was Discovery Communications, although Discovery Communications is actually not all that small. For the past two years, Fluor has also been co-chairman of the Pacific Business Forum. We have done this with Indonesia last year, and this year we have been co-chairman with Indonesia and Japan.
<p>
I was asked to speak about business views toward APEC. I'm not going to go into great detail on the report which the Pacific Business Forum produced, but I will be happy to send people copies if they want to contact me. I wanted to talk a little more broadly about why APEC is important. I think it's a bit difficult to represent U.S. business views as a whole, for two reasons. First, as you all know, the U.S. business community is probably among the most diverse in all the APEC economies. There are differences between large and small, which we touched on earlier, between the manufacturing sectors and service sectors, heavy industry and high tech; so, depending on who you talk to, you might get a very different opinion on APEC.
<p>
Second, there really is a distinct lack of awareness in the business community about APEC and what it does, so I think, as a whole, business views have not fully matured at this point. Indeed, until our chairman was asked to be part of the Pacific Business Forum, Fluor was aware of APEC but certainly not deeply involved in it. 
<p>
Before I go into the specific trade and investment issues that we were looking at this year in APEC as the PBF, I would like to make some very broad comments on why I think APEC is important to business.
<p>
First, it can help solidify the economic and political security of the region that business needs to feel confident in its investments. It is clearly in the interests of the U.S. business community to have a forum in which the U.S. can deepen its ties with all of its trading partners in the Asia Pacific region.
<p>
Second, APEC offers a mechanism for anchoring the U.S. in the region, as I mentioned, both strategically and economically. There seems to be a lot of debate today, at least around APEC, that America may be too focused on Asia, putting too much emphasis on the region; that we do not have a natural role there; that the cultural differences are far too great; and that we really should be focusing perhaps more on Latin America or Europe. I think the physical distance, the cultural differences, and the lack of a clear role in the post-Cold War world perhaps make APEC even more important, and keeping the U.S. involved in the region through APEC even more a priority.
<p>
Third, APEC is the only truly regional grouping in existence, and I think it can play an important role in bringing together the NAFTAs, the AFTAs (which is the ASEAN free trade area), the CERs (which is the free trade agreement between Australia and New Zealand), and prevent the region from breaking down into a multiplicity of isolated subregional trading blocs.
<P>
And fourth, APEC offers the U.S. a broad policy forum in which we can sit down and talk to our trading partners in more constructive dialogue, rather than in destructive confrontations that I think we have had in the past.
<p>
Beyond the tariff and trade and business reasons, I think those four are very broad areas or reasons to stay involved in the APEC process. But when you get to the business side, people always look at me and say, "Well, why APEC?  Why are you involved in it?  Does this really have any meaningful impact on your bottom line?"  I think the answer really is a resounding, "Yes, it can," but only if APEC gets its act together this year and starts taking some tough decisions in Osaka is it going to prove to business once and for all that it is willing to move from being a policy talk shop into an action-oriented forum. I think that is the main thing we need to see from Osaka this year.
<P>
Our report that the Pacific Business Forum produced this year, in fact, addresses this issue. Our theme is "Making APEC more relevant to business."  To achieve that business relevancy, APEC has to do two things this year. First, it has to establish itself as a credible and effective organization in the eyes of business, and, put very simply, that means we want to see APEC take some actions that are going to have an immediate and beneficial impact on our ability to conduct business in the region. If APEC does not begin to undertake these types of activities, I think it is going to lose its growing credibility with business, both in the U.S. and in the region, and the nascent business support you are seeing for APEC is going to evaporate.
<p>
Second, APEC really needs to strengthen its ties with business. There has been some general agreement that business has been the driving force behind the tremendous growth we have seen in the region in the last decade. Business is going to continue to do its part to drive that growth and create jobs, but we can do that better in partnership with the public sector through APEC in breaking down some of the barriers that you referred to. That is going to take a great deal of effort, because I'm not convinced that all of the APEC economies really want business input into the process. It is clear the U.S. is looking for it. Australia is looking for it. But I think there is a definite lack of interest in business participation by some of the other members.
<p>
Looking to the Osaka meetings, which are coming up in just about two weeks, there are three very broad things we would like to see. First of all, we need to see a clear road map on how we are going to get to free trade and investment in the region by 2010 and 2020. This would include time lines, milestones, and frequent progress reviews so that we can see exactly who is living up to their commitments, who is not living up to their commitments, and whether APEC as a whole is moving in the right direction. Declarations of intent and promises to do things next year and the year after simply aren't good enough any more.
<p>
Second, at Osaka we need to see a series of steps announced which prove APEC is serious about this trade and investment liberalization agenda. I think these can be small things. They don't all have to be focused on the tariff area. We can accelerate the work they have done in the customs area. We can look at visa-free entry for business travelers. You could look at further work on the rather weak investment principles that were adopted in Jakarta last year, look at continued work on intellectual property. These things are not difficult. They don't cost money, and with a little bit of political will by the leaders, I think they could be done.
<p>
Third, as I mentioned earlier, we need to strengthen this partnership between business and APEC, and there are two main ways I think that can be done. PBF has recommended that a successor organization to our group be established, which would be an official advisory group by regional business to the APEC leaders and ministers. I think there is a lot of debate about how that is going to come out.
<p>
In addition to that formal advisory group, APEC really does need to reach out, whether they want to or not, and get business involved in the working groups -- the ten that you mentioned, some of the programs you mentioned -- on an ongoing basis. Getting a report from business once a year will not keep APEC on the right track. They need to include businessmen in the official discussions; they need to include business in all of their meetings on an ongoing basis. Otherwise, I think we are going to see APEC waver from the path they are setting this year.
<P>
In conclusion, I want to say that I think APEC really is a remarkable organization. It has come a lot further, a lot faster, than anyone might have imagined. We are always intoning this mantra:  that APEC's been around six years and, by God, it better do something this year or we're going to walk away from it. But if you look at it, APEC has been around for only six years. I think it has come rather far for an organization of 18 countries of very disparate levels of economic development, disparate languages and cultures. I think we need to support APEC -- give them a little more time than we have so far.
<P>
Let me make one last observation. I mentioned earlier about keeping the U.S. involved in Asia. There seems to be a big debate these days on Asian values and Western values, and on differences between our philosophies and our ways of doing things. This is usually in the context of why APEC must fail or why ultimately the East and West cannot work together. Well, the PBF was 34 people from 18 different economies, different economic backgrounds, different outlooks, yet over time we all learned to respect each other, to respect each other's points of view. We have worked in great harmony and, in the true spirit of APEC, achieved consensus and mutual respect. We produced a report which every person put their signature on. If this represents the future of the region, I am really very optimistic that we are going to be able to work together in a long and productive partnership, both as business and as government. Thank you.
<p>
<b>BARBARA FRANKLIN:</b>  Dan Amstutz became president and CEO of the North American Export Grain Association in Washington last April. For three years previous to that, he was executive director of the International Wheat Council in London. Earlier, he had been in the Reagan Administration for six years, first as undersecretary of Agriculture for international affairs and commodity programs and then as ambassador and chief negotiator for agriculture in the GATT Uruguay Round trade negotiations. He was one of the key architects of the U.S. agriculture position in that round. When that round started, one of the U.S.'s major objectives was to have trade in agriculture products covered by GATT -- now WTO -- rules, and that was accomplished. Before that, Dan was with Goldman Sachs. He also was with Cargill for 25 years, the culmination of which was his serving as president and CEO of Cargill Investor Services in Chicago. We particularly wanted somebody who knew the agriculture sector around the world on this panel, given the divisions within APEC about that issue, so we are eager to hear from you.
<p>
<b>DAN AMSTUTZ:</b>  Thank you, Barbara. Phil mentioned that some opine that, perhaps, here in America these days we focus too much on Asia to the exclusion of the rest of the world. But from an agricultural perspective, probably we do not focus enough. When one looks at the demographic and economic outlook, it is staggering. Just to pass on a few things that most of you have heard before, it is highly likely that the world's population by 2025 will increase by 50 percent over current levels; it is reasonable to expect that at that time some 35 percent of the world's people will live in only two countries, China and India; so, within a generation, half the number of people that live in the entire world now may be living in China and India alone.
<P>
The economic scenario is equally exciting. Currently, the five largest economies in the world are the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, and France. In the year 2020, when trade liberalization is supposed to be accomplished in the APEC, the five largest economies of the world, with the exception of the United States, will be Asian:  China, Japan, India, and Indonesia. France will be ninth largest, behind Germany, Korea, and Thailand, and Britain will be the fourteenth largest, behind Russia and barely ahead of Mexico. Canada, currently part of the G-7, will not even be in the list of the top 15. It appears that the OECD is rapidly becoming irrelevant and that it will have to be replaced by a new grouping, but that is a different subject.
<p>
Consider just one example of why agriculture is so interested in Asia. This is an OECD estimate. If China, India, and Indonesia grow by an average of 6 percent a year economically, which is entirely feasible, and their income distribution remains unchanged from current levels, by the year 2010 some 700 million people in those countries will have an average income equal to Spain today. That is 600 million more than at present. The interesting thing about that number, 700 million, is that it is roughly equal to the current combined populations of the United States, the European Union, and Japan. So in a half a generation, a sophisticated market equal in size to Europe, the U.S., and Japan will develop in China, India, and Indonesia. For the agriculture sector, that is a lot of business:  a lot of meat and a lot of all kinds of food products. It presents an exciting outlook for trade expansion.
<P>
The agriculture industry in this country, by and large, is very much in favor of trade liberalization. We believe, as an industry, that trade negotiations must be comprehensive; otherwise, they are self-defeating. That means that all industries must be involved, and all segments of each industry, and that all barriers, all forms of protection, must be addressed.
<P>
The magic of trade negotiations is the concept of reciprocity, and unless you have a comprehensive negotiation, the magic of reciprocity breaks down. How in the world can you expect the U.S. to agree to liberalize import barriers for textiles and apparel, for example, if it is not going to enjoy better market access for some products in which it has a comparative advantage, namely, in agriculture?  The conclusion must be clear:  There would be no progress.
<P>
The truth is that the history of trade negotiations, both bilateral and multilateral, has been one of addressing the subject almost on a case-by-case, product-by-product basis. The terminology is "request/offer."  Country A says, "Can you open the market for more tires that we produce here?"  And Country B says, "Maybe we can do that, but what can you do about opening opportunities for the United Parcel Service?"  I use those two examples because I read that when President Zedillo was here from Mexico, these were trade issues that he discussed with President Clinton. With heads of state and heads of government meeting with each other, this is the process that has ensued. So product by product, service by service, progress is made, but slowly. The objective of a multilateral approach is to expand markets quickly, to allow for the generation of more wealth and more buying power quickly. That can be accomplished, in my judgment, only if we follow a truly comprehensive approach.
<p>
It goes without saying that when that kind of approach is endorsed, there will be some displacement of industries in various countries. It goes without saying that there is an enormous need for retraining, for restructuring, for redeveloping industries. And that becomes a national obligation, both by government and by the private sector. The reason for reluctance, and the reason countries ask for flexibility in the approach to trade negotiation, is they do not want to face those necessities. But the payoff is more opportunity, more access, more growth for more industries. This was what we preached at the beginning of the Uruguay Round, and I am proud that we were able to maintain agriculture on a comprehensive basis during that round.
<P>
I might add that, even in my industry, there are losers from this, and there are some that say, "Wait a minute, let's show some flexibility," as the government of Japan currently says. Certainly, the textile industry of this country would like to slow down the flow of textiles and apparel into the United States. And certainly, as we have trade liberalization, there is going to be a need for some restructuring and retraining and redevelopment in that industry here in the U.S. But there are always new services and new products that can be developed and for which there can be a market around the world. Again, the question is, "How quickly, how rapidly, can world economies expand?"  And the payoff from trade liberalization is that more countries are shipping more goods and services, and more wealth is indeed generated. That is what we're searching for.
<p>
We don't need an APEC to do that, I guess, but I'm here to tell you that an APEC really facilitates it, and really permits it to work much more effectively and much more rapidly. Is APEC competing with the World Trade Organization?  Not at all. It is facilitating it and advancing the objectives of trade liberalization more rapidly.
<p>
Can there be sensitivity to weak economies in this?  The term for this in trade negotiations is S&D, special and differential:  special and differential treatment for economies that are developing more slowly, special and differential treatment for industries that have particular problems in various countries. Of course there can be, and APEC is on a dual track in this regard:  2010 for the developed countries, 2020 for the developing. And there can be flexibility shown within that -- although I should not use the word "flexibility," because it's a buzz term for exclusions, and I want to speak out forcefully against that.
<p>
Within any industry there are some that will say, "Well, let's not rush too rapidly into this because we'll make some of our very good customers unhappy."  The truth is, the best customer in the world for American agriculture is Japan. By far. And I can tell you that we in American agriculture value the markets in Japan very much. We need them, we would like them to grow, and we want to help in that effort, in that pursuit. To use the word "reciprocity" again, we're very eager to help Japan's market outlets in this country grow as well.
<P>
The fainthearted cannot prevail these days on these subjects. You really cannot have your cake and eat it too; you either support overall growth in trade, or you opt for what I would say is a no-growth situation. So, again, to sum up, the opportunities for all involved in trade expansion in all the APEC countries -- certainly in agriculture -- are dramatic and exciting. We can have optimum realization of these opportunities for all only if APEC plows forward with a truly comprehensive approach. Then the magic of reciprocity will really work. It is for all of us who are not in government to urge our governments to press hard for this, and I think we will all be pleased with the results in the years ahead.

<h3>FULFILLING THE PROMISE OF NAFTA: A NEW STRATEGY FOR U.S.-MEXICAN RELATIONS</h3>

Backgrounder No. 1070<br>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere. With both eyes focused firmly on domestic U.S. politics, the Administration has dropped trade expansion from its Latin American policy agenda while adopting a more aggressive stance not only against illegal immigration from Mexico, but against drug trafficking in the Americas.<sup>1</sup>  However, the Administration is not alone in its retreat from free trade. In Congress, some longtime free traders from both parties are also backpedaling from trade expansion and from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Populist proponents of protectionism have tapped into voter anxieties about the health of the U.S. economy and job security by misrepresenting NAFTA as the cause of the Mexican peso crisis, declining manufacturing wages in the U.S., rising illegal immigration from Mexico, and increased drug trafficking.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;At one level, the Clinton Administration appears to understand the importance of foreign trade to the U.S. economy. The President's foreign policy team continues to extol the importance of free trade to America's economic interests. For example, Richard Brown, the White House coordinator for the Summit of the Americas, claims that the Administration has not retreated from the goal of completing negotiations for a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005. Brown also insists that the President has not given up on obtaining fast-track negotiating authority to include Chile in NAFTA<sup>2</sup>.  In practice, however, free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton Administration. During the past year, President Clinton has:
<ul><P>
<li>Reneged on his pledge to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996. The delay in Chile's admission to NAFTA has damaged America's credibility and leadership in the Western Hemisphere.
<p>
<li>Violated key provisions of NAFTA. For example, the Administration postponed indefinitely the implementation of provisions to permit the circulation of Mexican trucks in U.S. border states.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Dropping the ball on trade with Latin America is merely part of a larger problem with the President's Latin American policy. The Clinton Administration has never possessed a coherent vision of America's economic and security interests in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1993, bowing to pressure from American unions and environmental activist groups, the President delayed NAFTA's approval for a year while labor and environmental side agreements were imposed on Mexico and Canada. The Administration's invasion of Haiti in 1994 and secret immigration agreement with Cuba in 1995 likewise were undertaken in response to domestic political pressures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The damage is done. The task for American policymakers now is to correct the current drift in U.S. policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible. U.S. relations with Mexico must be repaired, NAFTA must be strengthened, and America must regain its dominant role in the process of hemispheric trade liberalization. To achieve these policy goals, the U.S. government should:
<ul><p>
<li><b>Comply with NAFTA.</b>The U.S. should fulfill all of its NAFTA obligations on schedule. By cheating on NAFTA, the Clinton Administration has established a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada, and other countries could follow in the future.
<p>
<li><B>Complete the NAFTA with Mexico. </B>The peso crisis demonstrated the high degree of interdependence between the U.S. and Mexican economies. It also showed that NAFTA is an incomplete pact. Some of NAFTA's most important provisions have yet to be negotiated by the U.S. and Mexico. These include such issues as currency unification, forgiveness of the Mexican government's foreign debt, immigration, and labor and law enforcement problems.
<p>
<li><B>Expand NAFTA.</B> Since the end of the Cold War, free trade and support for democracy have been the pillars of U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. The Clinton Administration's retreat from NAFTA's expansion has left the U.S. without a coherent foreign policy for Latin America and sidelined from the ongoing process of trade liberalization in South America. NAFTA must grow to remain vibrant and alive. Expanding NAFTA to include Chile and other countries would maintain the momentum for expanding free trade in the Americas and beyond, including at a later time Asian countries that qualify.
<p>
<li><B>Encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board. </B>The creation of a currency board in Mexico would stabilize the peso, reduce inflation and interest rates, and restore confidence in Mexico and NAFTA.
<p>
<li><B>Offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexico's public sector foreign debt. </B>This offer should be extended in return for an irrevocable pledge by Mexico to end all future international borrowing by government entities, not to take any more money from the IMF and World Bank, and to rely only on private investment to drive Mexico's economic development.
<P>
<li><B>Offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking. </B>The rise of these drug cartels threatens the national security of both Mexico and the United States.
</ul><p>
<b>THE TRUTH ABOUT NAFTA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since the peso's collapse on December 20, 1994, Mexico has been suffering its worst economic and political crisis in more than a century. The peso's meltdown sank the myth of Mexico as the standard-bearer of economic reform in the Third World. The &quot;200,000 net new jobs&quot; promised by the Clinton Administration have not materialized, and the U.S. is running a trade deficit with Mexico estimated at $15.83 billion for all of 1995.<sup>3</sup>  Instead of a prosperous partner, Mexico has become a financial ward of the U.S. government. As a result, many Americans now believe that NAFTA caused the Mexican peso crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nothing could be further from the truth. NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency. A series of political shocks in 1994 caused a sustained run on the peso by nervous Mexican and foreign investors<sup>4</sup>.  But instead of raising domestic interest rates and cutting public spending, the Salinas administration sharply increased public spending and used the country's international reserves to support an overvalued peso. As a result, the peso collapsed. Moreover, it was the devaluation of the peso that crashed the Mexican economy and cheapened the value of Mexican exports. These cheaper Mexican exports account for the U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious. Thanks to NAFTA, those who favored returning to a closed, statist economy were kept at bay while President Zedillo was able to keep the country on course to capitalist democracy. NAFTA is still the best guarantee that Mexico will become a true capitalist democracy and prosperous trading partner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and U.S. Competitiveness. </b>NAFTA is the best way to stimulate America's growth and competitiveness. Mexico is America's fastest-growing export market and third largest trading partner, as well as a key factor in the international competitiveness of many U.S. industries that have established manufacturing and assembly plants in Mexico since the 1960s. These plants enable U.S. manufacturers to compete against low-wage manufactures from China and other Asian countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate 2.5 times greater than U.S. export growth to the rest of the world<sup>5</sup>.  From 1987 to 1993, 48 of the 50 states expanded their merchandise sales to Latin America and the Caribbean, with Mexico absorbing the largest absolute share each year; 17 states expanded their exports to Mexico and Latin America by more than 200 percent during this period, and 15 recorded export growth of more than 100 percent. The biggest state exporters to Mexico and Latin America are Texas, Florida, California, Michigan, New York, Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana<sup>6</sup>.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America each year, with Mexico absorbing more than half of the total. These exports represent 19 percent of all U.S. merchandise exports and support nearly 1.96 million U.S. jobs. During the first year of NAFTA's implementation in 1994, U.S. exports to Mexico and Canada climbed rapidly. Merchandise exports to Canada, America's largest trading partner, grew by more than 13 percent to $114 billion, while exports to Mexico increased over 22 percent to $51 billion. U.S. exports to Mexico fell by 8.8 percent during 1995 as a result of the peso crisis but at the end of the year still remained well above the total for 1993, the last year before NAFTA went into effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Production-sharing operations along the U.S.-Mexican border, known as <I>maquiladoras</I>, are an important competitive strategy for many American firms competing in the U.S. domestic market with goods made by low-cost Asian producers. For example, products assembled in Mexico's <I>maquiladora</I> industries from U.S.-made components accounted for 48 percent of U.S. imports from Mexico in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and America's National Security</b>. NAFTA is very important to U.S. national security. Illegal immigration and drug trafficking are perceived increasingly as threats to this security. By a very large majority, Americans want their government to control and reduce illegal immigration and stop the flow of illegal drugs entering the U.S.<sup>8</sup>  Moreover, the Mexican peso crisis fanned the American public's concern that the U.S. is being overwhelmed by a flood of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly 3 million Mexicans enter the U.S. illegally each year.<sup>9</sup>  More than 80 percent of the cocaine brought into America is transported through Mexico by Mexican drug cartels. Mexican police investigators have disclosed that drug traffickers penetrated the highest levels of the Salinas Administration. Drug-related corruption is widespread within the PRI, Mexico's ruling party, especially at the state level. The police, courts, and military also have been corrupted by Mexican drug traffickers whose operations generate profits in excess of $30 billion a year. 
<P>
NAFTA is America's most valuable foreign policy tool in managing these security threats on its southern flank. In addition to accelerating Mexico's transformation into a capitalist democracy, NAFTA is a foundation on which to develop effective cross-border agreements to deal with the twin threats of illegal immigration and drug trafficking in both countries. With NAFTA promoting closer economic ties between the U.S. and Mexico, governments in both countries will face increased pressure from their respective constituencies to work out effective solutions for cross-border problems that hinder trade, economic growth, and competitiveness.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>NAFTA and Democracy in Mexico. </b>NAFTA is an important anchor for reform in Mexico. The closed, one-party system that spurred Mexico's economic development and guaranteed the country's political stability for over six decades is coming apart at the seams. A pluralist democracy is emerging, but the old statist regime will not surrender quickly or quietly. On January 12, 1996, 255 of the 298 representatives of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) publicly called on the government to &quot;abandon neo-liberalism and grant priority to action against poverty and unemployment.&quot;<sup>10</sup>  Similar demands are being made by other groups, including the left-wing PRD, small and medium business, the rebels in Chiapas, consumer debtor organizations, and farmers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite these pressures, President Zedillo has stood firm on Mexico's commitment to market-oriented policies, free trade, and compliance with NAFTA. Zedillo's main political priorities are to encourage the growth of a pluralist and open democracy, establish the rule of law, reform Mexico's judicial system, and eradicate widespread police corruption at the national and local level. Without NAFTA, Zedillo's chances of advancing these political reforms would be very poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>NAFTA and a Free Trade Area of the Americas. </B>NAFTA is the foundation upon which the U.S. can negotiate free-trade agreements with other Latin American countries. Latin America is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, and the U.S. has been one of the principal beneficiaries of that growth. For over six years, Latin American governments have pursued aggressive policies to liberalize trade. As a result, America's exports to other countries in the Western Hemisphere (including Canada) have increased over 50 percent since 1990, growing from $137 billion to nearly $207 billion in 1994 and creating 1.4 million new jobs for American workers. Overall, two-way trade between the U.S. and the Western Hemisphere jumped over 44 percent between 1990 and 1994, from $292.8 billion to $423 billion. U.S. exports to Latin America accounted for one-fifth of total U.S. exports during 1994. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, for free trade between the U.S. and Latin America to continue growing, NAFTA must be expanded quickly to other countries in the Western Hemisphere, starting with Chile and Argentina. It also should be expanded to include countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore that want to liberalize trade faster than currently envisioned by the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;NAFTA is the linchpin of U.S. relations with Latin America and the Caribbean.<sup>11</sup>  It assumes that the best way to achieve both sustained economic development and stable democracy is to expand international trade. The emerging capitalist democracies of Latin America and the Caribbean have embraced free trade and NAFTA without reservations, providing the U.S. an unparalleled foreign policy tool for the expansion of free trade, the consolidation of democracy, and the reaffirmation of American leadership in the Western Hemisphere. NAFTA is also the benchmark trade agreement for the creation by 2005 of a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA). As long as NAFTA's expansion remains stalled, the U.S. has no effective Latin America policy.

<b>MEXICO HAS NOT TURNED THE CORNER</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration claims that the worst of the Mexican crisis has passed. Mexico's external accounts are once again in balance, exports soared in 1995, the peso has risen, inflation is slowing, and interest rates have eased from their peak levels of 80 percent to 100 percent in early 1995. Moreover, Mexico has raised over $6 billion from international capital markets since the peso collapsed, and the Zedillo government is meeting the deadlines for repaying the money it owes to the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF). <sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;However, the Clinton Administration's claim that Mexico has &quot;turned the corner&quot;<sup>13</sup> is premature. The Mexican economy contracted between 6 percent and 8 percent during 1995.<sup>14</sup>  Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz admits that 1995 was the worst year for Mexico since the revolution<sup>15</sup>, although he also projects that the Mexican economy will grow 3 percent in 1996. Yet most private analysts forecast slower growth, more devaluation, and higher inflation because Mexico's banking system is still very weak. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Mexican government already has spent $6.5 billion to bail out the banking system and may have to spend another $10.9 billion during 1996 to keep the system afloat.  In all, the cost of bailing out Mexico's banking system could add up to $20 billion, or more than 12 percent of Mexico's GNP for 1995. Salomon Brothers, the New York-based investment bank, estimates that 30 percent of the Mexican banking system's debts are non-performing.<sup>17</sup>  Moreover, the system's problems may be worse than they appear to be, because Mexican banks book only the interest on past-due loans and not the entire loan, including the principal, as U.S. banks are required to list in their accounting.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another problem for the Mexican economy is the political weakness of President Zedillo. Two national polls conducted in November 1995<sup>19</sup> found that three-quarters of Mexico's voters approve of Zedillo's honesty and commitment to democracy but they give him poor marks on political leadership and ability to manage the economy. Two-thirds of the respondents in both polls disapproved of how Zedillo was governing the country, and over 80 percent said that he should change his cabinet. More than half of those surveyed felt the first two ministries to be changed should be the Finance Ministry and the Trade and Industrial Development Ministry. Compared to a similar poll conducted three months earlier,<sup>20</sup> the November poll indicated less confidence in Zedillo and increasing discontent with how he is managing Mexico's difficulties.
<p>
<b>A MEXICAN FREE-MARKET SOLUTION</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's $50 billion bailout has not halted Mexico's downward spiral of devaluation, depression, and eventual default. Clinton ignored the principles of free trade when he went to the aid of the Mexican government. The main beneficiaries were Wall Street speculators and Mexican banks and companies owned by business leaders close to the Salinas regime and the ruling PRI. Moreover, the Administration's decision to bail out Mexico with $20 billion from the U.S. Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund effectively underwrote the cost of refinancing the Mexican government's entire short-term debt without a U.S. congressional appropriation. Clinton's failed attempt to rescue Mexico also created a moral hazard: It signaled foreign governments and private investors that mistakes caused by political incompetence and corruption will be underwritten by American taxpayers through the U.S. Treasury, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of correcting the structural causes of the Mexican peso crisis, President Zedillo is repeating the errors of the Salinas administration. The policies of Finance Minister Ortiz are indistinguishable from those pursued by Pedro Aspe, his predecessor during the Salinas government. Pressured by the U.S. Treasury and the IMF, the Zedillo administration is following policies which are destroying Mexico's economy. The Zedillo government is doing everything it can to maintain the Wall Street fiction that Mexico is an investment-grade economy. At bottom, Zedillo's economic policies are intended to keep Mexico safe for portfolio investment, not to promote the sustained export growth that constitutes the only escape route from Mexico's current economic crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The central problem is that Mexico's financial technocrats refuse to consider a fixed exchange rate policy to achieve price stability. Since the peso's collapse, Mexico's central bank has implemented a floating exchange rate regime that allows the country's monetary authorities broad discretionary power to manipulate monetary and currency exchange policies. The problem with this policy is that Mexico's central bank lacks the credibility and international reserves to sustain itself without continued loans from the U.S. government and the IMF.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;To achieve price stability under its current floating exchange rate, the Bank of Mexico will have to impose a relatively tight monetary policy and high interest rates. Inevitably, this will be accompanied by very slow economic growth. A sluggish Mexican economy would depress export earnings and foreign investment, making it more difficult for the government to service its foreign debt obligations. Slow economic growth also would fuel increased political turmoil, a revival of statist economic prescriptions, and more illegal migration to the U.S. This could weaken support for NAFTA in both countries and increase cross-border tensions over sensitive issues like drug trafficking and illegal immigration. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Only Mexico can devise lasting solutions for the Mexican crisis. NAFTA is vitally important to Mexico's future economic prosperity and democratic stability, but it is only part of the equation. Mexico has yet to go the full distance to capitalist democracy. Moreover, it has yet to devise an effective economic model capable of delivering the sort of sustained growth Chile has managed to achieve since 1985. Natural resources, human capital, and access to technology are not the problems. Mexico has all three in abundance. Missing, however, is the bold, imaginative leadership capable of conceiving and executing a strategy to complete Mexico's transition to capitalist democracy. Ideally, such a strategy would involve five goals:
<p>
<b>1.) Restore confidence in Mexico by stabilizing the currency. </b>This requires replacing the Bank of Mexico with a currency board.<sup>21</sup>  To achieve sustained export growth and price stability, Mexico needs a sound monetary system, which a currency board would provide. The Bank of Mexico's floating exchange rate may be the favored option of Mexico's financial authorities, but it is fundamentally unsound because it allows arbitrary, discretionary control over Mexico's monetary and exchange problems. The principal goals of a currency board would be to fix the Mexican peso to the U.S. dollar and to eliminate the broad discretionary power (and lack of accountability) of Mexico's financial authorities to manipulate monetary and exchange policy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The establishment of a currency board would stabilize the peso virtually overnight and restore confidence in Mexico. It would do so by instituting a non-discretionary, rules-bound, and totally transparent currency exchange regime. A currency board would prohibit public spending above levels that threaten reserves, stimulate more foreign direct investment, and insulate the peso from political interference and bureaucratic tinkering, in addition to quickly reducing inflation and interest rates, thereby spurring an increase in real long-term productive investment in Mexico.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More than 70 countries have used currency boards. In all cases, these boards have produced stable currencies that keep inflation at substantially low levels. No currency board has ever devalued its local money against its reserve currency. Argentina has been using a variant of the currency board since 1991. In every country where a currency board has been established, governments have succeeded in killing the deadly virus of high inflation, lowering local interest rates to manageable levels, and encouraging direct foreign investment in the local economy. The creation of a currency board in Mexico would be the first step in a Mexican free-market solution for the Mexican crisis.<sup>22</sup>
<p>
<b>2.) Break Mexico's addiction to foreign debt. </b>This means restructuring Mexico's banking sector. Standard &amp; Poor's estimates that the bailout of Mexico's private banks will cost the equivalent of 12 percent of the country's 1995 GNP.<sup>23</sup>  Debt relief programs created by the Zedillo administration will not work under the current floating exchange rate because higher inflation from the ongoing devaluation of the peso caused by the banking crisis, along with the continuing need to cheapen Mexico's exports, will cause Mexico's domestic debts to increase more rapidly than the ability of debtors to repay them. Moreover, Mexico cannot increase its borrowings from the IMF because it already has exceeded, by a factor of nearly 20, its allowable credit ceiling under existing IMF rules. Complicating matters even more, in November 1995 the Clinton Administration rejected a formal Mexican request for more financial assistance to bail out the banking system.<sup>24</sup>  As a result, the Zedillo government may be tempted to print more pesos to rescue the banks, driving up inflation and keeping interest rates at high levels. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A currency board would create the stable price environment that Mexican banks need to recapitalize and restructure their domestic credit portfolios. Bad debts could be winnowed out of bank portfolios and written off. Collectable consumer and corporate debt could be restructured and securitized,<sup>25</sup> creating a secondary market where domestic debt paper could be traded at a discount. However, the government also should lift all remaining limits on ownership of banks and other commercial enterprises.<sup>26</sup>
<p>
<B>3.) Promote sustained economic growth. </B>A key to achieving this goal is liberalizing Mexico's national oil industry.<sup>27</sup>  The Mexican government owns 100 percent of the country's oil and natural gas industry. On February 12, 1996, the Mexican government announced its new energy program for the next five years. The plan is a restatement of Mexico's traditionally anti-market, monopolistic approach to energy development. <sup>28</sup> Jesus Reyes Heroles, president of the state oil monopoly <I>Petroleos Mexicanos</I> (Pemex), predicts that Mexico will attract $6.3 billion in foreign investment in petrochemicals, power plants, and natural gas companies. However, declared Reyes Heroles, no private investment will be permitted in upstream exploration, production, and refining of oil. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For Mexico, a better alternative would be to follow the example of more efficient and successful state-owned oil companies. A good model is <I>Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA),</I> which is implementing a mixed-economy expansion program to develop the country's oil and gas reserves.<sup>29</sup>  Without giving up ownership of Mexico's oil and gas reserves, Pemex could contract with small private operators to exploit older and smaller oil and gas reservoirs that are uneconomic for Pemex to operate commercially. In addition, Pemex could enter into long-term associations with large international oil companies to find and develop major oil and gas reservoirs which Pemex is not financially or technologically capable of exploiting by itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As oil and gas export earnings increase, part of the incremental profits could be reinvested in the expansion and modernization of Mexico's oil industry, and part could be deposited directly to the accounts of Mexican workers in privately managed pension funds. Such a strategy would represent a true &quot;nationalization&quot; of the Mexican oil industry, since it would transfer real oil wealth directly to workers and their families, creating a fast-growth domestic savings industry to finance Mexico's economic development with internal savings rather than with crippling external debt. 
<p>
<b>4.) Increase disposable income. </b>Mexico's income tax rate should be cut and income thresholds increased. The top tax rate of 35 percent takes hold at very low levels of income. To spur investment, Mexico should extend its current zero percent capital gains tax rate on large stock exchange companies to all investments.<sup>30</sup>

<p>
<b>5.) Create better legal and political institutions for economic growth. </b>This requires both judicial and political reform. The rule of law and transparent democratic institutions are essential for the well-being and prosperity of successful capitalist democracies. President Zedillo has pledged massive overhaul of the judicial and political systems in Mexico, but efforts on both fronts are not progressing quickly, largely because of increased political discontent and resistance to change fueled by the current economic depression.
<p>
<b>REASSERTING AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The current drift in U.S. policy toward Mexico and Latin America is dangerous. The Clinton Administration is projecting an image of retreat. In Mexico, still struggling to overcome its economic difficulties and recover its political stability, there is widespread concern about the depth of Washington's commitment to NAFTA. Throughout Latin America, political leaders trying to promote unpopular free-market reforms are questioning the sincerity of the Clinton Administration's pledge that the U.S. would lead the process of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas. The longer America's policy drift continues, the greater the risk that hard-won economic and democratic reforms will be stalled or even rolled back in some countries. Moreover, if Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide. To regain the initiative in Latin America, the U.S. government should: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Comply with NAFTA. </b> The Clinton Administration should respect NAFTA's provisions and timetables for implementation. By cheating on NAFTA, the Administration has established a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada, and other countries could follow in the future. Permits for Mexican trucks to circulate in the U.S. border states should be issued without further delay if the vehicles comply with all technical, safety, and legal requirements as stipulated in NAFTA.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Complete the NAFTA with Mexico.</B>The peso crisis demonstrated the high degree of interdependence between the U.S. and Mexican economies. It also showed that NAFTA is an incomplete pact. Some of NAFTA's most important provisions have yet to be negotiated by the U.S. and Mexico, including currency unification, forgiveness of the Mexican government's public-sector debt, illegal immigration, and labor and law enforcement problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and other countries. </B>Since the end of the Cold War, free trade and support for democracy have been the pillars of U.S. foreign policy toward Latin America. The Clinton Administration's retreat from NAFTA's expansion has left the U.S. without a coherent foreign policy for Latin America and sidelined from the ongoing process of trade liberalization in South America. Thus, NAFTA should be expanded to include Chile, and later to include Asian countries that qualify.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Chile is a beacon of economic prosperity and democracy for all of Latin America. It has set the standard for success in the region by achieving average growth rates of 6 percent annually every year since 1985, along with inflation of less than 8 percent, unemployment of 5 percent, and savings and domestic investment of 27 percent of GDP. Postponing Chile's admission to NAFTA would slow hemispheric trade integration and weaken American leadership.<sup>31</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Asian countries also should be considered for NAFTA membership. Some members of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, such as Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore, are willing to liberalize trade at a much faster pace than is currently envisioned by APEC and may wish to negotiate free trade agreements with the U.S. as quickly as possible. Instead of a series of separate bilateral pacts, incorporating Australia, New Zealand, and Singapore into NAFTA would make sense.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board. </b>The current Mexican experiment with a floating exchange rate will fail eventually.<sup>32</sup>  The U.S. should encourage Mexico to adopt a currency board that would fix the peso's exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. The creation of a currency board would stabilize the peso, reduce inflation and interest rates, and restore confidence in Mexico and NAFTA. Under a currency board, if a run on the peso occurred, the worst that could happen would be the total dollarization of Mexico, since trading would take place in U.S. dollars while the currency board held the stock of Mexican pesos.<sup>33</sup> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexico's public sector foreign debt. </B>This offer should be extended in return for an irrevocable pledge by Mexico to end all future international borrowing by government entities, not to take any more money from the IMF and World Bank, and to rely only on private investment to drive Mexico's economic development. There is no moral hazard in forgiving Mexico's entire public sector foreign debt, since it will never be repaid in full anyway. Moreover, writing off the public-sector's foreign debt would free Mexico from the IMF's destructive clutches.<sup>34</sup>  The IMF's record in Mexico, an IMF borrower since 1976, has been impoverishment, indebtedness, and dependency.<sup>35</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>Offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking. </B>For many years, America's war on drugs in the Western Hemisphere has concentrated on the Andean drug trade, with special emphasis on Colombia, while largely ignoring the closer threat of Mexican drug traffickers. However, since the mid-1980s, 19 distinct drug cartels have emerged in Mexico.<sup>36</sup>  President Salinas himself admitted that the annual flow of cocaine and other illicit drugs through Mexico totals some $100 billion annually. The rise of these drug cartels threatens the national security of both Mexico and the United States. The U.S. and Mexico should begin talks to enhance cooperation in apprehending and prosecuting illegal drug traffickers.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Mexican peso crisis weakened support in America for NAFTA, damaged U.S.-Mexico relations, and halted further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Americas for at least the next two years. Moreover, the crisis in Mexico is not over yet: Clinton's $50 billion bailout of the Zedillo government kept Mexico from defaulting on its foreign debt obligations in 1995, but Mexico's downward economic spiral was not reversed. The economic policies of the Zedillo government will not achieve the structural reforms that Mexico needs to avoid another currency collapse. The market's recent surge of optimism in Mexico's recovery therefore may prove to be very short-lived.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the Mexican crisis continues, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow. Conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking easily could displace cooperation on trade and investment. More crisis in Mexico also will fuel opposition in both countries to NAFTA and free trade, possibly delaying NAFTA's implementation in North America and derailing its expansion to other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<I>The Economist</I> argues that NAFTA is one of the principal factors responsible for &quot;a second Mexican revolution,&quot;<sup>37</sup> and asserts that Mexico's successful transformation into a stable capitalist democracy depends on its becoming &quot;more like America.&quot;<sup>38</sup>  More than that of any other country in Latin America, Mexico's future is tied, for better or worse, to the future of the United States. However, the American goal of creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), based on NAFTA's expansion to all democratic countries in the Western Hemisphere, depends on the quick return of economic and political stability to Mexico. As long as the crisis continues in Mexico, it will be difficult for any U.S. Administration to rebuild bipartisan congressional support for NAFTA's expansion and regain public trust and support for free trade. The U.S. needs to work with Mexico, through NAFTA, to help end this economic crisis.

Although McCaffrey's appointment did not cause any reaction in the U.S., throughout Latin America it was widely seen as a sign that the Clinton Administration plans to militarize the hemispheric war on drugs. Another first was the Administration's decision to deploy local law enforcement officers alongside federal agents already patrolling the U.S. border with Mexico, and to increase the use of armed forces personnel as support for the U.S. Border Patrol.

<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Reagan Administration understood that support for democracy and the hemispheric expansion of free trade was the foundation of future U.S. relations with Latin America. During the two Reagan Administrations, the Caribbean Basin Initiative was launched, and the groundwork was laid for a new relationship between the U.S. and Mexico based on the expansion of bilateral trade and investment, closer economic interdependence, and progressive economic liberalization in Mexico. In 1988, the U.S. and Canada signed a Free Trade Agreement that later would serve as the foundation for NAFTA. The Bush Administration's Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, launched in 1989, outlined a blueprint for creating a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA); the first step in achieving the goal of a hemispheric FTAA was the negotiation of the NAFTA with Mexico. When the Clinton Administration was inaugurated in 1993, the NAFTA talks between the U.S., Mexico, and Canada already had been completed. Clinton delayed NAFTA's implementation until 1994 while unnecessary labor and environmental side agreements were negotiated with Mexico and Canada. Moreover, at the Summit of the Americas, Clinton reaffirmed long&#173;standing U.S. policy that NAFTA should be the standard for creating a hemispheric FTAA.
<p><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January 29, 1996, the Mexican government repaid the U.S. Treasury $1.3 billion in short&#173;term swaps issued under the U.S.&#173;Mexico Framework Agreement announced by the Clinton Administration on February 21, 1995. In all, $13.5 billion in U.S. funds was disbursed to Mexico from the ESF, of which $10.5 billion in medium&#173;term swaps remains outstanding. The ESF, created by the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, has been used since the 1973 demise of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate regime to intervene in foreign exchange markets and finance short&#173;term loans to developed and developing countries. As of early 1995, the ESF held about $25 billion. The ESF is not financed with regular appropriations from Congress, so it &quot;borrows&quot; from the Federal Reserve when it needs additional funds. These loans are &quot;warehoused&quot; at the Federal Reserve, where the Treasury stores its foreign currencies in exchange for dollars that must be repaid later.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A currency board issues a local currency fully backed by reserve assets denominated in a widely used and respected foreign currency, such as the U.S. dollar. Under a currency board, the peso could be converted into the reserve currency &#173;&#173; in this case the dollar &#173;&#173; at a pre&#173;established fixed rate at any of the board's offices; the local currency supply could expand only in proportion to an increase in net exports or capital inflows; and the board's reserves could be invested in high&#173;quality, interest&#173;bearing notes and bonds denominated in the reserve currency.

During this period, Mexico rescheduled large amounts of public&#173;sector debt principal, including $19 billion in 1983, $30 billion in 1985, $45 billion in 1987, and $48 billion in 1990, for a total of $123 billion. Yet the Brady Plan, praised in some quarters as the solution to Mexico's debt problems, succeeded in extinguishing only $15 billion of Mexico's foreign debt, or about 16 percent of Mexico's total foreign debt as of 1989.

<p>
<h3>ABOUT ISSUES `96</h3>
</center><P>
<P><I>Issues `96</I> is intended as a handbook for conservative candidates 
of all parties seeking national office.
<P>
<P><I>Issues `96</I> is broken down into sections, one dealing with 
domestic issues likely to be part of the debate, and the other dealing 
with foreign policy and defense issues. Each section begins with a 
general introduction.
<P>
<P>Each chapter follows a general structure (with some variation 
in the foreign policy section). The chapter first summarizes the 
principal issues considered likely to be raised during the election. 
The main body of the chapter then provides candidate-friendly 
statistics and other information to help frame the debate. Following 
this is a summary of the record of the 104th Congress and the 
Clinton Administration on the issue, and a set of policy 
recommendations for 1997. Finally, chapters include a question-and-answer 
section dealing with questions likely to be raised during the debate. 
The information in each chapter is fully footnoted for reference, and 
a list of experts and relevant Heritage publications is included.
<P>
<P>The material in each chapter is as up-to-date as possible. 
<I>Issues `96</I> went into final production in mid-February; whenever 
possible, policy developments since that time have been noted. Updates 
will be issued if there are developments that affect key parts of a 
chapter. These updates can be obtained from The Heritage 
Foundation Government Relations Department or through the 
Heritage Internet home page.

<h3>Chapter 2 footnotes</h3>
<P>



<P><B><A HREF="chpt2.html">Return to Chapter 2</A></B></P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="1">1</A></B></TT>	The 2.9 percent Medicare tax, as
explained above, applies to all income. The 12.4  percent Social Security tax,
however, applies only  to the first $61,600 of income (the reason being that
Social Security is somewhat akin to  an insurance premium; taxing additional
income would have the effect of boosting the  retirement benefits of those who
had higher  incomes during their working years).
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="2">2</A></B></TT>	This section is derived largely 
(though updated) from Robert Rector, &quot;How to  Strengthen America's
Crumbling Families,&quot; Heritage  Foundation <CITE><U>Backgrounder</U></CITE>
No. 894, April 28, 1992.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="3">3</A></B></TT>	Liberal and conservative economists 
agree that both shares of the Social Security tax  are in fact taxes on workers'
wages. See Joseph A. Pechman and Benjamin A. Okner, 
<U><CITE>Who Bears the Tax Burden?</CITE></U>  (Washington, D.C.: The 
Brookings Institution, 1974), pp. 2543.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="4">4</A></B></TT>	Data from the U.S. Bureau of the 
Census. Total pretax income includes the employer  share of Social Security tax
deducted from the  worker's wages. In this case, the median income for  a family
of four in 1994 is $47,012. Adding $3,596 from the employer's share of payroll 
taxes brings the gross family income to $56,608. 
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="5">5</A></B></TT>	<U><CITE>1994 Annual Report of the
Board of  Trustees of the Federal OldAge and Survivors Insurance and Disability
Insurance Trust  Funds</CITE></U>, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  April 12, 1994.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="6">6</A></B></TT>	This is not to suggest that 
politicians should be given power to invest the funds.  Such a policy inevitably
would result in political manipulation, as surplus funds would be  steered to
politically wellconnected industries  and used to bail out businesses in the
states and districts of senior lawmakers.  A governmentcontrolled retirement
system, by definition, must be operated on a  payasyougo basis.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="7">7</A></B></TT> The chart shows a decline in tax 
collections in the early 1980s, but this occurred  as a result of the 19811982
recession (which started, incidentally, before Reagan's  first fiscal year
began). Moreover, this decline  in revenue also took place before there was a
tax cut. The Reagan economic package was  approved in the summer of 1981, but
the tax cut  was phased in over several years and not fully implemented until
1985. The tax burden  actually rose in Reagan's first year in office, as the
minor tax cut in 1981 was overwhelmed  by previously legislated payroll tax
increases and inflationinduced bracket creep  (indexing to protect taxpayers
from inflation did not  go into effect until 1985). The 1982 portion of the tax
cut was more significant, but it  was roughly canceled out by bracket creep and
payroll tax changes.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="8">8</A></B></TT>	The Administration's $300perchild 
credit begins phasing out for families with  incomes above $60,000 and reaches
zero at $75,000  in family income. The credit increases in value to $500 per
child after 1998.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="9">9</A></B></TT>	For taxpayers filing jointly with 
incomes above $110,000, the credit phases out at a  rate of $25 for each $1,000
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), thus fully phasing out  at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children, the two credits are phased out fully  at
$150,000 in income. For single filers, the credit begins to phase out at $75,000
in  income.
</P>
<P><TT><B><A NAME="10">10</A></B></TT>	Clinton's 1997 budget has modified 
this provision, thus making more families eligible for his $300 tax credit.

the Laurence H. Meyer and Associates macroeconomic model of the United States
economy.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="14">14</A></TT></B>	This also means that income should 
be defined properly. Provisions which force taxpayers to overstate their income,
such as  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  alternative minimum tax, would be
repealed. Nor should taxpayers be forced to  undercount business expenses. As a
result,  &quot;depreciation&quot; would be replaced by expensing.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="15">15</A></TT></B>	Taxation is not the only government 
activity that inflates the cost of hiring workers and reduces takehome pay.
Myriad  regulations, mandated benefits, unemployment  compensation, liability
costs, and labor laws  drive up the cost of employment and shrink  workers' pay.
</P>
<P><B><TT><A NAME="16">16</A></TT></B>	This process usually works by 
delaying, reducing, or canceling wage increases. In  most years, additional
investment and training increase worker productivity, making  employees more
valuable and allowing businesses to  increases wages. When these productivity
increases are accompanied by higher taxes, however,  it is government, not the
workers, that captures all the benefits.

proposal, the Treasury Department admitted that &quot;no  attempt is made to
estimate the taxinduced behavioral responses of either individuals  or
corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating conventions used by both
the  Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the
macroeconomic aggregates,  such as the level of compensation, prices,
employment, and gross domestic product, have  been assumed to be unchanged by
the proposal.&quot;

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The presidential campaign has focused national attention on the flat tax. Some candidates in the Republican primary favor the flat tax, and even President Clinton, who currently does not support a single-rate tax system, advocates a fairer, simpler system.<sup>1</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This growing support for the flat tax and fundamental tax reform has enlivened critics who claim that a flat tax system will raise taxes on the middle class. To explore this argument, The Heritage Foundation analyzed the <a href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th?bill=(H ADJ R ADJ 2060)">flat tax proposal</a> put forward by Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), which includes a 17 percent tax, the same rate as proposed by Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes.<sup>2</sup> The analysis used the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the most detailed and complete publicly available database of individual income tax returns.<sup>3</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This analysis of the Armey-Shelby plan shows no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class Americans when compared with their current tax burden. In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups (see <a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a><sup>4</sup>). Among the key findings:<P>

<b>Question:</b> Does a 17 percent flat tax raise taxes on the middle class?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> No. The majority of taxpayers in every income bracket enjoys a tax cut under an Armey-Shelby flat tax with a 17 percent rate.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> If a married couple gross $60,000 in wages, how much will they save in taxes under a 17 percent flat tax?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> If they also have two children, they will save $2,488 in taxes. That is a 35 percent lower tax bill.<sup>6</sup>
<P>
<b>Question:</b> Does everyone pay the same flat tax rate, even the very rich?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Yes and no. Everyone faces the same 17 percent rate. However, the flat tax taxes only the difference of total income minus the generous family deduction ($33,300 for a family of four). Because the 17 percent tax is levied on the difference, families with incomes of $50,000 to $75,000 pay only 10 percent of their income, while families with incomes between $200,000 and $500,000 pay 16 percent of their income in taxes.
<P>
<b>Question:</b> If everyone gets a tax cut with a 17 percent flat tax, won't that mean lower tax revenues and higher deficits?  
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> While nearly all individuals pay less tax, many medium- and large-size businesses will pay more. Also, many prominent economists believe that a flat tax will produce a bigger economy, which should result in more federal tax revenues.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Since the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal eliminates the Earned Income Tax Credit, what happens to low-income taxpayers?  
<P>
<b>Answer:</b> The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) allows low-income taxpayers to claim a credit that generally eliminates their income tax liability and restores some of the income taxed away by the Social Security tax (clearly the largest tax most low-income families pay). The Armey-Shelby bill replaces the EITC with a family deduction that more than doubles current family deductions. While details are unclear, the proposal intends to continue other aspects of the EITC under the government's welfare programs. About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<p>

<b>What Is a Flat Tax?</b><sup>8</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax would repeal the current income tax code and replace it with a system based on the following principles:
<p>
1. Tax all income with no deductions except a generous allowance based on family size. Today's complex system could be replaced by two simple, postcard-size forms, one for business and one for individuals.
<p>
2. Tax all income at one rate, applying the law equally to all taxpayers. Everyone faces the same 17 percent rate, and the government would not punish or subsidize taxpayers on the basis of how they earn or spend income.
<p>
3. Tax all income just once, ending the bias against savings and investment. Capital income would be taxed on the business form to ensure compliance, and labor income would be taxed on the individual form.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal follows each of these principles. For individuals, only the income from wages, salaries, and pensions is taxed. Individual taxpayers add up income from these sources and then deduct generous personal and dependent exemptions. What is left after these deductions is taxed at 17 percent (after a two-year phase-in period). For businesses, taxes are paid on income from the sale of goods or services. The business first adds up all of its income and then subtracts what it paid out in wages and salaries, what it purchased in order to make its products or provide its services, and the cost of all buildings, land, and other "capital structures" purchased during the tax year. The income that is left after these subtractions is taxed at 17 percent.

<P>
<b>Distribution of Tax Payments</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows the dollar and percentage reduction in average household tax payments under a 17 percent flat tax.<sup>8</sup> These estimates combine so-called labor income (wages and salaries) with all of the small business income currently reported on IRS Form 1040, Schedules C, E, and F.<sup>9</sup>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The most striking feature of this flat tax distribution table is how much taxes are reduced for very low and very high incomes. At the low end, millions of households see their tax payments disappear as a result of the generous family deduction. Specifically:
About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly everyone else below $30,000 will see their taxes fall.<sup>10</sup>
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxpayers at the high end of the income scale also see a substantial reduction in income taxes. These tax cuts result from two factors: the lower tax rate (a drop from an average effective rate of 33 percent to about 17 percent) and an end to the practice of double or triple taxation of so-called passive income (dividends, interest, and capital gains). Dividends and interest actually are payments made by companies to stockholders and depositors out of company income that already has been taxed. Furthermore, individuals buy company stock and make time deposits in savings accounts with after-tax income. Thus, all of the cash transactions associated with, say, a dividend are based on income that already has been taxed. To collect additional tax on dividends, interest, and capital gains constitutes double taxation, thus violating the principle of taxing all income only once and at its source. This double taxation would be ended under the Armey-Shelby flat tax.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxing income only once at its source results in a tax cut at the upper end of the income scale, just as it results in a tax cut for lower- and middle-income households with income from interest, capital gains, and dividends. While nearly 34 percent of all dividends claimed as income goes to households with total incomes below $50,000 (largely households with retired taxpayers), the average dividend income reported by upper-income households is much greater: $37,695 for incomes of $200,000 and above as opposed to $2,050 for incomes of $50,000 or below.<sup>11</sup> Thus, the exclusion of this income from taxes paid by individuals has a greater effect on taxes paid by wealthy people than on taxes paid by people of more limited means.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Because businesses under Armey-Shelby would pay taxes on the income from which they make dividend and interest payments, it is correct to say that the taxes on these payments are withheld at the business level in much the same way that income taxes on wages and salaries currently are withheld at the business level. <a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a> shows the effects of this withholding on the tax liabilities of households.<sup>12</sup> The dividend and interest payments received by households in <a href="fyi90t2.gif">Table 2</a> have been taxed at the business level, and these taxes are added to the 17 percent Armey-Shelby taxes of <a href="fyi90t1.gif">Table 1</a>. A quick comparison of Tables 1 and 2 shows who shoulders the burden of dividend and interest taxes. As income rises, the implicit burden of taxes on these forms of income also increases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is worth noting in this regard that corporate income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax. This increase largely offsets decreases in individual tax payments during the tax's two-year implementation period; Heritage's tax models currently estimate that taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from corporations will rise by $52 billion.
<P>

<b>Progressive Nature of the Flat Tax</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While it is certainly true that the flat tax as proposed by Representative Armey and Senator Shelby taxes income at one rate, the taxpayer and dependent exemption causes the actual rates paid by taxpayers to increase as incomes rise. For example, a single taxpayer without children and making $25,000 would be exempt from income tax on the first $11,350 and would pay a 17 percent tax on the remaining $13,650. The tax would be $2,321, or 9.3 percent of $25,000. If part of the $25,000 was dividend income, of course, tax already would have been taken out at the corporate level. A single taxpayer making $250,000 would pay a 17 percent tax on $238,650 under the Armey-Shelby bill. The tax would be $40,571, or 16.2 percent of total income. It is the presence of the exemption that makes the flat tax "progressive."<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Technical Note</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The data shown in Tables <a href="fyi90t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi90t2.gif">2</a> and <a href="fyi90c1.gif">Chart 1</a> are based on income tax records contained in the IRS Public Use File for 1991, a statistically accurate sample of all individual income tax returns for that year. The file contains 115,000 taxpaying households and 178 tax variables per household. When a variable is multiplied by its weight, the value of the variable equals its national total. Thus, the value of wage and salary income for a family earning $35,000 equals the national total for families in that income class when it is multiplied by its national weight. These are the same data the IRS's own Statistics of Income Division uses when preparing its annual analysis of taxpayers. They are the most accurate and complete tax data available for public use.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tax payments shown in Tables 1 and 2 include all of the kinds of taxable income that individuals now report on their annual 1040 tax form. Individuals currently report labor income (for example, wages and salaries) as well as business income from self-employment, trusts, partnerships, farming operations, and other business activities. However, the more prominent flat tax proposals make an important change in the way small business income is reported. Proposals similar to the Armey-Shelby bill separate labor income from business income and allow businesses to deduct from their gross income the costs of operations, the value of land and capital structures purchased during the year, and the wages and salaries paid to their employees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This separation of labor income from business income makes comparing the current tax system with a flat tax system difficult. In order to compare current taxes fairly with those collected under a flat tax, we added together the flat taxes individuals would pay on their labor income and on their small business income. This combination is reported in the flat tax columns of Tables 1 and 2. Thus, both sets of numbers include taxes paid on labor and business income.
<P>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, with respect to the effect higher business taxes might have on low- and middle-income families, many tax analysts believe that higher business taxes mean higher prices for consumers. Low- and middle-income households have more difficulty paying higher prices than do wealthier households. Thus, these analysts argue that increases in business taxes that produce higher consumer prices really amount to regressive "tax" increases on those families least able to pay for them.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While there maybe some truth to this view, the measurement of the relationship between tax changes and price changes is very difficult. First, the flat tax is expected to reduce many of the costs business faces, most particularly the cost of capital. Thus, firms may decide not to pass along tax increases to consumers. Second, more than half of all businesses will see a tax decrease under the Armey-Shelby bill, which could result in lower consumer prices. Third, history shows that firms in competitive markets are less likely to charge consumers for tax increases than firms in regulated, uncompetitive markets. The Heritage Foundation will address this issue in a future paper.

<li>   Tables <a href="fyi90t1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi90t2.gif">2</a> do not show the effect of any special rules to ease the transition from the current tax system to the Armey-Shelby flat tax. Thus, these tables probably overstate the amount of additional taxes some businesses would pay under a flat tax. For example, current tax policy requires businesses to depreciate their equipment purchases over a fixed period of time, often 15 years. Thus, many businesses have a large amount of unused depreciation that they have been carrying on their books as an asset. However, the Armey-Shelby flat tax does away with tax depreciation for capital equipment and replaces this policy with one that permits businesses to expense their purchases of land, structures, and equipment in the year that these items are purchased. To move from the current system to the Armey-Shelby flat tax means either writing off billions of dollars in accumulated depreciation or enacting a "transition rule" that would allow businesses to use accumulated depreciation for a few years as a deduction from gross sales. The Heritage Foundation is engaged in developing and analyzing such rules and will provide commentary on transition issues at a future date.<p>
<li>    Economists and sociologists for decades have been trying to reach agreement about what constitutes the middle class. We certainly will not attempt to enter that debate in this paper. However, broadly defining the middle class as single- and multi-person households with incomes between $30,000 and $100,000 probably includes what most analysts view as middle-class.<p>

<li>    Economists are beginning to publish analyses of how a flat tax would effect economic activity. One of the most important essays to appear so far is by Alan J. Auerbach of the University of California, Berkeley, and the National Bureau of Economic Research. See Auerbach, "Tax Reform, Capital Allocation, Efficiency and Growth," paper presented at Brookings Conference on Fundamental Tax Reform, February 15-16, 1996.<p>
<li>   The Heritage Foundation has published a number of other papers on tax reform and on the flat tax specifically. See Daniel J. Mitchell, "Jobs, Growth, Freedom, and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1035, May 25, 1995, and Daniel J. Mitchell, "Which Tax Reform Plan Is Best for America?," Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1055</a>, September 26, 1995.<p>
<li>    The Heritage Foundation used the largest publicly available tax database to construct these estimates. The Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991 is a statistically significant sample of all of the individual income tax returns filed in 1991. Estimates of current average tax payments were calculated by applying the 1996 tax rates and bracket amounts to net taxable income. The estimates of flat tax liabilities were calculated using the provisions of the tax reform proposal advanced by the Majority Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives, Representative Richard Armey (R-TX), and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL). See <a
href="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_104th?bill=(H ADJ R ADJ 2060)">H.R. 2060</a> and S. 1050.<p>
<li>    See Technical Note.<p>
<li>   For example, the family deduction for a single taxpayer is $11,350; for a married family of four, it is $33,300; and for a head of household with two children, it is $25,450. Only incomes greater than these amounts are taxable under the Armey-Shelby flat tax.<p>
<li>    See Internal Revenue Service, <I>Individual Income Tax Returns 1991</I>, Publication 1304 (Rev. 3/94), p. 28, Table 1.4, cols. 9 and 10.<p>
<li>    It is possible also to view taxes on capital gains as "withheld" taxes: The net present value of corporations is connected intimately to their ability to remain profitable while paying all of their taxes. However, households rather than businesses control the timing of capital gains realizations, which makes the analyst's job of estimating the business tax liabilities for capital gains exceptionally difficult. Thus, taxes on capital gains are not shown in Table 2. If they could be shown, the total tax liabilities of high-income households under a fully phased 17 percent flat tax would be even greater.<p>
<li>    Some advocates of the flat tax say that a taxpayer with 10 times the income pays 10 times more tax. Actually, the flat tax requires wealthier taxpayers to pay somewhat more than that, since the taxpayer and dependent deductions remain the same regardless of income level. In the above example, the richer taxpayer, who has 10 times more income, pays 17.2 times more tax than the poorer taxpayer.

<a href="fyi87c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Economic Growth Boosts Housing Values<br>
<a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Home Values and Income: Closely Linked; Tax Deduction and Home Values: No Relationship <P>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Last year, the National Association of Realtors 
hired Data Resources Inc./McGraw-Hill, a leading econometric firm, to analyze the economic 
effects of a flat tax. The resulting study concluded that the enactment of this tax, which would 
treat all taxpayers and all income equally, would result in a 15 percent drop in housing 
values,<sup>1 </sup>due largely to the elimination of the home mortgage interest deduction. This 
study is now being used by opponents of the flat tax. Yet numerous experts have pointed out that 
the DRI/McGraw-Hill study has serious methodological flaws that make its conclusions highly 
suspect.<sup> 2</sup> A more reasonable method of analysis -- one that looks at the historical 
relationship between personal income growth and the value of owner-occupied housing, 
combined with the range of estimates showing faster economic growth under a flat tax -- shows 
that home values actually would rise by as much as 7 to 14 percent by the fifth year after 
enactment of a flat tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These results should come as no surprise.  As <a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a> illustrates, home values consistently have mirrored changes in personal income. When the 
economy is strong and incomes rise, consumers spend more on almost all goods and services. As 
a major component of family budgets, housing has followed this pattern. Although projecting the 
value of housing into the future involves a level of uncertainty, a wide range of studies indicate 
that adoption of a flat tax would boost the annual rate of growth in gross domestic product (GDP) 
by at least 1 percentage point for a period of five or more years.<sup>3 </sup> Because personal 
income would rise with increases in GDP, it is possible to use the strong historical relationship 
between income and house values to generate estimates of how home values will change under 
the flat tax.<sup>4 </sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Critics of the flat tax argue that it is improper to use 
historical data to predict the future value of homes under a flat tax because, they say, the 
relationship between home values and personal income exists only in a world where mortgage 
interest is deductible. Yet if the deduction were indeed the critical variable, there should be a 
strong relationship between housing values in the past and the tax value of the deduction. In 
1980, before the Reagan marginal tax rate cuts, for instance, a dollar of home mortgage interest 
cost an upper-income taxpayer only 30 cents. In 1988, that same taxpayer paid 72 cents out of 
pocket for every dollar in interest payments. As <a href="fyi87c2.gif">Chart 2</a> indicates, however, the tax value of the 
deduction had no discernible impact on the value of housing over the period.
<p>


<b>Why the Realtors' Study Is Flawed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If the historical evidence and economic projections 
suggest that a flat tax will increase home values, why did the realtors' study predict a sharp 
decline? The reason is that it used several very questionable assumptions. For example:
<p>
<b>1. DRI/McGraw-Hill analyzed a flat tax with an initial rate of 25 percent, gradually 
phasing down to 21 percent.</b> The DRI/McGraw-Hill study used a much higher tax rate 
than is used in existing flat tax plans. Crucially, the lower the rate, the larger the economic gains 
under a flat tax, and the higher the positive impact on home values. Even the Clinton 
Administration's Treasury Department, no friend of the flat tax, refused to use a rate higher than 
21 percent when estimating the effects of a flat tax on the economy.
<p>
<b>2. DRI/McGraw-Hill did not properly estimate the drop in interest rates under a flat 
tax.</b> According to the Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank, interest rates would drop by 25 
percent to 35 percent under a flat tax.<sup>5 </sup> Other experts have similar estimates.<sup>6 </sup> DRI/McGraw-Hill stands alone in basing its estimate of likely interest rate declines -- and 
thus the positive effect on home values -- on the comparison between municipal bond rates and 
10-year federal bonds, rather than interest-bearing assets of equal risk such as high-grade 
corporate bonds.
<p>
<b>3. DRI/McGraw-Hill overestimated by 30 percent the average marginal tax rate which 
applies to homeowners.</b> Doing so significantly overstates the tax benefits of the deduction 
and exaggerates the change in a taxpayer's cost of mortgage interest under a flat tax.
<p>
<b>4. The study assumed that financial assets would lose value under a flat tax.</b> This 
assumption is at odds with academic analyses of the flat tax and defies common sense. Lower 
taxes on savings and investment actually would boost the value of financial assets by increasing 
the after-tax stream of income they produce.
<p>
<b>5. DRI/McGraw-Hill failed to include the impact of higher disposable incomes on home 
values.</b> The study does conclude that the flat tax would increase economic growth but fails 
to factor back in the effects on house prices. This is inexplicable.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The flat tax represents a direct threat to 
powerful vested interests that feel they benefit from today's deductions. Unfortunately, many of 
these special interests are willing to disseminate erroneous information to Americans in an effort 
to preserve the tax breaks they now enjoy. The DRI/McGraw-Hill study is based on an unsound 
methodology which leaves it alone in its dire predictions that housing values will fall. Historical 
evidence on the relationship between performance of the economy and house prices, however, 
clearly shows us that a flat tax would be a bonanza for homeowners.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The flat tax continues to gain support across the country as more and more Americans realize that the existing tax code cannot be fixed and should be replaced by a fair and simple tax code. Polls show that workers, investors, savers, entrepreneurs, farmers, small business owners, and the elderly are among the groups of Americans drawn to the proposal because they feel they will pay less in taxes, benefit from a faster growing economy, or simply avoid the hassle of today's mind-numbing tax code.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is one group, however, which should support the flat tax but has yet to do so: liberals. Consider the following eight features and consequences of a flat tax which one would expect to appeal specifically to this group:
<p><ul>
<li> The key philosophical principle of the flat tax is equality. All taxpayers play by the same rules, no matter how wealthy they are.
<p>
<li> Lower rates result in the rich shouldering more of the tax burden. This happened in the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s.
<p>
<li> Deductions disproportionately benefit the wealthy and others able to exploit loopholes. Eliminating them with a flat tax allows for a lower rate for those with lower incomes.
<p>
<li> Radically simplifying the code with a flat tax will help end the corrupting effect of tax lobbyists and prevent politicians from exploiting the tax system to generate campaign contributions.
<p>
<li> Because of a generous family-based allowance, the poor are shielded from the income tax burden. A family of four pays no income tax on their first $33,000.
<p>
<li> The flat tax will boost wages and income for lower-income and middle-income workers by eliminating the double, triple, and sometimes quadruple taxation of capital.
<p>
<li> A pro-growth tax system will reduce the budget deficit by increasing the tax base and reducing demands for government spending.
<p>
<li> Lower-income and middle-income taxpayers will enjoy a more financially secure retirement if they are not forced to pay a double tax on their savings.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History illustrates that a flat tax will generate immense benefits for Americans of all backgrounds and incomes.<sup>1</sup>  Honest liberals -- those who are genuinely concerned about helping the less fortunate and who favor eliminating special advantages for the rich and powerful -- should be among the strongest supporters of sweeping tax reform. There are some on the left, however, who oppose the flat tax in the belief that some short-term political advantage can be gained from fomenting class warfare -- even if the ultimate victims are those who have the most to gain from a more rapidly growing economy.

<p>
<b>EIGHT REASONS FOR LIBERALS TO SUPPORT A FLAT TAX</b>
<P>
<b>1. A flat tax promotes equality.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals often say they are fighting for equality. No other word better describes the flat tax, whose key principle is that the law should apply equally to all taxpayers and all income. More specifically, supporters of the flat tax believe all taxpayers should play by the same rules and that government should not grant special preferences or impose special penalties based on how income is earned or spent. Equality under the law means a tax system with just one rate for all levels of income. Anything else explicitly allows the government to discriminate among taxpayers and ultimately is self-defeating.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi85c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows how the principle of equality applies to taxpayers with different taxable incomes. Under a system that treats citizens equally, a taxpayer with twice as much taxable income as his neighbor pays twice as much in taxes.
<p>
<b>2. The rich pay more.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals often equate a fair tax system with one that results in the rich paying more. If so, the flat tax is the answer to their prayers. Why?  While the flat tax is designed to treat all taxpayers equally, history strongly suggests that one effect of moving to a flat tax is that the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich actually will increase. America has had three major episodes of tax rate reduction -- in the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. In each case, lower tax rates removed incentives to hide income, shelter income, reduce earnings, and transfer money overseas. The result: Upper-income taxpayers were willing to earn and report more taxable income, and the amount of tax they paid increased. The evidence speaks for itself.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1920s, tax rates were reduced from a high of 73 percent to 25 percent between 1921 and 1926. Did the rich get a free ride?  Hardly: The share of the tax burden paid by those making more than $50,000 -- a great deal of money back then -- rose dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1960s, the Kennedy tax cuts lowered the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. The result: Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>3</sup>

<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan reduced the top rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988 (see <a href="fyi85c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).<sup>4</sup>
<p><b>3. Deductions help the rich.</b>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Liberals presumably do not favor laws that confer special advantages on those with more income. Thus, the elimination of all loopholes, preferences, credits, exclusions, subsidies, and deductions under the flat tax should be particularly attractive to them. As <a href="fyi85c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, the three best-known deductions offer almost no benefit to the poor and middle class. Upper-income and wealthy taxpayers, by contrast, benefit immensely.

<p>
<b>4. A flat tax ends special-interest tax lobbying.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are 12,609 special interests officially registered to lobby in Washington, and the tax code is one of their chief targets.<sup>5</sup>  Former Members of Congress, former legislative staff members, consulting firm employees, and law firm partners are among those who can earn up to $500 an hour wielding influence in the tax-writing committees of Congress. It is precisely this process that has caused America's tax system, which began in 1913 with one simple form, to turn into a monstrosity encompassing more than 600 forms in which even the simplest -- the 1040EZ -- is accompanied by 33 pages of fine-print instructions.
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While lobbyists are very well compensated for their efforts (and not all of them are looking for special loopholes; some are fighting to keep their tax bills from increasing), the biggest winners from the convoluted tax code are the politicians. <a href="fyi85c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows the average contribution levels for members of the House tax-writing committee compared with the average for other House members. This is one reason why the House Ways and Means and Senate Finance Committees are considered the plum assignments for new Members of Congress.
<p>
<b>5. The poor pay no tax.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The only loophole in the flat tax is the one that protects the poor. Under the Armey-Shelby proposal (H.R. 2060, S. 1050), a family of four does not pay the 17 percent rate until its annual income reaches $33,300. This personal allowance, which is indexed to inflation to prevent bracket creep, is considerably above the poverty level and will ensure that even the low rate of a flat tax is not an impediment to those trying to climb the economic ladder.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As <a href="fyi85c5.gif">Chart 5</a> illustrates, the personal allowance also has the effect of making the tax system progressive. The tax rate on a family of four with $30,000 of income would be zero compared to an effective rate of 2.8 percent for a family with $40,000 of income and 5.7 percent for a family with earnings of $50,000. The effective rate continues to rise with income, reaching 9.5 percent on $75,000 of income, 11.3 percent on $100,000 of income, and 14.2 percent for a family with income of $200,000. For the well-to-do, the effective rate approaches 17 percent, as families with $500,000 of income pay 15.9 percent and a millionaire's household would pay 16.4 percent.
<p>
<b>6. A flat tax promotes higher wages.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Considerable discussion has been devoted to the plight of the middle class. While some assertions are false (for example, middle-class incomes have not fallen over the last 20 years), there is no question that earnings could and should be rising at a faster rate. Fortunately, there is widespread agreement among all economists that the way to increase incomes is to make workers more productive by giving them more and better tools with which to produce. As liberal economist Paul Samuelson has written:
<p><blockquote>

	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates.<sup>6</sup></blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Or consider the views of the White House. In the 1994 Economic Report of the President, the Administration noted that:<P><blockquote>	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The reasons for wanting to raise the investment share of the GDP [gross domestic product] are straightforward: Workers are more productive when they are equipped with more and better capital, more productive workers earn higher real wages, and higher real wages are the mainspring of higher living standards. Few economic propositions are better supported than these -- or more important.
</blockquote><p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;History shows a very close relationship between worker income and productivity, indicating the importance of capital formation. Since the flat tax eliminates the multiple taxation of capital income, levels of savings and investment will climb, worker productivity will increase, and wages will rise.<sup>7</sup><P><b>7. Budget deficits are reduced.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another desirable feature of the flat tax, at least for liberals, is that government <a href="fyi85c6.gif">revenues will rise</a>. As discussed earlier, the United States has had three major periods of tax rate reduction -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. In addition to the fact that the rich paid a greater share of the tax burden and the economy boomed, these reductions resulted in dramatic increases in tax revenues.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1920s, the top tax rate was slashed from 73 percent in 1921 to 25 percent by 1926. Because of improved incentives to work, save, and invest, income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to nearly $1.2 billion in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent during a period of virtually no inflation.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The White House today would do well to heed the words of then Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, who wrote that "The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions that resulted in legislation which reduced the maximum rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965. Just as happened in the 1920s, tax revenues again grew significantly, rising by more than 16 percent between 1963 and 1966.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As President Kennedy remarked in 1962, "an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits.... In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988. As supporters predicted, the tax cuts triggered the longest peacetime expansion of the economy in the nation's history. Critics charge, however, that Reagan's program caused big deficits.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These accusations may resonate politically in some quarters, but they are false. Reagan's critics conveniently forget that the first tax rate reductions, in 1981 and 1982, were offset by bracket creep and previously legislated payroll tax increases. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut, beginning in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent (28 percent after adjusting for inflation) by 1989.<sup>11</sup><p><b>8. Americans will have a more secure retirement.</b><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's Social Security system is in deep trouble. The bipartisan entitlement commission estimates the system's unfunded liability (the differences between how much is promised and how much will be available) at a staggering $7.3 trillion. With the baby boom generation approaching retirement, the Social Security Administration projects that the system will begin to run a deficit in less than 15 years. While there are ways to avert this upcoming catastrophe (the best option would be to follow the Chilean example of privatization),<sup>12</sup> it is widely expected that lawmakers will be reluctant to address such a politically charged issue.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This approach, unfortunately, means that the so-called baby boomers will face significant benefit reductions compared with what they are being promised and will be forced to augment their retirement income with private savings. The current tax system, however, punishes those who attempt to save and invest by imposing double, triple, and even quadruple taxation of savings and investment income. Even if income is "only" double-taxed, the effect on savings is dramatic. Chart 7 shows the difference in the nest eggs of someone who saves $1,000 a year under the current system and someone who saves the same amount in a flat tax world in which income is taxed just once. As shown, the double tax on interest income imposed by today's code dramatically redu
ces the amount which can be saved for retirement. By taxing income only once, the flat tax would allow interest earnings to compound, resulting in a nest egg almost 92 percent larger than the same amount of savings would generate under current law. See <a href="fyi85c7.gif">Chart 7</a> for the comparison between private savings with and without a flat tax.  
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The U.S. tax system ostensibly is designed to make the rich pay more and improve living standards for those with lower incomes. Even a cursory examination of the facts, however, underscores that the biggest victims of a progressive income tax which punishes success are precisely those who are on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. By achieving the effects outlined above, a flat tax therefore should attract the support of well-meaning people of all ideological persuasions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is a particularly important test for liberals. They must decide which is more important: maintaining lobbying power in Washington and keeping a tax system that may satisfy an ideological impulse to punish success, or adopting a system that ends special-interest corruption and helps boost the living standards of the less fortunate.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	American taxpayers, disgusted with today's flawed 
tax system, increasingly support efforts to scrap it for something entirely new. With the exception 
of the White House, there is almost universal agreement that America's tax system is anti-growth 
and anti-family. And to add insult to injury, tax laws are mind-numbingly complex, simultaneously 
punishing average taxpayers while creating special preferences for those with the right lawyers, 
accountants, and lobbyists.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		But what should replace the current system?  
Should America have a flat tax?  If so, which flat tax?  Or is the answer a sales tax or value-added 
tax?  Should a new tax system punish success by imposing higher tax rates as income rises?  With 
so many different tax reform plans being proposed, taxpayers understandably need some objective 
way of measuring which plan will generate the most benefits. The following table, based on nine 
criteria, gives an overall grade to each of the major tax reform plans.<sup>1 </sup>
<P><center>

</tr></table>
</center><p>
<b>The Nine Criteria:</b>
<p><ul>
<li>One Low Rate -- because work, saving, and investment should be rewarded, not punished;
<p>
<li>Simplicity --  because the pain of paying taxes should not be compounded by complexity;
<p>
<li>Savings and Investment --  because the tax code should not penalize these activities needed to 
increase growth;
<p>
<li>Social Engineering -- because people, not politicians, should be in charge of how their money 
is spent;
<p>
<li>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties --  because a tax code granting the government too much power is 
not part of the American ideal;
<p>
<li>Fairness -- because the law should apply equally to all;
<p>
<li>Risk --  because a new tax plan should not contain pitfalls;
<p>
<li>Evasion --  because everyone should pay his fair share;
<p>
<li>International Competitiveness -- because American workers deserve the highest wages and 
living standards.
<p></ul>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On these and other criteria, "pure" flat tax plans score 
the highest. Direct consumption taxes also fare well, with their only significant liability being the 
risk that politicians would use them as an additional source of revenue rather than as a replacement 
for the current system. Modified flat tax plans score higher than the current system, but they do 
maintain significant amounts of double taxation and are not graded as high as pure flat taxes. Tax 
reform proposals which resemble the current system, needless to say, fare poorly.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since no tax system is perfect, any grading scale is 
somewhat subjective. If a reform, or a particular feature of a plan, moves as close to the ideal as 
possible, it earns a grade of "A."  Proposals or parts of proposals that reflect a significant 
improvement over current law receive "B" grades. A grade of "C" means the tax plan or the 
particular feature of the plan was no better or worse than the tax code is today, while "D" and "F" 
grades reflect substantially worsening and worst case, respectively.
<p>

<b>THE NEW TAX PLANS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Several major proposals have been introduced since 
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1055.html">"Which Tax Reform Plan is Best 
for America?"</a>  was published by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> in 
September 1995. This analysis updates that publication with detailed analysis of the plan put 
forward by the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and 
Tax Reform</a> (the Kemp Commission) as well as plans prepared by Senator Phil Gramm (R-
TX) and presidential candidates Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following are the key features of the tax reform 
proposals released in recent months:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Kemp Commission</b> -- The report issued by 
the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax 
Reform</a> cannot be graded on the same scale as the other plans because it is not a legislative 
proposal.<sup> 2</sup>  The report, for instance, does not specify a rate and is largely silent on the 
issue of itemized deductions. Instead, the commission's report outlines the key principles of a sound 
tax system and makes several recommendations as to how any acceptable reform package could be 
structured. Many of the general recommendations -- such as tax all income at one rate, but one 
time, and require a supermajority to increase the rate -- are very desirable and will be judged, to the 
extent possible, against the nine criteria.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Forbes flat tax</b> -- Very similar to the 
Armey/Shelby proposal, the <a href="http://www.forbes96.com/html/is_flat.html">Forbes flat 
tax</a> would replace the current personal and corporate income tax systems with a simple 17 
percent tax on all income. All labor income, with the exception of a generous personal allowance 
($36,000 for a family of four), would be taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business and capital 
income (interest, dividends, profits, capital gains, and rents) would be withheld and paid at the 
business level. Unlike the current system, no income would be subjected to more than one layer of 
tax. Both businesses and individuals would be able to use postcard-size tax returns.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Gramm flat tax</b> --  Senator <a 
href="http://www.gramm96.org/cato11796.shtml">Phil Gramm</a> favors a 16 percent tax rate, 
but his flat tax is substantially different from many of the existing proposals. He keeps deductions 
for home mortgage interest and charitable deductions, but the biggest difference is the continued 
double taxation of many forms of income. Capital gains taxes would not be abolished, while 
income used for savings would continue to be taxed twice and the bias against business investment 
would be reduced, but it would not be eliminated. By making these modifications, and also by 
choosing to tax corporate profits at the individual rather than business level, the Gramm plan would 
not achieve the same level of simplicity as a "pure" flat tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>The Buchanan flat tax</b> -- Similar in many ways to 
the Gramm proposal, the <a href="http://www.buchanan.org/reveal.html">Buchanan plan</a> 
contains a low 15 percent rate, but many types of income are double-taxed. Corporate profits would 
continue to be taxed at both the individual and business level. Savings would be taxed twice. There 
would be a flat 17 percent rate on corporations, but provisions biasing the current system against 
investment, such as the alternative minimum tax and depreciation, would remain. On the individual 
side, the plan also continues deductions for such items as home mortgage interest and charitable 
contributions, thus adding considerable complexity when compared to traditional flat tax plans.
<p>


<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While each reform has an overall grade, it is 
particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. 
The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different plans reflect nine 
important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>

<b>LOW RATES</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A low, single rate treats all citizens equally under the 
law and ensures that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. 
Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such 
behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The report does not specify a rate, but makes clear 
that the rate should be as low as possible.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 		A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	With a rate of 17 percent, the Forbes plan earns high 
marks.
<P>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	B+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The low 16 percent rate ranks highly, but the double 
taxation of certain income (discussed in the savings and investment section) is a problem.
<P>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Gramm's plan, Buchanan's deserves credit for 
one low rate. It also suffers, however, from the same flaw.
<p>
<b>SIMPLICITY</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The current income tax requires hundreds of forms 
and consumes more than 5 billion hours of taxpayer time each year. Business compliance costs are 
particularly large.
<P>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	N/A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Any plan calling for one rate and taxing income only 
one time will automatically generate substantially greater simplicity. A specific grade, however, is 
difficult without knowing the specific structure of the flat tax and whether deductions would 
remain.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Armey/Shelby, the entire tax code is 
compressed down to postcard size. All taxpayers need to calculate is their total income and family 
size.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	:&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The plan would have some level of simplification, but 
capital gains, depreciation, itemized deductions, and other provisions limit the scope of benefits. 
Taxing dividends and interest on the individual form will also necessitate continued use of more 
than one billion 1099 forms.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The business side of the tax code, which generates 
the most compliance costs, remains largely untouched. The Buchanan plan also continues the estate 
tax, thus missing an opportunity to remove a source of considerable complexity.

<p>

<b>SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Having one low rate is a necessary feature of a pro-
growth tax system, but it is not the only piece of the puzzle. Equally important is that the tax code 
be designed so that income is taxed only one time. The current system hinders the growth of 
incomes and living standards by the multiple taxing of savings and investment.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The panel makes clear that no income should be 
taxed more than one time. Combined with the low rate, this would generate significantly higher 
levels of capital formation.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like other pure flat tax proposals, the Forbes plan 
does not discriminate against income used for savings and investment.
<p>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some double taxation is eliminated, but the treatment of 
capital gains, savings, and depreciation will leave continued bias against capital formation.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Like Gramm, Buchanan errs by not fully addressing 
the bias against savings and investment. In addition to double-taxing capital gains, savings, and 
depreciation, Buchanan retains the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax.

<P>
<b>SOCIAL ENGINEERING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, 
everything from putting a child in day care to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as 
savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Once a tax system strays from the concept of 
treating all income equally, regardless of how it is earned or how it is spent, the door is open for 
special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The report clearly states that the tax system should 
apply neutrally. It does not, however, completely rule out deductions that would shift behavior.
<P>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other than a family allowance, there is no preference, 
loophole, or exclusion in the Forbes plan.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In addition to the bias against savings and 
investment, the Texas Senator's plan retains deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable 
contributions.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Shortcomings are similar to the Gramm proposal.

<p>

<b>INTRUSIVENESS/CIVIL LIBERTIES</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In part because of the Internal Revenue Code's mind-
numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection 
activities that many believe are abusive. Moreover, complexity invites government intrusion to 
verify many tax returns. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, 
would solve much of this problem. Thus, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize 
the scope of and opportunity for intrusion.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even without details, it is hard to see how a tax 
system based on the commission's report could fail to eliminate the vast majority of problems. 
Indeed, its very first recommendation is to repeal the entire Internal Revenue Code.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The only possible source of conflict between an 
individual taxpayer and the IRS under a flat tax are total income earned and the size of one's family. 
Whatever other problems remain, such as deductions for the self-employed, would be a fraction of 
those that exist now. Businesses will benefit even more dramatically because of the simplicity.
<P>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Continued double taxation of some forms of capital 
income preserves opportunities for tax avoidance behavior that would necessitate the attention of 
the tax authorities and the maintenance of a layer of enforcement bureaucracy.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the Gramm plan, the Buchanan flat tax is an 
improvement, but many potential conflicts in the tax code will remain.

<P>
<b>FAIRNESS</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal 
treatment. Any special provision, whether to punish or reward, violates the principle that the law 
should apply equally.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The recommendations and tone of the commission's 
report clearly indicate strong support for treating all taxpayers and all income equally. Declares the 
report: "[I]f one taxpayer earns ten times as much as his neighbor, he should pay ten times as much 
in taxes."<sup>3 </sup>
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is 
taxed one time.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The single rate is a dramatic improvement over 
today's code, but the double taxation of savings and investment and itemized deductions undermine 
the goal of equality.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Better than current law, but suffers from the same 
problems as the Gramm flat tax.

<p>

<b>DOWNSIDE RISK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually 
attractive and would help the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The 
political process causes any plan to evolve over time, generally in an undesirable direction. Thus, 
the probability of a plan that will retain its beneficial design features should be considered.
<P>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		N/A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As long as no itemized deductions are allowed, a tax 
plan based on the commission's report should be stable and long-lasting. Without clear guidance on 
the use of deductions, however, it is difficult to assign a grade. The supermajority requirement to 
raise taxes, if enacted, would help considerably.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The single rate and purity of the Forbes plan, 
combined with support for a supermajority, provide a significant margin of safety. As with any 
proposal, it is difficult to bind the hands of future politicians completely.
<p>
Gramm flat tax	: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		C+
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One rate is a big improvement, but with double 
taxation and deductions retained, political pressure to include further distortions would soon 
develop. The influence of lobbyists might be curtailed, but not by much.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			C+
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, the plan mirrors both the good and the bad 
features of the Gramm proposal. Government would have the ability to discriminate on the basis of 
how income is earned and how it is spent.
<P>

<b>EVASION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To maintain public support, a tax system must ensure 
that everyone plays by the same rules. If the public views the law as corrupt or unenforcable, there 
will be pressure to return to the old system. This means that the new tax must not create 
opportunities or incentives for taxpayers either legally or illegally to shift behavior just to avoid 
taxes.
<P>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A-
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Assuming a tax system faithfully follows the report's 
recommendations, it is hard to see how a new tax system could offer many chances to evade taxes. 
It is not clear, however, whether capital income would be collected at the source.
<p>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;				A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Because of the single low rate, this plan would offer 
minimal incentives to evade. Taxing all income at the source eliminates more than one billion 1099 
forms and simplifies enforcement considerably.
<P>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;				B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While better than current law, some forms of income 
are double taxed and others maintain a preference. This will encourage taxpayers to arrange their 
affairs in ways to minimize or avoid taxes.
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;				B
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like the Gramm plan, one low rate will reduce incentives 
to avoid, but differential treatment based on sources and uses of income will create opportunities 
for evasive behavior.

<p>
<b>INTERNATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a world where capital can react quickly to changes 
in a nation's business climate, a tax system which minimizes the tax burden will attract increased 
investment. This will translate into more jobs and higher incomes. Unfortunately, America has been 
moving in the wrong direction.
<p>
Kemp Commission report: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;		A
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the panel's recommendations is to eliminate 
the foreign tax provisions of the current code which do so much to drive jobs offshore and hinder 
the competitiveness of U.S. firms. Combined with the other features -- tax at a low rate and tax only 
one time -- this would benefit America immensely.
<P>
Forbes flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			A
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eliminating the double tax on income earned 
overseas and fixing all the problems imposed on income earned in the U.S. will increase 
competitiveness and boost job creation substantially.
<p>
Gramm flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;			B
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One low rate will help, but the multiple taxation of 
capital will prevent complete realization of possible benefits. 
<p>
Buchanan flat tax: &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 			C
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Has the same pluses as the Gramm plan, but the threat of 
higher taxes on trade will have a sharply negative effect on U.S. competitiveness.

<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The current income tax system demands 
comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive 
resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many 
proposals that have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the pure flat tax are the 
best. Direct consumption taxes, assuming no loopholes and complete repeal of the income tax (16th 
Amendment and all), are very attractive, with modified flat taxes generally next in desirability. The 
closer a plan resembles the current system, needless to say, the more limited its benefits.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Legislation to dismantle the current tax code and replace it with
a simple, 17 percent flat tax triggered immediate and strong support
when introduced last year by now-House Majority Leader<a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax"> Richard Armey</a> (R-TX). Newspaper columnists said that, among other things,
this &quot;revolutionary reform&quot; would eliminate a &quot;Rube
Goldberg tax code.&quot;<sup>1</sup>  In the view of taxpayer groups, &quot;this legislation would unleash enormous economic growth and greatly
increase personal freedom&quot;<sup>2</sup> while &quot;eliminat[ing] the
long-time bias in the current tax code against saving and investment.&quot;<sup>3</sup>
 And Representative Armey has received thousands of letters of
support from people all across the country. In short, millions
of Americans know the current system is burdensome, unfair, unworkable,
and beyond repair.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax is more than popular, however; it is economically sound.
If enacted, for instance, it would:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Produce faster economic growth.</b> By reducing tax penalties levied
against productive economic behavior, a flat tax would spur increased
work, saving, and investment. Even if long-term growth rose by
as little as 0.5 percent, the average family of four's income
after 10 years would be as much as $5,000 higher than it would
be under current tax laws.<sup>4</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Create instant wealth.</b> According to Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson,
the flat tax would boost national wealth by some $1 trillion.<sup>5</sup>
 Among the reasons:  Investments would be guided by profitability
rather than tax status and the value of income-producing assets
would rise as the after-tax stream of income generated by these
assets increased<sup>6</sup>.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Lead to simplicity.</b> One business in 1992 had a tax return 21,000
pages and 30 volumes long.<sup>7</sup>  While generally better off than business,
individual taxpayers also face complex regulations, dozens of
special forms, and often heavy preparation costs. Under a flat
tax, all taxpayers, from General Motors to John Doe, would be
able to fill out their tax return on a <a href="bg1035c1.gif">postcard-size form</a>.<sup>8</sup>  Compliance
costs of the current system would drop by tens of billions of
dollars.<sup>9</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Achieve fairness.</b>  A flat tax would treat people equally. A taxpayer
with 1,000 times the taxable income of another taxpayer would
pay 1,000 times more in taxes, but the tax code no longer would
penalize success and discriminate against citizens on the basis
of income.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>End micromanagement and political favoritism.</b> The flat tax would
rid the tax code of all deductions, loopholes, credits, and special
preferences. The only exemption that would be retained is a personal
allowance based on family size. Politicians thus would lose the
ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish
enemies, and use the tax code to impose their values on the economy.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Increase civil liberties.</b> Under current law, someone charged with
murder has more rights and protections than a taxpayer dealing
with the Internal Revenue Service. With a simpler, fairer tax
code, infringements on freedoms and privacy would fall dramatically.<sup>11</sup>
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Increase tax collections from the wealthy.</b> Just as happened in
the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s, lower tax rates would result in increased
tax collections from upper-income taxpayers. The reason:  Incentives
to earn <I>and</I> report taxable income would climb dramatically.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's tax system is a major reason for Americans' widespread
distrust of politicians. Taxpayers know they can spend their money
more wisely than bureaucrats and lawmakers, who seem reflexively
to raise taxes at every opportunity. The tax burden in America
is now at an all-time high, and economists estimate that this
causes both economic growth and job creation to suffer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But this animosity is driven by more than opposition to an ever-growing
tax burden and concerns about lost jobs and lower wages. Most
Americans see the tax code as bewilderingly complicated, with
laws and regulations written for the benefit of special interests
rather than ordinary citizens. Families and businesses must pay
huge amounts to comply with this code, but even this does not
ensure an audit-proof tax return. Tax lawyers and accountants
admit that some provisions of today's tax law are so complex that
it is impossible to know whether returns are filed correctly.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress could solve most of these problems by adopting a flat
tax, taxing income at a low, single rate and, with the exception
of a family allowance, eliminating the current labyrinth of rates,
deductions, credits, and exemptions. No income tax ever promoted
economic growth, but a flat tax at least would penalize work,
savings, and investment far less than the current tax code.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, while tax experts across the political spectrum
have been attracted to the flat tax, politicians have not been
as receptive. A flat tax would undermine their ability to use
the tax code to finance new spending, to grant favors to powerful
interests, and to generate contributions from those seeking to
change or preserve specific features of the tax code. Now, however,
thanks to the sweeping changes in Congress wrought by last November's
elections and the voters' demand for simplicity and fairness,
a historic opportunity exists for radical reform of America's
tax system.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>W</B></I><B>HAT IS A FLAT TAX</B>?<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While no two of the several flat tax proposals advanced over the
years have been identical, they usually are based on the proposal
developed about fifteen years ago by Stanford University economists
Alvin Rabushka and Robert Hall. Among the key features of a Hall/Rabushka-style
flat tax are:
<P>
<ol>
<li><b>A single flat rate</b> &#173;&#173; All flat tax proposals apply a
single tax rate to any income subject to tax, although proposed
rates may differ. Some plans call for rates as low as 10 percent.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions</b> &#173;&#173;
Most flat tax proposals would rid the code of various provisions
(for example, deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable
contributions, and state and local taxes) that bestow preferential
tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>No double taxation of savings and investment</b> &#173;&#173; Flat
tax proposals are designed to reduce or eliminate the bias against
capital formation by ensuring that all income is taxed no more
than once. Simply stated, they often include the equivalent of
a &quot;super IRA&quot; to protect savings and investment from
additional levels of taxation.<sup>12</sup>
</ol><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While they share certain core principles, however, flat tax proposals
are not identical. The Armey proposal, for instance, calls for
a very generous family allowance.<sup>13</sup>  Others include smaller personal
allowances, a feature which allows the tax rate to be dropped
even further. Another major issue is whether a flat tax also should
be a tax cut. The Armey proposal would reduce government revenues
(according to static estimates). Others, like the Specter bill,
would collect the same amount of revenue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Other differences involve the tax treatment of business. All flat
tax proposals based on the Hall/Rabushka model, such as Armey's,
address the many anti-growth features of the corporate income
tax. In theory, however, a flat tax could be designed that applies
only to the personal income tax. The Social Security and Medicare
payroll taxes, which together are the equivalent of a 15.3 percent
income tax for most Americans, are yet another unresolved issue.
Unlike the income tax, the Social Security portion of the payroll
tax (12.4 percent) is levied only on the first $61,600 of income.
The Medicare portion (2.9 percent) applies to all wage and salary
income. Hall/Rabushka-based flat taxes do not attempt to tackle
the special problems of these retirement programs, though it would
be possible to design a flat tax which incorporated payroll taxes.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In addition, there are proposals that move in the direction of
a flat tax but, for various reasons (usually political), do not
satisfy all three core criteria. Some retain a &quot;progressive&quot;
rate structure, penalizing those who contribute most to the economy's
growth<sup>14</sup>; others retain some deductions, usually for fear of offending
a powerful constituency<sup>15</sup>; and still others would continue to double-tax
savings and investment. Such proposals generally are an improvement
over the status quo, but they clearly would not have the positive
impact on jobs and wages that a true flat tax would have.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;More important, these attempts to find a &quot;middle ground&quot;
lack the political appeal of a genuine flat tax. One reason the
flat tax is so popular is that it breaks the special-interest
logjam by reversing the notion that the tax code should be used
to reward some groups while penalizing others. But allowing politicians
to continue choosing winners and losers also allows tax lawyers
and lobbyists to retain power and influence. Even worse, because
of budget deficit concerns, retaining special provisions in the
tax code almost inevitably results in tax rates that are higher
than they would be under a true flat tax. These halfway steps
also undermine the goal of simplicity, since every surviving credit,
deduction, and exemption means longer and more complex tax forms.
For these reasons, more &quot;moderate&quot; flat tax proposals
most likely would fuel cynicism among ordinary Americans and generate
far less support than more radical plans.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>W</B></I>HY A FLAT TAX IS FAIR<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Perhaps the most common argument against a flat tax is that it
would not be &quot;fair.&quot;  This assumes that the tax code
should impose increasingly steep rates on people as their income
rises. More specifically, a so-called progressive rate structure
facilitates far more income redistribution than is possible under
a single-rate system. As will be discussed in further detail later,
the economic consequences of this approach are severe and have
been demonstrated in many studies. Even leaving the broad economic
argument aside, however, the redistributionist approach fails
any reasonable test of morality and is fiscally counterproductive.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<B>&quot;Progressive&quot; taxation is discriminatory.</B> The
central tenet of a progressive tax is that the government has
a right to larger shares of an individual's income as his income
rises. But traditional notions of fairness suggest the law should
treat citizens equally, and penalizing those with higher incomes
violates this principle. As John McCulloch, an early student of
taxation, warned, &quot;The moment you abandon... the cardinal
principle of exacting from all individuals the same proportion
of their income... you are at sea without rudder or compass, and
there is no amount of injustice or folly you may not commit.&quot;
<sup>16</sup> Those favoring high, confiscatory tax rates sometimes argue that
well-to-do taxpayers received so much from society that it is
only proper that government seize bigger portions of their income
and use the money to benefit the less fortunate. This approach
presents several fundamental problems.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, in the private sector, income is earned by offering others
something of value. Employers pay workers because they produce;
consumers buy products because they value them. Without government
coercion, income is earned by offering something to society, not
by taking something from society.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The redistributionist credo, by contrast, holds that income is
earned at the expense of others in society. This assumes income
is a fixed pie and that any additional income earned by one individual
somehow comes out of the pockets of everyone else. As the <a href="bg1035c2.gif">chart</a>
above shows, however, earnings for all income groups tend to rise
and fall in unison. Incomes for all groups, including the poor,
rose substantially during the Reagan years when tax rates were
reduced. They did not perform strongly during the Carter, Bush,
and Clinton years when high-tax policies were enacted.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, advocates of high tax rates often claim that government
spending somehow helps the economy in general or the poor in particular.
As discussed previously, however, study after study shows that
higher levels of government spending are associated with weaker,
not stronger, economic growth. Even programs designed to help
the less fortunate, such as welfare and food stamps, seem to <a href="bg1035c3.gif">worsen conditions</a> for the poor by trapping them in a cycle of dependence
on government.<sup>17</sup>  As the adjacent chart shows, large amounts of
welfare spending have not lowered the poverty rate.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, studies have shown that high tax rates can backfire by
discouraging work, savings, and investment, thereby reducing taxable
income and &#173;&#173; depending on the tax rate &#173;&#173;
causing revenues to stagnate or fall.<sup>18</sup>  According to this principle,
popularly known as the Laffer curve, when tax rates reach certain
levels, total tax revenue will fall. Despite attacks by politicians
and journalists, the theory is valid. Imposing a 100 percent tax
on income above a certain level, for example, almost certainly
would yield no additional revenue, since people no longer would
have any incentive to earn money above that amount. Conversely,
the government would collect no money if tax rates were zero.
The only question (bearing in mind that the revenue maximizing
tax rate is not the same as the growth maximizing tax rate) is
whether tax rates are so high that government loses potential
revenue.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, official government projections are of limited
use when attempting to calculate the &quot;revenue-neutral&quot;
rate under a flat tax, since tax estimators in the Administration
and in Congress assume that taxes have no impact on the economy<sup>19</sup>.
 Most Americans would find it hard to believe that government
ignores economic effects in calculating revenue, but consider
the experience of Senator Bob Packwood (R-OR). In 1989, as ranking
Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, he asked the Joint
Committee on Taxation (JCT) to estimate what would happen if the
government confiscated <I>all</I> income above $200,000 per year.
The JCT projected that such a tax would raise $104 billion in
1989, $204 billion in 1990, $232 billion in 1991, $263 billion
in 1992, and $299 billion in 1993. As Senator Packwood remarked,
the Joint Committee's estimate &quot;assume[d] people will work
if they have to pay all their money to the Government. They will
work forever and pay all their money to the Government when clearly
anyone in their right mind will not.&quot;<sup>20</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This blunder was only a theoretical exercise, but it demonstrates
the enormous shortcomings of its methodology. Unfortunately, it
is this methodology that drives the JCT estimates that Congress
uses when considering alternative tax proposals, and the results
can be very costly, as many cases have demonstrated.<sup>21</sup>  Capital
gains estimates in the late 1980s that were off by more than 100
percent were used to kill a capital gains tax reduction that could
have eased the economic hardship afflicting the nation during
the Bush Administration.<sup>22</sup>  The large tax increase of 1990 was approved
in part because lawmakers were told it would balance the budget.
Instead, revenues came in below the tax collection estimates made
before the tax increase was enacted.<sup>23</sup>  Over the years, because
of static revenue estimating procedures, the JCT has seriously
overestimated revenues from such changes as the windfall profits
tax, the corporate income tax after the 1986 Tax Reform Act, and
the 1990 Luxury Tax on yachts.<sup>24</sup>  Ironically, the Clinton Administration
admitted the flaws of static scoring during the debate on the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), arguing correctly
that revenues generated by higher economic growth would more than
offset tax cuts in the trade legislation.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Recent evidence confirms the negative impact of high tax rates
on revenues. The 1993 Clinton tax increase was supposed to make
the &quot;rich&quot; pay more by imposing the largest income tax
rate increase since Herbert Hoover's in 1930. Yet, according to
Administration budget figures, individual income tax revenues
have been growing much more slowly than other tax revenues. These
figures are an early sign that this increase in the income tax
rate will not raise the $114 billion in new revenue the Administration
predicted. What makes the figures even more surprising is that
they include money generated by the retroactive &#173;&#173; and
thus unavoidable &#173;&#173; tax increase on 1993 income (due
on April 15, 1994). The fact that income tax revenues in 1994
were still 30 percent below the growth rates for all other revenues
is particularly significant.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, the punitive Clinton tax increase caused rich
people to report less taxable income in 1993, as the <a href="bg1035c4.gif">chart</a> illustrates. The cause of this drop  &#173;&#173;  tax shelters,
reduced work effort, evasion  &#173;&#173;  is not yet clear.
Whatever the cause, the entire economy suffers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Given what happened in the 1980s, however, the failure of the
Clinton tax hike should be no surprise. Critics charged that the
Reagan tax cuts were a &quot;giveaway to the rich,&quot; but government
figures show that upper-income taxpayers paid a significantly
<I>larger</I> share of the income tax burden after their tax rates
were reduced. Simply stated, lower tax rates encouraged substantial
income growth and reduced incentives to shelter and underreport
income, and the result was a large increase in taxable income
which generated substantial amounts of new revenue for the government
even though actual tax rates were lower.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>ADVANTAGES OF A FLAT TAX<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two principal arguments for a flat tax:  growth and
simplicity. Economists are attracted to the idea because the current
tax system reduces growth, destroys jobs, and lowers incomes.
While it would not eliminate this damaging impact, a flat tax
would boost the economy's performance when compared with the present
tax code. For many Americans, however, the most persuasive argument
for a flat tax is that the complicated documents and instruction
manuals they must struggle to decipher every April would be replaced
by a simple postcard-size form. This radical reform appeals to
citizens who not only resent the time and expense of their own
tax forms, but also suspect that the existing maze of credits,
deductions, and exemptions gives a special advantage to those
with political power and the money to afford tax accountants.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>The Complexity Problem with the Current System<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By penalizing work, savings, and investment, the income tax has
slowed economic growth and lowered living standards significantly.
This economic damage is compounded by a tax code that imposes
very high costs on those who try to follow the law. As categorized
in James L. Payne's comprehensive <I>Costly Returns:  The Burdens
of the U.S. Tax System</I>, these costs include:<sup>25</sup>
<P><ul>
<li><b>Record keeping</b> &#173;&#173;  organizing data collection systems;
collecting and appraising data; synthesizing data.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Learning about tax requirements</b> &#173;&#173; studying tax form
instructions, tax books, pamphlets, and articles; seeking interactive
instruction in telephone calls and visits to IRS, discussion with
friends and volunteers, classes, training sessions; finding and
using a paid tax preparer<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Preparing the return</b> &#173;&#173;  making appropriate computations;
filling out tax forms and schedules; copying and sending the return.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Tax planning</b> &#173;&#173;  studying tax requirements, books, articles,
etc.; discussing tax avoidance with tax adviser and others; drafting
tax management plan.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to Payne, today's tax code imposes 24.4 cents of compliance
costs for every dollar of taxes raised.<sup>26</sup>  The Tax Foundation puts
the cost at 15.2 cents<sup>27</sup>, though even this means the tax code imposes
$192 billion of compliance costs. Testifying before a congressional
committee, one economist stated, &quot;If an enemy power bent
on destroying our nation were somehow given the opportunity to
devise our tax code with a goal of sapping the nation of its economic
vitality... it could do little better than adopt our current Internal
Revenue Code.&quot;<sup>28</sup>  A professor of tax law declared, &quot;The
United States now has the most complex tax laws in the history
of civilization.&quot;<sup>29</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While every tax system imposes compliance costs, a simple flat
tax would sharply reduce these ancillary costs. As illustrated,
the Armey proposal would allow all taxpayers, from the teenager
flipping hamburgers to the General Motors Corporation, to submit
their returns on a postcard-sized form.<sup>30</sup>  The original tax code
was only 14 pages long, and tax forms were simple one-page documents<sup>31</sup>.
 Today's tax code has swelled to 3,458 pages.<sup>32</sup>  Moreover, the IRS
receives more than 1 billion form 1099s every year as part of
the government's cumbersome efforts to track income from interest,
dividends, and other forms of business income.<sup>33</sup>  With a flat tax,
this burden disappears. The effect would restore the simplicity
of the original income tax.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The tax laws are only the tip of the iceberg. Internal Revenue
Service regulations, supposedly written to clarify ambiguities
in the tax code, are nearly six times the length of the actual
tax law.<sup>34</sup>  To put this in perspective, federal tax laws and regulations
are more than six and one-half times longer than the King James
Bible.<sup>35</sup>  Unfortunately, length is not matched by clarity.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Compliance Costs of the Personal Income Tax<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most individuals are painfully familiar with the peculiarities
of the personal income tax. They wade through the maze of forms
and instructions or pay professionals to do the job for them.
Studies show that Americans spend between 1.6 billion and 2.1
billion hours each year complying with the personal income tax.<sup>36</sup>
 In dollar terms, this represents an annual burden of between
$51 billion and $65 billion<sup>37</sup>, with compliance costs falling most
heavily on small businesses and the self-employed, thereby ensuring
that entrepreneurship is penalized.<sup>38</sup><BR>

<P>
What do taxpayers get for their time and effort?  All too often,
they get wrong answers. Each year, for example, <I>People</I>
magazine used to send tax information about a hypothetical family
to 50 different tax preparers, and each year virtually every one
came up with a different estimate of the family's tax bill &#173;&#173;
most of them missing the right figure by a wide margin.<sup>39</sup>  They
could have called the IRS for advice, but a 1987 General Accounting
Office survey found IRS officials giving taxpayers the wrong information
47 percent of the time.<sup>40</sup>  This survey was conducted just after
a major tax reform, and accuracy presumably has improved as IRS
staff have absorbed its intricacies. Nonetheless, the fact that
professionals both inside and outside of government have so much
trouble with the law argues compellingly for a simple flat tax.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Compliance Costs of the Corporate Income Tax<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The personal income tax code is relatively simple when compared
with the laws driving the corporate tax system. According to Payne,
American businesses devote more than 3.6 billion hours to tax
compliance every year<sup>41</sup>, in addition to which compliance costs actually
may exceed the total raised by the corporate income tax. One recent
study estimated that these costs exceeded revenues by $40 billion,
while another found them to be as much as 75 percent of revenues.<sup>42</sup>
 Small corporations, those with assets of $1 million or less (90
percent of U.S. corporations), are especially victimized with
compliance costs of $382 for every $100 raised.<sup>43</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Like individual taxpayers, businesses may have no way of knowing
whether the information they put on their tax returns is accurate.
Provisions like depreciation, alternate minimum tax, uniform capitalization,
economic performance rules, transfer pricing, and allocation rules
all add to the complexity of corporate taxes and help explain
why businesses spend 3.6 billion hours a year trying to figure
out their tax bills.  Worst of all are the provisions affecting
U.S. corporations that do business overseas. As one executive
has remarked, the &quot;forms are so complex they defy interpretation
and result in noncompetitive cost burdens.&quot;<sup>45</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Tax Evasion<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
Many people in America and around the world choose to evade taxes
by operating in the underground economy.<sup>46</sup>  By its very nature,
the underground economy is difficult to measure. Scholars have
come up with estimates ranging from a low of 4.5 percent of official
U.S. economic output to a high of 27 percent.<sup>47</sup>  High tax rates
and complexity contribute to a decision to operate outside the
law<sup>48</sup>, but a great deal of the underground economy is the result
of government decisions to impose criminal penalties on drugs,
gambling, and prostitution. Income from such activity would not
be disclosed whatever the tax rate, and this makes it more difficult
to estimate the tax-induced economic losses from the underground
economy.<sup>49</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Costs of Taxation Incurred by Government<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A complex tax system with high marginal rates also imposes costs
on government. The annual cost of operating the Internal Revenue
Service, for instance, is expected to reach almost $10 billion
in 1995, and other government agencies also have tax-related divisions
which add about $3.5 billion to the total. All told, according
to one study, the federal government will employ more than 136,000
people and spend more than $13.7 billion enforcing the tax code
in 1995.<sup>50</sup>  While considerably less than the costs borne by the
private sector, these figures would drop significantly under a
simplified flat tax.<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<I><B>T</B></I>HE ECONOMIC ARGUMENT FOR A FLAT TAX<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two ways to increase a nation's economic output or rate
of growth.  In simple terms, Americans must work more or work
more productively. Thus, economic growth depends on some combination
of:

<P><OL>
<b><li>Adding more labor to the economy</b>, which happens when people choose
to work longer hours, they take second jobs, or their spouses
join the workforce, or<BR>

<P>
<b><li>Adding more capital to the economy</b> so that workers can produce
more goods and services per hour of time worked.
<P></ol>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax would build a stronger economy by correcting both the
anti-labor and anti-capital features of the current income tax
code.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Discourage Work<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxes on labor discourage work by reducing the benefits (after-tax
income) individuals receive from offering their labor to employers.
In the language of economists, taxes reduce the &quot;price&quot;
of leisure relative to work, so when taxes and other government
policies make work less attractive by reducing take-home pay,
many individuals choose either not to work or to cut back the
number of hours they work.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This can take many forms. Economic research indicates that taxes
have a strong impact on whether people work,<sup>53</sup> particularly people
with low incomes whose welfare benefits often result in higher
after-tax &quot;income&quot; than they can earn by holding a job.<sup>54</sup>
 Taxes also reduce incentives for those who do choose to work,
causing a decline in hours worked and, in the case of high taxes,
the willingness to work overtime (at least three strikes in recent
months were against additional overtime).<sup>55</sup>  Excessive taxation
also discourages second jobs, since workers often find that the
additional after-tax income is not enough to offset the leisure
time sacrificed. <a href="#appen1">Appendix 1</a> lists several studies that document
the impact of taxes on the decision to work.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Even though studies confirm the relationship, the idea that marginal
tax rates profoundly influence individual incentives is not immediately
obvious to many Americans. They recognize that businesses must
watch the bottom line and thus understand how higher taxes depress
wages and cost jobs, but they think about their own lives and
conclude that a shift &#173;&#173; up or down &#173;&#173; in
marginal tax rates probably will not mean dramatic change. Most
Americans, after all, do not take second jobs in response to lower
tax rates.<sup>56</sup>  Nor are many workers likely to refuse overtime just
because they rise. How, then, will lower marginal tax rates encourage
economic growth?<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It turns out that high tax rates have a particularly pronounced
effect at the upper end of the income scale. Unlike most citizens,
the &quot;rich&quot; have significant control over the timing
and composition of their income. As seen in the <a href="bg1035c5.gif">chart</a> on page
9, &quot;rich&quot; taxpayers receive most of their income from
investments and business activity.<sup>57</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whether wealthy taxpayers are small businesses or investors, their
relative lack of dependence on wage and salary income means they
have far more ability to alter their economic behavior and protect
their income when changes in tax rates alter incentives. For small
businesses, any increase in tax rates lessens the ability to hire
workers or retain earnings for expansion. Because of the direct
effect taxes have on their generally smaller profit margins, small
businesses are even more sensitive to changes in the tax code
than large corporations are.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many well-to-do taxpayers, of course, receive a large portion
of their incomes from dividends, interest, capital gains, and
other types of investments or passive business earnings. As with
most other Americans, they seek to realize the largest possible
return on their investments and to protect as much of their wealth
and income from the government as possible. In a survey conducted
by Prince &amp; Associates, a Connecticut financial consulting
firm, 89 percent of 311 high-income business owners were found
to be &quot;extremely interested&quot; in &quot;tax minimization
strategies.&quot;<sup>58</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One significant advantage these taxpayers have over most other
Americans is the ability to retain the services of highly qualified
tax lawyers, accountants, and investment advisors, each of whom
supposedly can generate the highest after-tax return for clients.
Needless to say, increases in marginal tax rates reduce the attractiveness
of many investments. This encourages tax professionals and their
clients to focus on sheltering income, reducing tax code earnings,
placing assets overseas, and otherwise avoiding taxes. Consider
the following:
<P><ul>
<li><b>Municipal bonds are exempt from federal tax.</b> In a <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> report on the growth of these bonds in the aftermath
of Clinton's record tax increase<sup>59</sup>, a member of one billionaire
family noted, &quot;A wealthy New York City resident is looking
at a combined city, state, and federal rate of nearly 50 percent.
So you've got to buy municipal bonds. You've got to. A long-dated
muni yielding 5.5 percent is equal to a 10.53 percent yield on
a taxable [U.S.] government bond.&quot;<sup>60</sup>  Rather than reduce the
budget deficit, as politicians claim, high tax rates merely drive
wealthy investors into tax-free municipal bonds and other shelters.
The federal government does not collect new tax revenues, and
overall tax collections may well fall. In addition, there is real
damage to the economy as driving investors out of productive private-sector
investments and into buying the debt of state and local government
undermines economic growth, resulting in less job creation and
stagnating incomes.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>Fidelity Investments offers a new mutual fund based on tax minimization
strategies.</b><sup>61</sup>  Again, the issue is economic. As with similar funds,
managers' investment decisions, deploying huge amounts of money,
are influenced more by the arcane features of the tax code than
by real economic factors.<BR>

<P>
<li><b>The tax code drives some people to hide their money by sending
it overseas.</b> Even though such behavior is illegal, one financial
adviser recently explained, &quot;People are hiding money. They
don't like the tax system, and they think it will get worse. Legal
experts outside the U.S. tell me that they are getting a 100 percent
increase in the business every six months.&quot;<sup>62</sup><BR>

<P>
<li><b>Perhaps most revealing, the tax burden has become so oppressive
that some Americans choose to emigrate to protect their earnings.</b><sup>63</sup>
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This anecdotal evidence that people respond to tax changes by
acting to protect their earnings and change their behavior is
supported by government data. Monthly personal income data from
the Commerce Department, for example, show that income jumped
sharply at the end of 1992 and fell just as dramatically in early
1993. The reason:  the widely expected Clinton tax increase. Taxpayers
with any discretion over when they received earnings shifted income
from 1993 to 1992 to limit the additional amount taken by the
government.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Not surprisingly, monthly tax collection figures echo these data.
Taxpayers with modest earnings pay most of their income taxes
in the form of amounts withheld from their paychecks throughout
the year. Wealthy individuals and businesses, however, because
most of their income is not subject to withholding, are legally
obligated to make quarterly payments. Most of these payments are
made routinely in the months they are due, but this pattern changed
dramatically in 1993, when January's share of the payments was
more than 70 percent higher than the average January share for
the previous 15 years. This is significant, because January 1993
was the month quarterly payments for the last three months of
1992 were due. Well-to-do taxpayers shifted large portions of
their income to 1992 because of widespread anticipation that the
incoming Clinton Administration would increase marginal tax rates.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These quarterly payment figures underscore that small businesses
and rich taxpayers can and do alter the timing and composition
of their income to protect their earnings. One prominent example
is the First Lady of the United States. Hillary Rodham Clinton
elected to take her partner's share of earnings at the Rose Law
Firm on December 31, 1992, rather than at the beginning of the
following year as she had in previous years. Perhaps Mrs. Clinton,
like other smart taxpayers, suspected the new President might
propose higher tax rates and did what she could to minimize her
family's tax liability. If she did, as the following examples
indicate, she was not alone.
<P><ul>
<li>The two top executives at the Disney Corporation exercised stock
options shortly before 1993, presumably to avoid widely expected
tax increases once Clinton took office.<sup>64</sup>

<P>
<li>Other top-level corporate executives did the same thing. Three
General Dynamics Corporation officials exercised options to purchase
over 500,000 shares of company stock before the 1993 tax year
began.<sup>65</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Well-advised professional athletes also acted to protect their
earnings in 1992. Among baseball players, Oakland's Ruben Sierra
and Mark McGwire arranged for lump sum payments of $6 million
and $7 million, respectively, to avoid 1993's higher taxes. Other
players doing the same thing included David Cone of the Kansas
City Royals, with a lump sum of $9 million, and Detroit's Cecil
Fielder, who negotiated a record $10 million.<sup>66</sup><BR>

<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Discourage Savings and Investment</B>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taxes on savings and investment harm the economy by reducing capital
formation, the process by which the quality and quantity of equipment,
tools, and technology available to workers are increased, thereby
raising their productivity.<sup>67</sup>  Since salaries and wages are linked
closely to productivity, the only way to raise the income of workers
permanently &#173;&#173; assuming no change in their skills &#173;&#173;
is through savings and investment. Simply put, workers are paid
on the basis of what they produce, and giving them better tools
allows them to produce more. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The level of capital formation largely explains why workers in
the United States, Germany, and Japan earn more than workers in
Brazil, India, and Nigeria. Similarly, workers in America today
earn more than their parents because of net investment (increases
in the capital stock). As a result, they are more productive,
generating more output per hour of labor.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An ideal tax system does not penalize or subsidize particular
economic choices. Unfortunately, one of the most destructive elements
of the current income tax is the multiple taxation of savings
and investment. Just as savings, dividend, business, and other
forms of investment income are penalized by the personal income
tax, capital formation is hindered by corporate income, capital
gains, estate, and gift taxes, by depreciation tax provisions,
and by the corporate alternative minimum tax. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <a href="#appen2">Appendix 2</a> reveals ample evidence that taxes significantly reduce
savings and investment. This is important, of course, because
reduced levels of capital formation translate into reduced levels
of income.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why Capital Formation Matters<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Economists of all persuasions recognize the relationship between
investment and wages. Paul Samuelson, for example, a Nobel Laureate
economist who endorsed Bill Clinton for President, has written:
<BR>

<P><blockquote>
 What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with
more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work
with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive
real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and
meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates. <sup>68</sup></blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another example is taken from a 1991 report on economic growth
prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, then
controlled by the Democrats:<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> When an economy's rate of net investment (gross investment less
depreciation)<sup>69</sup> increases, the economy's stock of capital increases.
A larger capital stock permits a fixed amount of labor to produce
more goods and services. The larger a country's capital stock,
the more productive its workers and, generally, the higher its
real wages and salaries. Thus, increases in investment tend to
cause future increases in a nation's standard of living.<sup>70</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a 1989 report on economic growth published by the
Congressional Research Service,<BR>

<P>
<blockquote> Capital deepening has been and will likely continue to be a central
force for accelerating growth and potential output over the medium
term. But as we have seen, a permanent increase in the long-term
rate of growth will hinge on the United States ability to increase
the pace of technical advance and innovation. However, both of
these routes to faster growth will be contingent upon the ability
to increase the level of investment spending &#173;&#173; more
spending for capital equipment and more spending for research
and development. To finance higher investment will, in turn, require
that Americans raise the national rate of savings.<sup>71</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Critics of this analysis complain that it is nothing more than
&quot;trickle-down&quot; economics that relies on tax cuts for
the &quot;rich&quot; to boost wages. Such rhetoric may be useful
politically, but it cannot change economic reality, as economist
John Shoven has explained:<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
 The mechanism of raising real wages by stimulating investment
is sometimes derisively referred to as &quot;trickle-down&quot;
economics. But regardless of the label used, no one doubts that
the primary mechanism for raising the return to work is providing
each worker with better and more numerous tools. One can wonder
about the length of time it takes for such a policy of increasing
saving and investments to have a pronounced effect on wages, but
I know of no one who doubts the correctness of the underlying
mechanism. In fact, most economists would state the <I>only</I>
way to increase real wages in the long run is through extra investments
per worker.<sup>72</sup><BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The following example illustrates why savings and investment suffer
in the current tax climate. A taxpayer has $100 of income and
must decide what to do with it. He can consume the $100, spending
it on food, vacations, clothing, haircuts, or some other product
or service, in which case (with the exception of possible sales
taxes) he will receive close to $100 in goods and services for
his money. Or he can invest in the stock of a start-up company
with the potential to provide new jobs to the community and produce
goods that consumers desire. If the company succeeds, the investor
most likely will profit. If it fails, he will lose his $100.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In this case, the investment bears fruit and yields a 10 percent
rate of return, enabling the company to produce $10 of annual
income for every $100 invested. Under the current tax code, 34
percent is skimmed off to pay the corporate income tax, leaving
only $6.60 out of the original $10. This $6.60 then goes to the
investor as a dividend. But there are other taxes. Depending on
the investor's income, the personal income tax will take as much
as 39.6 percent of his $6.60, leaving him with less than $4.00
of annual income from a &quot;successful&quot; $100 investment.
In addition, he may face applicable state and local income taxes.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, if the investor ever decides to sell the stock, he will
be hit by one of the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized
world, and what little income he eventually receives from saving
and from having taken the risk of investing most probably will
be subject to sales tax when he spends it. To add insult to injury,
successful entrepreneurs who try to accumulate an estate to pass
on to their children are penalized by inheritance taxes which
can confiscate 55 percent of a deceased's assets.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Thanks to the tax code, a fortunate investor &#173;&#173; one
who actually earns money on his investments &#173;&#173; may have
to send more than half his earnings to the government, not to
mention having already paid taxes on the money used for the investment
in the first place. Thus, government tax policy has created a
very tilted playing field. By punishing saving and investment,
the tax code encourages both individuals and businesses to consume
rather than to build for America's future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As discussed earlier, the only ways to boost per capita income
are to work more hours or produce more per hour worked. Since
leisure has a positive value to Americans, particularly those
with families, most would prefer to raise their living standards
by increasing their hourly productivity. This is why taxes on
capital are especially damaging. They penalize the very economic
actions &#173;&#173; saving and investment &#173;&#173; necessary
for increased productivity and the growth in wages that accompanies
it. Thus, while it is important that the tax code not discourage
people from working more if that is what they desire, eliminating
the multiple layers of taxes on saving and investment is even
more critical if we want higher incomes without sacrificing leisure
time.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Why High Tax Rates Depress Economic Growth<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Since taxes affect incentives to work, save, and invest so powerfully,
it should come as no surprise that major tax changes almost always
have a significant impact on the economy. Herbert Hoover's decision
in 1930 to increase the top tax rate from 25 percent to 63 percent
certainly contributed to the Depression. Lyndon Johnson's surtax
on income tax liabilities, enacted in 1968, together with an increase
in the capital gains tax helped end the 1960s expansion. Large
tax increases, including inflation-induced bracket creep, contributed
to the economy's dismal performance under Jimmy Carter. George
Bush's record tax increase in 1990 was a principal cause of the
recent recession and subsequent anemic recovery. And the sub-par
performance of today's economy, particularly the decline in median
household income<sup>73</sup>, almost certainly is attributable in part to
the record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by Bill
Clinton.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Once again, the evidence is confirmed by academic research. As
the examples in <a href="#appen3">Appendix 3</a> indicate, tax codes that penalize productive
economic behavior are associated with weaker growth, fewer jobs,
and lower incomes. Other studies find that the damage occurs when
government spends the money. In either case, the message is clear:
 The larger and more intrusive a government is, the worse its
economy performs.<BR>

<P>
<h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT A FLAT TAX</h3>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font> :  Will a flat tax encourage job creation?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  A flat tax will encourage more jobs and higher wages by boosting
incentives to work, save, and invest.</b> In the long run, the elimination
of most of the tax code's bias against savings and investment
will have the biggest effect. As studies show, a flat tax will
encourage capital formation, leading over time to higher levels
of productivity, increased wages, and more jobs. A flat tax also
will have a more immediate impact on job creation, however, by
making work more attractive. High tax rates drive a wedge between
what it costs a business to employ a worker and how much the worker
receives in take-home pay.<sup>74</sup>  By increasing the cost of labor, taxes
lower the number of workers a company is willing to hire. Businesses
do not exist to pay workers more than they are worth. They exist
to make money and will hire only as long as the value of each
new worker's additional output exceeds the total cost of employing
that worker.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When politicians enact policies that raise the cost of employment,
the total cost of some workers will rise above the value they
bring their employers. In the long run, a business has only two
options when faced with this predicament:  close its doors or
lay off workers who are net money losers. Even workers who retain
their jobs pay a price. Taxes on labor income, whether paid by
employee or employer, dollar for dollar, unavoidably reduce the
amount that finds its way into their paychecks. Politicians may
pretend otherwise, but every time the tax burden climbs, workers'
after-tax income declines.<sup>75</sup><BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  This depends on which flat tax is implemented.</b> More specifically,
it depends on the tax rate and whether the proposal includes limits
on government spending. Even though lower rates generally stimulate
economic growth and expand the tax base, at some point they translate
into less revenue. A flat tax of 20 percent, for instance, almost
certainly would raise more money than a flat tax of 10 percent.
The size of the personal exemption/family allowance also plays
a key role, since the decision to protect a certain amount of
income ($36,800 for a family of four in last year's Armey bill)
generally means the rate on taxable income must be higher.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a Treasury Department analysis leaked to the media
before the 1994 elections, the Administration estimates that the
Armey flat tax would result in a $244 billion revenue loss to
the federal government in 1995.<sup>76</sup>  But this study contained a $500
billion error, as the Department later admitted<sup>77</sup>, and used the
17 percent rate to analyze 1995 revenues even though the Armey
bill calls explicitly for an initial rate of 20 percent (which
would be phased down to 17 percent). The Treasury Department now
claims that, once fully phased in, the Armey flat tax would &quot;cost&quot;
the government as much as $186 billion per year.<sup>78</sup>  Because it is
based on static analysis, however, this figure assumes that reduced
tax rates and simplification would have no positive effect on
the economy. Hence, it ignores the additional revenues produced
by income growth (as well as the binding caps on federal spending
that the Armey bill would impose).<sup>79</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax almost certainly would reduce long-term government
borrowing since its reduced rates and lower taxes on savings and
investment would boost economic growth. Each year, the result
would be an expanding tax base and at least some reduction in
outlays for certain means-tested programs and the unemployment
compensation system. According to one relatively modest estimate
of supply-side impact, a flat tax would increase the economy's
long-run annual growth rate by just 0.5 percent. By the tenth
year, national economic output would be $578 billion higher than
it would have been without a flat tax.<sup>80</sup>  Government's &quot;share&quot;
of this production of additional goods and services would be $86
billion in tax revenue.<sup>81</sup>  By the twentieth year, added growth of
0.5 percent would mean an increase of more than $2 trillion in
GDP and additional tax revenues in excess of $300 billion.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The revenue feedback from higher growth, however, probably would
not be enough in the short term to offset the revenue lost from
lower tax rates and elimination of the multiple taxation of capital
income. Achieving a deficit-neutral flat tax (at least the Armey
version) would require some restraints on government spending.
And if lawmakers were forced to balance the budget by 2002, the
limit on spending increases would have to be even more stringent.
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What would happen to charitable contributions and the housing
market?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  While many recognize that a flat tax is far better than the
current system, they fear that the transition would create problems</b> &#173;&#173; in particular, that the loss of charitable and home
mortgage interest deductions could cause turmoil in affected markets.
This is a legitimate concern. A wealthy individual donating money
to a museum no longer could claim the gift as a deduction, reducing
his tax burden by nearly 40 cents for every dollar given and thereby
also reducing the &quot;price&quot; of his gift. The loss of the
home mortgage interest deduction would increase the after-tax
cost of housing payments and could lead to a drop in housing values,
since experts believe the value of the home mortgage interest
deduction is factored into home values.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Fortunately, history suggests these fears are exaggerated. During
the 1980s, the top tax rate was reduced dramatically, from 70
percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The effect was to slash
the value of the deduction and raise the &quot;price&quot; of
gifts. Similarly, the decline in tax rates increased the after-tax
cost of mortgage payments. In fact, the after-tax costs of mortgage
interest for homeowners and donations for charitable givers in
the highest tax bracket jumped from 30 cents to 72 cents on the
dollar, an increase of 140 percent. Most other taxpayers also
experienced a significant increase in after-tax costs of contributions
and mortgages.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If these sectors of the economy depended on the value of the tax
deduction, there should have been a noticeable downturn in home
values and charitable contributions during the 1980s. As the charts
show, however, the value of <a href="bg1035c7.gif">housing</a> did not drop. Also, <a href="bg1035c6.gif">charitable contributions</a> rose throughout the 1980s even as the out-of-pocket
cost to donors increased. These charts do not mean that lower
tax rates necessarily encourage more charity and higher home values.
They simply suggest that any adverse consequences from lower rates
&#173;&#173; or from no deductions at all &#173;&#173; can be
offset if the economy's performance is robust. In other words,
charitable contributions and housing values may well depend more
on rising incomes and wealth creation than on tax status.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There is strong reason to believe, moreover, that a flat tax would
stimulate the housing industry because of its impact on interest
rates. The current tax treatment of mortgage interest &#173;&#173;
deductible to borrowers and taxable to lenders &#173;&#173; results
in artificially high interest rates.<sup>82</sup>  One need only compare the
interest rate on tax-free municipal bonds with the interest rate
on taxable bonds to see how tax treatment of interest results
in unnecessarily high interest rates. If adoption of a flat tax
reduced interest rates to the level enjoyed by municipal bonds,
the impact on the housing industry would be substantive and positive.
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What would happen to the price of other assets?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  While the potentially negative impact on housing markets and
charity appears negligible, the positive impact on income-producing
assets would be large.</b> Assets such as stocks, bonds, and rental
properties produce a stream of income over time. Their market
price is determined by calculating how much income an asset will
produce over time, after taxes, adjusted to reflect the fact that
income today is worth more than the same amount of nominal income
in the future.<sup>83</sup>  By lowering tax rates and removing the double
and sometimes triple taxation of capital income, a flat tax can
increase dramatically the after-tax income stream an asset will
generate. Thus, a low-rate flat tax would be a boon to asset holders,
offsetting any theoretical fall in housing prices, and would stimulate
a surge of new investment in the economy. Harvard professor and
tax economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that a flat tax would increase
national wealth by $1 trillion.<sup>84</sup>  While this may seem high, it
should be remembered that the mere announcement in Israel that
a capital gains tax was being imposed caused the Israeli stock
market to drop by 10 percent in just one day.<sup>85</sup><BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax benefit everybody?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  If the question is considered narrowly (will anyone's tax
bill rise?) it depends on how a flat tax is structured.</b> If it
is designed to give the government as much money as it receives
under the current system, and if there is no consideration of
the increased revenue that would accrue from new job creation
and higher economic growth, then it is impossible to avoid having
winners and losers. In the long run, a flat tax presumably would
generate higher incomes and living standards, raising after-tax
income even for those who suffered a short-term tax increase.
At the same time, it doubtless would have an adverse impact on
the lawyers, accountants, and lobbyists who profit from the current
law's complexity.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many flat tax proposals are structured so that few taxpayers,
if any, would have higher tax bills. This is because they are
designed to go beyond simplification and rate reduction to include
significant tax cuts for the American economy. The Armey plan
is a good example. Using static estimating techniques, it probably
would save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars over a five-year
period. While the combination of a 17 percent tax rate and generous
family exemption would not necessarily guarantee lower tax bills
for everyone, few would face higher taxes.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Is there a way to stop politicians from raising tax rates
in the future?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  There is no guarantee that a future Congress would not turn
a simple flat tax back into a complicated &quot;progressive&quot; tax.</b> This is the Achilles' Heel of tax reform. The sweeping reform
enacted in 1986 expanded the tax base by eliminating many deductions
while simultaneously reducing tax rates to keep the total tax
burden from climbing. Skeptics warned that politicians could not
be trusted to honor this arrangement and that eventually they
would raise rates while failing to restore deductions. This is
exactly what happened under Presidents Bush and Clinton.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Could this happen with a flat tax?  Using the promise of low tax
rates, could politicians take away the home mortgage interest
deduction, the charitable contributions deduction, and other tax
preferences but then raise tax rates in the future?  It is to
reduce this danger that most proponents of a flat tax include
an ironclad provision to make raising tax rates difficult or impossible.
One way to accomplish this would be by amending the Constitution
to require that no increase in tax rates can be approved without
the votes of at least three-fifths or two-thirds (in other words,
a &quot;super-majority&quot;) of both the House and Senate.<sup>86</sup><BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Should the income tax be abolished instead?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  Proponents of a flat tax note that the current &quot;progressive&quot;
income tax penalizes growth, discourages savings and investment, imposes heavy compliance costs, destroys jobs, and reduces America's international competitiveness.</b> It has been pointed out, moreover,
that a flat rate income tax reduces but does not eliminate these
negative effects. Thus, the question for some becomes whether
it would be better to replace the income tax with a sales or &quot;consumption&quot;
tax. Proponents of this view, including House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) and Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN),
usually suggest that the foregone revenue could be offset by spending
cuts, consumption taxes, or some combination of the two.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most advocates of a flat tax recognize that this argument is sound,
at least in theory. Abolishing the income tax, closing down the
Internal Revenue Service, and repealing the 16th Amendment clearly
would be in the national interest. Eliminating the income tax
would lead to even more economic growth and job creation than
would occur under a flat tax. The real question is how that goal
can be achieved.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Supporters of the flat tax have decided that eliminating the income
tax is unlikely, especially in the short run. Because so many
interest groups benefit from the current tax system, enacting
a flat tax will be difficult by itself. Moreover, there is some
concern that proposals to abolish the income tax could play into
the hands of those who want a national sales tax, or value added
tax (VAT), as an add-on tax. If implemented as a replacement for
the income tax, either of these would be less destructive to the
economy. The experiences of other countries, however, suggest
that, while a VAT would be implemented with the promise to eliminate
other taxes, politicians would never take that second step. The
country then would have the worst of both worlds:  income <I>and</I>
direct consumption taxes.<sup>87</sup>  In any event, enacting a flat tax is
probably necessary as an interim measure for those who favor eliminating
the income tax.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  Probably, but &#173;&#173; again &#173;&#173; it depends on
how the flat tax is structured.</b> The marriage penalty refers to
the increased tax faced by a married couple compared to two single
people with similar incomes. This penalty is most severe for couples
with similar earnings. A flat tax automatically solves part of
this problem by making it no longer possible for one spouse's
income to push a couple into a higher tax bracket. But the marriage
penalty also arises if the personal exemption for a married couple
is not twice the size of the exemption for those filing singly.
The Armey proposal solves this part of the problem by giving a
married couple twice the exemption of a single filer. Nevertheless,
a flat tax could be constructed that retains this penalty.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  How would a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  It would be possible to reform the personal income tax dramatically
while leaving the corporate income tax untouched.</b> As mentioned
earlier, many businesses file using the personal tax code, so
many of their problems would be solved by a flat tax that left
the corporate tax code untouched. All flat taxes based on the
Hall/Rabushka model, however, reform both the personal and corporate
income tax codes. Under the Armey proposal, for instance, the
business rate would fall to 17 percent, the same as the personal
rate, and the code would be reformed to eliminate the excess taxation
of capital.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;A flat tax can be designed to include substantial reform of Social
Security and Medicare payroll taxes. Under current law, payroll
taxes totaling 15.3 percent are levied on the first $61,600 of
income (7.65 percent each from employer and employee, though economists
agree that the entire tax is borne by the worker).<sup>88</sup>  Although none
has reached legislative form, some flat tax plans incorporate
the payroll tax, making the total marginal tax rate a fixed percentage
regardless of income.<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  Would a flat tax help America compete?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  The historic tax rate reductions launched by Ronald Reagan
in the 1980s caused a chain reaction around the world.</b> Many nations
followed America's example and have made similarly dramatic reductions
in marginal tax rates in recent years. In large part, this worldwide
shift in tax policy was driven by competition as investors avoided
nations with high tax rates. Unfortunately, America seems to be
one of the few nations that have not learned from the experience
of the 1980s. While the rest of the world has been cutting taxes,
the United States stands alone as the only major nation to impose
sharply higher tax rates in recent years. Investors have reacted
accordingly, and the amount of new investment in American jobs
and business from overseas has dropped from an average of $175
billion per year during the low tax years of the 1980s to an average
of only $108 billion in 1990.<sup>89</sup><BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b><font size="+1">Q</font>:  What happens to capital gains taxes and estate taxes under
a flat tax?<BR>

<P>
<font size="+1">A</font>:  They are all eliminated.</b> One of the key principles of a flat
tax is that income is taxed only once. A capital gain for a financial
asset is simply a reflection that the market's expectation of
the after-tax streams of income from that asset has risen. Under
a flat tax, that income is taxed at the business level when it
is realized. To tax the capital gain is double taxation. Similarly,
the estate tax is a second layer of tax on earning which, under
the current system, already has been taxed at least once.<BR>

<I><B>C</B></I>ONCLUSION<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;America's income tax system punishes the economy, imposes heavy
compliance costs on taxpayers, rewards special interests, and
makes America less competitive. A flat tax would reduce these
costs drastically and create a tax system that rewards productive
behavior. Perhaps more important, it would reduce the federal
government's power over taxpayers' lives and get government out
of the business of trying to micromanage the economy. No tax is
good for the economy, but the flat tax moves the system much closer
to where it should be &#173;&#173; to being a tax that raises
needed revenue in the least destructive and least intrusive way
possible.

  Taxes Affect Decisions to Work</b>
<hr>
<P><ul>
<li>Joint research by economists from Princeton University and Brigham
Young University, based on a random survey of physicians, found
that a one percentage point increase in marginal tax rates is
associated with a reduction of as much as 1.11 percent in hours
worked.<sup>90</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A University of California economist found that because of the
Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which lowered tax rates), the work effort
of high-income married women rose by 0.8 percent for every one
percent their after-tax wages increased.<sup>91</sup>

<P>
<li>Another economist found that &quot;Husbands of retirement age,
60 and over, show substantial variation in hours of work, related
systematically to wages and income in the expected way.&quot;
  Moreover, &quot;Wives in all age groups are quite sensitive
to wages and income.&quot;<sup>92</sup>  In other words, as after-tax income
falls, so does the incentive to work.<BR>

<P>
<li>Two other economists estimated that &quot;wives' labor supply
will increase by 3.8 percent&quot; in response to a reduction
in the marriage penalty.<sup>93</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A comprehensive study in <I>The Journal of Human Resources</I>
found that taxes reduce married males' hours of work by 2.6 percent
and married females' by between 10 percent and 30 percent.<sup>94</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>According to a statistical study in <I>Econometrica</I>, yearly
hours of work for white married women increase by 2.3 percent
for every one percent increase in after-tax earnings.<sup>95</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>While husbands are not as sensitive to taxes as wives, the impact
of taxes on their behavior is nonetheless dramatic. One study
found that they work eight percent less than they would in the
absence of taxes.<sup>96</sup>  This indicates a loss in economic output of
at least $1,000 per person.<sup>97</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>All studies acknowledge that higher after-tax incomes increase
incentives to work by increasing the &quot;price&quot; of leisure,
but some assume this effect is offset because lower taxes allow
workers to achieve a certain level of income by working fewer
hours. While this trade-off is relevant when looking at individual
choices, two economists note that &quot;the generalization of
the individual analysis to the economy as a whole is invalid&quot;
because &quot;It will be impossible for <I>all</I> individuals
to consume both more goods and more leisure as the individual
work-leisure analysis implies.&quot;<sup>98</sup>  The actual economy-wide
response to changes in tax rates will be higher than almost all
studies indicate.<sup>99</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>One econometric model found that a one percent reduction in tax
rates increased work effort for lower-income workers by 0.1 percent,
for middle and upper-middle-income workers by 0.25 percent, and
for upper-income workers by more than 2.0 percent.<sup>100</sup><BR>

Taxes Reduce Savings and Investment</b>
<hr>
<P><ul>
<li>In a book on taxes and capital formation, Norman B. Ture and B.
Kenneth Sanden noted, &quot;The bias against saving in the present
tax system results from the fact that, with few exceptions, taxes
are imposed both on the amount of current saving and on the future
returns to such saving, whereas the tax falls only once on income
used for consumption.&quot;<sup>101</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Economist John Shoven estimates that a reduction of 20 percent
in the top rate for capital gains would cause the stock market
to rise by 3 percent.<sup>102</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Undersecretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has written
that &quot;increases in the real after-tax rate of return received
by savers would lead to substantial increases in long-run capital
accumulation.&quot;  Further, &quot;bequests may account for a
large fraction of national capital formation,&quot; which strengthens
the argument that taxes influence savings.<sup>103</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A study in <I>The American Political Science Review</I> noted
that &quot;Nations...where the extractive [tax] capacity of government
did not significantly increase, relative to the economic product,
have, in a sense, opted for...an increasing rate of private capital
accumulation.&quot;<sup>104</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Analyzing the decline in savings, a study by three experts concluded
that Social Security and other transfer programs have led to a
&quot;decline in U.S. saving.&quot;<sup>105</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Two other economists also concluded that Social Security reduces
savings because workers no longer worry as much about retirement.
<sup>106</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Econometric results, according to a study published in the <I>Journal
of Public Economics</I>, &quot;suggest that dividend taxes have
important effects on investment decisions&quot; and that &quot;an
increase of 10 percent in the stock market would raise the investment
rate by about 15 percent.&quot;<sup>107</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Writing in the <I>National Tax Journal</I>, three economists found
&quot;significant effects for the after-tax return on saving,
after-tax cost of borrowing, or both.&quot;  The Reagan tax cuts
&quot;had a major impact on U.S. economic growth.&quot;<sup>108</sup><BR>

Growth Is Weaker When Government Penalizes Economic Behavior</b><BR>
<hr>
<P><ul>
<li>A 1983 World Bank study of twenty countries found that low-tax
nations experience faster growth, generate more investment, and
enjoy more rapid increases in productivity and standards of living
than high-tax nations.<sup>109</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>The tax system imposes between 22 cents and 54 cents of losses
for every dollar raised, according to a labor-supply economist.
For working wives, the losses are even higher:  more than 58 cents
for very dollar of tax revenue.<sup>110</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Another study found that each 1.0 percent increase in the federal
tax burden reduces economic growth by 1.8 percent and lowers national
employment by 1.14 percent.<sup>111</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>According to a statistical study published in the <I>American
Economic Review</I>, for every dollar paid to the federal government
in taxes, 33.2 cents is lost to the economy.<sup>112</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>The increased tax burden between 1965 and 1980 drove an estimated
1.9 million people out of the U.S. labor force.<sup>113</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>Statistical research published in <I>Lloyd's Bank Review</I> has
found that in the U.K. each one percent rise in payroll taxes
causes hiring to fall by approximately 1.4 percent. The same study
estimated that each $1 of additional tax revenue costs $3 in lost
economic output.<sup>114</sup> <BR>

<P>
<li> A study printed in the <I>American Sociological Review</I> concluded
that &quot;Increases of one percent in the tax burden relative
to household income are directly associated with a 2.8 percent
decline in economic growth over three years, or just under one
percent annually.&quot;<sup>115</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>An <I>American Economic Review</I> study found that every dollar
of taxes could impose as much as $4 of lost output on the economy,
with the probable harm ranging between $1.32 and $1.47.<sup>116</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A 1981 analysis of the Swedish economy in the <I>Journal of Political
Economy</I> found that &quot;The estimated long-run effects [of
high marginal tax rates] are sufficient to explain up to 75 percent
of the recent decline in the measured growth of the Swedish GNP.&quot;<sup>117</sup>

percent and 80 percent of the additional wealth generated by increased
savings and investment goes to workers.<sup>118</sup><BR>

<li>Another study in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> estimated
that the corporate income tax costs more in lost output than it
raises for the government. The &quot;excess burden&quot; is &quot;123
percent of revenue.&quot;<sup>119</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>A 1984 study in the <I>American Economic Review</I> estimated
&quot;20.7 cents of welfare loss per additional dollar of tax
revenue.&quot;<sup>120</sup><BR>

<li>A study of U.S. taxes at the state level found that low-tax states
grew 35 percent faster than high-tax states between 1970 and 1980.

been shown in literally dozens of studies.<sup>122</sup><BR>

<li>Another economist was able to illustrate a very strong inverse
relation between average per capita growth rates and average tax
rates on income and profits in developed countries.<BR><sup>123</sup>

<P>
<li>According to an article in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I>,
based on worldwide data, increasing the tax burden by ten percentage
points will reduce annual growth by two percentage points.<sup>124</sup><BR>

<li>In a paper presented at the World Bank, two economists uncovered
an &quot;impressive negative relation between the rate of growth
and the ratio of tax revenue to GDP&quot; as well as a &quot;negative
association between growth and...the 'marginal' income tax rate.&quot;

Korea, Hoover economist Alvin Rabushka has written that <BR>
<BR>
<blockquote>

 The four Asian tigers adopted supply-side tax policies decades
before the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions. Finance ministers
oversaw systems of taxation that featured low rates and/or low
levels of direct taxation of individuals and businesses, the absence

taxation of 10 percentage points was predicted to decrease long-term
growth rates by 1.4 percentage points.&quot;<sup>127</sup><BR>

<P>
<li>According to Daniel Landau, &quot;The results of this study [published

<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some sense, there are no economic losses,
since the income&#173;generating activity does occur. The &quot;losses&quot;
are the tax revenue the Treasury foregoes. In addition, costs
presumably are borne by those who seek to keep income from the
underground economy away from the prying eyes of the IRS.

<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another way to generate growth is by adding
to the population. Over time, a higher birth rate or increased
immigration will raise total economic output. This is not the
same, however, as higher per capita economic output, which is
the prerequisite for higher incomes and rising living standards.
<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital includes not only machinery, equipment,
technology, and buildings, but also human skills. A better&#173;educated
work force, for instance, is a more productive work force.

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examining the relationship at the time
between untaxed unemployment compensation benefits and taxable
income, Martin Feldstein estimated that the combination raised
the unemployment rate by 1.25 percent and drove 1 million workers
out of the labor force. Martin Feldstein, &quot;Unemployment Compensation:

that every $1.00 of additional welfare lowered labor and earnings

that increasing monthly AFDC and Food Stamp benefits by 50 percent
was followed by a 75 percent increase in the number of women participating
in the program and a similar increase in the amount of time spent
receiving benefits. M. Anne Hill and June O'Neill, <I>Underclass

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While most Americans do not work two jobs,
the number of those who do is surprisingly high:  nearly 7.5 million.

are small businesses &#173;&#173; for example, sole proprietorships,

<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taxation is not the only government activity
that inflates the cost of hiring workers and reduces take&#173;home
pay. Myriad regulations, mandated benefits, unemployment compensation,
liability costs, and labor laws drive up the cost of employment
and shrink workers' pay.
<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This process usually works by delaying,
reducing, or canceling wage increases. In most years, additional
investment and training increase worker productivity, making employees
more valuable and allowing businesses to increases wages. When
these productivity increases are accompanied by higher taxes,
however, it is government, not the workers, that captures all
the benefits.

<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its analysis of the Armey proposal,
the Treasury Department admitted that &quot;no attempt is made
to estimate the tax&#173;induced behavioral responses of either
individuals or corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating
conventions used by both the Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint
Committee on Taxation, the macroeconomic aggregates, such as the
level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic
product, have been assumed to be unchanged by the proposal.&quot;

<P>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming taxes would take only 15 percent
of the added output. Since taxes currently consume about 19 percent
of GDP, this estimate understates the potential supply&#173;side
impact on revenues.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There has been a surge in support for a flat tax in recent months, thanks largely to the efforts of House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX). Many Americans see the current tax system as a complicated failure that hinders the nation's growth while allowing the politically well-connected to manipulate the system to get special breaks not available to average workers and businesses. The flat tax, on the other hand, is simple, treats all taxpayers equally, and greatly increases incentives to work, save, and invest.
<p>
<b>WHAT IS A FLAT TAX? </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There have been several flat tax proposals over the years. While they differ in important ways, almost invariably they contain three features, each designed to fix a major problem with the current tax code. The major features of a flat tax are:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Single flat rate.</b> All flat tax proposals have a single tax rate that applies to all income subject to tax. Flat taxes also usually include provisions to ensure that all income is taxed just once. The actual tax imposed varies, with rates in some plans as low as 10 percent and in others approaching 20 percent. The low, flat rate solves the problem of high marginal tax rates by reducing penalties against working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions.</b> Flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the code that bestow preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities. Examples of such preferential treatment include deductions for home mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes. Eliminating these special provisions solves the problem of complexity, allowing taxpayers to file their tax returns on a postcard-sized form.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>No double taxation of savings and investment.</b> Flat tax proposals are designed to reduce or eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by ending the double taxation of income used for savings and investment. Simply stated, these plans often have the equivalent of a "super-IRA," which basically means that taxpayers would be taxed only on the portion of income that is consumed. This reform to ensure that income is not subject to a second level of taxation is needed since today's tax code penalizes future economic growth by discouraging capital formation.
<p>
<b>ADVANTAGES OF A FLAT TAX</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are two principal arguments for a flat tax -- growth and simplicity. Many economists are attracted to the idea because the current tax system, with its high rates and multiple taxation of savings and investment, reduces growth, destroys jobs, and lowers incomes. A flat tax would not eliminate the damaging impact of taxes altogether. But by dramatically lowering rates and ending the tax code's bias against savings and investment, it would boost the economy's performance when compared with the present tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For many Americans, however, the most persuasive feature of a flat tax is its simplicity. The complicated documents and instruction manuals taxpayers struggle to decipher every April would be replaced by a brief set of instructions and the lengthy forms by a simple postcard-sized return. This radical reform appeals to citizens who not only resent the time and expense consumed by their own tax forms, but also suspect that the existing maze of credits, deductions, and exemptions gives a special advantage to those who wield political power and can afford expert tax advisers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If enacted, a flat tax would yield major benefits to the nation, including: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Faster economic growth.</b> A flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment. By increasing incentives to engage in productive economic behavior, it also would boost the economy's long-term growth rate. Even if a flat tax boosted long-term growth by as little as 0.5 percent, the income of the average family of four after ten years would still be as much as $5,000 higher than it would be if current tax laws remained in effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Instant wealth creation.</b> According to Harvard economist Dale Jorgenson, a flat tax would boost national wealth by some $1 trillion.<sup>1</sup>  The reason:  all income-producing assets would rise in value since the flat tax would increase the after-tax stream of income they generate.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Simplicity.</b> All taxpayers, from General Motors to a teenager flipping hamburgers, would be able to fill out their tax return on a postcard-sized form, and compliance costs would drop by tens of billions of dollars. According to a study conducted for the IRS, the current tax code requires taxpayers to devote 5.4 billion hours each year to their tax returns.<sup>2</sup>  Yet even this commitment of time is no guarantee of accuracy. The code is so complex that even tax experts and the Internal Revenue Service often make mistakes.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Fairness.</b> A flat tax would treat people equally. A very wealthy taxpayer with 1,000 times the taxable income of another taxpayer would pay 1,000 times more in taxes. No longer, however, would the tax code penalize success and discriminate against citizens on the basis of income.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An end to micromanaging and political favoritism.</b> The flat tax gets rid of all deductions, loopholes, credits, and exemptions. Politicians would lose all ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax code to impose their values on the economy. According to Professor Alvin Rabushka of Stanford, co-author of <i>The Flat Tax</i>, $100 billion of uneconomical investments are made for tax purposes.<sup>3</sup>  Under a flat tax, those funds would be used to boost economic growth.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Increased civil liberties.</b> Under current law, people charged with murder have more rights than taxpayers dealing with the Internal Revenue Service. With a simpler, fairer tax code, infringements on freedom and privacy would fall dramatically.<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Friendliness toward families.</b> Under the Armey proposal, a family of four would be able to shelter the first $36,800 of income from taxes. Other proposals include similar family allowances.
<p>
<b>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</b>
<p>
Q:  Should the rich pay more?
<p>
A:  Under a flat tax, the rich do pay more than the poor. A wealthy taxpayer with 100 times more taxable income than his neighbor will pay 100 times more in taxes. A flat tax, however, does not impose special penalties on those who contribute most to the nation's prosperity by subjecting them to punitive and discriminatory tax rates. For those who think the "rich" should pay a higher percentage of their income, the generous family allowance in, say, the Armey bill and others effectively creates a modest level of "progressivity." 
<p>
 Q:  Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?
<p>
A:  It depends on the tax rate, what happens to spending, and how much faster the economy grows under a flat tax. Even taking supply-side effects into consideration, at some point lower rates do translate into less revenue. The size of the personal exemption or family allowance also plays a key role since the decision to protect a certain amount of income generally means the rate on income above that level has to be higher. The Armey proposal probably would cause tax revenues to be lower, particularly in the short term. It also includes spending provisions that would cap the growth of government, however, so the long-term effect would be to reduce government borrowing.
<p>
Q:  What would happen to charitable contributions and housing markets?
<p>
A:  Some worry that the transition from the current system to a new one would create problems for charities and homeowners. History suggests these fears are exaggerated. During the 1980s, the top tax rate was reduced dramatically, falling from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988. The effect was to reduce the value of itemized deductions by the same amount, yet the value of housing did not drop. Similarly, charitable contributions actually rose sharply during the 1980s. This does not mean itemized deductions have no importance; it simply indicates that the benefits generated by a robust economy more than offset any costs associated with lost deductions. 
<p>
 Q:  Is there not a risk that politicians will raise tax rates in the future?
<p>
A:  As recent events demonstrate -- base broadening in 1986 followed by tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 -- this is a real danger. But this is not an argument against the flat tax. It is further evidence of the need for a constitutional amendment that requires a supermajority to raise taxes.
<p>
Q:  Should the income tax simply be abolished and replaced by a sales tax?
<p>
A:  A flat tax does not eliminate the harmful aspects of income taxation; it only reduces them. Some have suggested that the better approach is to replace the income tax with a national tax on consumption. While attractive in theory, however, the danger is that Americans could end up not with a sales tax replacing the income tax but with a sales tax <i>and</i> an income tax. A sales tax should be considered only as part of a campaign to repeal the 16th Amendment (which allowed the income tax). Otherwise, such an effort could play into the hands of those who want to impose a national sales tax or value-added tax (VAT) as one more way for politicians to get new money to spend.
<p>
Q:  Does a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?
<p>
A:  It all depends on how the flat tax is structured. The marriage penalty refers to the increased tax a couple face if they choose to get married. A flat tax automatically solves part of this problem since it would no longer be possible for one spouse's income to push a couple into a higher tax bracket. The penalty also arises, however, if the personal exemption for a married couple is not twice the size of the exemption for those filing singly. By giving a married couple twice the exemption of a single filer, the Armey proposal solves this problem. 
<p>
 Q:  What counts as taxable income under a flat tax?  Fringe benefits?  Capital gains?
<p>
A:  A key principle of most flat tax proposals is that all income be taxed, but only once. Capital gains would be taxed at the business level, but the tax would not be applied a second time at the individual level. Dividend income would be taxed in similar fashion. Fringe benefits are not taxed at all under the current system, but they would be subject to tax, typically on the business level, under most flat tax proposals.
<p>
Q:  How does a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?
<p>
A:  Most flat tax proposals, including the Armey plan, reform the corporate income tax as well as the personal income tax. Most, however, do not address payroll taxes. Both Social Security and Medicare face significant long-term structural problems. But while flat taxes could be designed to include substantial reform of Social Security and Medicare financing mechanisms, most lawmakers believe that problems of the income tax code should be addressed separately from those faced by retirement programs.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The current income tax system punishes the economy, imposes heavy compliance costs on taxpayers, rewards special interests, and makes America less competitive. A flat tax would reduce these ill effects dramatically. Perhaps more important, it would reduce the federal government's power over the lives of taxpayers and get the government out of the business of trying to micromanage the economy. There will never be a tax that is good for the economy, but the flat tax moves the system much closer to where it should be- raising the revenues government demands, but in the least destructive and least intrusive way possible.

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;<A NAME="gleaves"></A>
<P>

<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.<A NAME="pat"></A>
<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Russell Hittinger<BR>
Professor, Department of Philosophy <BR>
The Catholic University of America</b></CENTER><p> In <i>The Roots of American
Order</i>, Russell wrote: &quot;Whatever America's incertitudes today,
it is difficult to find American citizens who can sketch any convincing
ideal new order as an alternative to the one long rooted here.&quot;
This sentence was aimed particularly at the malcontents of the
1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<A NAME="irving"></A>

Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.<A NAME="honorable"></A>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.<A NAME="homily"></A>

<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<HR>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Flush with a handful of money he had just won at a bowling 
tournament, Joe Koslowski invited some friends to celebrate with him at the nearby Atlantic City casinos. 
Joe, then 16, and all his buddies were allowed in despite the age limit of 21. Once inside, Joe's good 
fortune continued; he parlayed his bowling winnings into a couple of thousand dollars.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After his initial success, Joe returned to the casinos frequently. 
His winning streak eventually ended, but his taste for the thrill of gambling did not. Once out of cash, he 
opened credit accounts under family members' names, using cash advances from the credit cards to 
gamble.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The whole scheme finally came crashing in on Joe last year, 
after he had amassed $20,000 in debt. Now at age 20, Joe, who had no prior criminal record, is serving 
time in a Pennsylvania federal prison for credit-card fraud. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Joe is one of tens of thousands of young people who fall 
victim to America's gambling obsession every year. At least three-quarters of the nation's teens engage in 
some form of gambling. Much of it, of course, is fairly innocuous and occurs among peers: weekend poker 
games, betting on football, the annual NCAA basketball tournament pool. Adolescents have become 
increasingly adept, however, at gaining access to state-sanctioned gambling -- lotteries, casinos, electronic 
poker -- which often becomes a bridge to compulsive or addictive behavior. In 1995, University of 
Minnesota researchers reported that more than half of underage Minnesota teens surveyed had participated 
in some form of legalized gambling. An earlier survey of Atlantic City high-school students revealed that 
nearly two-thirds had gambled at the city's casinos. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is becoming painfully apparent that the only jackpot 
awaiting many of these young people is a life out of control: More than a million adolescents are already 
addicted to gambling, according to Durand Jacobs, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Loma Linda 
University Medical School and an expert on youth gambling. Further, Jacobs says, the gambling addiction 
rate among teens is three times that among adults.  In a recent review of major youth-gambling studies in 
North America, Howard Shaffer, director of the Center for Addiction Studies at Harvard Medical School, 
concluded that roughly one in six teens experiences gambling-related problems, while about 6 percent are 
actually addicted, or pathological, gamblers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The New Jersey Council on Compulsive Gambling, which 
operates a national toll-free hotline (1-800-GAMBLER), reports that callers under 21 phoned the hotline 
4,300 times in 1994, accounting for 11 percent of total calls. Ed Looney, the council's executive director, 
says many of these young people find themselves in desperate straits. He tells of a call regarding a 16-year-
old who had slit his wrists after losing $6,000 -- four years of newspaper delivery earnings -- on the lottery 
in a single day. He tells of the college student from the Midwest who dropped out of school because he lost 
his tuition money gambling; of the 19-year-old New Jersey youth who sold his car for a fraction of its 
value so he could get back into the casinos; of the numerous calls from kids too scared to go back to school 
because they can't pay back their bookies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 The phenomenon of youth gambling is not entirely new, but 
its rapid growth and startling magnitude is alarming. Says Valerie Lorenz, head of Baltimore's Center for 
Compulsive Gambling, "We never saw a teenage gambler 10 years ago. Now we see them regularly." 
Moreover, the most addictive forms of gambling -- eagerly promoted by more and more state governments 
in search of tax revenue -- can produce ripple effects in young lives that undermine families, communities, 
and civic order. As we move into the next century, Shaffer says, "We're going to have major issues with 
youth gambling that will equal or eclipse the problems that we have with substance abuse." 
<P>
<b>A Slippery Slope?</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Experts draw a distinction between the "problem" gambler 
and the "pathological" gambler. According to Shaffer, pathological gamblers exhibit three basic 
characteristics: an inability to stop gambling despite massive losses, a sense of lost control, and a 
compulsion or craving to gamble. Problem gamblers can be affected in less severe ways, including 
difficulty concentrating, failure to fulfill family, school, or work obligations, general irritability, and 
sleeplessness. The two, however, are closely connected. Shaffer refers to problem gamblers as being "in 
transition," either moving toward or away from pathological gambling behaviors. Individuals may 
frequently move in and out of these designations. It is estimated that 1 to 3 percent of the adult population 
are pathological gamblers, but nearly twice that number are problem gamblers.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Probably 90 percent of the population can gamble 
"recreationally," but a significant minority cannot. Moreover, all forms of gambling can be addictive for 
teens, as well as adults, though they vary in their potency. The most addictive, such as electronic poker, 
contain the element of rapid "action" and occur in relative isolation, Shaffer says. Video gambling and slot 
machines are inherently more dangerous than bingo or the lottery. But the lottery frequently serves as a 
gateway to other gambling activities for teens. Once exposed to even a relatively benign form of gambling 
such as the lottery, many find themselves craving greater excitement. Studies bear this out: Participation in 
other forms of gambling is higher in those states that have lotteries.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Many problem and pathological gamblers -- adolescents or adults 
-- become debtors. Once they get in over their heads, teen gamblers follow the cue of their elders: They 
turn to crime. Jacobs contends that at least one in 10 juveniles has used illegal means such as stealing, 
shoplifting, selling drugs, or prostitution to obtain money to pay off gambling-related debts. A 1994 study 
of Massachusetts youth found that 5 percent had been arrested for gambling-related problems.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Despite the extent and impact of youth gambling, Jacobs says, 
the level of public awareness is "absolutely abysmal." A few recent high-profile press reports, along with a 
meeting last spring of the North American Think Tank on Youth Gambling Issues at Harvard, have begun 
to bring the issue to the public's attention. Teens themselves remain largely unaware of the dangers 
associated with gambling. Shaffer found that only one-quarter of Massachusetts youth surveyed rated 
gambling as potentially dangerous, compared with 60 percent or more who perceived the dangers in 
alcohol, tobacco, and drugs.
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Gambling in all its forms is proving to be nearly irresistible to 
a rising generation that frequently tells pollsters of its apprehensions about a bleak economic outlook. 
Traditional forms of gambling such as church bingo have generally  been able to restrain compulsive 
betting. Government promotion of gambling, including the $350 million states spend advertising the 
lottery, has been more pernicious. It communicates to young people the subtly destructive notion that the 
work ethic is pass, that all they need is "a dollar and a dream," as one lottery advertisement puts it. 
Perhaps that's why an average of 200,000 minors have been turned away from Atlantic City casinos every 
year for the past decade, according to figures from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Another 
24,000 underage gamblers are escorted from the casino floor annually. Many more gamble in the casinos 
undetected. Ironically, many state lotteries are pitched to the electorate as a honey pot for public education. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"By sending young people the message that they need to 
gamble to get ahead," Shaffer says, "we're telling them not to study calculus, not to study science, and we 
shouldn't be surprised that America is now falling behind other cultures in terms of intellectual pursuits."
<p>
<b>A National Compulsion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If young people follow the lead of the adult gambling culture 
around them, they'll squander much more than their intellectual energy. Americans will legally wager 
more money this year than they will spend on groceries -- some $500 billion. That number represents a 
3,000 percent increase since 1976. Utah and Hawaii are the only states that prohibit all forms of gambling, 
though Hawaii is considering casinos. Casinos are now legal in about half the states and constitute nearly 
half of total gambling revenues, which are growing at the rate of 15 percent annually.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"America is on a gambling binge," says Congressman Frank 
Wolf, who is pushing legislation to establish a national commission to study the effects of legalized 
gambling. The growth will undoubtedly continue, at least in the short run, as state and local governments 
scramble for an even bigger slice of the gambling revenue pie. In 1994, governments received $1.4 billion 
from casinos alone. Lotteries contributed another $10 billion to state coffers. That same year, revenue-
hungry state legislatures considered more than 1,600 gambling-related bills.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unfortunately, government's addiction to gambling has been 
transmitted to the public. Nationwide, it is estimated that about 10 million Americans have a gambling 
habit that is out of control. A recent surge in the number of problem and pathological gamblers is strongly 
correlated with the explosion of legalized gambling opportunities. An unlikely source for a case study is 
Iowa. A 1989 survey indicated that 1.7 percent of Iowa residents were problem or pathological gamblers. 
Shortly thereafter the state added riverboat casinos and casinos on Indian lands and also expanded 
parimutuel wagering. A subsequent survey last year showed the percentage of Iowans with a serious 
gambling problem had ballooned to 5.4 percent. An additional 78,000 Iowa adults had become hooked on 
gambling in that six-year period.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Iowa study is consistent with other findings. John Kindt, a 
professor of commerce and legal policy at the University of Illinois, says that when gambling activities are 
legalized and made accessible to new jurisdictions, increases in the numbers of addicted gamblers range 
between 100 and 550 percent. These newly created addicts are turning in overwhelming numbers for help -
- help that the mental-health community is ill-equipped to supply. According to the National Council on 
Problem Gambling, there are fewer than a hundred treatment programs nationwide for pathological 
gamblers, as compared with some 13,000 such programs for alcoholism and other substance-abuse 
problems. Tens of thousands are seeking help through local Gamblers Anonymous groups; GA has added 
four hundred new chapters in the United States in the last five years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee last 
September, American Gaming Association (AGA) president Frank Fahrenkopf Jr. claimed that the 
gambling industry is making substantial efforts to address the problem. So far, however, little has been 
done. "The casino industry is heavily dependent on the revenues of psychologically sick people," says 
Earl Grinols, an economist at the University of Illinois, who calculates that more than half of a casino's 
take comes from problem and pathological gamblers. University of Minnesota researchers found that a 
mere 2 percent of gamblers in that state accounted for nearly two-thirds of all money spent on the state's 
casinos, charitable pulltab games, lottery, and the like.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Experts warn that the number of gambling addicts has yet to 
crest. In fact, Jacobs predicts that it will be the nation's fastest-growing addictive behavior. In addition to 
greater availability of traditional gambling venues, the emergence of hi-tech video gambling machines, 
gambling on the Internet, and interactive telephone and television gambling will undoubtedly contribute to 
the problem. These addictions will come with enormous social and economic price tags, as social scientists 
and researchers -- and millions of families -- have already discovered.
<p>
<b>Gambling with the Family</b> 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In August 1993, Mike and Sharon James (not their real 
names) and their two preschool children left a successful business in East Liverpool, Ohio, for promising 
job prospects in Charleston, S.C. The couple had been in Charleston one month when Sharon received an 
overdrawn notice from the bank. Puzzled, she contacted the bank to clear up the "error"; the couple had 
several thousand dollars in their checking account set aside for a down payment on a house.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Sharon discovered that her husband of 10 years had made 
several withdrawals in recent weeks, many in the neighborhood of $1,000. When she questioned Mike, she 
learned that he had spent the money on South Carolina's ubiquitous video poker machines. Despite 
Sharon's pleas and attempts at treatment, Mike couldn't kick the habit. He squandered the family's 
remaining savings, hocked many of their possessions, even cashed in the children's savings bonds, and left 
the family $20,000 in debt. Finally, Sharon filed for divorce. Mike wound up in the county jail for 
delinquency in child-support payments and for writing bad checks.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"This man was a wonderful person, a very caring father," 
says Sharon. "I really believe he didn't realize what he was doing, because he was never like that before. 
This addiction just grabs you and twists you. It destroyed him and us."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similar stories abound in gambling communities across the 
nation. Yet the scope of the problem is tragically underestimated, largely because so little research has been 
undertaken regarding gambling's impact on the family. The meager available data comes primarily from 
surveys of small groups of compulsive gamblers seeking treatment. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Last year the Illinois Council on Compulsive Gambling 
surveyed nearly 200 Gamblers Anonymous members and found that 16 percent were divorced due to their 
gambling addictions; another 10 percent had separated as a result. In an earlier study of spouses of 
compulsive gamblers, Valerie Lorenz discovered that 78 percent had threatened separation or divorce, and 
half had carried through on their threats. Jacobs surveyed 850 high-school students in Southern California 
and found that children of compulsive gamblers were almost twice as likely to experience the trauma of a 
broken home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In Harrison County, Mississippi, the hub of the state's casino 
industry, the number of divorces rose from 440 in 1992 to nearly 1,100 in 1993, the first full year after 
casinos. Judge William L. Stewart, who has served on chancery court along Mississippi's Gulf Coast for 17 
years, says he knows gambling to be a factor in about a third of the divorce cases he now oversees. "Other 
than the general decline of morality in society, I don't believe there has been a single factor [affecting 
divorce rates] like this. It's just not a normal thing. This thing is huge. It has a tremendous effect on a 
community." 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Spousal and child abuse and neglect are other problems 
attendant to gambling addictions, as reports from social-service agencies in gambling communities 
consistently attest. The Gulf Coast Women's Center in Biloxi, Mississippi, has averaged 400 additional 
crisis calls per month since the advent of casinos there. Central City, Colorado, reported a six-fold rise in 
child protection cases in the year after casinos arrived. Jeffrey Bloomberg, former state's attorney for the 
Deadwood, South Dakota area, cited a similar increase in his September 1994 congressional testimony, and 
described how children were being left in cars all night while their parents gambled. Earl Grinols points out 
that Nevada led the nation in deaths of children attributable to abuse from 1979 to 1988, a period when 
casino gambling was illegal everywhere else except in Atlantic City. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Children of compulsive gamblers also suffer in other ways. 
Jacobs found that such youth have a greater propensity for substance abuse, lower academic achievement, 
juvenile delinquency, and poorer mental health. They are also far more likely to develop gambling 
addictions themselves. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Compulsive gamblers are at much greater risk for other 
harmful behaviors. According to Henry Lesieur, about half of compulsive gamblers experience problems 
with alcohol and substance abuse. Lesieur also notes that compulsive gamblers are five to 10 times more 
likely to attempt suicide than is the general population. The National Council on Problem Gambling states 
that 20 percent of compulsive gamblers attempt suicide. Many succeed. A 19-year-old Iowa college 
student, a St. Louis-area housewife and church volunteer, and an Illinois businessman are a few of the 
recent self-inflicted casualties that have received press attention, but hundreds of others go relatively 
unnoticed year after year. Nevada has the highest suicide rate in the nation. In Gulfport, Mississippi, 
attempted suicides rose more than 200 percent in the first two years of casinos, while suicide attempts 
soared from six to 66 in nearby Biloxi in the first year alone. Family members of compulsive gamblers are 
also at greatly increased risk for suicide, according to Lesieur.
<p>
<b>Showdown in River City</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Over the last decade the gambling industry has done a 
phenomenal job of selling itself as an economic elixir to communities strapped for revenue. Inflated 
promises of jobs, tourism, and additional tax monies have seduced politicians and citizens in dozens of 
states and communities. The numbers, however, are beginning to catch up with the gambling forces. As 
Americans become more aware of the societal devastation wrought by legalized gambling, the industry is 
finding it increasingly difficult, and ever more expensive, to peddle its wares. In recent elections, gambling 
interests have outspent opponents by margins of 10, 20, even 50 to one, and are still losing far more often 
than not.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Jefferson City, Missouri, which voted for casino riverboats in 
1992, voted them out last November. Fledgling efforts are underway in Louisiana, Wisconsin, and 
elsewhere to repeal legalized gambling. Even the industry's own polls show that gambling's acceptance 
appears to be waning.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The issue, however, is far from decided. Gambling interests 
have targeted several key states again this year -- California, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, and Texas, among others - for expansion. In New York, the gambling lobby last year helped 
introduce a form of keno called "Quick Draw." It puts casino-style gambling right in front of teens, 
appearing in bowling alleys, supermarkets, and even candy shops to lure kids into shooting high-tech craps. 
If these and other efforts are successful, it will be a sure bet that millions more Americans -- many of them 
children -- will slip into addiction, and the destitution and darkness that go with it.

<p>
<b>Crimeland </b>
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The gambling industry has launched a major offensive to try to 
convince Americans that they don't know what they know: Gambling breeds crime. The industry has hired 
a handful of law-enforcement officials and academics to assert that gambling is no more conducive to 
crime than Disney World. It's a Mickey Mouse argument.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Data from gambling communities points to an overwhelming 
link between legalized gambling and criminal activity. Three years after the arrival of casinos, Atlantic 
City rose from fiftieth to first in the nation among cities in per capita crime. Nevada continually ranks near 
the top in crime per capita.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The experiences of newer gambling communities mirror those 
of Nevada and Atlantic City.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Within five years of permitting limited stakes casinos in 
Deadwood, South Dakota, serious crimes jumped 93 percent. Mississippi's Gulf Coast welcomed casinos 
in August of 1992. After a year, bank robberies had increased from one to 13, and armed robberies tripled. 
In Ledyard, Connecticut, home of the nation's richest casino, rape, robbery, car theft, and larceny all 
increased more than 400 percent in the first three years after Foxwoods opened.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The fact is in every city that casinos have been introduced in 
any significant way, crime in the streets has gone up, and there has been a marked rise," says 
Massachusetts attorney general Scott Harshbarger. Frank J. Kelley, Michigan's attorney general for more 
than 30 years, told the International Conference on Gambling in 1994 that "there has never been an issue 
that has disturbed me any more than the proliferation of gambling in our state."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Last October, Maryland Attorney General J. Joseph Curran 
Jr., issued a notable report on the gambling-crime link. Curran concluded: "[C]asinos would bring a 
substantial increase in crime to our State. There would be more violent crime, more crimes against 
property, more insurance fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug and alcohol-
related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse, and more organized crime."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The gambling industry insists that the crime link is solely a 
factor of more people visiting these communities. The testimony of the law-enforcement community, 
gambling's demonstrated ties to organized crime, and the millions of gambling addicts who become 
criminals as a result of their addictions attest otherwise. One might say the gambling industry's denial of 
these facts is just plain Goofy.
<p>

<b>Cashiering Casinos</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Despite shoestring budgets, grass-roots groups in dozens of states 
are doing a surprisingly effective job of stalling the gambling juggernaut:
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Mirage Casinos finally cut its losses at more than $10 million 
and left Bridgeport, Connecticut, late last year after failing in its four-year push to construct the nation's 
largest casino. With support from the media and the governor, and a non-stop public-relations barrage, the 
casino deal looked like a sure thing. But the dogged persistence of various anti-gambling groups prevailed.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Pennsylvanians Against Gambling Expansion (PAGE) has 
employed a two-pronged strategy to thwart riverboat casinos. PAGE gathered about 44,000 petition 
signatures, which it presented to the governor at a widely publicized press conference. PAGE has been 
working behind the scenes with key legislators, from both the Democratic and Republican parties, to keep 
gambling bills from reaching a vote.
 <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eleven different casino companies hired lobbyists last year in 
hopes of squeezing casinos into Maryland. They had planned to close the deal by this spring. Maryland's 
No Casino group derailed the plan largely via a series of anti-casino rallies held around the state last fall. 
Gambling lobbyists have now forsaken their attempts to get casinos in Maryland.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	Last November, voters in Washington state trounced Initiative 
651, which would have allowed unrestricted gambling on Indian lands.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fifty gambling lobbyists descended on Virginia last year to 
push for riverboat casinos. Virginians Deserve Better blunted their efforts by joining with dozens of 
minority pastors in targeted areas of southern Virginia.
 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Florida's No Casinos is preparing to repel the gambling 
industry's fourth casino initiative, expected this fall. No Casinos has built a broad coalition including 
liberal and conservative religious groups, law-enforcement officials, business and political leaders, and 
tourism interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Rev. Tom Grey, coordinator for the National Coalition 
Against Legalized Gambling, says state-based affiliates prevailed -- via referendum, the legislature, or the 
courts -- in 21 of 23 contests over the last couple of years.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the great debate about affirmative action that is about to begin, opponents of racial quotas and preferences must be prepared to offer a better way of opening opportunity for racial groups that have historically been victims of discrimination. The answer is high academic standards for everyone, a solution that the Clinton administration is, unfortunately, resisting.<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics. The prevailing assumption among teachers and principals in all too many poor neighborhoods seems to be: "These kids can't learn, and even if they do, society is so racist that there's no opportunity for them anyway."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Talk about a self-fulfilling prophecy. Why study hard if your teacher doesn't think you can learn? Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending the message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that, when much is expected of them, black and Hispanic children can achieve at a very high level. Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores for blacks and Hispanics are artificially raised to compensate for their racial status.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Consider the track record of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School in Los Angeles, near the site of the 1992 riots. Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American. Three-quarters have single parents, and many come from alcoholic families. But by the end of the sixth grade, his students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight of Shakespeare's plays. His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company. Their performance of Measure for Measure will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class? The same way outstanding teachers always do. He sets high standards, and gives his students the help they need to meet them. "I put my heart and soul into my teaching, and the kids know that. I demand the same from them." Esquith begins teaching his class of 40 students at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.) By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile, while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile, and the district in the 47th percentile. On the English test, they scored in the 92nd percentile, while the school overall scored in the 47th percentile, and the district in the 35th percentile. His sixth-grade class produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language, and, but for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Esquith's devotion to his students doesn't stop when they graduate from elementary school. On weekends he gathers his former students to prepare them for the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The walls of his classrooms are filled with banners of colleges and universities like Harvard and Berkeley, institutions his students have gone on to attend; their names appear next to their respective schools. Most of these students are the first in their family ever to attend college.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Esquith's story is compelling, not only because his students do well, but because he proves that high expectations and hard work produce results. His students may be poor, but they will be able to compete in the marketplace on a level playing field because they are well educated, and Esquith -- the recipient of the Walt Disney Outstanding Teacher of the Year award in 1992 -- can trump most private-school teachers any day. Esquith's secret -- which seems to be well kept from most of the education establishment -- is his conviction that poor, inner-city kids can learn, and that the keys to educational success are high standards and hard work.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another example of the "aim high and achieve" model is Holy Angels Elementary School, described as an "oasis in the middle of the desert" by Jolene Pearl, a professor of education at Spring Arbor College. Every year, Pearl takes her students to Holy Angels to show them that a successful school need not be housed in a safe, affluent white neighborhood. Nor does it take a fortune to keep its door open. The 108-year-old South Side Catholic institution sits in the Kenwood-Oakland neighborhood of Chicago, where three out of four people live in poverty and violent crime is the rule rather than the exception. Holy Angels's enrollment includes 1,256 students -- all of whom are African-American -- from preschool to eighth grade, each paying a tuition of $40 to $45 per month. The school's motto: "Where Proud Black Youngsters Produce and Achieve." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"I feel like I'm in a war zone," replies Sister Helen Struder, the school's principal, when asked how she feels about the location of her school. You'd never guess that from the students' performance. A comparison of scores on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills published by the Chicago Public Schools shows that, in 1994, the number of Holy Angels eighth-graders scoring above the national norm in math was quadruple the average number of eighth-graders at the three area public schools on the same test. The data also show that twice as many Holy Angels eighth-graders scored above the national norm in reading as did the average of the three area public school eighth graders. <P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How did this happen?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Sister Helen, who has been on the school's staff since 1960, before reaching her post as principal a year ago, believes that the secret to the school's success is threefold: its basic curriculum (mathematics, English, reading, science, and social studies), its strict discipline (it teaches respect for self and others and holds students responsible for their actions), and its high academic expectations for its students. Instead of making excuses for the children, Sister Helen and Holy Angels teachers expect them "to paddle their own canoes." Instead of offering an array of extracurricular classes or dumbing down its curriculum to increase the "self-esteem" of its African-American pupils, Holy Angels offers a strict diet of math and reading and expects students to get the job done. The principal believes that "by success you build self-esteem."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a school like Holy Angels or a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grass-roots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math. Lawyers from the Center for Law and Education at Harvard and a bevy of other "experts" tried to convince the federal courts that this requirement was unconstitutional because in Florida -- the first of many states to adopt such a test -- 80 to 90 percent of African-American students failed it on the first few tries. Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra P. v Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Lerner noted in a 1991 article in Commentary, children who mastered the basics went on to improve their scores on more advanced tests like the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) too, because "[m]inimum competence is the entry ticket in the race for advanced competence and, as in any race, increasing the number of entrants increases the number who cross the finish line." That, she argued, is why the SAT scores of African-American students rose by more than 47 points between 1980 and 1989. Lerner believes that the only way to expand the success of the minimum competence exam is to make it the standard for grade-school graduation, and also to require children to pass an advanced competence test like the SAT to graduate from high school. Such a test would go beyond literacy and numeracy to measure abstract reasoning and problem-solving ability with both words and numbers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Minimum competence tests have repeatedly been challenged in the courts by legal-services and civil-rights groups that contend, in Lerner's words, that the test "would hurt minority students the most, as a disproportionate number of them would fail the test and be denied high-school diplomas. That would stigmatize them for life, do severe damage to their self-esteem and motivation, and close off all further academic and career opportunities, locking them into a permanent underclass. The result would be a widening of the gap between the haves and the have-nots in American society, deepening our racial divisions and moving us away from equality and justice." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration makes a similar argument. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Education investigated Ohio's policy of requiring students to pass a ninth-grade proficiency test to see whether it violated the civil rights of minority students. Thanks to pressure from Republican congressman William Goodling, who depicted the Department of Education's involvement in Ohio as an "unwelcome intrusion into a state's education practices," the investigation was halted. But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- mainly because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests. Currently, according to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test. Michigan, New York, and Tennessee offer state-endorsed diplomas, and New York, Ohio, and Tennessee offer honors diplomas.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;New York is one of the few states that has made huge strides in this area. Last year, thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City. Cortines mandated Regents-level classes in mathematics and science for most incoming high-school students-to be phased in for sophomores, juniors, and seniors in the following three years. (Regents are college-level courses recommended by the state's education department and overseen by the Board of Regents. Students who take the achievement tests that correspond to the classes qualify for a Regents diploma.) Cortines's plan immediately eliminated many "bonehead" courses -- as he characterized them -- which typically had large minority enrollment. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;According to a report by the Hudson Institute, Education Reform 1994-1995, the results of the first year reveal that the course-failure rates rose among African-Americans and Hispanics, but also that the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly. The enrollment of African-Americans in college-preparatory science rose by 129 percent and Hispanic enrollments by 265 percent. Compared with the previous school year, more than 6,500 additional African-Americans and 7,000 Hispanics passed the Regents science courses.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Nearly 50 percent more Hispanics took the test in 1995 than in 1994, and 2,033 passed it (280 more than the year before). About a third more African-American students took the exam, and 2,532 passed it (184 more than the year before). Cortines's bold efforts received a boost last year when State Education Commissioner Richard P. Mills required that all New York City students not enrolled in Regents courses do so. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regents courses put pressure not only on students, but also on teachers. Many of the complaints about Cortines's and Mills's efforts come from educators unfamiliar with teaching Regents-level courses. But as Kay Toliver, an award-winning math teacher from East Harlem Tech puts it, the pressure to perform pays off.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;She should know. For 30 years, Toliver has been teaching elementary school and junior-high-school math at Public School 72/East Harlem Tech, a school for pre-kindergarten through eighth grade with 792 students, 88 percent of whom are Hispanic. She teaches pupils in grades four through eight in a program called the Challengers, designed for teaching mathematics in an integrated curriculum that emphasizes communications skills, history, and problem solving. She says she considers high expectations vital to success, "especially for students who are constantly being told they are 'disadvantaged' and who may have the impression that mathematics in particular is a subject beyond their abilities."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Every student can succeed in mathematics, even if [he or she has] never before been successful," Toliver wrote in the Journal of Negro Education. "I let my students know two things from the beginning: (1) I am with them to teach, and (2) I expect to be met halfway." She's determined to eliminate the stigma attached to poor minority students as underachievers. "I believe [that] the greater the problems surrounding the students, the more important it is that they triumph in their education and thus receive the key to a better life." Last spring, her fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-graders averaged above the 50th percentile on New York City's annual standardized math test, while the school scored in the 30th percentile.)<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In 1993, an award-winning PBS documentary, Good Morning Miss Toliver, brought her efforts to a wider audience. Since then, she has given many teacher-training workshops, and the Foundation for Advancement in Science and Education, in Los Angeles, has underwritten two sets of teacher-training videos featuring Toliver.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No wonder a good portion of her students end up in such elite schools as the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics. Perhaps forcing students to take Regents-level courses will result in the creation of many more teachers like Kay Toliver. Yet until more states decide to follow New York's lead in devising and mandating courses and exams like the Regents, teachers like Toliver will need to take on the challenge by expecting more from their students.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Brother Bob Smith, the principal of Milwaukee's private Messmer High School, sets similar standards of excellence. "We won't allow students to perform poorly because they are poor, black, or from single-family homes and have often suffered years of neglect," he says. "Our kids are evaluated and reviewed in the middle and at the end of each quarter. Our kids see themselves as students, not as black and white or members of a group." Messmer has 320 students, of whom 65 percent are African-American, 10 percent are Hispanic, and 25 percent are white or of other ethnic background. And how does Brother Bob's "no-nonsense" recipe fare? Forty of his 52 juniors taking the PSAT last fall scored in the top 30th percent nationally, his African-American students hold the same grade-point average as the school's white students, 98 percent of his students graduate, and 80 percent move onto college. All this at a per-pupil cost less than half that of any of the public high schools in the Milwaukee school system.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of race-based affirmative action are constantly challenged to offer viable alternatives. Their answer often includes myriad empowerment ideas, such as school choice and vouchers, each of which has been carefully crafted to address specific aspects of the problems affirmative action has failed to solve. As the accomplishments of Rafe Esquith, Sister Helen Struder, Ramon Cortines, Kay Toliver, and Brother Bob Smith demonstrate, promoting high standards is an idea that will boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;These educators refute the fears of the civil-rights establishment that high expectations will forever tarnish the spirit of minorities, and are proof that the best kind of "affirmative action" is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.<p><I><b>Nina H.

<b>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A report last year by the Council on Families in 
America characterized America's culture of divorce this way: "Relationships between men and 
women are not getting better; by many measures, they are getting worse. They are becoming 
more difficult, fragile, and unhappy. . . . The promises of the divorce revolution proved empty, 
its consequences devastating for both adults and children." Researchers predict that roughly half 
of existing marriages will break up, and nearly three out of five new unions will end in divorce or 
permanent separation. For many couples, such odds can make their sacred vows seem more like a 
crapshoot.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Along with the problem of illegitimacy, failed and 
failing marriages are at the root of the nation's worst social ills. But what can we do about it? 
Public policymakers need to reconsider the legal regime governing marriage and divorce, from 
reform of no-fault divorce laws to longer waiting periods for divorcing parents. In the next issue 
of <i>Policy Review</i>, we'll examine which states have the lowest divorce rates, where 
legislatures are trying to make divorce more difficult, and other efforts to reverse the 
proliferation of divorces. 
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Public policy, however, is only one part of any 
solution. Over the past 20 years, research has revealed or confirmed the elements of successful 
marriages. Many programs, support groups, and therapy techniques are now available to 
strengthen even the most troubled relationships. The religiously based Marriage Encounter and 
Family Life weekend retreats, for example, have renewed the faith and commitment of thousands 
of couples. In the pages that follow, we profile a few of the ideas for forming more perfect 
unions, in the hope that they take root in families, communities, and religious congregations 
around the country.
<p>
<a name="div">
<b>Divorce Buster</b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the 1960s, as divorce rates began to climb, many 
family counselors began to see divorce itself as a therapeutic option of first resort. Therapist 
Michele Weiner-Davis recalls a fellow counselor who claimed that 90 percent of the marriages in 
his practice were dead on arrival. Weiner-Davis herself used to believe that many marital 
problems were insurmountable.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No longer. "The vast majority of relationship 
problems are solvable and the vast majority of marriages are worth the effort required to make 
them work," she writes. "Now I do whatever I can to help people find solutions to their marital 
problems so that they can stay together."
<p> 
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Why the change? Weiner-Davis says she's seen up 
close the suffering and disillusionment that can come with divorce. And blaming one spouse as 
the source of the problems, she says, is a mistake, because "it doesn't take into account the roles 
both partners play in the deterioration of the relationship." Bad habits and behaviors developed 
over years go with them when they end the marriage.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I don't believe in 'saving marriages,'" she says. "I 
believe in divorcing the old marriage and beginning a new one -- with the same partner." With 
that creed in hand, Weiner-Davis pioneered the use of Solution-Oriented Brief Therapy (SBT) in 
marriage counseling. Unlike traditional therapy methods, which tend to focus on problems and 
on the past, SBT emphasizes solutions. For example, rather than encouraging couples to talk 
about childhood disappointments and how they may be affecting their relationship, SBT asks 
them to define what they want to accomplish in their reconciliation, and then to devise a strategy 
for meeting these goals.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In her own practice, Weiner-Davis has found that 
SBT can salvage at least four out of five seriously troubled marriages. She says that couples can 
begin to turn their relationships around within a month, even if only one spouse wants to save the 
marriage. She promotes SBT in her recent bestseller, <i>Divorce Busting: A Step-By-Step 
Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again</i> (Fireside).

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For information about SBT therapists, send a self-
addressed stamped envelope to Michele Weiner-Davis, P.O. Box 197, Woodstock, Ill. 60098. 
Tel.: 815-337-8000. Also available is a home-study course with six audio cassettes and a 
workbook called Keeping Love Alive.</i>
<p>
<a name="lang">
<b>The Language of Diplomacy </b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the most common reasons marriages break 
up is that husbands and wives don't know how to communicate or handle conflicts. The problem 
may be not what you fight about, but how you fight. The good news is that just about anyone -- 
even the most emotionally inept -- can learn skills in communication and conflict resolution. 
There are numerous seminars to prevent divorces and enhance marriages. Here are three that are 
especially well researched and effective. In each of them, participants follow the curriculum in 
small groups and then huddle with instructors for individual coaching.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>PREP.</b> "We have a Geneva Convention for 
the way we conduct warfare," says Howard Markman, the director of the Center for Marital and 
Family Studies and developer of the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP). 
"What we need is a sort of Geneva Convention for handling marital conflict." PREP supplies just 
that by imparting rules that couples can use to negotiate the minefields of marriage, including 
calling "timeouts" when a conflict gets out of hand and taking turns listening to each other. The 
"how-to"s of conflict resolution are taught in a five-session workshop that offers plenty of 
practice and coaching. PREP recently won a four-year grant from the National Institute for 
Mental Health to train clergy in administering the program. The PREP approach can be 
previewed in a book called <i>Fighting for Your Marriage: Positive Steps for Preventing 
Divorce and Preserving a Lasting Love</i>, by Howard Markman, Scott Stanley, and Susan L. 
Blumberg (Jossey-Bass).
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For information about counselors trained in the 
PREP approach, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to PREP, Inc./Referrals, 1780 S. 
Bellaire Street, Suite 621, Denver, Colo. 80222. Tel.: 303-750-8798.</I>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Couple Communication.</b> More than 
500,000 couples have been helped by this program, which provides practical skills in four to six 
sessions. The program uses tools such as the "Listening Cycle," which helps spouses ascertain, 
for example, whether they are really listening to each other or just waiting for their turn to talk. 
Developed by Sherod Miller, Phyllis Miller, Daniel Wackman, and Elam Nunnally at the 
University of Minnesota, the curriculum is praised by therapists for being easy to use.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For more information, call 1-800-328-5099, or 
write to Interpersonal Communication Programs, Inc., 7201 S. Broadway, #11, Littleton, Colo. 
80122</I>.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Relationship Enhancement Therapy.</b> 
Pioneered by Bernard and Louise Guerney, this approach stands out for long-term effectiveness 
when measured against marriage-enrichment programs, including Marriage Encounter. In part, 
its success can be attributed to the greater length of its program (nine to 10 weeks of two-hour 
sessions), but it also provides a unique emphasis on the teaching of empathy.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	There are a few RE centers around the country, but 
Bernard Guerney, its originator, can be reached in Bethesda, Md., at 301-986-1479.

<p>
<a name="better">
<b>Better Wed Than Dead</b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Couples may want to think twice before saying "I 
don't." Recent research indicates that getting a divorce could kill you. For men, "being divorced 
and a nonsmoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying 
married," says David B. Larson, the president of the National Institute for Healthcare Research, a 
think tank located in Rockville, Maryland.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Divorced men are twice as likely as married men to 
die prematurely from cardiovascular disease, four times more likely to die from suicide, and 
seven times more likely to die from pneumonia. Divorced women, on the other hand, have lower 
fatality rates than their married counterparts, but are more likely to suffer acute or chronic 
disease. And both sexes face a greater likelihood of accidental death for six months before and 
after divorce.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Separating spouses aren't the only ones to suffer the 
medical effects of a divorce. Children of divorce are 50 percent more likely to develop asthma, 
and 20 to 30 percent more likely to suffer an injury. And the deleterious effects last long beyond 
childhood. One long-term study at the University of California at Riverside found that people 
whose parents divorced before they were 21 faced a one-third greater risk of dying in any given 
year. Men whose parents had divorced had a median life span of 70 years, while those whose 
parents stayed married lived 10 years longer; for women, the figures were 82 versus 86 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you value your health, get regular exercise, eat 
plenty of fruits and vegetables -- and stay married. Of course, tense marriages carry their own 
health risks: A study by researchers at Ohio State University has found that couples who engage 
in fierce fighting suffer impaired immune systems.
<p>
<a name="count">
<b>Counting the Costs </b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Anyone interested in family issues but intimidated 
by the dense prose of academic journals will appreciate a recent book from the National Institute 
for Healthcare Research. Need to know how divorce contributes to health-care costs or the 
relationship between marital disruption and juvenile delinquency? It can all be found in <i>The 
Costly Consequences of Divorce: Assessing the Clinical, Economic, and Public Health Impact of 
Marital Disruption in the United States</i>, by David B. Larson, James P. Swyers, and Susan S. 
Larson. This 282-page manual is a mother lode of up-to-date research on everything from 
changes in attitudes about marriage and divorce to the morbidity consequences of divorce to the 
ingredients for marital satisfaction.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some of the reasons examined for marital instability 
may not surprise: premarital pregnancy, short courtships, exposure to divorce as a child. "Those 
who marry before age 20," the book notes, "are twice as likely to divorce as those who wait until 
their twenties." But contrary to conventional wisdom, there is growing evidence that those who 
live together before marriage will experience poorer quality marriages and higher divorce rates 
than those who do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The book also gathers the latest data on the effect of 
religious commitment on marriage. One study found that marital dissolution among white men is 
three times more common for those who never attend church than those who attend at least twice 
a month. Protestants and Catholics as a group have higher divorce rates than Jews, but within 
each faith, the decisive issue is the degree of religious commitment. Part of the reason, 
researchers suggest, is that "those who actively participate in their church have a wide network of 
friends and associates to turn to for help in times of distress."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although packed with social-science data, this book 
is surprisingly friendly to the lay reader -- call it Cliff Notes for policy analysts. And it's a 
bargain at $40.
<p>

<b>A Modesto Proposal</b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We can save 90 percent of all marriages in America," 
boldly asserts Michael J. McManus, an ethics and religion columnist. Considering that the 
United States is the divorce capital of the world, that sounds like a pipe dream. But McManus, a 
sort of avuncular modern-day prophet, has seen what works -- and what doesn't -- in the 
marriage-making business. Calling churches little more than "blessing machines," he takes them 
to task for what he sees as an abject failure to support and nurture marriages (see his article "Veil 
of Tears," <i>Policy Review</i>, Winter 1994).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To counter this trend, McManus has drafted a 
practical blueprint for organizing congregations to adopt a united Community Marriage Policy, a 
sort of civil compact that requires prospective newlyweds to meet minimum standards of 
preparation and marriage enrichment. The bottom line: Participating churches pledge not to 
marry couples who refuse to enroll in the premarital program. McManus reasons that, since 
almost three-quarters of first marriages take place in a religious setting, church is a strategic 
place to begin rolling back divorce rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	McManus also encourages congregations to locate 
"mentoring couples" to help the engaged and newly married in their midst -- giving them advice 
on making their marriages and families work. "There are some 350,000 churches in America," he 
says, "and every one of the them has couples with solid marriages who've never been asked, 
trained, equipped, or inspired to do this job." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This church-based strategy is taking root -- and 
seems to be bearing fruit. In 1986, Modesto, California, became the first city to institute a 
Community Marriage Policy. Since then, about 40 towns from Fairbanks, Alaska, to 
Montgomery, Alabama, have enacted such policies. After Modesto established its Community 
Marriage Policy, divorce rates dropped by 15 percent, and Peoria, Illinois, has experienced a 20 
percent decline in its divorce rate since the churches in town signed a marriage policy in 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For a fuller explication of the Community Marriage 
Policy idea, read McManus's book, <i>Marriage Savers: Helping Your Friends and Family 
Avoid Divorce</i> (Zondervan). Marriage Savers not only spells out ideas for organizing 
churches, but also is one of the best all-around resources for anyone who wants to throw a 
lifeline to a friend, a family member, anyone who seems to be drowning in America's culture of 
divorce.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Though moralistic in tone and filled with biblical 
references, the book brims with optimism. McManus also offers a set of six videotapes based on 
the book and a study guide aimed at church groups for a total price of $199.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For more information about putting together a 
Community Marriage Policy, contact Michael J. McManus, president, Marriage Savers Institute,

<b>Showcasing Success </b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Between 800 to 1,200 people in the marriage-saving 
business -- mentor couples, religious leaders, and marital therapists -- will trek to Fort Worth, 
Texas, for the Second International Marriage Enrichment Conference, May 23 through May 25. 
Designed to showcase some of the leading marriage-building techniques, the conference will 
include workshops on communication skills and marriage preparation, as well as more than 40 
seminars on topics ranging from the special needs of parents of preschoolers to maintaining 
sexual intimacy after recovery from a heart attack. The event is cosponsored by the Association 
for Couples in Marriage Enrichment (A.C.M.E.) and several other marriage groups.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Woods also serve as copresidents of A.C.M.E., 
a nonprofit, nonsectarian membership organization based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 
This group was founded in 1973 by David and Vera Mace, a husband-and-wife team of marital 
therapists. The organization also acts as an informal clearinghouse for those interested in 
marriage-renewal efforts nationwide, and promotes marital support groups in local communities. 
Consisting of more than 1,100 couples, the organization puts out a bimonthly newsletter and 
coordinates weekend retreats, skills-learning classes, and seminars.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Deciding when, where, and how to intervene with military force presents a truly perplexing set of questions. In a post-Cold War world, with no overriding threat to serve as the focus for American national strategy, it is even more difficult to decide when, where, and how to use the U.S.'s limited military resources. In this increasingly uncertain world, it is therefore imperative that American policymakers follow clear guidelines in deciding where and when American military intervention is most needed and how it can be most effective.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, however, the United States currently has no such guidelines in place. Because of this, the Clinton Administration has been tempted to intervene militarily in peripheral areas of the world. In Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, the result has been either failure or settlements that even one former Clinton advisor has characterized as "provisional, fragile, and reversible."<sup>1</sup>  Moreover, congressional and public support has been very weak because it has been unclear to most Americans how these interventions serve the national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations unless the Clinton Administration and Congress adopt a concrete set of policy guidelines for when and how to use American military forces abroad. These guidelines must be flexible enough to address a wide range of military options, but they also must be constant enough to balance the projected benefit of any intervention against the costs to the American people.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before approving any future military intervention, the Administration and Congress therefore should make certain that it meets the following criteria:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #1 - Military intervention should defend national security interests.</b> Both the President and Congress must recognize that not all national interests are equally important. They must also acknowledge that not all national interests are national security interests that require military intervention. Instead of focusing on core security interests, the Clinton Administration has committed American military power only on the periphery, and with inconclusive and negligible results. The Administration has what one critic has called an "instinct for the capillary" -- a tendency to send U.S. troops on missions that serve lesser national interests, or in some cases (such as Haiti and Somalia), no security interest at all.<sup>2</sup>  For America to use its power effectively, it must prioritize where and how it chooses to defend its vital, important, and marginal interests, thereby avoiding both excessive activism that diffuses important resources and isolationism that eschews important opportunities to shape events.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #2 - Military intervention should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments.</b> America's current national military strategy is strategically bankrupt. Not only is the Bottom-Up Review force too small to execute the two major regional conflicts strategy, but it is woefully underfunded as well. Huge interventions in areas of marginal security interest have exacerbated the strain on the U.S. military and made it doubtful that the military can mobilize the resources necessary to defend vital national interests and honor current security commitments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #3 - Military intervention should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable.</b> Military interventions should be conducted to accomplish clearly definable military goals that are militarily achievable, consistent with overriding political objectives, and supported by enough force to achieve these goals. In Bosnia, the Clinton Administration has failed to define these military objectives clearly, and those objectives that have been articulated are insufficient to achieve the larger political goal of reaching a sustainable peace. Thus, there is no reliable way to measure success or failure, which is why Clinton has imposed a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops. The President, in effect, has made withdrawing U.S. forces on schedule the only clear-cut, identifiable U.S. military goal in Bosnia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #4 - Military intervention should enjoy congressional and public support. </b> President Clinton has made a habit of circumventing Congress in deciding to undertake military interventions. In non-emergency contingencies like Haiti and Bosnia, Congress should have the opportunity to vote on the merits of an intervention, not merely whether to support American troops already on the ground. Such decisions should not be made by polls; Americans traditionally are reluctant to intervene. However, when intervention is required, the President should mobilize public support (as President Bush did during the Persian Gulf War) so that American troops abroad will know that the nation and the Congress support not only the troops, but the actual goals of the operation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Criterion #5 - The armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success.</b> The U.S. armed forces must be allowed the operational freedom to create the conditions within which they can succeed. The U.S. military should never be placed in a situation where it has no control over the outcome, as was the case in both Haiti and Bosnia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, Congress can help redress the policy shortcomings of the Clinton Administration. First, it should ask the President to issue a presidential directive that establishes these five criteria for military interventions. This would add to the Administration's presidential decision directive concerning multilateral peace operations (PDD-25), which was limited to guidelines for U.S. participation in peacekeeping. Congress also should require that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain:
<p><ul>
<li><b>A prioritization</b> of national interests and national security interests;
<p>
<li><b>A listing of criteria,</b> such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions;
<P>
<li><b>A set of criteria</b> for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures such as the United Nations;<p>

<li><b>An unequivocal guarantee</b> that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and
<P>
<li><b>A declaration</b> that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine.
</ul><P>
<b>THE NEED FOR CRITERIA</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Few issues of foreign and military policy are as vexing for the policymaker as military intervention. The problem of finding reliable criteria for deciding when, where, why, and how to intervene abroad with military force is made particularly difficult by several factors. First, there is the character of the "new world disorder," a volatile and unpredictable international arena that does not lend itself to conceptual or strategic clarity. On the one hand, there is no one clear and present danger on which to base a coherent strategy; on the other hand, the many lesser threats to American interests, like those posed by such rogue states as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and Libya, cannot be ignored. These threats are more than enough reason for maintaining forces capable of many different levels of military intervention.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second factor that complicates operating in this world disorder is a dilemma in the way Americans think about military intervention. Henry Kissinger has aptly described this dilemma and the solution that is needed:
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	America's dominant task is to strike a balance between the twin temptations inherent in its exceptionalism: the notion that America must remedy every wrong and stabilize every dislocation, and the latent instinct to withdraw into itself. Indiscriminate involvement in all the ethnic turmoil and civil wars of the post-Cold War world would drain a crusading America. Yet an America that confines itself to the refinement of its domestic virtues would, in the end, abdicate America's security and prosperity to decisions made by other societies in faraway places and over which America would progressively lose control. Not every evil can be combated by America, even less by America alone. But some monsters need to be, if not slain, at least resisted. What is most needed are criteria for selectivity.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has failed to put forth such selective criteria for military intervention: when and why it should take place, and how it should be carried out.<sup>4</sup>  Instead of offering a sensible strategy that sets strategic priorities and matches America's means to her most important foreign policy objectives, the Administration has concentrated on marginal "feel-good" operations on the periphery of U.S. national interests. While neglecting the core priorities of American foreign policy, the Administration has squandered American resources on interventions in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia -- military operations in which the claimed successes are both transient and easily overturned.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Professor Michael Mandelbaum, a former Clinton advisor, writes that President Clinton has intervened on the periphery in "social work" at the expense of successfully managing relations with other great powers -- the core concern of U.S. foreign policy.<sup>5</sup>  Nothing demonstrates the validity of this argument better than the continued insistence of Administration officials that Bosnia is a conflict "raging at the heart of Europe."  Bosnia is indeed a European security problem, but hardly one that threatens to overwhelm the continent. It needs attention, but not the same sort of military attention given by America to Europe as a result of the hegemonic designs of Germany and the Soviet Union in the past. Americans deserve a foreign policy that is shorter on such rhetoric and longer on rational discourse about core and peripheral interests. Such discourse is needed to promote consensus and understanding about where, when, and how America should intervene.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the United States is the world's leading power, U.S. leaders must shape events and not be shaped by them. In Bosnia, however, President Clinton portrayed American leadership as a fateful burden that has painted America into a corner as the leader of the NATO implementation force (IFOR). Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke has stated that "we did not choose this as the test case.... [N]obody wanted it to happen, but that is the hand history has dealt us. The U.S. role in Europe and NATO's future and our bilateral relationships with all the major countries in Europe are all going to be determined by Bosnia."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the U.S. has no control over its own destiny in Bosnia or Europe, and leadership simply means accepting the many bad options presented by European and Administration indecisiveness. In addition, such a statement means surrendering America's right to help shape the future of Europe and instead allowing the American role in Europe to be determined by local factions in Bosnia. This is hardly leadership. America leads because of the conditions leadership engenders, conditions that are favorable to the U.S. and its allies. Leadership is a means to an end, not an end in itself. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By failing to lead and shape events in Bosnia, the U.S. has relegated itself to the role of medium-sized player in a peripheral European security affair. The Administration has put aside the larger questions, such as NATO's expansion, in favor of a one-year peace implementation mission in Bosnia. More important, it has tied the measure of American power and successful foreign policy in the world to insignificant operations that the President claims are "test cases" of American leadership. The danger, as one analyst has noted, is that "it is surely perilous to think of the Balkans as an 'acid test,' 'test case,' or a 'defining moment' for anything. We have already seen what devastating effect such manufactured challenges can have on Western unity."<sup>7</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States needs a military intervention policy that is consistent with America's role as the greatest power in the world today. Such a policy would be based on the need to protect and defend America's national security interests through a range of military options, including deterrence, preventive attacks, warfighting, diplomacy, and even peace operations. An intervention policy should discriminate between America's interests and how best to defend them so that America's limited military resources will be used where they are most needed and most effective and not wasted on inconsequential operations of little lasting significance. 
<p>
<b>THE INTERVENTION DEBATE</b><sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration has acted without an effective doctrine for military intervention. Clinton's national strategy of "Engagement and Enlargement," for example, offers more in the way of academic abstractions than discriminating policy guidance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This reluctance to provide useful criteria for military intervention comes on the heels of long-standing debate. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger was attacked in 1984, from both the left and the right, for proposing criteria that were perceived as too restrictive. Weinberger proposed six conditions for military intervention: 
<ul><p>
<li>Vital national interests are threatened,
<p>
<li>The U.S. clearly intends to win, 
<p>
<li>The intervention has precisely defined political and military objectives,
<p>
<li>There is reasonable assurance that intervention will be supported by the American people and Congress,
<p>
<li>The commitment of American forces and their objectives can be reassessed constantly and adjusted if necessary, and
<P>
<li>The commitment of U.S. forces to combat is undertaken as a last resort.<sup>9</sup> 
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Critics maintained that Weinberger's criteria were a prescription for inaction, arguing that America's military options in many cases would not be clear-cut enough to support their application. In addition to the expected attacks from the left, critics ranging from Secretary of State George Shultz to conservative commentators and <I>National Review</I> magazine claimed that the Weinberger criteria were simply unobtainable in many instances in which the U.S. would want to entertain limited military action. Newspaper columnist William Safire echoed the sentiments of many when he wrote that Weinberger would restrict the U.S. to "only the fun wars."<sup>10</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
From the military's point of view, however, the Weinberger doctrine was meant to guarantee that the U.S. would not repeat the strategic mistakes of the Vietnam War and the failed Lebanese intervention of 1982-1983. In both of those cases, there was no clear intention of winning despite the sacrifices being made; there was tenuous public and congressional support; and the military and political objectives were never clearly defined, attainable, or decisive. The Vietnam syndrome was, in essence, the understandable desire on the part of America's military that their sacrifices not be in vain. As the post-Vietnam military sought to rebuild the strategic ethos, one officer wrote that "when it comes to being engaged in any undertaking where political objectives are hazy, public support only tepid, the prospects for a rapid decision remote, and the risk of substantial casualties high, service opinion is unanimous: count us out."<sup>11</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It therefore came as no surprise when General Colin Powell, who had been a young infantry officer in Vietnam, bolstered the Weinberger doctrine while serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Powell weighed in with even more explicit guidance as to how military force should be used in interventions.<sup>12</sup>  In particular, he wished to reinvigorate the strategic link: closely matching military goals to political objectives. And, as is well known, he favored using overwhelming force to guarantee that objectives would be reached at minimum cost in American lives. This was very much the philosophy in the Gulf War, where Powell stated that his strategy left nothing to chance; the U.S. military was "not operating in the margin" and would "win decisively."<sup>13</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite the resounding victory in the Persian Gulf, critics still openly questioned the utility of the Weinberger-Powell doctrines as guidelines for the use of force, especially in other-than-war military interventions such as peacekeeping. The late Congressman and Defense Secretary Les Aspin and others said that Weinberger-Powell left the policymaker with only two options: all or nothing. Aspin postulated that with the end of the zero-sum game of Cold War superpower rivalry, the U.S. should adopt a more flexible approach to military intervention. Knowing that military power was a blunt instrument, he also hoped that new military technologies (such as precision guided munitions) would help to provide the U.S. with more precise and flexible tools that could be used in limited military interventions without mobilizing public and congressional support or using overwhelming military force.<sup>14</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton Administration's early position on intervention was couched in light of its doctrine of "assertive multilateralism" and addressed only peace operations. The Administration hoped that U.S. military intervention could be conducted mainly through such multilateral institutions as the United Nations. However, the failure of the U.N. mission to Somalia and the shocking deaths of U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu street battles prompted President Clinton's security team to rethink their criteria for participation in U.N. operations. The result was Presidential Decision Directive 25 (PDD-25), a document that set intervention criteria solidly in the tradition of prudence and caution started by Caspar Weinberger. PDD-25, published in May 1994, set out eight criteria for the U.S. to consider when deciding to support a peace operation, six further restrictions for U.S. participation should American troops be involved, and an additional three if there was a strong possibility of combat.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite this note of caution, however, the restrictive criteria of PDD-25 did not prevent the Clinton Administration from undertaking a peace enforcement mission in Haiti; U.N. peacekeeping in Haiti, Rwanda, and Macedonia; and the NATO peace implementation mission in Bosnia. In these interventions, the cautionary criteria of PDD-25 were ignored. Given the controversies over Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, it was obvious that there was little desire in the Administration to set criteria, let alone to comply with guidelines when they were set. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In March 1996, National Security Advisor Anthony Lake further contributed to the atmosphere of uncertainty in a speech at George Washington University in which he proposed seven broad circumstances that "may call for the use of force or our military forces."<sup>16</sup>  These circumstances included:
<p>
<ol>
<li>To defend against direct attacks on the U.S., its citizens, and its allies;
<p>
<li>To counter aggression;
<p>
<li>To defend key economic interests;
<p>
<li>To preserve, promote, and defend democracy;
<p>
<li>To prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, international crime, and drug trafficking;
<p>
<li>To maintain U.S. reliability; and
<p>
<li>For humanitarian purposes.<sup>17</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This was an attempt to answer "why" and "when" the U.S. might conduct a military intervention. However, Lake's list is not specific enough to serve as a useful guideline for military intervention. For instance, stating that the U.S. will use force "to counter aggression" is strategically meaningless. It assumes that aggression everywhere, large or small, may require the use of American military force. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lake's list can hardly be used to provide constructive guidance on "where" and "whether" to intervene. In addition, the question of "how" must be addressed, as it significantly affects all the other questions. Americans need a clearer set of criteria for military interventions -- which, while not necessarily identical to the Weinberger or Powell criteria, nevertheless are well within the tradition which they established. These criteria are:
<P>
<b>Criterion #1<br>
Military intervention should defend national security interests.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The essence of American statecraft today consists of being able to discriminate among competing national interests and then balance these interests against the willingness of the U.S. to defend them. Otherwise, America risks squandering its power by failing to differentiate between vital interests and others that are merely important or marginal. Without strategic priorities, the U.S. will be left rudderless in the post-Cold War era, lurching from one media-generated crisis to another and vacillating between the extremes of mindless interventionism and rigid isolationism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States today has a limited pool of resources to use for military interventions. These resources are manifested in tangible forms (for example, number of troops, carrier battle groups, or fighter wings) or intangible forms (public support, willingness to sacrifice). America must use these resources wisely, only where American action is most needed and most effective. Devising criteria for military intervention requires a methodology to establish priorities among America's interests in the world.<sup>18</sup>  It is not enough to develop a laundry list of national interests and assert that they are all equally important.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
America's national interests vary not only in degree of importance, but also in the types of military interventions necessary to defend them. <b>Vital national interests</b> (a term often used but not universally understood) are interests essential to the continued existence and well-being of America as a free and prosperous nation. They also are national security interests: Threats to vital interests threaten the security of the United States. Therefore, the United States should be willing to go to war to defend these interests, and should consider all manner of military intervention in order to uphold them. In contrast to Weinberger's criteria, military force in defense of vital national interests should not necessarily be used only as a last resort; many times it will be more effective when used as a first resort. Vital national interests include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Protecting</b> America's territory, borders, and airspace;
<p>
<li><b>Preventing</b> a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, or the Persian Gulf;
<p>
<li><b>Preventing</b> hostile interference by an outside power in the Western Hemisphere;
<p>
<li><b>Ensuring</b> access to foreign trade and resources; and
<p>
<li><b>Protecting</b> Americans, at home and abroad, against threats to their lives and well-being.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Important national interests</b> are those which are less than vital but important enough to warrant major diplomatic, economic, or possibly limited military intervention. This recognizes the need for more flexibility than given by the Weinberger doctrine. In the post-Cold War world, with its lesser but more nebulous threats, the U.S. must be prepared to use limited force in defense of national security interests that are not vital national interests. Important interests are are not always national security interests, however, because not all threats to the security of the U.S. can be addressed through military means. Important national interests include general stability in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia, as well as promoting more open trade arrangements with Japan and China, promoting democracy and stability in areas such as the former Soviet Union, and combating terrorism and the flow of illegal drugs into America. As a rule, military intervention should be considered as a last resort in defending most of these interests. In most cases, diplomatic and economic efforts will be more effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Marginal interests</b> are national interests, but rarely national security interests, and should not be high on the list of priorities that require the commitment of America's military resources. Marginal interests include political stability and economic development in many parts of the developing world, humanitarian concerns, and environmental issues. These interests also should be considered marginal from a military perspective because they tend to involve the sorts of problems that do not lend themselves to military solutions, especially when imposed by an outside force. For instance, the attempts by U.S. and U.N. military forces at coercive disarmament, political reconciliation, and nation-building in Somalia backfired. Problems of economic and political development, humanitarian crises, and environmental concerns only rarely are susceptible to a military solution. Lasting solutions to these problems most often come from within and are best supported by diplomatic or economic programs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While policymakers must always weigh other considerations, such as moral and legal factors, calculations of national interest must always be their principal focus in setting priorities for military intervention. Moral considerations, media pressure, and legal prerogatives do not always give policymakers a clear sense of the value of a national interest to America and what Americans will be ready to sacrifice for that interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For instance, moral outrage and disturbing media images fueled President Bush's decision to conduct a limited humanitarian relief effort in Somalia. Moral considerations and vague internationalist ideals also drove President Clinton to continue the Somalia operation and expand its goals to include political reconciliation and nation-building. However, these moral motivations never gave either President a sense of what the Somalia effort was worth to the American people. In the end, 18 American soldiers killed on October 3, 1993, turned out to be too much for America. The result was a humiliating withdrawal because of a miscalculation over value and the threshold of national sacrifice. The Somalia episode showed the transient and ephemeral nature of national interests generated by the media or academic abstractions about the new world order. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moral umbrage, media-generated urgency, and offense taken from legal transgressions all combine to add pressure for military intervention. Naturally, the policymaker needs to consider all these factors. However, only calculations of national interest, based on the prosperity and well-being of America and her allies, can measure accurately what the American people will sacrifice to see the intervention through to a conclusion. As former National Security Council official Richard Haass writes, "the ability to sustain an intervention over time, and, more importantly, despite human and financial costs, is linked directly to the perceived importance of the interests at stake."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
<b>Criterion #2<br>
 Military intervention should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments.  </b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. is operating with an enormous gap between its national objectives and its military means to achieve them. The gap between security commitments and actual forces is exacerbated by the fact that even the inadequate force of the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review is underfunded by some $150 billion over the next five years.<sup>20</sup>  In the meantime, while drastically cutting America's armed forces by some 35 percent, the Administration has used what is left for tangential peace operations in Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia: missions where the reward for the U.S.'s military efforts are tenuous, indecisive, and easily reversible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The current national security strategy ostensibly is predicated on fighting and winning two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts (MRCs). While President Clinton maintains that "the forces the Administration fields today are sufficient to defeat aggression in two nearly simultaneous major regional conflicts,"<sup>21</sup> most experts disagree.<sup>22</sup>  More damaging is the assessment of the uniformed military, those who actually will have to carry out the Clinton strategy with inadequate resources. General Ronald Fogleman, the Air Force Chief of Staff, has testified before the House National Security Committee that the service chiefs "had made no secret of the fact that we have never had the force structure that was called for... to execute the two-MRC strategy."<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This strategic bankruptcy, exacerbated by military interventions in areas of marginal strategic importance, violates what the great American foreign policy thinker Walter Lippman called "the controlling principle" of strategy: that a nation should keep its goals within its means and should never make commitments without providing the resources necessary to achieve them. For the United States, this means ensuring that the shrinking military forces of the U.S. are trained, ready, and postured to defend the national security interests of the U.S.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The primary mission of the U.S. armed forces should be to fight and win the nation's wars, although this obviously does not mean that war is their only task. In fact, of the over 250 military interventions carried out by the U.S. since 1789, only five have been declared wars.<sup>24</sup> In the post-Cold War world, the U.S. military must be prepared for all manner of military interventions, including limited conventional warfare (Panama 1989 and Desert Storm), punitive airstrikes (Libya 1986 and Iraq 1993), deterrence (Kuwait 1994), shows of force (Persian Gulf 1988 and Philippines 1989), and support for peace operations (when their goals are clearly defined and they serve the national interest). However, two critical points must instruct the wide range of possible interventions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The first is common sense: Forces intervening somewhere are not available elsewhere. Nor are they training. Congressman Ike Skelton (D-MO) has noted that "peace-keeping commitments may so degrade the armed forces' warfighting capability that it will be impossible to carry out the national military strategy."<sup>25</sup>  His findings are supported by the General Accounting Office, which has found that even small combat units returning from peace operations need up to six months of recovery time to train back up to warfighting standards; larger units (such as divisions) need more.<sup>26</sup>  This means that because the Bosnian peace implementation force requires so many resources from the 1st Armored and 3rd Infantry Divisions, the U.S. Army in Europe is unable to meet the Army's standards of warfighting readiness for one to two years. It also means that the shrinking forces of the U.S. are finding it difficult to keep up with their many security commitments.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The second point must always underpin American military strategy: Focus on warfighting and keep America's powder dry to protect vital security interests. Lieutenant General Wesley Clark, the Joint Chiefs' strategic planner, knows that the U.S. armed forces may be called upon to conduct many types of limited interventions in defense of less important interests. He notes that "American military power need not, and indeed, must not, be reserved for use only in cases of vital interests."<sup>28</sup>  However, it is equally true that military interventions in support of peripheral interests should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests: a perilous situation that many believe the U.S. is rapidly approaching today. As Colin Powell stated shortly before he retired,
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	we can modify our doctrine, we can modify our strategy, we can modify our structure, our equipment, our training, our leadership techniques, everything else to do these other missions, but we never want to do it in such a way that we lose sight of the focus of why you have armed forces -- to fight and win the nation's wars.<sup>29</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. must act like a great power and use its military forces where the American role is unique and decisive. The U.S. must concentrate its diplomatic, economic, and military efforts on its core interests: relations with other great powers and preventing major conflicts between them. For instance, America's military role in NATO is to prevent the domination of Europe by a hostile power or bloc of powers. This is a role that no other nation in the world can play. Consequently, an America with security commitments all over the world cannot be expected to play the principal military role in every local security crisis that does not threaten the basic security of the European continent.<sup>30</sup>  As Richard Haass has written, "there is little reason for U.S. involvement in peacekeeping, a mission that can be readily undertaken by the forces of many countries."<sup>31</sup>
<p>
<b>Criterion #3<br>
Military intervention should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interventions must always be driven by political and military objectives that will define success or failure in an operation. More important, military objectives must support the political objective. In Vietnam, the numerous battlefield victories achieved by American and South Vietnamese forces made little difference to the political outcome of the conflict. In order to correct that incoherence in America's Vietnam strategy, the U.S. military now specifies in campaign plans exactly how military achievements will produce the political success of an operation. This is what the Weinberger doctrine meant by "winning."  For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from in and around Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task on the battlefield, the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For military objectives to contribute to the political goal of an intervention, they must be clearly defined, decisive, and attainable. In some American interventions, the military was not given a clearly defined objective whose attainment could be measured. For instance, in Lebanon in 1982-1983, the U.S. Marines in Beirut were asked to "establish a presence."  This objective was ambiguous, indecisive, and unsustainable, and made little contribution to the political goal of stabilizing Beirut and Lebanon. In Somalia, the initial mission to provide humanitarian relief was clearly defined, and the U.S. military was able to measure its success. However, the mission of nation-building could not be supported by unambiguous and conclusive military missions. As a result, the U.N. force never defined the criteria for its success in Somalia, and the military forces were left to hope that an incoherent campaign of partial disarmament and the fact of their presence would make political reconciliation possible. There was no direct connection between military goals and political objectives, only an oblique influence on political events by various military activities. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Working toward clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point, but it has been violated consistently by the Clinton Administration. Lacking clear military and political objectives for his military options, Clinton has fallen back on setting deadlines for troop withdrawal as the only objective that is both clearly defined and attainable. In short, Clinton has substituted time-driven objectives for event-driven objectives. This violates the profound military dictum of Clausewitz that "No one starts a war -- or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so -- without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve and how he intends to conduct it."<sup>32</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In contrast, for the Clinton Administration it is enough that an intervention endure for a certain period of time. Bosnia is case in point. The Administration has not given the military an objective the achievement of which would signal the end of the mission and the accomplishment of something important -- an exit strategy. Instead, President Clinton has offered an exit date and stated that the U.S. military effort in Bosnia will last "about a year."  Therefore, U.S. troops will pull out of Bosnia regardless of whether they achieve any other objectives. In other words, the "exit strategy is the mission. That is, the mission is to show up and leave, not to stay until the [unstated] goals are fully achieved."<sup>33</sup>  Some critics have maintained that this lack of strategy is intentional because if a goal is never set, Clinton cannot be accused of not reaching it. Exit dates, in fact, are foolproof; time always marches on. Supporting the realization of the Dayton Peace Accords -- the vaguely stated goal of the mission in Bosnia -- may not be achieved, but the goal of withdrawing U.S. troops can be.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Time-driven interventions are the <I>de facto</I> strategy of this Administration because it cannot find achievable and sustainable military goals in its ill-defined and ambiguous interventions. In his March 1996 address on intervention, Anthony Lake stressed the Administration's emphasis on schedules and deadlines rather than objectives: In Haiti and Bosnia, "for these operations to succeed, tightly tailored military missions and sharp withdrawal deadlines must be the norm."  Lake has been forced to rely on deadlines and timelines because the Administration is intervening in peripheral conflicts that cannot long sustain the support of the American people and their Congress. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the American people thought the Bosnian intervention was really as profoundly critical to the security of Europe as the Administration pretends, the effort would be worth doing for more than "about a year."  The American public has supported U.S. involvement in NATO for 47 years but is skeptical about Bosnia. This inconsistency between rhetoric and commitment illustrates the Administration's failure to measure the real value of marginal national interests. The President's pollsters know that weak public support for inconsequential interventions can be somewhat ameliorated by deadlines, regardless of mission accomplishment. They also know that if the going gets rough, they can pull out the troops and argue that nothing much was lost anyway --precisely because Americans know that no vital interests were at stake.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is a gross misuse of American military power. When the U.S. military is committed to an intervention, it must be given goals whose success can be measured clearly. If policymakers do not set clearly defined military and political objectives, they will tend to choose, as in Vietnam, plans that are politically controllable over plans that will be militarily and politically successful.<sup>34</sup>  This is the case in Bosnia. The military plan is controllable, but whether it will be successful is out of the military's hands. As a result, there is no guarantee that the year spent in Bosnia will achieve anything of note.<sup>35</sup>  Ultimately, the goal of the U.S. military is to be persuasive in peace and decisive in war. To satisfy both conditions, it needs clearly defined and decisive objectives in all interventions.
<p>
<b>Criterion #4<br>
 Military intervention should enjoy congressional and public support.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The role of Congress in foreign policy and defense today is certainly not what the framers of the U.S. Constitution intended. During the past three years, Congress has been marginalized and unable to vote on the merits of a military intervention. This condition was fostered during the Cold War and exacerbated by the necessity that the President be able to act with secrecy, expediency, and continuity of purpose. However, neither Somalia, nor Haiti, nor Bosnia represented a critical emergency or imminent threat to national security. There was time for debate about ends and means, costs and benefits, and the role of American military force in the world. Congress must reinvigorate its constitutional role by reasserting its decision-making powers concerning military intervention without infringing on the President's ability to act decisively in a crisis. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In both Haiti and Bosnia, President Clinton committed large numbers of U.S. combat forces without the approval of Congress. In fact, in both instances, the President obtained the authorization of the U.N. Security Council before asking the U.S. Congress for its support. In the debate over the Bosnian intervention, by the time Congress was prepared to vote, the vote was no longer about the value and efficacy of the intervention itself. Rather, it was about upholding a President that already had committed American troops and American prestige. Having painted Congress into a corner, the President won the vote to uphold American credibility and support American troops. Even so, the House of Representatives voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while expressing support for the troops. The Senate voted 69-30 to stand by the troops but "not endorse the President's decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Similarly, in the first months of his Administration, the President expanded the U.S. role in Somalia and pushed the United Nations to take on a more ambitious mandate. Congress never approved this plan, and when 18 U.S. soldiers were killed in Mogadishu on October 3, 1993, Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) led the successful effort to cut off funds for the mission and force a unilateral U.S. withdrawal from Somalia by March 1994. Not having consulted Congress before changing the nature of the Somalia intervention, President Clinton could not gauge the inherent value of the mission to Congress and the American people. Committing U.S. troops and national prestige to interventions when Congress is unsupportive and the national will is not engaged weakens American credibility abroad.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There has always been tension between the Congress and the President over foreign policy, and military intervention in particular. The framers of the Constitution clearly intended both the legislative and executive branches to have a role beyond one branch's rubber-stamping the unilateral actions of the other. The system delineated by the framers was to have Congress declare war (Article I, Section 8) and the President wage war (Article II, Section 2). But since modern convention is for nations to resort to the force of arms without declaring war, this system of checks and balances has broken down. And yet, as Professor Chistopher Layne recently noted, "as the embodiment of the American people's political will, Congress has a legitimate role in deciding whether U.S. troops participate in global military interventions."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American people must be involved in supporting significant military interventions, and this requires the support of Congress as well. If an intervention is not supported by the public, it can collapse after minimum resistance and a few American casualties. This is not to say that Americans are intolerant of casualties incurred in military interventions, but they will not tolerate losses in interventions that do not have clear goals and readily apparent benefits that are worth the cost in blood and treasure. As strategist Harry Summers has written, "casualties per se are not the limiting factor. It is whether those casualties are disproportionate to the value of the mission."<sup>37</sup>  This proposition is supported by a recent sociological study of public opinion during the Lebanon and Somalia interventions. The study showed that public approval of some interventions "is not conditioned by a knee-jerk reaction to casualties. Judging from the responses we have seen to Lebanon and Somalia, it is conditioned rather by the demand that casualties be incurred for some clear and worthy purpose."<sup>38</sup>  If the mission appears to be worthless, the tolerance for casualties will be low. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The decision to undertake a military intervention cannot be made by polling or by having 535 Members of Congress act as national security advisors. Traditionally, the American public and Congress are reluctant to intervene. Presidential leadership can make a significant difference in building a case for intervention, however. President George Bush worked assiduously for months to rally Congress and the public behind Operation Desert Storm. Even then, not a single member of the Democratic leadership in either the House or the Senate voted in favor of the Desert Storm resolution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress and the American public should be involved in voting on the merits of any American military intervention, and it is the task of the President to seek that consensus. Only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the U.S. hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad.
<p>
<b>Criterion #5<br>
 The armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success.</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. should use its military forces for objectives that can be achieved decisively, and that are politically decisive as well. This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just "the big ones," as some critics charge. Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli in Libya, can have a decisive effect. However, in limited interventions, there is often the temptation to restrict military requirements because the purpose is to send a political signal. This happened in 1979 when Iran was threatening Saudi Arabia. Embarrassingly, it was revealed that the F-15s which President Carter sent to help defend Saudi Arabia were unarmed. It was an empty political signal that could have been a military disaster. If U.S. combat forces are to be used in any intervention, their operations must be completely consistent with the proven operational doctrine of the United States military. This allows the U.S. armed forces to create and control the conditions for their success, no matter how big or small the tasks and the stakes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Strategy is the art of using military means to achieve political ends. A coherent strategy ensures that the armed forces have objectives that, once attained, contribute directly to the desired political solution. These military objectives must be clearly defined, attainable, decisive, and consistent with military doctrine. In other words, the military should be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well-trained, and that will make a difference once attained. From a military perspective, the most sought-after strategy would be similar to that used in the Gulf War, in which President Bush formulated "clear-cut and attainable political objectives; and the armed forces achieved those objectives through rapid and decisive military action."<sup>39</sup>  While this formula is not always so easily achieved in limited military interventions, the policymaker should strive to replicate it as much as possible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. military prefers rapid and decisive action because it delivers results. Not only is overwhelming force and decisive action consistent with the greatest success, but it tends to be the least costly way to fight. In any intervention, the military wants to keep the initiative. The actions of U.S. forces, not others, should dictate the pace of events and the outcome. Even in limited interventions, the use of overwhelming force helps American forces keep the initiative and create the conditions for success. It also helps minimize the casualties and costs of protracted or attritional warfare. Although this is often referred to as the "Powell Doctrine," it is in fact a classic tenet of military action. The official history of World War II notes that "the efficient commander does not seek to use just enough means but an excess of means. A military force that is just strong enough to take a position will suffer heavy casualties in doing so; a force vastly superior to the enemy's will do the job without serious loss of men."<sup>40</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Many types of intervention are inherently resistant to this formula. Peacekeeping, for example, relies on the consent and cooperation of the local factions in order to succeed. The peacekeepers themselves cannot guarantee the outcome no matter how efficient their operations. It is for this reason that peacekeeping missions can carry on for 20 years on the Golan Heights, 30 years on Cyprus, or 40 years in India and Pakistan with no conclusion. This also could become the case in Bosnia, where U.S. forces have been deployed to a volatile environment without being able to create the conditions for success. Such interventions should be avoided, since they offer no control over what return can be expected from America's military sacrifices. The U.S. should not be interested in make-work military options in which a "draw" is a good result.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, because the U.S. is the world's military superpower, American forces will be involved in multilateral peacekeeping or other inconclusive interventions. It is imperative that the U.S. play only a supporting role in these indecisive multilateral ventures. The U.S. should promote a sensible division of labor in multilateral operations; America is not just another power. Using U.S. leadership in this way will extend American resources and allow the U.S. to focus on those crises in which the American role can be both unique and decisive. Faced with all manner of security crises, both great and small, the U.S. should function much as the Mayo Clinic does in an unhealthy world: American combat troops should not make a house call for every case of nighttime heartburn, but instead should support local doctors as the need arises. More important, the forces of the U.S. should be committed to those illnesses that are truly consequential and for which the unique and decisive capabilities of the American military are most needed and most effective. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. also must decide when to work under the rubric of an international organization, as part of a coalition of the willing, or on its own. As a rule, if a military intervention is worth doing, it is worth doing alone. However, operating with the support and assistance of allies can offer tremendous political and military advantages. Another factor that must be recognized is the constraints presented by international organizations. An alliance such as NATO has the political legitimacy, military authority, and practiced procedures for mounting and deploying significant military operations; an organization such as the U.N., however, is not capable of forming, directing, and employing large military forces in pursuit of ambitious objectives. It is inhibited by the constraints inherent in a 185-member voluntary organization. The U.N. has neither the legitimacy nor the authority that would allow it the resources and procedures for forming and controlling complex military operations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The more complex a military operation becomes, the more it will require a stringent, rehearsed, and reliable command and control structure that can be provided only by a practiced alliance structure or a coalition dominated by a major power. A coalition of the willing, such as that in the Persian Gulf War, can be a tremendous success as long as there is a clear unity of effort and purpose among coalition partners and a legitimate and authoritative framework for command and control. Any time U.S. combat forces are involved in coalition operations, the United States should work either as the lead nation or in a parallel command and control structure where American troops remain under U.S. command and control. U.S. troops should never be put under non-U.S. command and control structures in order to "balance" coalition forces on paper; they must always have the operational autonomy to succeed through operations based on American training and doctrine.
<p>
<b>CODIFYING A MILITARY INTERVENTION POLICY</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Administration and Congress should institutionalize these steps in order to provide strategically sound criteria for military intervention in the post-Cold War world. The goal should be for Congress to have some oversight over America's military interventions without usurping the President's duty to form and implement a national military strategy. The President should codify his military intervention policy in a Presidential Decision Directive similar to PDD-25, but addressing more than multilateral peace operations. Unfortunately, there is no legal recourse against a President who insists on making poor strategic decisions. However, Congress can take steps to redress this problem through the National Security Strategy. This is a presidential document required by Section 603 of the Goldwater-Nichols Defense Department Reorganization Act of 1986. In this document, the President is required to lay out his national security strategy: when, where, why, and how he intends to use America's armed forces in promoting the goals of the nation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because President Clinton's National Security Strategy has failed to provide constructive criteria about America's role in the world and how the U.S. armed forces will support that role, Congress should consider an amendment to the 1997 defense authorization bill requiring the President to:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Prioritize national interests</b> and specify national security interests that the President will support through military intervention. 
<p>
<b><li>Stipulate the criteria</b>, such as the five listed here, that will be used to discriminate when, whether, where, and how the U.S. will undertake a military intervention. 
<p>
<b><li>Specify the criteria</b> used to decide when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other multilateral structures.
<p>
<b><li>State unequivocally</b> that he will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies.
<p>
<b><li>Declare</b> that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives that can be achieved decisively through proven military doctrine.
</ol><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention. However, by establishing workable criteria, the United States can minimize those risks or, at the very least, ensure that risks are consistent with costs. The Clinton Administration has not done well in measuring the value of its interventions and has persisted in costly and inconclusive operations on the periphery instead of focusing on America's core interests. By refusing to prioritize the value of national interests, the Administration has failed to understand the price, in magnitude and duration, that the American people are willing to pay to protect these interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Strategic priorities lend clarity and coherency to a national security strategy that addresses criteria for military intervention. They also help to allocate America's finite means among the many different challenges facing the U.S. today. Failing to match means to ends results in a credibility gap and severely strained forces, a condition the United States is approaching today.<sup>41</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition, if a military intervention is worth undertaking, and is better than other options, it also must be accomplishable. Thus, the U.S. must set clearly defined and achievable military objectives that the armed forces can achieve through their proven operational doctrine. Empty political "signaling" that overrides military requirements for successful operations is ultimately self-defeating. Most important, the objectives U.S. military forces achieve must be able to stand alone as politically decisive; the U.S. should not be in the business of making strategic gestures that are transient and easily reversible. Intervention must achieve a goal that serves the long-term security interests of the United States.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The U.S. owes it to its armed forces to give them every conceivable advantage in any intervention. This includes giving them enough autonomy to create the conditions they will need to succeed. It also means that when working in a multilateral framework, U.S. forces should have a unique and decisive role that makes sense for a global leader with singular capabilities. Finally, by keeping Congress and the American people involved, the President can assure that the value of his objective is understood by all and that the benefits from military intervention are worth the costs in blood and treasure.

<title>Keeping Faith with the Troops: Why Clinton Should Sign the DoD Bill -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>KEEPING FAITH WITH THE TROOPS:
WHY CLINTON SHOULD SIGN THE DOD BILL</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 442<br>
December 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

On December 19, the Senate approved the Department of Defense authorization bill, sending it to 
President Bill Clinton for his signature. The bill authorizes national security programs for both the 
Department of Defense and the Department of Energy for fiscal year 1996. 
<p>
President Clinton, however, has threatened to veto the defense bill. The President objects to the 
bill's provisions banning abortions at military hospitals, discharging military personnel with the 
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and earmarking funds for shipbuilding and other programs. 
But his biggest problem appears to be the bill's demand that the nation begin building defenses 
against ballistic missiles. Clinton is prepared to sacrifice the entire DOD bill -- one that raises pay 
for U.S. troops, including those being deployed to Bosnia -- because he cannot tolerate a bill that 
demands protection for the American people against missile attack.
<p>
The President needs to take a step back from his thoughtless threat to veto the DOD bill. Too much 
is at stake to play politics with the nation's security and the lives and well-being of U.S. troops 
overseas. He should sign the DOD bill because it:
<p>
<b>Supports the troops in Bosnia.</b> President Clinton has argued tirelessly that the nation 
needs to support U.S. troops in Bosnia. He is right. But how can he demand that others support the 
troops while he vetoes the very bill that authorizes funds for the troops?  The Department of 
Defense authorization bill establishes the legal foundation for all the programs necessary to conduct 
Operation Joint Endeavor in Bosnia. These include programs for military pay, operations, and 
procurement, as well as many intelligence programs. While many of these programs already are 
funded through the Department of Defense appropriations bill, which was approved earlier, their 
proper management still requires authorization.
<p>
<b>Improves the quality of life for military personnel.</b> The Defense authorization bill 
provides a 2.4 percent cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for military pay and a 5.2 percent increase 
in funding for housing allowances. A presidential veto will block the full implementation of these 
adjustments in pay and benefits. The White House statement on the authorization bill indicates that 
the President supports these adjustments, but his threat of a veto implies otherwise. Why would a 
President who vetoes an entire federal budget bill because it does not provide increases in benefits 
to Medicare beneficiaries at the rate he desires not give the same consideration to military personnel 
by signing the Department of Defense authorization bill?  Military personnel -- particularly troops 
risking their lives in Bosnia -- deserve at least the same level of presidential support as Medicare 
beneficiaries.
<p>
<b>Funds the Bottom-Up Review force.</b> In 1993, President Clinton adopted a new defense 
policy and force structure following the Pentagon's Bottom-Up Review (BUR). The Clinton 
Administration's defense budget, however, does not provide enough funding to support the force 
structure recommended in the BUR. The White House states that because the Defense authorization 
bill provides almost $7 billion more in funding for defense than the President requested, he is 
opposed to it. But all Congress has done is attempt to fund the Clinton Administration's own 
defense program. A presidential veto would mean that, in effect, the Clinton Administration is 
disowning its long-range defense program.
<p>
<b>Modernizes the force.</b> President Clinton has stated on a number of occasions that he 
wants to maintain the technological superiority enjoyed by the U.S. military at the time he entered 
office. But the defense procurement account, which is the primary account for providing modern 
weapons to the military, has fallen by more than two thirds since 1985. Whereas procurement 
funding consumed almost 34 percent of the Pentagon's budget in fiscal 1985, by fiscal 1995 it had 
fallen to 17 percent. Most of the congressional add-ons go to the procurement account. Congress 
believes that cutting procurement too fast will erode the nation's superiority in military technology. 
A presidential veto would mean that the President has decided to fritter away this technological 
edge.
<P>
<b>Defends America.</b> The most outrageous complaint leveled by the White House at the 
Department of Defense authorization bill is the objection against the bill's provision to deploy a 
national missile defense system. President Clinton has ordered 20,000 troops to Bosnia because it 
supposedly serves the national interest. At the same time, the Clinton Administration has stated that 
a national missile defense system will not serve the national interest. The President apparently sees 
a national interest in sending U.S. troops to a conduct a dubious mission in remote Bosnia but 
cannot see one in defending the American people here at home against missile attack. This defies 
logic and common sense. It also is morally irresponsible. Why should the lives and security of 
Bosnians be more precious that those of Americans?
<p>
The White House states further that a decision to deploy a missile defense system will jeopardize 
the reduction of nuclear forces in Russia. Its argument: Deploying defenses supposedly will cause 
the Russian Duma to deny ratification of the 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty II (START II ). 
START II would reduce U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals each to 3,500 warheads. The 
U.S. Senate is likely to approve ratification of the treaty in the coming days or weeks.
<p>
The likelihood of approval of START II by the Russian Duma is indeed remote. But this dismal 
outlook for START II has little to do with a decision by the U.S. Congress to deploy missile 
defenses and everything to do with a view popular in the Duma, especially in the aftermath of 
recent elections under the sway of Communists and nationalists, that the Russian nuclear force is a 
useful tool for coercing other nations, including the U.S. By what twisted logic can someone blame 
the U.S. Congress for the demise of START II in the Russian Duma?  Anyone familiar with 
Russian politics knows that the Communists, nationalists, and military-industrial complex oppose 
START II because they want to keep Russia's strategic arsenal strong, not because they feel 
threatened by America's desire to defend itself against Russian missiles.
<p>
In national security policy, a President must mean what he says. Bill Clinton claims to support U.S. 
troops in Bosnia, but his threat to veto the Defense authorization bill belies his professed regard for 
their well-being and their purpose. He says he supports increases in military pay and benefits, but a 
veto of the DOD bill would deny the troops these increases. The White House pretends to have a 
long-range defense plan -- its much-ballyhooed Bottom-Up Review -- but a defense veto would 
make it all but impossible to fund the President's own program. Clinton insists that he wants to 
preserve America's lead in military technology, but his draconian cuts in military procurement 
would devastate the military's ability to stay on the cutting edge of technology. Finally, the 
President has declared his intention to protect the vital national interests of the U.S., but he would 
veto a bill that attempts to protect the American people against the growing possibility of missile 
attack.
<p>
The President's actions speak louder than words. His promises have proven to be empty. It is time 
for Bill Clinton to make good on his promises, and his words, by signing the Department of 
Defense authorization bill.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>What Laws Should Govern the Internet? </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1><CENTER>Individuals, not governments, should shape Internet's future</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
<B>by</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bruce Chapman </I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
The two traits that have always distinguished the American character are
a fierce insistence on personal liberty and &quot;Yankee ingenuity.&quot;
Both live on brightly in the Internet, the winning future of communications
and commerce. Forget Al Gore's industrial era image of &quot;the information
superhighway,&quot; conjuring up visions of interactive televisions and
a big regulatory job for government. The concept isn't big enough or open
enough for what the Internet already is becoming. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet began as an obscure Defense Department communications project
a quarter of a century ago, but for the past twenty years it has been changing
in form and content. It is no longer a government network tying computer
users together, but a worldwide network of many networks, free and open
to all, and increasingly easy to access. There is no monopoly potential
to it, so government's excuse to regulate it is almost nil. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
More than 40 million people presently use the &quot;Net&quot;, some just
for electronic mail. However, 22 million of them also use it for research,
education, buying and selling, video-conferencing, publishing, or simply
seeking information in text and motion pictures from around the world. With
the number of &quot;domains&quot;--Net locations you can contact--growing
about seven thousand a month, and with numbers of users doubling annually,
the Internet is a whole new communications revolution. Further, its low
cost general offerings are greatly enriched by various for-profit services
and software products that, in turn, help America's economy to expand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But (good news for lawyers, alas) there are legal problems on the Net. If
the Internet it to continue to flourish, these problems must be met head
on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When businessmen, attorneys, techies, academics and government officials
meet in Seattle for the first International Internet Law Symposium later
this month, they will be responding to a sense that Internet service providers
and users need to find answers to certain legal issues before the government
does. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A government-run Internet is no more in the public interest than a monopoly-run
Internet. But neither is a lawless Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, this column belongs to the Seattle Post-Intelligencernow and,
per agreement, to me later. In a few days I'll put it on the Internet &quot;home
page&quot; of my think tank and make it available to readers all over the
world (I can dream, can't I?). But what if someone plagiarizes it? Or simply
reprints it and sells it commercially? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I know, &quot;Who cares?&quot; Well, if it were not a column, but,
say, a book--say, your book--you might care a lot. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, copyright law has to apply somehow to the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And so do other property rights, including the right to protect one's reputation.
Who, for example, owns e-mail within a company? What are standards of libel
in cyberspace? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Or take the issue of gambling, which is now illegal in most states, with
certain exceptions. A huge battle is building over a proposal to provide
Bingo and other gambling on the Internet, organized through a Native American
company, Multimedia Games, Inc., in Oklahoma, and operated through outlets
on reservations nation-wide. How can gambling be controlled when state and
eveninternational borders mean nothing? Among other things, how can it be
taxed? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like most legal disputes, these involve both important principles and practical
trade-offs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pornography is another example. When both models and customers may be children--including
children receiving unsolicited filth through the Internet--the principle
of offended &quot;community standards&quot; normally would be invoked. But
what is the &quot;community&quot; in this case: Seattle? The world? The
&quot;community&quot; of Internet users? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the related problem of persons inventing false identities
and deploying the Internet to attract gullible minors to real life sexual
encounters. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any added legal sanctions, of course, must be understood as complimenting,
not contradicting, other important values, such as privacy and free speech.
Fortunately, law enforcement is getting into the field in both a vigorous
and reasonable way. Which raises the question, do we need new laws in this
area, or just common sense extensions of the ones we have? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trend towards digitized cash is yet another story. Banking is heavily
regulated now and while many of us are intrigued by the trend toward commercial
transactions conducted over the Internet, unless people have good assurances
of security, such innovations won't succeed. Unfortunately, federal law
presently prevents U.S. businesses from encrypting their transactions internationally.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In any case, transfers of money electronically, as ATM's have shown in a
modest way, do not have to be fail-safe. They just need to be as safe as
transactions that use cash or checks. In a few years, cash in your wallet
may be almost as rare as a silver dollar. Money will move internationally
the way it moves around town now. Ah, but when all that happens, what becomes
of the IRS? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of these questions are fascinating to discuss and deliberate. But first,
one major medium for discussing them, the Internet iteself, needs to be
better understood. At the moment, while the telecommunications bills before
Congress move in the direction of a freedom model, they still ignore the
Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ordinary people should shape the exciting future of the Internet. Government's
job is simply to be sure that the laws that keep normal commerce reliable
and free also protect the Internet. But, even that job is going to require
careful foresight. <BR>

Today the craft  of film-making is awe inspiring, but the sensibility is often pernicious.  Take three leading contenders for Oscars, The English Patient, The People  vs. Larry Flynt and Evita. All three films display adroit writing, acting  and editing. And all three use the bedazzling tricks of Hollywood to gain  audience sympathy for scoundrels.</P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The English Patient presents us with a handsome count in North Africa who,  as World War II approaches, seduces a friend's wife (and much of the theater  audience). When they are nearly killed by her jealous husband, the count  leaves her wounded in the desert to get help. He is arrested mistakenly  by the British, kills an innocent guard and then, to get a plane to return  him to his lover, offers precious maps of the desert to the Germans, helping  to doom thousands of British soldiers. The person after whom the story  is modeled, Count Almasy, was in fact a spy for the Nazis and later the  Soviets. Yet there were many wet eyes at the end of the film about this  irresponsible relativist. After all, who are we to judge such a romantic  figure?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  A hero's mantle from the costume racks also magically transforms Hustler  magazine publisher, Larry Flynt. No pander was ever half so endearing as  actor Woody Harrelson portrays Flynt. Gloria Steinhem for once has it right:  The real-life Flynt earns his millions by degrading women, in some cases  celebrating violence done to them. In an apparently successful effort to  disarm viewers, the film almost admits as much, but we are supposed to  be charmed.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Businessman Flynt uses the First Amendment strictly to protect his production  of salable sex, but the film offers him up as a rustic champion of a robust  Constitution, just a little left of Tom Paine. Could manipulated theatergoers,  like the woman seated behind me, who exclaimed loudly that the film was  the &quot;best movie I have ever seen,&quot; be made to feel the same about  a film toasting pedophilia or bestiality?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Very possibly so, because the point of the Flynt film is that the First  Amendment is absolute and that those who constantly extend the plumbing  of its depths deserve not just legal toleration and fat bank accounts,  but also the public's thanks. Understandably, the real Larry Flynt, however  rich, is used to being a social pariah. But a few days ago he was invited  onto a national TV talk show and was delighted--and amazed-- by the immense  ovation that greeted him. Hollywood has lionized another skunk.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Then there is Evita. This is the film with a screenplay co-authored by  Oliver Stone, who has done so much for bogus history in JFK and Nixon.  It arguably is the worst film of the three exactly because its lying is  the most persuasive. Stuffed with rolls of cinematic gauze, the satirical  bite of Andrew Lloyd Webber's original stage musical is reduced to gumming.  In the lyrics of Tim Rice an echo of sarcasm remains, but it is lost in  the visual schmaltz. Imagery and music easily drown out words in a film  whose makers have fallen in love with the villains.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Oh, people are shown getting beaten up by the Peronistas and there is a  sly allusion (but only that) to Juan Peron's similarities to Benito Mussolini.  But you would have to guess that the Perons themselves were responsible  for the beatings and murders, and you would hardly imagine that the Italians  who pelted Eva with eggs during her visit to Rome did so because Juan Peron  had been an outspoken admirer of Il Duce and Der Fuehrer. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  In the film there is no disclosure that the Perons were anti-Semitic or  that they welcomed up to 15,000 escaping Nazis at the close of World War  II, raking in untold millions in gold from them. The Perons' economic policies--in  the film, an amusing redistribution of wealth from the stuffy privileged  classes--resulted in long term financial desolation for all classes. At  one time living standards in Argentina rivaled Canada's. Thanks largely  to the Perons, Argentina sank to third world status.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  But in today's Hollywood, Eva Peron's sins are washed away and restored  as 90's virtues. Her sexual power-seeking warrants admiring chuckles; what  pluck! On screen, she is a Latin feminist, seizing authority from hidebound  men who don't realize that glamour has a right to rule. Her propaganda  lines and staged humility (&quot;I only bring the people to the heart of  Peron!&quot;) no longer ring hollow, as in Andrew Lloyd Webber's play.  They chime cheerily to a generation of movie-goers who know little of fascism.  The film's violence is just an exotic backdrop for Webber's operatic themes  and Madonna's fashion parade.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Indeed, Madonna is the perfect vehicle for Oliver Stone's mock-populist  revisionism. Perhaps we can see her next as poor, misunderstood Lady Mac  Beth, and after that the noted &quot;Renaissance woman,&quot; Lucretia  Borgia. Then she can rehabilitate that suffering citizen of revolutionary  France, Madame Lafarge.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  There are so many historical and fictional rascals left, each of whose  appearance needs to be uplifted by Hollywood's celluloid implants.<BR>  <BR>  </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based Discovery  Institute.

At least one early morning  a week, you will find George Benson, 78, down on the waterfront picking  up trash along the tracks or over at the car barn shining glass lenses  on the headlamps of the city's vintage streetcars. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Why such devotion? &quot;It's my baby!&quot; George  exclaims. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Indeed, it is. Back in 1974 Councilman Benson had the idea that Seattle  should retrieve part of its abandoned transportation heritage, streetcars.  Not &quot;trolleys&quot; that run on wires, mind you, but real streetcars  that run on tracks. Like other American cities, Seattle once had an intricate  web of them, including an &quot;Interurban&quot; that could take you to  Everett or Tacoma in about the time you can make it now in an auto at rush  hour. The automotive lobby long ago seduced Seattle and most other cities  into abandoning streetcars, and only in recent years have modern variations  on the old theme begun to return to fashionability. But rare are the lucky  burgs with old fashioned, strap-hanging, bell-clanging streetcars. New  Orleans. Philadelphia. San Francisco, of course.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  And, thanks to George Benson, Seattle. On one short line from the Myrtle  Edwards Park at the north end of the waterfront, along Alaska Way to Pioneer  Square and on to the International District, Metro operates five beautifully  restored vehicles that together carry nearly 500,000 passengers a year.  Many passengers take advantage of Seattle's general policy of free transit  within downtown (a policy also dating to the '70's). But another large  group--177,971, to be exact--are paying customers, most of them tourists  taking in the sights.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  There were other municipal advocates of a new/old streetcar route back  in 1974. But it was George Benson, the enthusiast, who persevered with  such detailed attention that all obstacles (lack of local car stock, the  need for businesses to support a local improvement district, safety concerns,  and on and on) gradually were overcome--after only eight and a half years  of effort.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  I was one of George's colleagues on the Council, and now I am an occasional  customer of his streetcars, which I find ideal for showing visitors our  town. So when we talked at a recent dinner for former and present Council  members, I told Geroge I had a dream that I bet he shared: to extend the  current one-way, back and forth route into a loop. With a loop line, passengers  could expand the current trip to the waterfront, Pioneer Square, the Kingdome  and the International District into a grander tour of downtown, adding  the Municipal and County buildings, the financial district, the art museum,  the forthcoming symphony hall, hotels, and shopping opportunities around  Westlake Mall and the Convention Center, followed by a jaunt across the  newly trendy Denny Regrade to Seattle Center before heading back to the  waterfront for another loop.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  I was right. George lit up like a streetcar beacon. A loop route is his  secret passion. We have been talking precise routes ever since. It's a  game anyone can play, so readers are invited to share their concepts, too.  But in this game there are a couple of rules. For one, these streetcars  cannot go down a steep incline, so east-west routes in the center of our  hilly downtown won't work. For another, many motorists are made nervous  by the strangeness of a streetcar next to them, so a new route should not  cram streetcars and autos too closely together. Beyond all, safety must  prevail. People are used to dodging cars, but not streetcars--despite the  ringing bells.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  It isn't hard to find fault with the idea. Because so many passengers travel  free, the present route doesn't pay for itself directly. (Of course, neither  do buses downtown.) A loop route might attract still more passengers, but  it is hard to see it breaking even under present pricing arrangements.  Also, the Engineering Department, which must guide any new development,  is anxious about congestion that may eventuate as new tracks head back  through busy north/south avenues.<BR>  A little imagination and Bensonian grit in the current city leadership  might help at this point. Perhaps the streetcar route could go through  the bus tunnel under Third Avenue. Perhaps a little longer trip at the  north end of a loop, along Denny Way past the Pacific Science Center to  Bay Street, would provide a sufficiently gradual grade to assure streetcar  traction. Perhaps the relatively high ridership of the system would allow  its integration into the new regional and intermodal transit plan and help  cover startup costs.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Certainly a streetcar loop would be popular with visitors, and, in fact,  maybe all of us who use it should--on this one downtown run--pay the going  cost. To have the pleasure of getting from one attractive destination to  another on an easy-to-comprehend streetcar loop would make Seattle's downtown  even more appealing, especially in the rain--for locals as well as tourists.  Starting, of course, with George Benson.</FONT></P>  <P><CENTER><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  <B>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based Discovery Institute.

When such a law is passed,  Congressmen will be arresting each other literally right and left, until  there's no one around to run the country. Rather, the sane solution heads  in the opposite direction: admit that scandal-mongering has become a degenerative  disease of democracy and rewrite our over-regulatory laws to give politicians  some slack. Allow more room for conflicting interpretations of political  &quot;truth&quot; and reduce penalties to a point that a legislator is  not threatened with ruin for a minor failing. Towering cases of real corruption  might be more visible in our system if we did not permit puny underbrush  to obstruct the view. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Representative government accepts that people with different philosophies  and different stakes are going to see things differently. Politics is supposed  to make a virtue of these disagreements so that voters can make up their  own minds at election time. However, what the current ethics laws and regulations  do is change politics from a game where the point is to impress public  opinion at election time to one whose purpose is to destroy the opposition  personally in a legal setting. The problem goes back a generation or more,  but it is getting worse. As we are seeing, even the House Ethics Committee,  which has standing only under House rules and is not a court, can become  so preoccupied with legal-sounding procedural issues that members from  the two parties can hardly speak to each other any more, let alone work  together. Cooperation on any subject is now endangered.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  It needs saying that citizens as well as politicians bring their biases  to these matters. For all of us, there are three mental and moral exercises  that might help bring such bias to the surface and put issues into proper  perspective. The first is to imagine a reversal of identities in the parties  to a given conflict and see if, in that case, one would feel the same way.  For example, if a Democrat, instead of Newt Gingrich, had raised money  for a non-profit organization to finance a college course with what some  people could interpret as a partisan point of view, would that have been  seen as seriously reprehensible? If a Republican member of Congress had  distributed a tape of a cellular phone call to friendly news media, as  Rep. Jim McDermott is accused of doing, would that be have been seen as  materially different?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Secondly, one can ask in these ethics cases how a particular standard applied  to politicians would look if it were applied to critics in the media. It  supposedly is terrible if a politician &quot;misleads&quot; his collegues.  But media commentators mislead the public quite often, for roughly similar  reasons: ignorance, prejudice, stress, time pressure, recklessness. You  could hardly hold a Sunday TV talk show anymore if the shouting heads were  held legally responsible for their veracity. Why, to use another example,  is it reprehensible that Jim McDermott passed along an illicit phone tape  to the New York Times (if indeed he did), while there is no discussion  at all about the propriety of the Times' publishing a transcript of it?  Do we only care about violations of privacy by private citizens and politicians,  never by the media? </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Third, one might explore the practical circumstances and conequences, not  just the formal cause, of the alleged ethical misbehavior. Circumstances  and consequences count. Did someone abuse his office for personal gain,  or was it a mainly political maneuver? Who was really hurt, how much and  in what way? Gingrich's course wound up being non-partisan, in fact, and  was never used for the Speaker's financial advantage. His &quot;misleading&quot;  paperwork submitted to the Ethics Committee, though wrong, related to a  non-crime. Likewise, McDermott's supposed delivery of a telephone tape  to The New York Times was a political blunder more than a crime, an ethics  weapon that backfired.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  If all sides in Congress could declare a temporary truce, they might spend  some time trying to reform the ethics laws and regulations so that petty  infractions are given only proportionate punishment. Under more realistic  rules, the legal payoff for exaggerating scandals necessarily would diminish  (for media as well as politicians) and today's gladiators-to-the-death  would become merely happy warriors, their conflicts ritualized in more  traditional parliamentary forms. The business of government could proceed  on its more or less dignified course. Politics as usual. It actually would  be a relief.<BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of Seattle-based  Discovery Institute.

The report, &quot;The Shakespeare File:  What  English Majors are Really Studying,&quot; produced by the National Alumni  Forum, provides an insight into declining academic standards overall and  the growing failure even to acknowledge standards.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	At Georgetown University, for example, you can still  take a course on Shakespeare, but despite a university administration effort  to cloud the issue, you can graduate as an &quot;English major&quot; without  doing so.  The emphasis now is on &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;a wide range  of literary and non-literary genres such as mass media.&quot;  Within such  &quot;genres&quot; are courses in &quot;Gangster Films&quot; and &quot;Detective  Fiction as Social Critique.&quot;  In the latter course the student learns  what detective novels tell us about &quot;the nuclear family, traditional  masculine values, and capitalist ideology.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	You can understand why a 19 year old would rather take  some temporarily trendy course on gangster films than something he knows  little about, like Shakespeare, but whose worth and universal significance  have been proven over centuries.  But what parent forking over $30,000  a year to Georgetown wants the English major debased by such topical triflings?   Where is the foundation--the &quot;canon,&quot; in academic terms--upon  which a life of reading and reflection is erected?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	According to the National Alumni Forum's report, the  trend not only is widespread, but dominant.  Out of 70 of the nation's  top colleges and universities (including those listed in the annual report  of U.S. News and World Report), &quot;only 23 now require English majors  to take a course in Shakespeare.  At Duke, Shakespeare yields to &quot;Melodrama  and Soap Opera,&quot; at Oberlin &quot;The Uses of Deviance.&quot;  Other  schools offer English--yes, English--classes in sports, textile trade,  theme parks, third world liberation struggles, mail-order brides, computer  games, advertising imagery and world fairs.  A high sounding course at  Cornell on the &quot;Languages of Community&quot; really involves study  of &quot;innovative cultural texts such as alternative 'zines, Nuyorican  performance poetry, and Internet News groups.&quot; (Note:  &quot;'zines&quot;  means magazines and &quot;Nuyorican&quot; means New Yorker.  Big deal.)</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Alumni Forum report comments on the strange &quot;combination  of low culture with high theory (in many courses), as if enough theoretical  jargon made any subject worth study.&quot;  At Bowdoin College, &quot;An  Introduction to Literary Theory through Popular Culture&quot; provides  a &quot;structuralist, deconstructive, feminist, psychoanalytic, new historicist,  African-American, and lesbian and gay theory&quot; on such matters as &quot;best-selling  novels, music videos, Hollywood films, and soap opera.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Why?  It cannot be that Shakespeare no longer is worthy  of an audience or is irrelevant to our age.  The audience is still there.   There have never been so many new films of Shakespeare's plays and adaptations  of them.  Imaginative new versions of Hamlet and Romeo and Juliet are just  now opening, for example.  Sneak Previews' critic Michael Medved says that  Shakespeare &quot;is the hottest thing going in film right now.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But Shakespeare may be irrelevant, indeed, to the careers  of English professors who obtained degrees in the riotous 60's.  They seem  unable to identify with an artist who was not at war with his times, whose  genius it was to perfectly express the society of his period even while  brilliantly transcending it.  They prefer the post-modern sensibility that  conceives of the artist's job as confronting and shocking society, even  though the confrontation is a pose and the shocks quickly wear thin.  They  regard the continuing high reputation of Shakespeare outside the university  as the rueful Cassius did Caesar:</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Like a Colossus, and we petty men</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Walk under his legs and peep about</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	To find ourselves dishonorable graves.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	They also may believe that teaching of a long tradition  in literature does nothing to enhance their own stature among their academic  peers.  You don't attract attention by teaching Shakespeare, Chaucer and  Milton these days; you attract it by inventing new forms of literary criticism  that only other colleagues read.  Maybe that's their idea of the business  they are in.  But, again, why would any parent want to pay for such self-dramatizing  mediocrity?  Do we really want to reward Professor Glutz for his marvelous  insights into soap operas, or to teach Macbeth and Midsummer Night's Dream?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Of course, knocking the bust of Shakespeare off its pedestal  is only an indication of the tyranny of levelling in our culture.  A whole  range of great and tested authors, not just Shakespeare, endures the academy's  neglect.  Forget for a moment the divisions of liberal and conservative,  rich and poor.  Some of the worst damage to our cohesion as a people now  comes from supposed experts in education who denigrate lasting achievements  and celebrate the notional.  It is giving us two societies:  a small, remnant  strata that enjoys and benefits from the inspiration of our civilization's  long traditions, and the consumerist, throw-away culture that screams its  adoration of pop idols before discarding them for something still newer.   At peril is the Thomas Jefferson vision of a democratic culture that elevates  all.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is not new that a majority of citizens don't know  much of Shakespeare--or of the great figures of history, economics, philosophy  or science.  What is new is that university graduates--sometimes supposed  specialists, as in English departments--don't know about them either and,  most importantly, are not expected to.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	This latest news about falling academic standards in  English, in particular, has serious implications for the next generation  of teachers of high school, who can hardly introduce children to the glories  of King Lear or Henry IV if they are barely acquainted with them themselves.   It is a sad loss for our culture, where next to the Bible (which terrifies  many colleges as well as common schools), Shakespeare is the well from  which writers of all kinds have drawn deepest inspiration for four centuries--writers  who shared their allusions with the whole reading public.  It's more bad  news for newspapers, for the theater (especially the various Shakespeare  festivals) and eventually even films. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is terrible news for the regents and trustees of our  colleges and universities.  The National Alumni Forum makes it clear that  most university English departments are so lost in political correctness  and intellectual consumerism that they cannot be reformed from within.   They will have to be rescued by the people who have ultimate legal responsibility,  college and university trustees.  Most trustees would rather duck the responsibility,  but ethically they cannot.  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	If English departments will not stress the generally  recognized best in English and American literature, Dr. Jerry Martin of  the Alumni Forum says, it plainly is up to trustees to call together a  distinguished national panel of professors to critique such departments  for the trustees' benefit and recommend changes (as the Forum itself did).   But perhaps another panel also could give advice:  Bring in the leading  practitioners of good writing in our society, the men and women who have  won fiction and non-fiction prizes, and the newspaper and magazine editors  and book editors of greatest distinction.  Ask them about these trends.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Conservatives who despair that the problem of lowering  standards in the academy is a disease recognized only by themselves might  be surprised by the broad support--left as well as right--the Shakespeare  report has elicited out in the real world.  Martin Peretz of the liberal  New Republic magazine, for example, praised the Alumni Forum report, as  did Robert Brustein of the American Repertory Theater.  Roger Shattuck,  University Professor, Boston University, stated, &quot;The (current) situation  constitutes a breech of contract.  In fact, parents should sue for breech  of contract.&quot;</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Some English department chairs probably will assert that  their preferences merely reflect new scholarly understandings, perhaps  accessible only to academics; and under their breath they will rail against  efforts to resurrect &quot;dead white males&quot; like Shakespeare.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Let them read Maya Angelou, the African American poet  who appeared at President Clinton's first inaugural.  Chided for reading  Shakespeare as a youth, Angelou recounts (in <I>I Know Why the Caged Bird  Sings</I>), &quot;...(Y)ears later, when I physically and psychologically  left that country, that condition, which is Stamps Arkansas...I found myself  and still find myself, whenever I like, stepping back into Shakespeare.   Whenever I like I pull him to me.  He wrote it for me.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;When in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	I all alone beweep my outcast state</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	And look upon myself and curse my fate,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd </FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Desiring this man's art and that man's scope.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	With what I most enjoy contented least...'</FONT></P>  <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;Of course he wrote it for me,&quot; Angelou continues;  &quot;that is the condition of the black woman.  Of course, he was a black  woman.  I understand that.  Nobody else understands it; but I know that  William Shakespeare was a black woman.  That is the role of art.&quot;</FONT></P>  <BLOCKQUOTE>    <P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Maya Angelou understands.  The National Alumni Forum    understands.  What is it that keeps over half of the English departments    in America's higher educational institutions from understanding?</FONT></P>  </BLOCKQUOTE>  <P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Bruce Chapman is president of the Seattle-based  Discovery Institute and writes a column on this page each Friday.</FONT></I></B></P></BLOCKQUOTE><H1><CENTER><A HREF="aboutdis.html"><IMG SRC="aboutdis.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="current.html"><IMG SRC="image45.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><AHREF="front.html"><IMG SRC="image46.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="46" ALIGN="MIDDLE"NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A><BR><A HREF="ggindex.html"><IMG SRC="image47.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A><A HREF="crsc1.html"><IMG SRC="crscbttn.gif"WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="44" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE"></A><A HREF="whatsnew.html"><IMG SRC="image49.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="48" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></A></CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER><A HREF="index.html"><IMG SRC="image51.gif" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="59" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="BOTTOM"></A></CENTER></H3></BODY></HTML>

Instead of coming up with  a list of New Year's Resolutions for 1997, it appears that our public leaders  are putting together a list of New Year's Irresolutions. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  At the top of the list is Social Security reform. The advisory council  on Social Security recommends that the private investment market be used  to shore up the nation's endangered old age insurance system. Failure to  do so offers the prospect of higher payroll taxes and benefit reductions  in the years ahead, while prompt action to link Social Security to the  private sector and the &quot;miracle of compound interest&quot; offers  nothing less than capitalistic ownership of the means of production by  the entire workforce and a better retirement for everyone. Seldom has there  been a subject where the choices are so clear and where so many are affected  so deeply. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Yet the initial reaction of politicians to the latest call for action is--irresolution.  The typical official response is &quot;cautious,&quot; which in government  lingo means, &quot;Let's punt.&quot; In private, Republicans embrace the  idea and such Democrats as the influential Sen. Patrick Moynihan of New  York acknowledge that it needs to be addressed. Some other Democrats, including  the President, are thought to be supportive of reform. However, excepting  Sen. Kerrey of Nebraska, they are not about to say so. <BR>  </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Social Security reform is only one of the 600  pound policy gorillas officialdom is determined to ignore in hopes that  maybe they will go away. The solvency of Medicare is still more pressing,  so it will take the full concentration of our leaders to pretend that they  are doing something about that problem while doing nothing.<BR>  The same goes for tax reform, upon which the government also has resolved  to be irresolute. The distilled opinion coming out of the election campaign  was that tax cuts could stimulate growth and stabilize the economy. Dole's  proposed 15% rate reduction across the board may never have caught fire,  and neither did Clinton's parade of &quot;targeted&quot; cuts, but everyone  professed to believe that something could and should be done. Now that  talk apparently can be filed under &quot;Campaign Rhetoric.&quot; </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Maybe in the information age it doesn't matter  whether the Consumer Price Index exaggerates inflation, the tax code punishes  marriage and raising children and discourages investment. Maybe we have  repealed economic cycles and are fated to plug along with low, but satisfactory  growth. Maybe. But nothing in economics is as seductive--and wrong--as  the impression that present trends can be extended indefinitely into the  future. The statesman knows that and looks ahead. So where are the statesmen?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Next on the list of New Years Irresolutions comes the long range foreign  policy of this country. You would think that we had made the world safe  and serene forever and that violence in the Middle East or the Balkans  are simply curiosities on the evening news. Are think tanks and recently  retired generals warning us about reduced fighting readiness in the US  military and demoralization in the ranks over gender issues? Defense can  wait until we discover a breakdown in the course of an emergency. Put it  all on the New Year's Irresolutions List. </FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  How about the environmental reforms that both liberals and conservatives  supposedly agree need addressing? Liberal environmentalists professedly  realize that the current, mainly proscriptive laws read great, but are  not really protecting the environment. Conservatives continue to complain  that the same laws handicap the economy and actually make sensible conservation  more difficult. It is time to find a pathway to reform--of the Environmental  Protection Agency, for example, and of the Endangered Species Act, for  another--that aims more at consequences than procedural purity. Any takers?  Or do we put the environment also on the Irresolutions list?</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  Telecommunications mistakes found in the 1996 act? Live with them. Impending  disaster with Amtrak? Hold off hearings until everyone agrees--in the sweet  bye and bye.</FONT></P>  <P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><BR>  The great thing about such a long list of New Year's Irresolutions is that  it frees the body politic to attend to matters that are much more amusing,  if infinitely less important: petty scandals. We already are into the middle  of January and the topic that Congress and the media find most engrossing  is whether Newt Gingrich used non-profit money to organize a partisan college  course, or used political funds to organize a non-partisan college course.  Now, if you don't find that sexy, look to the Paula Jones scandal spread  over the latest issue of Newsweek. What's the future of Social Security,  the solvency of Medicare and the state of America's defenses in comparison  to a soap opera like that?</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P><CENTER><BR><B><I>Bruce Chapman, president of the Seattle-based Discovery Institute,writes on this page each Friday.</I></B></CENTER></P><P><CENTER><B><I></I></B>&nbsp;</CENTER></BODY></HTML>

But that assumption goes almost  wholly uninspected. Few people know what actually was taught in the course,&quot;Renewing  American Civilization.&quot; Media accounts have utterly failed to give  details on it. That is entirely unnecessary, for the classes were video  taped and the tapes have been for sale for three years through a &quot;1-800&quot;  number (none of which profits Gingrich personally).</P>  <P>	Seeing the charge of alleged ethics violations start to develop last  fall I decided to get a full set of the tapes. &quot;Oh, joy,&quot; my  wife said dryly when they arrived in a big box, &quot;twenty hours of Newt  Gingrich!&quot; With a somewhat heavy heart myself, I sat down at the VCR.  But, fortunately, Gingrich at length is far more nuanced and interesting  than the sound bite Gingrich on the TV news.</P>  <P>	At heart, as he told the Ethics Committee, Gingrich is a professor.  Years ago, when he first entered Congress, I visited his office several  times, and before I could get to my business I had to hear all about the  latest four or five books he had read. Then he would wait expectantly for  me to write down the titles. I'm told he still does it.  Sen. Pat Moynihan  of New York, another former academic, will make you listen at length to  his interpretations of history, but at least he doesn't expect you to take  notes. </P>  <P>	Gingrich on camera in front of a class is just the same, only now he  has assembled  his ideas into a public policy tour of grand ambition. The  title, &quot;Renewing American Civilization,&quot; sounds grandiose, but  the product turns out to be well-organized and coherent. It is something  he almost alone in Congress (again excepting Moynihan) could have accomplished.  </P>  <P>	Gingrich argues for American exceptionalism, describing from history  the decisve effects inventors and entrepreneurs have had upon our economic  rise and the moral as well as self-interested grounds  for an internationalist  foreign policy and free trade. His grasp of technology's role in shaping  a better future is masterful. At the same time, he recounts with specificity  the unintended effects of sixty years of welfare state policies onAmerican  culture, leaving us with two societies--the educated and uneducated, the  successful and the unsuccessful. His examination of inner city problems  is one of serious concern. Finally, he analyzes the economic and social  strategies that various individuals have proposed to restore to all citizens'  control over their own destinies.</P>  <P>	 Having once taken the famous college course on American Intellectual  History taught by Professor Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a politically active  Democrat, I found the Gingrich class comparably engaging. There is this  distinction, however: Gingrich's course is less partisan. It displays a  Gingrich conversant with a wide array of knowledge and able to synthesize  it. He is fair-minded and positive. He frequently presents noted Democrats  and other liberals in a favorable light.</P>  <P>	 Many Republicans cannot be thrilled, for example, that Gingrich dotes   on Alvin and Heidi Toffler, authors of &quot;The Third Wave.&quot;  Once  the noted literary couple get off the  familiar theme of the hunter-farming  society yielding to the Industrial Revolution, which  yields in turn to  the Information Revolution, they are given to expressing alarmist environmental  and social concerns that make conservatives gnash their teeth. On the night  before the recent presidential election, Gingrich's class on the role of  volunteers in American public life, carried nationally on Mind Extention  University cable tv, included generous tributes to former President Jimmy  Carter and to handicapped activist Max Cleland, even though Cleland was  on the ballot the next day as a Democratic candidate for the US Senate  in Georgia (he won).</P>  <P>	Maury Kennedy, a businessman who took the Gingrich course a couple  of years ago and now markets the tapes, complains of the ethics charges,  &quot;I manage this course every day of the week and I fail to see what  partisan political benefit he (Gingrich) or anyone else gets out of it.&quot;  The course is not a political recruiting device. About 7500 people subscribe  to a newsletter that follows the course themes.</P>  <P>	This confirms what I suspected all along. Gingrich is accused of using  this non-profit course and the colleges where he taught it on behalf of  his partisan objectives, specifically those of his action organization,  GOPAC. The reality is closer to the reverse: he initially  used GOPAC and  his political connections to start an academic course that refines his  philosophical and academic interests. But there is nothing morally wrong  with that. </P>  <P>	It often is on the side of their virtues rather than their vices that  politicians fail to guard themselves, which is how they fall into the kind  of procedural mistakes with which Gingrich's political opponents would  like to ensnare him now. Particularly when you are dealing with a politician  who also is an intellectual, it often is impossible to separate the man  of action from the man of ideas. From the standpoint of public interest,  it is an error to try too hard to do so. </P>  <P>	There is some danger that Gingrich's college course will be used as  an excuse to further restrict use of tax exempt educational moneys, a move  with potential to throttle, rather than improve, public discourse. It would  be wiser to broaden tax deductibility to include legitimate educational  research  conducted by parties and elected officials. Why should Republicans  and Democrats be denied the advantages enjoyed by the Chamber of Commerce  Foundation or the Sierra Club? Why this cute game where you can call something  &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; and it's okay with the  professional ethicists, but calling it &quot;Repubican&quot; or &quot;Democrat&quot;  makes it unacceptable?</P>  <P>	Newt Gingrich may have been careless as he moved his intellectual pursuits  from the political to the educational realm, and he was right to apologize  for that.  But his was the kind of minor failure you must tolerate in a  leader or sacrifice the First Amendment--which, above all, protects political  speech--and the capacity of representative government to function effectively.  </P>  <P>&nbsp;</P>  <P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Bruce Chapman, a former Secretary of State in Washington  State and a Reagan Administration official, is president of the Seattle-based  Discovery Institute.

<BR>
Good morning, and Happy Leap Year, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
I am honored to be asked my opinion about the 2000 Census.<BR>
Leap Year, indeed, is a good time to review the Census Bureau's plans, because
a great statistical leap into the 21st century is what the Bureau is proposing.
The Congress may wish to look very hard before you take this leap, however,
because it is a leap into the unknown.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am particularly concerned about the plan to use sampling to adjust the
hard count for the 2000 Census. Looked at through a green eye shade, it
may seem prudent. Obviously, it is financially burdensome to obtain the
last 10 percent or so of Census names, so sampling looks like a winning
solution. Undoubtedly that thought must have weighed heavily in the recommendations
of several bodies that are advocating adjustment. But if money is what matters
most, you could save even more by relying on still more sampling. The Census
is, indeed, expensive. But consider what you get with it. It holds up the
whole statistical system of the Unite States. Having said that, I do acknowledge
the legitimacy of the cost issue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The statistical accuracy argument must also be acknowledged. It is embarrassing
to have an undercount after every decennial Census. However, it is an embarrassment
the republic has managed to survive each decade for two centuries. I am
not sure how well we would survive its alternative. The problem with sampling
and adjustment does not lie only with accuracy, which statisticians can
debate, but with its admitted core of artificiality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My argument with adjustment, thus, is not primarily a matter of statistical
methodology. That's not my background, in any case. If anybody could pull
off an adjustment in a conscientious manner it is the U.S. Census Bureau.
My experiences at the Bureau left me with the greatest respect for the honesty,
ability and public spirit of the people who work there, right up to and
including the outstanding current director, Dr. Martha Riche. Moreover,
many of the statistical and management innovations the Bureau has proposed
for the 2000 Census, including new &quot;matching&quot; software to spot
double-counting, the digital &quot;capture&quot; of data on forms, more
user-friendly forms and the added mail contacts with each address, all have
excellent prospects, in my view. The 2000 Census, as with past censuses,
will see improvements, regardless of adjustment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should an official adjustment take place, however, and you have one national
number, the Census will still not have counted everyone, even in theory.
For example, the present plan will have done nothing to count the literally
hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not employed by the government
and who are temporarily living overseas. (Overseas government employees
now are counted, of course.) The people I'm talking about are U.S. citizens;
some of them own homes and other property here; some are on the voter roles
and motor vehicle license lists. I certainly agree with the proposal to
explore the use of many other administrative records, such as Social Security
and welfare rolls, to seek names of people who may have been missed in the
Census head count. I also understand why the Bureau must count illegal immigrants,
even though they may lack reliable addresses and their stay in this country
may be very temporary, indeed. But shouldn't we also be trying to identify
citizens of the U.S. who happen to be out of the country around the Census
time, but whose names can be found in public records and who count the United
States as home? Isn't their stake in the country important enough to be
reflected in the numbers that are used, for example, to apportion Congress?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer given by the Census Bureau, with OMB no doubt looking over its
shoulder, is that such a search would be costly. Well, if so, why isn't
it proposed to sample and adjust for the overseas Americans, too? But, meanwhile,
the controversy of this very subject returns us again to the central problem
in the 2000 Census plan, and that is the moral or philosophical concept
of an official, adjusted enumeration. Sampling is a proven and accepted
form of measurement, but there usually has to be some hard, broadly accepted
data base from which the sample is drawn. More importantly, I can't think
of a statistical sample that is so closely tied to a civic act as is the
Census enumeration, any more than I can think of an election survey that
has the moral authority of an actual election.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census enumeration is a participatory function of government hallowed
by Constitutional mandate. There are not too many comparable civic acts;
voting is one, serving on juries is another. Perhaps participation in the
Census falls between those two--it is neither as voluntary as voting, nor
as demanding as jury service. In any case, the Census is one of the fundamental
democratic institutions of our society, and I believe, it is a noble one.
It gives us the numbers that make other numbers meaningful. It must not
only be trustworthy, but palpably trustworthy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The current Census director herself has spoken of the three legs of the
Census stool that must dictate the process: cost, accuracy and public perception.
The first two legs are important, as I have acknowledged, but if the latter
breaks, the whole construction comes down. The term &quot;public perception&quot;
could also be described as trustworthiness. In a time when public mistrust
of government is rife, I question a change that would introduce the invention
of statistical persons into the Census--robots constructed of sampled data
and intellectual abstractions--to stand in the place of real human beings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census has long represented an honest attempt to count every person
in the United States--every real person, not every &quot;virtual&quot; person,
not every &quot;statistical analog&quot; for a person, not every &quot;full
time equivalent&quot; of a person, but every real person. Once citizens
realize that the Census number is partly an invention--however brilliant
an invention it is--they will begin to question many things. Suspicions
will be aroused. How, some will ask, do we know that the creation of statistical
persons does not have some partisan or factional or geographic regional
basis? How does this corrupted Census count infect other numbers and political
institutions?<BR>
Let me stress again my own full confidence in the integrity of the individuals
who serve at the U.S. Census Bureau. It is largely because I don't want
to see that integrity even put up to question that I raise this problem
of perception--of evident trustworthiness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's next consider legal problems with the Census; do you think you have
them now? In fact, the costly lawsuits challenging the Census invariably
are won by the government. Common sense tells a judge that a good faith
effort to count every person cannot be faulted for occasional human mistakes,
especially when plaintiffs can seldom if ever produce evidence of actual
individuals who have not been counted. But under an adjusted Census it will
not be difficult at all to produce evidence that the Census erred, and erred
intentionally, by imputing fictitious people into neighborhoods where the
real neighbors can readily prove that the interlopers do not, in plain truth,
exist. In some cases, the fictional, imputed people are going to amount
to a difference between drawing a redistricting line one place rather than
another, and maybe even change the apportionment of states. (After all,
isn't that part of the whole idea?) In such cases, I suggest, common sense
will now become the government's enemy, because you will need to give all
the judges and ordinary citizens an extensive course in statistics to persuade
them that it is just and fair to invent people for something as supposedly
straightforward as a U.S. Census. How especially do we explain including
invented people in determining such matters as apportioning Congress when,
as I noted before, we do not count real American citizens living abroad?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Maybe the American public will accept all this with total unconcern or even
satisfaction. But maybe, instead, this will be seen as one more way the
government is trying to pull a fast one on the people. Won't any resulting
public cynicism make the hard count even more difficult to obtain in the
first place? If it contributes to further falloff of response, won't that
and the ever-present financial incentives, lead to still more sampling in
subsequent Censuses, in a downward spiral? And won't it seem perfectly acceptable
soon to conduct the whole Census through sampling? And won't there be an
irrestible temptation to try, Census by Census, to improve the content of
what constitutes the invented persons created through the sample, and hence
the meaning of such invented persons?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To conclude, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am here to urge
you to look at the Census as one of the most venerable civic institutions
of the United States, and to do all you can to protect it. Once trust in
it is undermined, it will be very hard, if not impossible, to restore. <BR>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: Clinton Claims Undeserved Credit for Cutting FY 1996 Deficit<br>
<a href="/heritage/issues96/bud_2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Comparing of Deficit Reduction Plans
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After nearly 18 months of trying to block congressional efforts to enact a seven-year plan to balance the federal budget, President Bill Clinton is now jumping to take credit for the recent news that the FY 1996 deficit will fall to $117 billion -- some $29 billion below the Office of Management and Budget's March estimate and the lowest dollar level since 1981. But not only is the falling deficit none of Clinton's doing; the record shows that he repeatedly blocked Congress's efforts to enact an honest long-term plan to balance the federal budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's claim is especially surprising when one considers that in February 1995, he submitted an FY 1996 budget to Congress that would have raised the deficit to $211 billion, or $94 billion higher than is now expected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting Clinton's proposed $211 billion FY 1996 deficit nearly in half. This happened because Congress rejected Clinton's plan and acted to curb spending. According to Congressional Budget Office predictions, the Clinton policies would have perpetuated $200 billion-plus deficits well into the next century. Furthermore, had Clinton not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for FY 1996, this year's deficit actually would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which Clinton now claims credit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

But this has been the White House's pattern throughout the budget battle with Congress: First block congressional initiatives, then claim credit for the good news. Since Clinton sent his budget-busting FY 1996 budget to Capitol Hill, he has proposed seven "balanced budget plans."  Each of these plans -- including Clinton's FY 1997 budget -- proposed higher spending and higher taxes, and as a result, each would have added more to the national debt than the balanced budget plans produced by Congress.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

There are a variety of reasons the deficit is now $173 billion lower than its peak of $290 billion in 1992. Clinton policies, however, generally are not among them. Some of the factors:<ul>

<p><li><b>Domestic discretionary cutbacks pushed by Congress.</b> Although Clinton blocked the entitlement reforms embodied in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, Congress was able to reverse the growth of discretionary -- or annually appropriated -- spending. Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, FY 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969.<sup>1</sup>  More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects, and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission, and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third.

<p><li><b>The turnaround in the savings and loan program.</b> A significant contributor to the soaring deficits under George Bush was the high taxpayer cost of bailing out failed savings and loan institutions. In FY 1991, for example, $66 billion in taxpayer-financed bailout costs was added to the federal deficit. In FY 1992, these costs totaled $2.6 billion. This year, however, this program is expected to bring in over $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector. Between FY 1992 and FY 1996, this budgetary reversal (from a program adding to the deficit to one reducing the deficit by generating revenues) amounts to an $18 billion swing in the deficit -- 10 percent of the deficit change between FY 1992 and FY 1996.

<p><li><b>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum.</b> The White House currently estimates that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry will generate over $10 billion in new revenues in FY 1996. These new revenues are considered "offsetting collections."  This means they are subtracted from the expenditures column of the federal register rather than added to the tax revenue column, thus giving the appearance that federal spending is lower than it actually is. In 1992, when the deficit reached its record level, the government did not auction telecommunications spectrum; it simply gave it away at no cost, and therefore at no benefit to the Treasury. Clinton is reaping this windfall.

<p><li><b>Defense cutbacks.</b> The White House now estimates the government will spend roughly $266 billion on national defense in FY 1996 -- $37 billion less than in FY 1992. These cutbacks, initiated by the Bush Administration, reflect the fall of the Soviet Union. Under the Clinton Administration, defense spending has fallen to roughly 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and less than 17 percent of overall federal spending. Both levels are lower than at any point since before World War II. By contrast, when the young Bill Clinton had his picture taken with President John F. Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden, defense consumed 50 percent of all federal spending and about 10 percent of the nation's economy.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Combined, the last three items alone account for $65 billion, or 38 percent, of the overall drop in the deficit since 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>A Tax Revenue Windfall.</b> OMB currently projects that tax revenues will total $1.453 trillion in FY 1996, nearly $27 billion higher than was estimated in March. It appears that these new tax collections are a one-time windfall rather than a sign of improved economic conditions. According to OMB, "the Administration believes that most of this increase comes from higher-than-anticipated collections of non-withheld individual income taxes."  In other words, it is possible that this windfall is the result of investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The rise in tax collections from the doldrums of the Bush recession is a significant factor in the declining deficit. Since 1992, tax revenues have grown by $363 billion, or one-third. During the Bush recession, however, tax revenues grew an average of only 3.8 percent per year, half the average annual growth rate between 1948 and 1996. The combined effect of tax collections returning to their historic year-over-year growth rates and Congress keeping federal spending from growing faster than these new collections has made a significant dent in the deficit picture.
<p>

<b>CLINTON'S RHETORIC VERSUS REALITY<sup>2</sup></b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Clinton's record throughout the budget debate with Congress stands in stark contrast with his public rhetoric. At every turn during the past 18 months, Clinton stood in the way of smaller government and real long-term deficit reduction. The record is clear:
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #1:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February 1995, the Clinton Administration responded to the 1994 election results by presenting a status-quo FY 1996 budget to the new Congress. This budget deviated little from "baseline" forecasts which projected $200 billion deficits through the end of the decade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

According to the CBO, the President's February budget would have increased the deficit from an estimated $177 billion in 1995 to $276 billion in 2000. Spending would grow an average of 5 percent per year, some $422 billion in all in just five years. On May 19, 1995, the Senate defeated Clinton's budget plan by a vote of 99 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #2:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On June 13, 1995, after months of criticizing congressional balanced budget efforts while offering no plan of his own, Clinton presented a second budget plan which he claimed balanced the budget in ten years, by FY 2005. This plan, barely 30 pages in length, fared no better than Clinton's first effort under CBO scrutiny. According to CBO, in addition to not balancing the budget, it would have produced $200 billion deficits for at least the next ten years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Due to revised economic forecasts, the Administration later said that this plan would balance the budget in nine years. However, the CBO maintained that it would never have balanced the budget. Indeed, CBO found less than $400 billion in legitimate deficit reduction in this Clinton offer -- $350 billion short of the total seven-year deficit reduction in the Balanced Budget Act.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #3:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 7, the day Clinton vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, he presented yet a third budget plan. The Administration claimed that this plan also would balance the budget in seven years but was more in line with the President's priorities than the one he had vetoed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Once again, CBO found that the Administration's numbers failed to reach a balanced budget by 2002. While this budget plan proposed larger savings from discretionary spending programs and welfare reform compared to the June budget, it also proposed smaller savings in Medicare and Medicaid. In total, Clinton's third budget produced only $385 billion in credible deficit reduction over seven years -- $365 billion short of the savings achieved by the BBA he had vetoed. Moreover, according to the CBO, instead of balancing the budget in FY 2002 as advertised, it would leave a deficit of $115 billion in that year.
<p>

<b>Clinton Budget #4:</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


On December 15, after two weeks of negotiations with congressional leaders, Clinton presented a fourth budget plan. But this plan was mostly an iteration of Budget Plan #3 and contained no new policy recommendations. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The CBO scored this plan as still $69 billion out of balance in FY 2002. The Administration tried to make up its shortcomings in reducing the deficit by challenging CBO technical and economic estimates. The Administration had been arguing for weeks that CBO's economic assumptions were too conservative and thus required excessively deep spending cuts to balance the budget. In making this argument, the Administration wanted to have it both ways. While claiming that it wanted to balance the budget, it actually wanted to spend more money as the budget was moving toward balance.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On December 18, 1995, the House defeated this plan by a vote of 412 to 0.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #5:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

On January 6, 1996, Clinton presented a fifth budget plan. This plan, largely adapted from a proposal by Senate Democrats, was certified by CBO to balance the budget in seven years, at least on paper. Though it mathematically balances the budget in seven years, however, the fifth Clinton budget fell far short of being a credible plan. The reasons: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Most of the heavy lifting of deficit reduction was required in the two years following the end of Clinton's possible second term as President. Indeed, 62 percent of the plan's $583 billion in deficit reduction falls in FY 2001 and FY 2002. For example, the plan called for $102 billion in Medicare savings over seven years, but 63 percent of these savings were to come in the last two years. Similarly, the plan called for $37 billion in discretionary spending cuts beyond the savings needed to achieve a "hard freeze" in these programs, yet 95 percent of these additional savings fell in the last two years of the plan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While the fifth Clinton budget plan called for $87 billion in gross tax cuts ($17 billion in net tax cuts) over seven years, these cuts were sunsetted in FY 2001 -- one year before the budget was to be balanced. This means taxes would have to be raised. Mathematically, such a ploy "boosts" tax revenues by at least $15 billion in FY 2002 and thus requires fewer spending cuts to achieve a balanced budget. The overall size of the tax cut proposal was reduced by the plan's call for $60 billion in new revenue from closing "corporate loopholes."  Some 43 percent of the revenues generated from these tax hikes would be received in FY 2002.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #6:</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The sixth Clinton budget was submitted on January 9. This plan moved only slightly beyond the previous plans, modestly increasing the proposed savings from Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare reform while slightly boosting the size of the tax cuts. Overall, this Clinton plan would produce nearly $160 billion less in budget savings and nearly $70 billion less in deficit reduction than the last congressional offer. Moreover, the White House still avoided the fundamental reforms in Medicare, Medicaid, and welfare needed to achieve budget savings and restructure the programs.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #7</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The seventh Clinton plan was submitted to Congress on January 18. This budget plan was essentially identical to the January 9 plan except that it substantially increased the amount of new revenues it would generate from closing "corporate tax loopholes" and other such devices. Because of these new revenues, the net size of the tax cut would have been reduced to a mere $36 billion over seven years.

<p>
<b>Clinton Budget #8: The FY 1997 Budget</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Like the seven budget plans that preceded it during the past year, the FY 1997 Clinton budget, presented to Congress February 5, would have forced hard-working Americans to pay higher taxes in exchange for more spending on programs which have become old and obsolete, or which are ripe for termination, privatization, or transfer to state control. Indeed, compared with the FY 1997 budget resolution passed by Congress in May, Clinton's FY 1997 budget would mean nearly $1,500 in higher taxes and $3,500 in higher spending for every household in America over the next six years. Moreover, the Clinton plan ignores the fundamental problems facing the government's major entitlement and welfare programs. Clinton has shirked his responsibility to address, for instance, a Medicare program facing insolvency, a Medicaid program that is bankrupting state budgets, and a welfare system that perpetuates a culture of poverty.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Repeated gimmicks and ploys such as these indicate that the Clinton Administration probably never has been serious about reaching a balanced budget agreement with Congress. At every turn, President Clinton has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the growth rate of spending. Incredibly, Clinton now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it would have been lower had he not vetoed Congress's Balanced Budget Act of 1995. The truth is that Congress deserves credit for reversing Clinton policies which would have perpetuated a $200 billion deficit into the next century. The record is clear: Bill Clinton prefers keeping money in the hands of Washington bureaucrats to keeping it in the pockets of American taxpayers.

<p>
Using a generally accepted and widely regarded model of the U.S. economy, we found that balancing the federal budget between 1996 and 2002 while cutting taxes caused the economy generally to grow more than not balancing the budget and cutting taxes.
<p>
<i>Specifically, according to the simulation, the balanced budget plan with tax relief would mean:</i>
<p><ul>
<li>Gross Domestic Product grows by $10.8 billion more than under current law in the year 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $32.1 billion in real disposable income over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $66.2 billion in consumption expenditures over the period 1995 though 2002.
<p>
<li>An additional $88.2 billion in real non-residential fixed investment over the period 1995 through 2002.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.4 percent in the conventional mortgage rate.  This means that a balanced budget with tax relief would save a home borrower of $100,000 about $10,000 over the life of a 30-year mortgage.
<P>
<li>The additional construction of 104,000 new family homes over the next seven years.
<p>
<li>The additional sales of 600,000 automobiles over the next seven years worth $10 billion.
<p>
<li>A decrease of 0.7 percent in the growth rate of the Consumer Price Index.
<p></ul>
	The Heritage Foundation used the U.S. economic model developed by Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a nationally recognized economic consulting company, to reach these conclusions. Laurence H. Meyer & Associates are consultants to many government agencies including the Office of Management & Budget, the Federal Reserve Board, the Department of Labor, the Congressional Budget Office, and the Council of Economic Advisors.
<p>
	Heritage made no changes to the Meyer model except to reset federal spending levels to mirror those contained in the Congressional Budget Resolution of May and to reduce tax rates that capture tax policy changes defined by the Senate Finance Committee.  We explicitly continued the assumption of the Meyer model that the Federal Reserve would not act to stimulate the economy in the face of slower than expected growth.  Had we allowed the model to use the assumption of a more active Federal Reserve, all of the numbers reported below would have been significantly higher.
<p>
Specifically, we assumed:
<p><ul>
<li>Reductions in the rate of growth for Medicare and Medicaid follow those in the budget resolution.
<p>
<li>Cash aid welfare spending growth rates were capped at 3.5 percent.
<P>
<li>Increases in national defense spending were applied primarily to Department of Defense procurement programs.
<p>
<li>All other spending -- for government purchases and transfer payments -- was reduced in the same proportion called for in the budget resolution until balance was reached in 2002.
<p>
<li>A 50 percent exemption of capital gains was assumed through 2004.
<p>
<li>Family tax relief and other provisions of the Senate tax package were accounted for by changing the effective tax rates on wages, dividends, and individuals.

<b>Read the descriptions below, and click on the titles for a graphical representation:</b>
<p>
<center><a href="chart13.gif">Competing Deficit Reduction Plans:</a></center>
<P>
"President Clinton has developed two official budgets over the past year.  The first one, issued in January, 1995, was never intended to balance the budget over the next decade.  The second Clinton budget, issued in June 1995, was said to reach a balance in 2005.  However, as this graph shows, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the President's second budget will never actually balance the budget.  In contrast, the Congressional Balanced Budget Plan of 1995 reaches a balance in 2002, according to the Congressional Budget Office."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart14.gif">GDP in 2002....</a></center>
<p>
"Balancing the budget and cutting taxes over seven years produces $10.8 billion more in Gross Domestic Product.  The red bar below shows the level of Gross Domestic Product, a measure of all the final sales within the United States, that is forecast in the year 2002 if nothing is done to balance the budget or lower taxes.  The blue bar shows that a higher level of GDP can be expected in 2002 with a balanced federal budget and tax cuts."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart5.gif">Additional Consumption Expenditures From A Balanced Budget</a></center>
<p>
"One result of a balanced budget with tax cuts is some $66.2 billion more in consumption expenditures that the American people, not the government, are able to spend on everything from groceries to houses."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart7.gif">Additional Non-Residential Fixed Investment With A Balanced Budget and Tax Cuts</a></center>
<p>
"This graph shows that a balanced budget with tax cuts will allow companies to build more factories and buy more machinery:  $88.2 billion more.  This increased spending represents lasting investments, primarily in the manufacturing sector."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart8.gif">Additional Business Investment in Computers.....</a></center>
<p>
"Another advantage of a balanced budget with tax cuts is that businesses will be able to invest in computers.  This will allow American workers to be more productive and in turn make American companies more competitive."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart12.gif">Additional Investment in Durable Goods....</a></center>
<p>
"A balanced budget with tax cuts means that Americans will be spending $66.2 billion more in consumption.  This graph shows that a large part of that additional spending will be for producers' durable, things like microwaves, air conditioners, and other appliances.  In other words, a balanced budget with tax cuts will allow Americans to invest in lasting, household goods."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart11.gif">Additional Purchases of New Automobiles....</a></center>
<p>
"A balanced budget with tax cuts means that Americans will be able to purchase about $10 billion worth of new automobiles over the next seven years.  That means that about 600,000 new automobiles will be built and purchased."
<hr><P>
<center><a href="chart9.gif">Conventional Mortgage Rates.....</a></center>
<p>
"A balanced budget with tax cuts could lower interest rates.  Over the next seven years a balanced budget with tax cuts might lower rates 0.5% below what they are expected to be without a balanced budget.  This 0.5% decrease means that a home borrower of $100,000 would save about $10,000 over a thirty-year mortgage."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart4.gif">Additional Housing Starts.....</a></center>
<p>
"Lower mortgage interest rates means that more people will be able to afford a house.  A balanced budget with tax cuts could lead to the construction of nearly 104,000 new homes over the next seven years.  This means not only new homes but also more good-paying construction jobs."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart10.gif">Inflation.....</a></center>
<p>
"Perhaps most importantly, a balanced budget with tax cuts would likely lower the rate of inflation by almost a full percentage point.  Thus, prices will not rise as quickly.  This is most beneficial to senior citizens and younger people who are living on a fixed income."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart_3.gif">$500-Per-Child Tax Credit Worksheet</a></center>
<p>
"The Congressional Balanced Budget Plan of 1995 includes a $500 per child tax credit.  This tax credit will help more than 28 million American families raising 51 million children.  To most families $500 would help pay one months mortgage payment or rent."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart2.gif">$500-Per-Child Tax Credit Benefits Middle Class Most</a></center> 
<p>
"Contrary to what most people have been saying, the $500 per child tax credit benefits mostly middle and lower class families.  In fact, 96 percent goes to families making below $100,000 per year."
<hr><p>
<center><a href="chart1.gif">Income Taxes</a></center>
<p>
"This graph shows that the $500 per-child tax credit benefits those at lower incomes more than the wealthy.  In fact, about 3.5 million families would have their entire income tax burden eliminated by the $500 per-child tax credit."

<h3>Russell Amos Kirk</h3><br>
<b>1918-1994</b><br></center>
<p>
"For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was the conscience of the conservative movement. As a scholar, essayist, lecturer, and critic, he saw contemporary political events against the backdrop of history, philosophy, and literature -- subjects in which his background was astonishingly thorough. Following the publication of his masterful <I>The Conservative Mind</i>, Dr. Kirk watched the conservative intellectual revival develop around him until his solitary cause of the early 1950s became the dominant trend of the 1980s. As much as any other living American, Russell Kirk was responsible for the growth of that movement. His works have given the conservative movement sage guidance in its efforts to redeem the time and champion the permanent things."

<B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration came into office with a widely  recognized lack
of experience in defense and foreign policy. But  the new President did not take
the necessary steps to correct this  deficiency. The new Commander in Chief,
already suspect in the  national security community for his history of draft
avoidance  during the Vietnam War, made decisions which reinforced his image as 
a President out of touch with the military services and inattentive  to foreign
policy and national security issues. His flip-flops on  Haiti, Cuba, China, and
Bosnia weakened American credibility  abroad and created doubts around the world
about U.S. leadership.  Moreover, the Clinton Administration has presided over a period of neglect  and decline of
U.S. military strength. The Administration's series  of missteps amounts to
little more than on-the-job-training.  Despite over three years in office, the
job as leader and chief architect  of America's foreign and defense policies
still appears to be too  big for Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Instead of developing a clear and coherent foreign and  defense policy
grounded in American principles and national interest,  the Clinton
Administration allowed politics and indifference to  foreign policy issues to
create muddle and confusion in America's  foreign 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  policy. Until the beginning of the
104th Congress and the  Contract With America, Congress regrettably did little
to correct the  unwise course being followed by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President and his advisors, indelibly influenced by their  opposition to
the Vietnam War, came into office confused about  the principles that legitimize
the exercise of American power. It  soon became apparent that the Clinton team
believed unilateral  U.S. action was improper, and that U.S. power must be  &quot;legitimized&quot;
by operating through some international or multilateral agency  like the United
Nations. The resulting policy of  &quot;assertive multilateralism&quot;
subordinated clear national interests to the  U.N. and other supranational
entities. Extending his liberal  worldview to international politics, President
Clinton in Somalia, Haiti,  and Bosnia looked upon foreign policy as social
work. Clinton's  vague global utopianism led him to commit the U.S. to dubious 
enterprises, with American soldiers needlessly killed and scarce  defense
dollars wasted. The Administration claims to have learned  that &quot;assertive
multilateralism&quot; in the U.N. does not work, but  the President exercised
the same unwise judgment from his early  years in office by unnecessarily and
unwisely sending U.S. troops  to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Dubious Foreign Policy Successes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of these enterprises have been hailed as foreign policy  successes by
the Clinton Administration. The President has  claimed that his greatest
successes are in North Korea, Haiti, and  Bosnia. But these claims are
overblown. For example, the  Administration has:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Made extraordinary concessions to a most dangerous 
potential enemy, North Korea.</B> Rewarding North Korea's blatant and 
persistent refusal to live up to its obligations as a signatory to  the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the U.S. agreed to provide  $5 billion in fuel oil and
to help finance and build two new light  water reactors for Pyongyang. These
terms were spelled out in  the Nuclear Framework Agreement the Clinton
Administration  negotiated with North Korea. The Administration brags that this 
agreement gives the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) the right
to inspect certain nuclear facilities inside  North Korea. But the IAEA already
had the right to carry out  inspections. Moreover, the Nuclear Framework
Agreement provides no  guarantee that the North has stopped trying to build
nuclear weapons  at hidden sites, or that the North will continue to cooperate
with  the IAEA once Pyongyang has extracted financial and diplomatic 
concessions from the West.<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> North Korea has  been paid to do what
it already was obligated to do under the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and
the U.S. is still not certain  that North Korea has stopped its nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Embarked on a costly venture of dubious value in Haiti.  President
Clinton hails his Haiti venture as a great foreign policy success.</B>  To be
sure, the U.S., the world's remaining military superpower,  did subdue the
Hemisphere's poorest and most backward country.  But for what purpose?  To
restore to office an avowed Marxist  demagogue known for his hostility to the
U.S. While the Haiti  mission did not turn into a Somalia-like disaster with the
loss of  American lives, it has cost upwards of $2 billion and placed enormous 
strain on U.S. forces at a time when they were engaged in many other  so-called
peace operations. Moreover, under the watchful eyes  of U.S. occupation forces,
former President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  hijacked democracy in Haiti,
placing his hand-picked and  easily controlled successor in power via the
elections of December,  1995, and allowing political murders of his opponents to
occur  unpunished. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> The U.S. operation in Haiti was  unnecessary
and wasteful, serving no vital U.S. interest, and it did  not achieve its stated
purpose  the creation of democracy in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Boxed America into an unwise and unnecessary U.N. troop  commitment to
Bosnia.</B> By failing to lift the arms embargo on the  embattled Bosnians so
they could defend themselves, it was left up  to the Croatians to push back the
Bosnian Serbs, who had  dominated the military balance of power inside Bosnia.
Once this shift in  the balance of power occurred, the stage was set for the
peace  agreement which was negotiated November 30, 1995, in Dayton,  Ohio.
Although U.S. pressure and NATO airstrikes played a role  in bringing about the
Dayton agreement, the real key was the  military defeats which the Bosnians and
Croatians imposed on the  Bosnian Serbs last year. But because the Bosnian
Muslims do not fully  trust the Croatians  indeed a few years ago they were at
war with  each other  the Dayton peace agreement is not only very fragile,  it
requires the presence of 20,000 U.S. troops and other  NATO forces to enforce
it. Thus, by failing to lift the arms embargo  on Bosnia, President Clinton
practically guaranteed that U.S.  troops would have to go to Bosnia to enforce
the peace, something  which he had repeatedly in the past promised he would not
do.
<br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> The U.S. troop deployment was unneccessary and  unwise, and
peace is by no means assured in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Claimed credit for the two Israeli-Palestinian peace accords  signed at
the White House in September 1993 and September 1995.</B>  But the two
agreements came about through bilateral negotiations  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  tween Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization,  initially conducted without the Administration's
knowledge. <br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> President Clinton enjoyed two photo opportunities,
but  the diplomatic breakthroughs that produced the agreements  came about
mainly through bilateral talks between Israelis and  Palestinians, not through
American diplomatic efforts.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Claims to have advanced the peace process between the  Irish Catholic
minority in Northern Ireland and the Irish Protestant  majority, backed by the
British government.</B> But the  Administration's controversial embrace of Gerry
Adams, leader of Sinn Fein,  the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), is a risky  diplomatic gambit that has backfired. Despite the fact that
the  IRA has killed almost 2,000 people in terrorist attacks over the last  25
years, the Administration has rewarded it with a &quot;carrot and  carrot&quot;
policy. Clinton overruled the advice of his own State  Department, Defense
Department, and Justice Department to  allow Adams to obtain a visa to visit the
U.S. in February 1994.  In March 1995, the Administration allowed Adams to
travel to  the U.S. on a fund-raising trip, open an office in Washington, and 
visit the White House on Saint Patrick's Day. Although the IRA  agreed to a
cease-fire in its terrorist war, it did not agree to disarm,  and maintains a
huge arsenal, including more than a ton of  Semtex plastic explosive, much of it
provided by Libyan  dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Of course, the IRA broke its
cease-fire,  renewing its terrorist campaign, making a mockery of Clinton's 
efforts to bring peace to Nothern Ireland. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>  Clinton's opportunistic embrace of Gerry Adams, motivated at least in  part by domestic
politics, has undermined U.S. counterterrorism  policy; strained relations with
Britain, a staunch ally; and raised the  IRA's expectations that Washington will
press London to make  conces
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  sions without IRA concessions,
thereby undermining the  chances of a genuine peace.

</P>
<P><B>NAFTA and GATT: Successes Unfulfilled</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One genuine success for which the Clinton Administration fails  to claim
much credit is the approval of the North American  Free Trade Agreement and the
Uruguay Round of talks in the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
The Clinton  Administration is to be commended for completing these agreements, 
but the initiative and much of the work behind them occurred in  the Reagan and
Bush Administrations. Moreover, by dropping the  ball on expanding NAFTA to
include Chile, the Clinton  Administration has practically taken the U.S. out of
the game of expanding  free trade in the Western Hemisphere. As a result, the
President  has ceded the initiative to Brazil and others who may want to  create
trade blocs closed to the U.S. but possibly more open to U.S.  competitors in
Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton's Failures</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While the President's foreign policy &quot;successes&quot; have proven to 
be doubtful, his many foreign policy failures are obvious and  admitted even by
his supporters. For example, the President has: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Dragged his feet on protecting the U.S. homeland and troops
 and interests abroad from the growing danger of ballistic missiles. </B> He cut
the budget for missile defense by over 50 percent from  levels projected by the
Bush Administration and has attempted  illegally to broaden the restrictions of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic  Missile (ABM) Treaty, which imposes severe restrictions
on strategic  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  fenses, to cover tactical and
theater defenses as well. <br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> Americans will be left vulnerable to
nuclear attack,  even though the Clinton Administration itself has admitted that
the  proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is the most 
serious threat to national security.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Wasted American lives and treasure on dubious peacekeeping  operations.</B>
Clinton allowed a limited, humanitarian mission to  Somalia to escalate into an
uncertain and dangerous  &quot;nation-building&quot; mission, which included
hunting Somali warlords and  disarming militant factions  in effect making the
U.S. a combatant in  a bloody civil war. Putting U.S. troops under a confused
U.N.  command structure, the Clinton Administration failed to provide  adequate
weapons and equipment to U.S. forces engaged in a  combat operation. The result
was an intense street battle in Mogadishu  in October 1993 which left 18 young
American Rangers dead,  75 other soldiers wounded and led to America's
humiliating  retreat from Somalia. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> American lives were lost 
unnecessarily, and U.S. national prestige and credibility suffered  needlessly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Frittered away American military strength and credibility in a  series
of &quot;peace operations&quot; with little or no benefit to the  nation's
security, consuming billions of defense budget dollars intended  for training,
operations, and maintenance of U.S. forces and  equipment.</B> These missions
included an unwise expansion of the  peace mission in Somalia, which led to the
mission's failure, and  the dispatch of troops to peacekeeping missions in
Haiti,  Macedonia, and Bosnia. At the same time, by cutting the defense budget, 
the President has neglected the core duty of the armed forces: to  fight and win
wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and  existing 
 military alliance commitments. 
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Under  Clinton, American fighting troops are weaker and less able
to deal  with larger military contingencies, such as in Korea or the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Built America's military strategy on a potentially fatal illusion.  In
1993 President Clinton's Pentagon released a study of  America's long-range
military requirements.</B> Called the &quot;Bottom-Up  Review,&quot; this study
concluded that the U.S. should have the  means and forces to fight two nearly
simultaneous medium-sized  conflicts. Yet Clinton proceeded to cut the very
forces needed to  sustain this capability. The President refused to fund
adequately  and field the force which his own planners said the country  needed.
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Because the U.S. will not be able to protect  all its interests
around the world, its alliances may weaken, its  credibility and influence may
wane, and Americans could be forced  to follow the lead of others rather than to
lead themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Weakened the armed forces with social experimentation and  &quot;political
correctness.&quot;</B>  The President has imposed his radical  vision on the
military services by pushing women into combat  positions before their
effectiveness has been tested, or their impact on  combat effectiveness honestly
evaluated. He has advocated the  admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the
ranks, contrary to  the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The
result has been  a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they 
lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat  effectiveness.<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Clinton has weakened the morale of  America's fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Followed a &quot;Russia-only&quot; policy that has not bolstered 
democracy in Russia, but it has blocked development of strong relations  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  former Soviet states like Ukraine.</B>
President Clinton has  staked U.S. policy on the fate of one man, President
Boris Yeltsin.  The ostensible reason for this policy is to bolster democracy in
 Russia, but it clearly has not worked. Yeltsin has kicked democrats  like
former Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and former  Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly
Chubais out of his cabinet, replacing  them with old Soviet hardliners like
Yevgeny Primakov, the new  Foreign Minister. But still the U.S. offers Yeltsin
good will and  cooperation. Clinton has largely turned a blind eye to Russia's 
hard-line policy toward its former &quot;republics&quot; and provinces  the 
so-called &quot;Near Abroad&quot;  and he has failed to condemn Russian 
aggression in trouble spots like Chechnya, Moldova, and Georgia. 
<br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> Clinton's policy of accommodation has not  worked. Russia continues to
drift away from democracy and toward a  more hard line foreign policy, while the
U.S. continues to offer  friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Put at risk key alliance relationships with Japan and the  Republic of
Korea. The Administration's effort last year to manage  trade with Japan was
acrimonious and counterproductive from the  start.</B> The U.S. reached auto
trade agreements with Japan in  November 1994 and March 1995, but these achieved
little and strained  U.S.-Japan relations. After initially denying that its
confrontational  policies were damaging the U.S.-Japan alliance, the 
Administration, under the Pentagon's leadership, belatedly tried to limit the 
damage and reaffirm the alliance. The main purpose of the April  1996
U.S.-Japanese summit is to repair the damage caused by the  previous year's
trade battles. At the same time, Clinton's efforts  to strike a nuclear bargain
with North Korea marginalized the  influence and role of a reliable U.S. ally,
South Korea. Recent  opinion polls by the United States Information Agency show
South  Korean 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  support for a U.S. military
presence at 72 percent, down 10  percent from 1994. Overall opinion of the U.S.
not only is down 20  percent, but also  and for the first time in 12 years  is
more  unfavorable (53 percent) than favorable (43 percent).<br><b>The Bottom  Line:</b> America's alliances with South Korea and Japan, key links in  the security chain
of Asia, have been weakened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with the People's Republic  of
China. After campaigning in 1992 to link China's Most  Favored Nation (MFN)
trading status to its human rights record,  President Clinton reversed himself
in 1994 and delinked MFN from  human rights.</B> <TT><B><A
HREF="ftntfor.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>  This was the correct
decision. As the Administration  belatedly recognized, the best way to encourage
China to  observe international norms of conduct is to promote policies which 
enhance economic interaction and, in turn, economic freedom  and reform. These
are the seeds from which democracy can  grow. However, the Administration's
flip-flops created the impression  of ineptness and weakness. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>
While the  Administration ultimately did the right thing, its ill-conceived
linkage  policy cost the U.S. credibility both in Beijing and across Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Allowed Beijing to set America's agenda with the Republic  of China on
Taiwan.</B> In response to nearly unanimous  congressional resolutions, the
Administration relented and allowed  Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui to make a
&quot;private&quot; visit to his alma  mater, Cornell University, in June 1995.
Previously, in the face  of Beijing's protests, the Administration had resisted
the visit  of President Lee, claiming that it would violate its  &quot;One-China&quot;
policy. Clinton reversed himself only when he was pressured to  do so. The
mistake was the initial refusal to allow President Lee  to visit the U.S. 
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Beijing should not be allowed  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  dictate the terms of America's &quot;unofficial&quot;
commercial and  cultural relations with Taiwan, and its interest in Taiwan's
security,  as established by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Abandoned three decades of principled U.S. policy towards  Cuba.</B>
President Clinton secretly negotiated with Fidel Castro's  communist regime in
August 1994 to reach an agreement whereby all  Cuban boat people intercepted at
sea by U.S. ships would be  repatriated forcibly to Cuba. Hitherto Cuban
refugees were permitted  to enter the U.S. without restriction.
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Clinton changed the longstanding U.S. policy of isolating communist  Cuba to a
new conciliatory stance, without winning any democratic  or free-market
concessions from Castro. Clinton was  eventually forced to abandon this
conciliatory policy, and to strengthen  the embargo against Cuba, but only after
he was forced to do so in  the aftermath of the Cuban downing of two U.S.
civilian aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Failed to take seriously the global challenge of radical or 
revolutionary Islam.</B> Nor has the President pursued realistic steps to  deal
with the Islamist threat to friendly regimes or secular Muslim  powers in the
Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. Instead,  he has sought to
establish diplomatic contacts with radical  Islamic movements such as Algeria's
Islamic Salvation Front, thereby  undermining secular regimes battling Islamic
radicals. As a  result, the U.S. is not properly anticipating the potential
realignment  of global power in regions critical to U.S. interests. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Radical regimes could threaten not only U.S. access to oil, but  also
American lives and interests through terrorism.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that  have
characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  defense policy over the past four
years are serious. They  have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad
and, unless  rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great 
power capable of defending its values and interests. For America, it  is either
lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security,  and greatness, the
second to weakness and submission. For its  own well-being, and for that of the
entire globe, America's  leadership needs to be restored.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weak record of the Clinton Administration in foreign and  defense policy
was singled out for criticism in the GOP's  Contract With America. Alarmed over
Clinton's defense budget cuts  and failure to move rapidly toward a national
missile defense  system, Republicans marching under the banner of the Contract 
promised to restore America's military strength. Once elected in  November 1994,
they got to work on trying to fulfill their promise. On  February 7, 1995, the
House of Representatives passed the National  Security Revitalization Act (H.R.
7), which sought to establish  a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall
in defense, set a  new policy for the development and deployment of missile 
defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the  President to
subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Senate did not take up H.R. 7. However, parts of H.R. 7  found their way
into different pieces of legislation in the Senate, such  as in the defense
authorization bill and foreign relations  authorization bill. While not all of
the original Contract items were included  in final legislation reconciling
differences between the House  and Senate  for example, Congress dropped the
House's demand  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  create a commission to examine
U.S. national security strategy   conservative supporters of the Contract
delivered on the  majority of their promises to the American people. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress undertook a number of other foreign and  defense policy
initiatives in 1995 that complemented and supplemented  the legislation inspired
by the Contract With America. For  example, the new majority in Congress
endeavored to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Restore America's military strength. Congress approved a 
defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget  request
submitted by President Clinton.</B> This money was needed not  only to keep
America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but  also to maintain a force
with modern high-technology weapons in  the 21st century. Primarily because he
counted on congressional  support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton
bowed to  congressional demands and signed the defense appropriations bill for 
fiscal 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his  original
request. But in an unprecedented act the President vetoed  the accompanying
fiscal year 1996 defense authorization bill  which would have: 1) provided more
funds to maintain the  technological superiority of U.S. forces, 2) authorized a
pay raise and  housing allowance increase for military personnel (including
those  deployed to Bosnia), and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S.  homeland
against ballistic missiles. However, in early 1996 the  President signed a
different version of the defense authorization bill  that weakened missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Move the United States closer to a national missile defense  system.</B>
The defense authorization bill approved by Congress but  vetoed by the President
sought to establish a clear timetable for  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  velopment and deployment of both
national and theater  missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the
application of  Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater
defense  systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill,
giving  as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it 
contained. Of course, the President eventually got his way,  forcing Congress to
accept a weakening of missile defense in the  final 1996 defense authorization
bill. Once again the President has  succeeded in blocking this country's ability
to defend its citizens  from nuclear attack and Congress was not able to muster
enough  votes to override his veto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut foreign aid.</B> While the new Republican majority promised 
extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of  revamping
America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending  on foreign aid will
likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than  it was in FY 1995. However,
under the umbrella of a balanced  budget by the year 2002, further cuts are
likely. While current  cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except
aid to  Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right 
direction is a new law, that the U.S. government report on the  progress being
made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets,  the main engine of
economic development. This effort was inspired  by The Heritage Foundation's
<I>Index of Economic  Freedom</I>, a global comparison of economic freedom in
142 countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</B> Congress passed and  the
President signed the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity  Act just a few
days after the February 24, 1996, downing by Cuba  of two U.S. registered
civilian aircraft in international waters.  This legislation, which tightens the
U.S. trade embargo on Cuba  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  allows American citizens to seek
compensation for property  stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening
the end of  Castro's dictatorship.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reorganize the State Department.</B> Congress proposed to cut  waste in
the State Department and foreign operations accounts by  consolidating several
independent foreign policy agencies into  the State Department. This effort, led
by Senate Foreign  Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the
support of  Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic  interests
within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key  legislation to move
the Arms Control and Disarmament  Agency (ACDA), United States Information
Agency (USIA), Agency  for International Development (AID), and two other
foreign  policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a 
House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President  has vowed to
veto this legislation if approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</B> In  December
1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support  the U.S. troops being
deployed on the peacekeeping mission  to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did
not endorse  the President's decision to deploy them, and raised questions about
 the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear  goals. The House
went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the  Bosnia mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Maintain America's trading relations with China by  approving
most-favored-nation trade status for China.</B> In July 1995, the  Congress
sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China.  This decision reflects
the belief held by a majority in the Congress  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  increasing economic interaction
is the best way to promote  economic reform and advance political liberalization
and  human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</B> In the face of 
Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui  a visa to
visit his alma mater Cornell University, the Congress  voted with near unanimity
in May 1995 to support his visit. As a  result, the President reversed course
and granted the visa. Also, both  the House and Senate, have included provisions
in the 1996 State  Department authorization bill that would give precedence to
the  1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China  government-to-government
communiqu&eacute;s when considering future weapons exports to  Taiwan. U.S.
China policy too often is framed by communiqu&eacute;s  that have no force of
law, international or domestic. The Taiwan  Relations Act, however, is the law
of the land. The President  has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.

<h3> A Personal Report from the Education Summit: What Does It Mean For Education Reform? </h3>
<b>By Denis P. Doyle<br> 
Senior Fellow in Education </b>
<p>
A Heritage Foundation Symposium, given May 21, 1996.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Allow me to share with you my impressions of the recent Education Summit, sponsored jointly by IBM and the nation's governors. As an invited guest representing The Heritage Foundation, I was impressed by the tone and temper of the meeting. There was a clear reaffirmation of the principle that the job of public education is a state and local task; it is not the job of the federal government. And while the governors and the representatives of corporate America have a direct interest in the best education of America's children, including real standards, tests, and results, the ultimate engine of reform is dedicated parents. They are most interested in their children's education. While school choice, the most vigorous and far-reaching education reform measure available to us, was not on the summit agenda, we all know that market-based reform like school choice enforces accountability to parents. It is the natural ally of high academic standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It was an extraordinary first. Forty-three governors encamped to the IBM Palisades, New York, conference center March 26 and 27, 1996, to talk about -- and act on-- education standards. A gathering of eagles, each governor was accompanied by a home-state CEO of his or her choosing. To round out the invitation list, IBM CEO Louis V. Gerstner and co-host Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson invited 30 education "resource people."  More than the usual suspects, the resource people were a motley crew of special-interest pleaders, state education leaders, foundation executives, think tank intellectuals, and policy analysts. Indeed, the most distinctive resource person was Secretary Riley, invited neither as a participant nor as a speaker. His silence spoke volumes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Governor Thompson and CEO Gerstner jointly presided over the two-day meeting, and were joined at the head table by a bipartisan steering committee made up of Governors Terry Branstad (R-IA), John Engler (R-MI), Jim Hunt (D-NC), incoming NGA head Bob Miller (D-NV), and Roy Romer (D-CO). CEOs Robert E. Allen (AT&T), John L. Clendenin (BellSouth Corporation), George Fisher (Kodak), John Pepper (P&G), and Frank Shrontz (Boeing) shared the spotlight.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the meeting's larger purpose was to reinvigorate the standards movement and highlight education technology, its real function was to solemnize the fact that the federal role in education is virtually at an end. Governor Thompson made one thing crystal clear in his opening remarks: The meeting was addressing a problem that was national in scope but that did not call for a federal government solution. The governors and CEOs could handle it themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b> HAIL TO THE CHIEF</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The harmonious picture was completed when President Clinton addressed the group just before lunch on Wednesday, the second day of the conference. Even seasoned Washington watchers were impressed by the security; in addition to the usual complement of Secret Service agents and countless members of the New York highway patrol, each governor was accompanied by a phalanx of plainclothes officers. There were many more people with earpieces and distinctive lapel pins than there were participants.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because the putative purpose of the meeting was to get the education standards train back on track, the first afternoon's plenary session was followed by small group meetings with no press present, chaired jointly by a governor and a CEO; resource people were present but largely seen, not heard. Cocktails and dinner were followed by a six-person panel featuring Al Shanker of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT); Governor Jim Hunt of North Carolina; Chester Finn and Lynn Cheney, conservative appointees and education specialists in the Reagan and Bush Administrations; and Governors John Engler of Michigan and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin. The next morning, small groups of governors, CEOs, and resource people were moved at a forced march through more than a dozen technology exhibits (ten minutes per exhibit). The technology exhibits were carefully scripted and were a great success, not least because of a striking example of enlightened despotism: The majority of the technology displays were running on Apple software. Moreover, the CEO of Apple was at the summit as the guest of the governor of North Dakota.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>PRIVATE INITIATIVE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Two things stand out. First, the original idea was Lou Gerstner's. As Chief Executive Officer of IBM, he has had a long-standing interest in education. It was not a government conclave, and it certainly was not a typical business meeting. One of the nation's most vigorous business leaders, Gerstner gained the confidence of Tommy Thompson (concurrently the head of National Governors' Association and Education Commission of the States, the first governor to chair both organizations since Bill Clinton) and Roy Romer, Governor of Colorado and as liberal as Thompson is conservative. While no summit could escape political overtones, this one was neither politically conceived nor politically motivated. It achieved a status often talked about but only infrequently realized: It was bipartisan. (The issue of school choice was not on the table; had it been, the bipartisan aura would have evaporated quickly, as a brief public colloquy between Governors George Allen of Virginia and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin revealed as the summit was wrapping up. Even more was apparently said in private.)
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Limiting the agenda to issues about which bipartisan agreement could be achieved was no small feat. Indeed, two years ago, when the 103rd Congress was still sitting, there could not have been widespread agreement about standards. That such agreement is emerging is a commentary on the temper of the times. And while Gerstner is a political animal within the corporate world, he does not approach education as a political issue. It was his insight to take the issue to the governors. Gerstner is no newcomer to the issue; he has been worried about the quality of the nation's schools for a very long time. I know about his interest first hand as the co-author of a book with him (and two other colleagues) several years ago: <i>Reinventing Education: Entrepreneurship in America's Public Schools </i> (New York, E. P. Dutton). Among other things, it tells the story of the RJR Nabisco Foundation's Next Century Schools program, in which Gerstner oversaw the investment of $32 million in 43 schools across the country -- not an insignificant amount, even by Washington standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interestingly, governors, highly political in their own states, are strikingly nonpartisan with each other. They are as courtly with other governors as members of the U.S. Senate are with colleagues; but unlike Senators, their show of bipartisanship is real. In part this is because they do not see other governors as competitors. They have much in common and much to learn from each other, and they know it. They genuinely enjoy each other's company as well, which is one of the reasons they gave former Governor Clinton such a warm welcome; regardless of party affiliation, he's a member of the tribe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Clinton, for his part, gave a speech calculated to please--as it did--and demonstrated that what he is ideally suited to be is "governor" of the United States. The President, as many know, can charm the birds out of the trees. And if he believes what he says--or if he acts as though he does--American education could be in for a big change. This is always a challenge for those of us who tend to be skeptical of the President's diplomatic relations between his language and his actions. In his 1996 State of the Union speech, Clinton had proclaimed that the era of big government was at an end. From his federal budget submissions, however, this is not at all clear to the rest of us. In his Palisades education policy speech, he repeated that promise. Not surprisingly, like much of his State of the Union Address, it was a speech 95 percent of which any Republican could have delivered with complete conviction.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The high points were few and memorable. Clinton opened with the claim that what matters in education is effort. Not talent or IQ or luck; effort. How quaint. And how on the mark. Nothing is more patronizing--or damaging--to poor or minority children than to tell them that nothing they do matters, that whatever might happen to them is the luck of the socioeconomic draw. About this point the President is right. He went on to say that standards are essential, just as state-developed assessments are. The pivotal point, however, was his use of the word "consequences."  Only one other public figure regularly uses that word, AFT President Al Shanker, and it is no accident that he has been heavily lobbying the President and his senior staff about this issue for months. Clinton gave "consequences" operational significance when he attached a liberal sacred cow: social promotion. No more, he intoned. Right again.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
C-SPAN carried the full proceedings of the summit. President Clinton mentioned that he had watched the panel discussion from the comfort of the White House. His folksy references to panelists' comments--particularly Al Shanker's--offered another striking example of his command of the subject of his speech.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clinton closed with a paean about discipline: No one can teach or learn in an undisciplined and unsafe environment. As Checker Finn noted, it was a speech which Ronald Reagan could have given. There was not a single reference to the federal government, no talk about federal standards, and nary a word about Goals 2000.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what was true of Clinton's comments was true of the governors and CEOs. The idea that standards are a state and local issue was supported unanimously, or at least with no public dissent. In the case of governors like Jim Hunt and Roy Romer, their willingness to go along may be simple political prudence. They know that the federal role will soon be <i>de minimis</i>, and they are reconciled to this new reality. They might wish that it were otherwise but made no public complaint or statement to that effect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>NEW, NEW FEDERALISM</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For my part, I am convinced that whatever their private reservations or reluctance might be now, they will grow to like their new role. Governors actually enjoy governing, and education is typically the biggest single item in their budgets. While they know that freedom from Washington will have a price (federal spending reductions), they are likely to find that life is both simpler and more interesting without Uncle Sam looking over their shoulders.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Presidents from Nixon to Clinton, of course, have flirted with the idea of "new federalism."  Indeed, it is a Nixon coinage, but has made little substantive headway over the years. It is one of those ideas that is good in principle but very difficult to put into practice. Part of the problem is the sheer weight of habit, part is fear of the unknown, part is the heavy lifting required to change the contours of massive programs. Changing what Washington does is hard work, just as changing what the states do is.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The creation of the U.S. Department of Education in 1978 by Jimmy Carter is a case in point; it was a major Democratic campaign promise to the NEA, but Carter could barely marshal the votes to get the bill out of the House of Representatives. It was a "ho-hum" issue in Congress, eliciting only weak support and unenthusiastic opposition. Undoing the department falls in the same category, as President Reagan discovered to his chagrin: He couldn't find an author to carry his promised legislation to abolish the department in his first term in office.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In any case, the real strength of "new federalism" will depend precisely on the extent to which its practitioners prefer it to the old federalism. And the assembled governors gave every indication that they will actually welcome it. Time will tell.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A second noteworthy point is that the summit was not dominated by the otherwise ubiquitous special interests. True, many of the resource people were members of the special-interest crowd; the AFT's Al Shanker and NEA President Keith Geiger were both there, but they were among a silent throng at the back of the hall.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In an era overwhelmingly dominated by politics--indeed, in an era in which "politics" has become a dirty word -- it is hard to overestimate the importance of the simple fact that the summit was the product of private, not public, interest. That may account for the relative isolation of the special-interest groups at the summit itself. Ironically, there was concern in some conservative circles that the summit was no more than a new generation of "robber barons" working their will on a malleable and hapless populace. Perhaps, but a more realistic analysis is to take Gerstner of IBM and his fellow CEOs at face value. They are genuinely worried about the future of America and are convinced that, left to their own devices, schools will not spontaneously reform. If not CEO pressure, then whose?  If not now, when?  To suspect them of sinister motives is a bit much, particularly when their professed motives are manifestly reasonable. Parents, whose children have the most to lose in a failing educational system, need their help and should enlist them as allies.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fact is that CEOs are interested parties, not parties-at-interest, and they come as close to being disinterested as any reformers can. They are the ultimate consumers of the schools' product and have a real stake in school performance. Equally important, they don't want problems; they want solutions and have no desire to tell anyone how to do it or what to do. They just want results. The CEO point of view is captured in David Kearns's comment when he was head of Xerox before joining the U.S. Department of Education as former Secretary Lamar Alexander's Deputy Secretary: "If the schools educate, business will train."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>MANY A SLIP BETWIXT CUP AND LIP</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What is the ostensible and what is the likely outcome of the summit?  In this case, they are likely to be the same. There is actually reason to believe that something will happen as a result of the summit. No one in America is more results-oriented than CEOs; they are serious, and about this they mean business. The governors too; they are now in it so deep that it would be hard to pull back. Indeed, the issue is not withdrawing, but just what it is they will do and when they will do it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The communiqu produced by the summit was reasonably clear about the next step: the creation by the governors of a national--not federal--clearinghouse (or "war room," as Governor Thompson called it) that would be going full-bore within two years. Designed to serve the states, it would keep everyone up to date on standards, but its more important function would be to set the stage for meaningful comparisons among states. Then we -- and the governors--would know who is "world-class" and who is not. Discussions about the clearinghouse have already begun; to be sure, there are numerous practical decisions to be made, not least who will pay for it and will "it" be a new or existing organization?  While logic would suggest that an existing organization should assume that role, candidates are not so obvious as they might at first appear.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most logical is the Education Commission of the States (ECS), created three decades ago by then North Carolina Governor Terry Sanford and James Bryant Conant, former Harvard president and author of <i>The American High School Today</i>. ECS's mission was to keep Washington at bay, a task at which, to no one's surprise, it failed utterly. A sort of <i>estates general</i>, its membership included governors, chief state school officers, state legislators, and sundry interested citizens. ECS quickly became a part of the establishment and today is a flaccid institution. If ECS was too broadly conceived to maintain any focus, the National Governors' Association (NGA) suffers from the opposite problem.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In any case, the summiteers seemed to have no interest in passing the standards baton to either ECS or NGA. In the closing comments at least, the governors asserted their interest in a wholly new organization, one that would exist for the sole purpose of promulgating standards and comparisons. Time will tell.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the communiqu did not call for a state "wall chart," it is hard to imagine state comparisons without one, and we may soon witness states actually participating in comparisons, the one with the other.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>THE DOG THAT DIDN'T BARK</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What was missing at the summit?  Ironically, two points of view were virtually absent. One is the national (not federal) perspective that Diane Ravitch, a sensible conservative reformer, ably represents. In her post-summit wrap-up, she laments the absence of this view. Who needs fifty sets of standards?  Diane asks. Who indeed?  For better or worse, it is my strongly held view that we do need state, even local, standards and that the issue of "fifty standards" is moot. We will not have Nevada math and Maryland math, Oregon English and Florida English; Americans in each state and locality will quite naturally gravitate to similar standards, and insofar as differences may emerge, they will probably emerge for good reason.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The real danger of national (not federal) or state (not local) standards is that they will be forced to a lowest common denominator by political pressures. True, the absence of national or state standards would permit lackadaisical school districts to continue in their feckless manner, but the presence of high standards in neighboring districts will have a salutary effect. It may put some starch in slackers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Be that as it may, the most important point of view not represented at the summit (except in a brief reference by Lynn Cheney) was old-fashioned localism or, as it is characterized in education circles, local control. That governors and CEOs would not be naturally drawn to this point of view is no surprise; modern CEOs are as likely to think in global as local terms, and governors by virtue of their jobs, think in statewide terms. This is not to say that either is opposed to local control, just that the terms of the discussion were cast as state-level concerns.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To be sure, there is a powerful statewide dimension; in all the states, education is a state constitutional responsibility, and education typically consumes more than half the state budget. Only in a few outliers like New Hampshire is the state role tiny; less than ten percent of New Hampshire's education spending comes from state sources. At the other end of the scale is Hawaii, the nation's only statewide school system (though, thanks to the interaction effects between Proposition 13 and the <i>Serrano</i> school finance case, California is virtually a statewide system). Even in these situations, however, education is quintessentially a school-based (even schoolroom-based) enterprise, and the role of the state in standard setting should be approached with the utmost circumspection. The obvious danger is standardization, a fate to be avoided at all costs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts and school buildings must be on the front lines of standard setting for several reasons, not least because they must live with them. Governors, chief state school officers, and state legislators have an understandable interest in setting standards, but they should resist the temptation to impose them on school districts. Standards cannot be parachuted in; schools must "own" them if they are to have any lasting effect. Equally important, the process of setting standards at the local level is a powerful trainer and community builder. If teachers and parents are involved in setting standards from the beginning, they both learn about them and support them. Knowing what they are and how they are to be put in place lends reality to the idea that standards will have consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The most powerful and useful role for the state will be in developing standards "advisories": model standards, templates even, for local school districts to use as they engage in the standard setting process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The logic of local standard setting is not "let a thousand flowers bloom," though there will be some of that. The logic is ownership, because as each community works through the standard setting process, each community's standards will be substantially like each other's. So too, each state's set of "advisories" will be like every other's. There are two reasons for this. First, there exists among Americans a high degree of social consensus about what young people should know and be able to do. For example, most Americans would agree that to earn a diploma, all students should be able to read and understand a news story in a national news magazine, a national newspaper, and their local paper. They should be able to count and compute; understand plane geometry and algebra; read, write, and speak standard American English; and so on.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There will be differences, to be sure. The citizens of Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example, may want their graduates to know solid geometry and trigonometry, not just algebra. The citizens of Seattle, Washington, may want their graduates to master marine biology and vulcanology, while their counterparts in Arizona may be more interested in desert ecosystems. Citizens in Texas will want graduates to know Texas history and geography to a level of detail that other communities will not. And so on. So much the better. This is not a difference to be ignored or suppressed, but one that should be applauded.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, even insofar as there are regional differences in subjects like history and literature, the foundations are much the same. A high standard requiring mastery of historical material and methodology can be satisfied using very different content. The study of literature is made richer and more rewarding by attending to local writers. So too with science standards. It would be altogether sensible for each area of the country to emphasize its strengths; Arizonans might master the scientific method and meet high science standards by emphasizing Canyon geology and water erosion, just as residents around the Great Lakes might emphasize the impact of glaciation. Finally, there is no California algebra or Illinois chemistry.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>TEACHING TO THE TEST</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the assessment and consequences parts of the standards agenda are attended to with enthusiasm, the issue of who sets the standards is less important than who asks the test questions. Ultimately, that is what standards are all about. If the tests and measures are carefully crafted and calibrated, they will do a world of good, for the assessments actually set the standard. Indeed, that is what the old bromide about "teaching to the test" is all about: If it is a bad test, so much the worse; if it is a good test, so much the better. One way to think about it is this: The test is the interrogatory form of the standard; the statement of the standard is the declarative form. What this means in practice is that the test must be a solid instrument, because many people--employers, school board members, taxpayers, students, teachers--will come to rely on it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The questions must seek and measure "world-class" knowledge and skills, and they must do so in a world-class way. Which is to say, the tests must de-emphasize the true-and-false, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blanks format. The only reason for such a format is low-cost, high-speed scoring -- administrative convenience. It is noteworthy that adults are not tested this way in the real world. The tests we must meet are performance-based: Do we measure up?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Schools--and the institutions that test them and their students--will need to reintroduce the written and spoken word: essays, declamations, auditions, performances. Again, that is how we are measured after school. School measures should be no different.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>BENCHMARKING</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The issue of assessment raises the most important aspect of standards--seeing that they are met, holding people accountable. To do this sensibly requires tests and measures that are reliable. Put simply, standards and the tests used to measure them must permit comparisons, both among schools in a district and among districts in a state as well as among schools in different states and between states. Governors must be able to boast (or complain) about their states' academic standings as readily as they do state university football scores. Without the capacity to compare each other with some precision, the whole standard setting exercise will be worse than moot; it will be an exercise in futility.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Interestingly, the German Republic provides an example of this in action. A federal system, the German states, or <i>Lnder</i>, are entirely free of federal control, and federal funding as well. Like their American counterparts, who have a Council of Chief State School Officers housed in Washington, D.C., the Germans have a similar council housed in Bonn (soon to move to Berlin). But there the similarity ends. The German council meets and confers to keep the national government at arm's length; they will not tolerate national intrusion in <i>Land</i> affairs. At the same time, the German council members use their forum to compare themselves to each other, which they do with gusto. America's governors can--and should-- take a page from the German book. At the turn of the old century, we borrowed <i>kindergarten</i> from the Germans; as the new century approaches, it is time for another learned borrowing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What remains is for the governors to push hard on the assessment front. Their task, difficult but within reach, is to see that state assessments permit both intrastate and interstate comparisons. Without the capacity to do so, standard setting will be for naught. Ironically, the place for them to turn is the federal government and the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). Overseen by the National Assessment Governing Board, the operation has gained the respect of most observers of the passing scene. It has been genuinely bipartisan, and its members have acted responsibly and prudently. The NAEP is almost all we have to go on as a nation, and it would be wise both to strengthen it--for national-level data and analysis--and to permit states and school districts to tap into the data stream so they can learn more about themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, that is the crux of the matter: When schools and school districts want to learn more about themselves, when they actively want to know how they compare where they are strong as well as weak, then the momentum for change will grow. Whether or not the summit will ignite that spark remains to be seen.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GRASSROOTS REFORMERS?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the final analysis, the summit was wonderful theater, but the heavy lifting of school reform remains to be done. Who will do it and where will the work be carried out?  It will be accomplished school-by-school, district-by-district, by involved citizens. They will make it happen. To be involved, they must know what is going on and what needs to be done. First, citizens across the country should welcome CEO and gubernatorial interest; it is genuine and may even be useful. Certainly, governors like Thompson, Romer, and Engler, who were central to the summit planning process, are serious about reform. So too were the CEOs. And while their perspectives will differ to some degree, all will respond to citizen interest and activity.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are three things that should happen at the grass roots, then. Citizens everywhere should take the pledge to support:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
High academic standards;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Realistic tests and measures to see that students are meeting those standards; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Consequences.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What does this mean in practice?  Standards must be set and met locally. The state is not much better than Uncle Sam when it comes to local control. Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty as regards both the state and federal governments. To be sure, states can play a more constructive role than Washington, but they should not engage in a command-and-control relationship with local school districts. It is not only bad politics; it is worse pedagogy. The freer schools are to do their own thing, the better off they are. Standards templates, or advisories, can be designed at the state level and made available to local districts but should not be imposed on them. If the standards are realistic and useful, local districts will flock to them. If they are not, they will not. And properly so. So too with tests and measures. To see that the standards are met, school districts must adopt tests that fit their standards.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this connection, there are two interlocking issues. Local districts should adopt tests that are consistent with the standards they have adopted. Not every district will want to (or be able to) design and adopt tests unique to it. In this case, the state can offer technical assistance and advice but should not impose its will on local districts. Again, to do so would be bad politics and worse pedagogy. The state does, however, have a reasonable and proper interest in knowing how much its students know, and should support statewide testing to provide both state and district information. Such tests should be developed cooperatively with local schools, but should permit the governor to brag about the state's overall performance. Without such information, the cause of school reform will falter and eventually founder. And the information--once it is available -- will be invaluable to local schools. If anything, they need it more than the state does. No business could do without high-quality performance data, and schools are no exception to this general rule.

There is one final note that everyone must attend to, and that is the one issue that was not on the table at the summit: <i>education choice</i>. Its absence was duly noted by several governors in attendance, but the ground rules made it impossible to bring it up. No such ground rule works at the local level. Bring choice up, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is crucial to the standards debate. Indeed, without choice the standards debate is almost sure to become an empty exercise. There is simply no reason to believe that every school in every district in every state will hold itself to the same high standards; it can't be done politically, and it can't be done logistically, at least not in the next two decades. Only highly centralized school systems like those of France and Japan even attempt such an approach, and it is not clear that it works in those countries. And the American commitment to local control rules out any centralized solution.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>THE BLESSINGS OF THE MARKET</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The alternative to command and control is a market, whether it is purely private, as many of us would like it to be, or regulated, a mix of public and private providers. Markets have two overwhelmingly important characteristics. First, they are exquisitely calibrated communications systems, letting willing buyers and sellers know what good or service is available at what price in what quantity and quality, and letting each know what the other would like; second, as Schumpeter declared, they permit "creative destruction."  Inefficient, corrupt, and ineffectual organizations disappear. That's what markets are all about. That is why in a market the consumer is sovereign. That is why cost doesn't determine price.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To create a system of high academic standards, and schools which are safe and disciplined, there must be choice among schools. Schools themselves must be able to choose to have high standards and to deliver on them. Just so, parents and students must be able to select schools that measure up and select out of those that do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Attempting to push standards down from the top will not work any better than the endless skein of failed reforms that already litter the education landscape. But double-joining standards and choice can work. Indeed, it is the last, best hope of school reform.

America's students still are not performing at a satisfactory level, and Americans are not getting a solid return on the investment of their tax dollars in the nation's schools, according to the latest assessment of achievement. After 15 years and $328 billion in federal spending, the U.S. <a href="http://www.ed.gov">Department of Education</a> is contributing little, if anything at all, to student success in reading.<sup>1</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The recently released findings from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) final 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States show most of America's students are not meeting a proficient achievement level in reading.<sup>2</sup>  The 1994 NAEP reading examination is the nation's report card in reading. The 1994 test was administered to nearly 140,000 students in public and private schools nationwide.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The NAEP report reveals student reading and comprehension achievement levels in grades 4, 8, and 12 between 1992 and 1994, as well as achievement levels within various subgroups of the student population. The report uses three achievement levels to rank the results: basic, proficient, and advanced.<sup>3</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While 4th and 8th grade students showed slight declines in performance, there was a significant decline in the reading performance of students in grade 12 (see <a href="fyi94c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Between 1992 and 1994, notes the report:
<p><ul>
<li> There was a significant decline in the proportion of twelfth graders <I>at or above</I> the proficient level;<p>
<li> There was also a significant decline in the proportion of twelfth graders <I>at or above</I> the basic level; and<p>
<li> There was a significant increase in the percentage of twelfth graders performing <I>below</I> the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Regionally, the results were equally discouraging. According to the report:
<p><ul>
<li> Every region (Northeast, Southeast, Central, and West) had significant declines in the number of twelfth grade students achieving <I>at or above</I> the proficient level; and<p>
<li> Every region had an increase in the number of twelfth grade students achieving <I>below</I> the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1994 NAEP final report also accounted for the reading performance of six population subgroups: white, black, Hispanic, Asian, Pacific Islander and American Indian.<sup>4</sup>  Consistent with previous NAEP reports, there were large differences in performance by race and ethnic subgroups (see <a href="fyi94c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). In nearly every ethnic and racial subgroup there were significant declines in reading performance. While there were significant decreases in the reading performance levels for white, black and Hispanic twelfth grade students, white students had the largest decreases. Fewer white twelfth graders in 1994 achieved at least <I>the basic level of reading performance</I> than achieved that level in 1992.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Breaking down student performance by gender, the 1994 NAEP results show that female students generally outperformed male students in all three grade levels (see <a href="fyi94c4.gif">Chart 4</a>). According to the report: 
<p><ul>
<li> Between 1992 and 1994, there was a significant decrease in the percentage of twelfth grade males <I>at or above</I> both the proficient and basic levels. There was also a significant decrease in the percentage of twelfth grade females <I>at or above</I> the basic level. There was also a significant increase in the number of male and female twelfth graders who performed at or below the basic level.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps the most discouraging results are the differences in the performance levels between poor students participating in the Title I program, the Federal Education for the Disadvantaged program "(formerly called Chapter One)," and non-Title I participating students (see <a href="fyi94c5.gif">Chart 5</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Although there were no corresponding data on Title I participation for 1992, the 1994 results show that the low-income students enrolled in the Title I program are being left behind the rest of America's students. According to the report:
<p><ul>
<li> Across all three grade levels, of those students participating in the Title I program, there were significantly fewer students performing <I>at or above each of the reading achievement levels.</I> 
<p>
<li> Of all students performing <I>at the below basic level</I>, Title I students are performing below the basic level at a larger proportion than non-Title I students. The percentages of Title I students who performed <I>below basic</I> ranged from 59 percent at twelfth grade to 80 percent at fourth grade.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Clinton's Secretary of Education, <a href="http://www.ed.gov/PressReleases/04-1995/naepwrd.html">Richard W. Riley</a>, argues that congressional efforts to dismantle the existing federal bureaucracy and channel funds back to the states, localities, teachers and parents would set back efforts to improve education.<sup>6</sup>  The results of the 1994 NAEP reading examination are yet another indicator that the current approach to education is not working. More money, more bureaucracy, more regulation, and more federal intrusion clearly are not improving America's academic performance.

<h2>Our Foundering Fathers</h2>
<P>
<B>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</B> 
<P>
<B>Are You a Sperm Dad?</B> 
<P>
Perhaps the most important book written this decade on our greatest
social crisis is <I>Fatherless America: Confronting Our Most Urgent
Social Problem</I>, by New York intellectual David Blankenhorn.
The president of the Institute of American Values, Blankenhorn
dissects the insidious and prevalent bias against the value of
fatherhood in both elite and popular culture. In this impassioned
yet carefully reasoned and researched book, he argues that being
a father is &quot;society's most important role for men.&quot;
<P>
While mothers typically concentrate on meeting children's immediate
physical and emotional needs, Blankenhorn writes, fathers tend
to &quot;focus on preparation for the future and on children's
success in the larger society. Fathers are likely to devote special
attention to character traits necessary for the future, especially
qualities such as independence, self-reliance, and the willingness
to test limits and take risks.&quot;
<P>
Moreover, Blankenhorn writes, a proper view of fatherhood is essential
to the concept of masculinity. &quot;Fatherhood cannot destroy
or oppose masculinity, but fatherhood must domesticate masculinity.
In a good society, men prove their manhood by being good fathers.&quot;
But many journalists, academics, and purveyors of popular culture
are writing a new &quot;cultural script&quot;-new definitions
of what it means to be a man-that fails to serve the needs of
children, families, or society. Here are some of the inadequate
roles available to today's dads:
<P>
The Unnecessary Father. &quot;He may be useful in some ways. He
may be a nice guy, perhaps even a force for good. But he is nonessential,
peripheral, 'not that important.' His presence may be appreciated,
but it is not required.&quot;
<P>
The Visiting Father. This poor chump writes the checks and strives
valiantly to stay in touch with his children after a divorce.
Although often romanticized, as in the popular <I>movie Mrs. Doubtfire</I>,
&quot;the great majority of visiting fathers are not-indeed, cannot
be-good-enough fathers to their children,&quot; Blankenhorn writes.
<P>
The Sperm Father. He accounts for nearly 30 percent of all fathers
of young children. &quot;His is the fatherhood of the one-night
stand, the favor for a friend, the donation or sale of sperm.
His child is the unintended consequence, the result of the affair
that did not work out, the reason for the paternity suit, the
baby he never learned about.&quot;
<P>
The Stepfather and the Nearby Guy. Rosy assumptions to the contrary,
&quot;children who live with stepfathers experience outcomes that
are no better, and frequently worse, than children in mother-only
homes.&quot; The Nearby Guy (a coach, a teacher, the mother's
boyfriend) provides not fathering but often &quot;ambiguity, complexity,
and frequent change.&quot;
<P>
The New Father. &quot;He expresses his emotions. He is a healer,
a companion, a colleague, He is a deeply involved parent. He changes
diapers, gets up at 2 a.m. to feed the baby, goes beyond 'helping
out' in order to share equally in the work, joys, and responsibilities
of domestic life.&quot; How can you hate this guy? Blankenhorn
doesn't fault dads who change diapers, but he insists that this
is not their most important contribution.
<P>
In contrast to this cast of losers, Blankenhorn holds up the Good
Family Man. He &quot;puts his family first. He is responsible
for them. He sacrifices for them&quot; to help prepare them for
life in the real world. Sure, this guy also helps his wife care
for the children and pitches in with household duties, but he
views his role as complementary, not identical, to that of his
spouse. This distinction is vital to the masculinity of men and
to the future of fatherhood.
<P>
That's why, Blankenhorn says, it is crucial that society provide
men with the right cultural script, because successful fathering
depends more on societal codes of conduct than on biology. If
we get those codes wrong, we'll see &quot;the continuing decline
of fatherhood and a deepening ambivalence and skepticism toward
masculinity.&quot; We must get them right, because &quot;fatherhood,
more than any other male activity, helps men to become good men.&quot;
<P>
<B>Your Man-Frog or Prince?</B> 
<P>
If you want to be a good father, the single most important thing
you can do is to be a good husband. In a landmark study of marriage
and parenting styles, Jay Belsky, professor in the Department
of Human Development and Family Studies at Pennsylvania State
University, has found that men whose marriages were in decline
tended to exhibit parenting traits that undermine child development.
<P>
&quot;Men appear much less likely than women to distinguish between
their feelings about their child and their feelings about the
marriage,&quot; writes Belsky in <I>The Transition to Parenthood:
How a First Child Changes a Marriage; Why Some Couples Grow Closer
and Others Apart</I>. (The book, by Belsky and John Kelly, is
available in paperback from Dell.) &quot;If a man is dissatisfied
with the latter, he will usually stay away from his family, even
if it means sacrificing the opportunity to get to know and form
a close bond with his youngster.&quot;
<P>
Sadly, it seems marriages tend to be most vulnerable just when
they need to be strongest-when children are very young. Belsky
found that when children entered the picture, a little over half
of all marriages declined. Only 20 percent of couples thought
their marriages improved, and the remaining 30 percent of couples
found their level of marital satisfaction to be about the same.
Research by the National Center for Fathering also shows a &quot;U-pattern&quot;
of marital satisfaction. It is high before the birth of the first
child, declines when children are young, and tends to rise again
as the children grow older and leave home.
<P>
Belsky writes that a major area of marital discord is the division
of responsibility for child care and housekeeping. Babies are
a lot of work, and the mother generally finds she bears most of
the burden-by choice or by default. Because a woman will tend
to measure her husband's share in domestic duties against her
own (she typically does three times more than he does), that perception
of unfairness breeds resentment. But men measure their contribution
(which averages 15 or 16 hours a week) against what their fathers
did. By this yardstick, husbands today are doing 40 percent more
household work than men did a generation before. Also, she tends
to downplay his contributions as a breadwinner; he regards them
more highly. By his calculations, he's a prince; by hers, he's
a frog.
<P>
The arrival of children provokes spousal conflict in other areas
as well, Belsky writes, including money, work, social life, and
commitment to the relationship. Obviously, those who would counsel
couples in their transition to parenthood must urge them to address
unrealistic expectations and conflict over gender roles. Discouraging
divorce is not enough; we must foster strong and loving marriages
that nurture the healthy development of children.

<h2>Leading the Fatherhood Brigade</h2>
<P>
Thousands of men gather in football stadiums around the country
to recommit themselves to their wives and children. Vice President
Albert Gore attends a national summit on fatherhood, with major
news media in tow, and chastises men for walking away from &quot;the
most important role that any of us will ever play in life.&quot;
Hundreds of thousands of African-American men convene in Washington,
D.C., to pledge responsibility to their families. Is fatherhood
making a comeback in the nation with the world's highest rate
of father absence? &quot;There's not a movement,&quot; says The
Reverend Donald Burwell of Fathers' Education Network in Detroit.
&quot;But I do think there is a fatherhood revival or Renaissance.&quot;
Whatever we call it, something is going on. In recent years, several
new groups dedicated to promoting fatherhood have sprouted, and
older organizations have reoriented their efforts to this cause.
Here are some of the leaders in the fatherhood field-a mix of
liberal and conservative, religious and secular-all united in
a belief that fathers are vital to their children's well-being.

<P>
 &quot;What reduces crime, child poverty, and teen pregnancy,
and requires no new taxes?&quot; asks the National Fatherhood
Initiative. The group's answer, of course, is good fathers. The
nonprofit organization was founded in 1993 to spread the &quot;news&quot;
that fathers are indispensable to their children's development.
<P>
Its goal is ambitious: broad cultural and social change. But it
has widespread support, savvy, creative and committed leadership,
and a national advisory board that includes William J. Bennett,
James Earl Jones, congressman Steve Largent, Willard Scott, Louis
Sullivan, and George Gallup. NFI's aggressive media outreach has
garnered more than 650 mentions in publications nationwide. With
backing from the Advertising Council, NFI will launch a blitz
public-service announcements this year to reintroduce fatherhood
as a vital concept.
<P>
NFI has become a nerve center for various fatherhood groups, sponsoring
national and local meetings. Last summer and fall, NFI chairman
David Blankenhorn led a &quot;National Fatherhood Tour&quot; to
30 cities to meet with community activists and promote the NFI
&quot;fatherhood pledge.&quot;
<P>
The organization plans an interfaith summit in Washington, D.C.,
in May, to convene various religious leaders-a more modest version
of its 1994 National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, which brought
together national and local religious, civic, business, and entertainment
leaders. Also in the works is a summit addressing the needs of
the African-American community, to be chaired by Louis Sullivan,
the secratary of health and human services under President George
Bush.
<P>
NFI president Don Eberly, a former top aide to Jack Kemp, is based
in the national office in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, while director
Wade Horn, a former U.S. Commissioner of Children, Youth, and
Families, works out of Gaithersburg, Maryland. Originally conceived
as a public-education campaign, NFI has also become a membership
organization in response to popular demand. Membership benefits
include a quarterly newsletter, a media kit, a guide for community
activists, and a catalog of fatherhood-related books and videos.
With three full-time and three part-time staff members and a budget
of about $600,000, the institute's challenge now is to find the
funding to carry out its many ambitious initiatives.

Considered one of the leaders in the field, the National Center
for Fathering is a Kansas-based nonprofit organization that trains
individuals in the fundamentals of fatherhood. Founded in 1990
by scholar Ken Canfield, the center holds seminars based on Canfield's
<I>The Seven Secrets of Effective Fathers</I> (available from
NCF in paperback and as an audiocassette or a video seminar).&quot;Where
National Fatherhood Initiative is the strategic bomber of the
fatherhood movement, we are the infantrymen in the trenches,&quot;
says NCF spokesman David Warnick. With a budget of $560,000 and
10 full-time staff members, NCF runs programs for fathers from
all backgrounds, including corporate personnel, prisoners, military
dads, and inner-city fathers, and is actively involved in minority
outreach. More than 15,000 fathers around the country have participated
in its two-day training sessions.
<P>
Its national training program, &quot;Operation Domestic Shield,&quot;
is often disseminated through church networks, and Canfield works
as a trainer for the evangelical Christian group Promise Keepers.
But NCF prides itself on being a nonpartisan, nonsectarian organization,
working with everyone from California governor Pete Wilson to
Vice-President Al Gore.
<P>
The National Center for Fathering publishes a quarterly magazine,
<I>Today's Father: For Men Who Want To Be Better Dads</I>, which
contains parenting advice and lists of books and other resources,
and also produces a three-minute radio program carried on more
than 300 stations nationwide.

Although technically not a &quot;father&quot; group, this Christian
evangelical organization, founded by former University of Colorado
head football coach Bill McCartney, keeps popping up on the lists
of leaders in the fatherhood-renewal movement because it promotes
the building of strong marriages and families. It has been drawing
tens of thousands of men, for $55 a ticket, into sports arenas
from Seattle, Washington, to Washington, D.C., for two-day conferences
featuring Christian music and inspirational speakers. Men make
a series of promises to God, wife, family, friendships, church,
and community.
<P>
Headed by president Randy Phillips, Promise Keepers now has a
staff of 250 and a budget of $64 million, and its 1-800 number
averages 20,000 calls a day during its summer registration season.
Such success has alarmed some women's groups. In October 1995,
for instance, a <I>Glamour</I> magazine editorial referred to
Promise Keepers as &quot;among those who still think men can't
keep up unless women are kept down.&quot; In response, the group
contends that being a leader means being a servant to one's family,
not a tyrant.

On Father's Day last year, Vice President Al Gore announced a
new nongovernmental initiative to promote paternal involvement
through community-based mentoring programs. The goals and structure
of Father to Father are so ill-defined that it is difficult to
tell where this initiative is going, but Gore's high-profile support
will bring welcome attention to the issue. This loose federation,
under the direction of Martha Farrell Erickson of the Children,
Youth and Family Consortium at the University of Minnesota, offers
kits to communities and organizations that want to reach out to
fathers, providing lists of resources and strategies for starting
their own mentoring group.
<P>
An electronic version of this effort is called FatherNet, a free

information and resources about and for fathers.

Under the mantle of the liberal Families and Work Institute since
1989, the Fatherhood Project was founded in 1981 by director James
A. Levine as a national research and education program to increase
male involvement in childrearing.
<P>
Programs include the Male Involvement Project, directed by Edward
W. Pitt, which works with Head Start and other early childhood
and family support programs. The MIP sponsors community-based
social programs in Baltimore, Minneapolis, and the San Francisco
Bay area, and a national training program for early-childhood
administrators such as pre-school directors. Publications include
<I>Getting Men Involved: Strategies for Early Childhood Programs</I>
and <I>New Expectations: Community Strategies for Responsible
Fatherhood</I>. The Fatherhood Project also oversees a program
called Fathers and Work, which promotes family-friendly workplaces
and presents seminars on how to deal with &quot;daddy stress.&quot;
<P>
A caveat: Critics argue that the project's emphasis on separating
men from the role of breadwinner could inadvertently erode paternal
involvement and provision. Some claim that directors Levine and
Pitt have bought into a feminist agenda that aims to turn fathers
into substitute moms.

Hailed as a &quot;modern-day prophet&quot; and a &quot;visionary&quot;
by others in fatherhood circles, Charles Augustus Ballard began
the institute 13 years ago to help young, directionless black
men in Cleveland, Ohio, become involved in their children's lives.
(See his article, &quot;Prodigal Dad: How We Bring Fathers Home
to Their Children,&quot; in the Winter 1995 <I>Policy Review</I>.)
Most fathers who have gone through Ballard's program finish high
school, get jobs, and legally establish their paternity.
<P>
Ballard's emphasis on reuniting fathers with their children--grounded
in thoroughly biblical themes of family and responsibility-has
appeal across the political spectrum. The institute's national
office is housed in the Joint Center for Political and Economic
Studies, a nonpartisan liberal think tank. His urban program got
a tremendous boost in early 1995 when the Ford Foundation gave
the group $2 million to reproduce its efforts nationally. The
institute has opened five new centers: in Milwaukee, Washington,
D.C., San Diego, Atlanta, and Yonkers, N.Y., each to be headed
by a married couple. The institute's strategy is to saturate one
blighted neighborhood at a time.
<P>
Some question whether a group headed by a single charismatic leader
can replicate and institutionalize its programs. We'll see: Each
new location will be headed by men and women who have been trained
by Ballard in Cleveland.

Six years ago, 18 African-American men in Omaha, Nebraska, decided
they would no longer tolerate gang violence and drug-dealing in
their neighborhoods. So they created M.A.D. D.A.D.S. (Men Against
Destruction-Defending Against Drugs and Social Disorder), a community-based
group that organizes street patrols, paints over gang graffiti,
confronts drug-dealers and gang members, sponsors activities for
youth such as block parties and car shows, and to counsels young
people in local jails.
<P>
&quot;We started out of pain-the pain of our children dying in
the streets of their own communities,&quot; says a recent M.A.D.
D.A.D.S. publication. &quot;We realized that we could hold no
one responsible but ourselves. . . . So we united as a handful
of community fathers who now know that we must be the force behind
change.&quot;
<P>
From this handful grew an organization of more than 25,000 volunteers,
with 41 chapters in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan,
Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.
<P>
The group has logged more than 87,000 volunteer hours on the streets-more
than half after midnight. For its work on the front lines of impoverished
minority communities, M.A.D. D.A.D.S. has won national recognition
from Presidents Bush and Clinton, the National Education Association,
and <I>Essence</I> magazine. Fathers who want to open a chapter
of M.A.D. D.A.D.S. in their community can contact the national
office in Omaha and ask for John Foster, Bishop Robert Tyler,
or Eddie Staton.

<br>
Can ex-cons be good dads? The Reverend Donald Burwell, whose organization
works with fathers newly returned from prison or first-time offenders
hoping to avoid jail time, has answered that question at least
5,000 times. Since 1990, that's how many men his Detroit-based
group has trained in the interpersonal skills they need to reconnect
with their families. In the process, the organization has cut
recidivism rates in half for its participants. FEN also offers
instruction to women to help them reinforce at home what their
husbands or boyfriends have learned in class.
<P>
A tax-exempt nonprofit funded solely by donations, FEN will soon
be taking Burwell's innovative curriculum to four new locations
in Michigan, and opening branches in Chicago, Brownsville, Texas,
and near Memphis, Tennessee.

<title> Speaking for Hong Kong-- Heritage</title>

<b>Heritage Lecture No. 563</b>

<hr>
<p>
<b>By The Rt. Hon. Christopher Patten</b></p> 
<p>
Given May 7, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong is very fortunate to have so many friends and well-wishers in the United States. Over the next 14 months and beyond, Hong Kong is going to need its friends in the United States and elsewhere. Hong Kong needs the understanding and the support of the United States as it progresses through the most testing period of its history, the final months before July 1, 1997, and the transfer of sovereignty to the People's Republic of China. I have come to Washington this week to talk to our friends about an issue which is crucial to Hong Kong's ongoing economic and social success. As you all know, I have come to Washington to put Hong Kong's case--let me repeat that--Hong Kong's case for the renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I want to make this point absolutely clear right at the start. I have not traveled to Washington to speak on behalf of the People's Republic of China. It is not for me to put China's case for the renewal of MFN status. Nor is it for me to defend China's record on human rights, on arms proliferation, or its trade practices. These are matters which Chinese officials must address, not the Governor of Hong Kong.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am not saying that Hong Kong has no view on these issues. On the contrary, Hong Kong has very strong opinions about human rights and about free and fair trade. Our record as a pluralist society based on the rule of law and our record as probably the most open economy in the world tells you all you need to know about where we stand on these issues. My task today and during the rest of my visit to the United States is to speak for Hong Kong, to put, as I have said, Hong Kong's case for MFN renewal, and I shall do so with all the force that I can command.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I shall be putting two arguments to everyone I meet. The first is an argument for the preservation of a fundamental trade principle. The second is an argument for the preservation of jobs and livelihoods in Hong Kong. Let me start with principles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Round about the turn of the last century, the Patten family, my forbears, decided it had a principled position on the pressing issue of poverty. They did not like it, so they left Ireland and set off for Manchester. Now Manchester, during the last century, was the epicenter of a free trade earthquake which shook protectionism everywhere. Manchester was so committed, some might say obsessed, with free trade as a political issue that it named its principal place of public assembly the Free Trade Hall. This is the only example that I know where a city named one of its public buildings for a proposition from economic theory. That is, of course, unless I missed the opening of the Milton Friedman "Tight Money" concert hall in Chicago recently.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Manchester won the free trade argument, and, as a result, the first great free trade revolution occurred after 1846 under British leadership. During the following 30 years, international trade increased by more than 300 percent. History repeated itself and the second great revolution in free trade occurred exactly a century later. This revolution took place under American leadership and started in 1946. Again, the value of international trade increased by more than 300 percent in the following 30 years. It was the United States which made this 20th century expansion of trade and prosperity possible. The United States provided the world with unstinting aid directly and through almost every multilateral organization. The United States also provided resources and incentives to emerging economies in Asia and elsewhere and kept its huge market open to the export products of these economies. At the same time, American business invested enormous amounts of capital in the reconstruction of Europe and Japan and in developing economics everywhere, but particularly in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic, social, and political consequences of this American free trade leadership have been profound. You need look no further than Hong Kong to understand what it has meant.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong has enjoyed 35 years of unbroken economic growth. During this time, our per capita GDP has increased by 530 percent so that we are now on a par with Canada and much of Western Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong has put its growing prosperity to good use. We provide tertiary education places for 24 percent of each generation of students--up from about 3 percent 10 years ago. Our health care standards are now fast approaching the standards of Western Europe and North America--and some of our health indicators are actually better. We have invested in our people and invested heavily in our infrastructure.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, hard work and a high savings ratio have been important. But it was free trade-- access to the United States market in the post-war years--which gave Hong Kong, and many of our neighbors in Asia, their big break. Without the liberal trading environment created under the GATT and now continuing under the World Trade Organization, there would have been no German, Japanese or, more recently, Southeast Asian economic miracles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What has been true of the past 50 years will, I think, be true of the next 50 years. American leadership will be as vital in maintaining the momentum of free trade during the first half of the 21st century as it has been during the second half of the 20th century. And a crucial test of this leadership is the one which most concerns Hong Kong. The issue can be simply stated: Can the United States and China establish and maintain a normal trading relationship?  I say normal trading relationship because, of course, MFN status is the international norm. The alternative is an abnormal trading relationship between the United States and China, and that, it seems, would be in no one's interests, certainly not Hong Kong's.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Let me make Hong Kong's position absolutely clear. We are not suggesting that the United States, or any other country which shares your and our values, should soft-pedal on the other major issues in the relationship with China. Human rights are at least as important as trade relations. Nor can there be any higher priority for all of us than controlling the spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nor can there be any doubt that trade practices must be fair or that intellectual property rights must be protected.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But I believe that MFN should be used as a key to achieve progress on all of these issues, not as a weapon. MFN status should be allowed its opportunity to facilitate progress on all of these issues. By contrast, I believe, withdrawal of MFN status would hinder, rather than promote, such progress. The policy of engagement adopted by the United States seems to me, and seems to the community for which I speak, to be the only policy which offers the possibility of making progress on the full range of issues in the U.S.-China relationship.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I said earlier that I wanted to preserve a principle and that I wanted to preserve Hong Kong jobs. This second argument for renewing China's MFN status is, to put it bluntly, a matter of special pleading. Hong Kong is now so closely integrated with the Chinese economy that anything which damages the relationship between the United States and China, our two largest trading partners, is certain to injure us. Specifically, if MFN is not renewed, Hong Kong stands to lose about 90,000 jobs and up to half of our forecast annual growth in GDP. I recognize that Hong Kong's economy is flexible and that we would recover from such a blow in time. But the blow would fall at a particularly difficult time for Hong Kong. It would come just as we are about to start the final year of the transition to Chinese sovereignty, at a time when Hong Kong is particularly vulnerable to shocks to confidence in its future and we can least afford a setback to our economic fortunes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There might be people here today who wish Hong Kong well on MFN, people who are concerned to give Hong Kong the best possible chance of making a success of its future as a Special Administrative Region of China, people who think that putting conditions on the renewal of China's MFN would in some way help Hong Kong to achieve this. I want to say to you in the clearest possible terms: Thanks, but no thanks. I am not aware of any community leader in Hong Kong who advocates anything other than renewal of China's MFN without conditions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The message I bring from Hong Kong on MFN is this: If you want to help Hong Kong, please listen to what we are saying on this crucial issue and saying unanimously. To any of our friends and supporters in Washington or elsewhere who are tempted by the idea of MFN conditions, I say to you on behalf of the whole community in Hong Kong that you will not help us by damaging our economy and damaging confidence in our future. The best way to help us is by renewing MFN and by continuing the policy of engagement towards China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I have not pointed and will not be pointing to the economic consequences for the United States of any deterioration in the trade relationship with China as a result of not renewing MFN or of attaching conditions. This is a matter for Americans, not for the Governor of Hong Kong. I will make only one tangential observation and leave it at that. I am no economist, and I do not claim to be an expert on the theory of comparative advantage and free trade. But I hope that I have got the basics right, perhaps because my family absorbed some of Manchester's free trade zeal, or perhaps just because I read Adam Smith. And the basics are that free trade is beneficial to those who practice it regardless of what others do. If I may paraphrase a 19th century French economist, to argue that the United States should be protectionist because other countries do not practice free trade is like saying that you should block up your harbors because other countries have rocky coasts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thomas Jefferson once said that no country was ever ruined by trade. He was right, but quite a few countries have been damaged by protectionism. The essential point I want to leave you with today, ladies and gentlemen, is that Hong Kong has lived and prospered by free trade. Please do not do anything to jeopardize Hong Kong's trade, Hong Kong's prosperity, or Hong Kong's future.

For the first time in 5,000 years of China's history, a Chinese people have directly elected their leader. This impressive exercise in democracy took place on March 23 in the Republic of China on Taiwan with the election of President Lee Teng-hui. Equally impressive, however, has been the pace of political evolution in the ROC that has transformed a one-party authoritarian system into a multi-party democracy. The direct popular re-election of President Lee was the capstone in a ten-year process of liberalizing national politics and developing democracy on Taiwan, and took place even as China was conducting a campaign of military intimidation against Taiwan. Democracy on Taiwan is of great political and strategic importance. Policymakers in Washington cannot ignore the reality of Taiwan's democracy when dealing with mainland China.

<p>

<b>The Road to Democracy on Taiwan</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since the ending of martial law in 1987 and the legalization of the Democratic Progressive Party, Taiwan's main opposition party, the democratic transformation of Taiwan has spread across the political landscape at the local, county, provincial, and national levels. In 1992, Taiwan held the first full election of its law-making body (the Legislative Yuan);<sup>1</sup> in December 1994, ROC citizens directly elected Taiwan's provincial governor for the first time. The growth of democracy also involved amending the constitution of the Republic of China in 1994 to allow for the direct election of the president.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Taiwan's democratic transformation culminated in a four-month span from December 2, 1995, when ROC citizens for the second time elected members to the Legislative Yuan, to March 23, 1996, when they went to the polls to elect their president directly for the first time.
<p>
<b>The March Election</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On March 23, 1996, over 10.7 million of Taiwan's 14.3 million eligible voters cast their ballots in the first direct, democratic election of the president of the Republic of China. Incumbent President Lee Teng-hui won re-election overwhelmingly, with 54 percent of the vote. Former political prisoner and Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Peng Ming-min came in a distant second with 21 percent of the vote, and New Party candidate Lin Yang-gang and independent Chen Li-an received under 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively. Winning 54 percent of the vote in a four-way race with 76 percent voter participation earned President Lee Teng-hui an overwhelming mandate to push forward his platform of greater "dignity, vitality, and grand development" for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although overshadowed by the presidential election, elections for the Third National Assembly also were held on March 23. In the National Assembly, the ROC institution charged with managing constitutional reform, the Kuomintang (KMT or Nationalist Party) maintained its slim majority with 54 percent of the 334 seats. The formerly independent seats were nearly equally divided between the DPP and the New Party, with slightly more going to the DPP. The DPP improved its representation in the assembly from 12.6 percent to 29.6 percent, while the New Party went from zero to 13.7 percent representation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
After the elections of December 1995 and March 1996, the KMT maintains a slim majority in both the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan and thus will have to form coalitions in order to conduct the business of government. In the National Assembly, Taiwan's constitutional democracy will have to deal with the political agenda of Taiwan's evolving loyal opposition. The DPP has campaigned for constitutional amendments to eliminate the National Assembly and the office of Taiwan's provincial governor. The KMT opposes these changes, but supports less drastic measures such as extending Legislative Yuan terms from three to four years.
<p>

<b>China's Missile Diplomacy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing could not have made the contrast between the two Chinese systems more clear. On one side was the PRC -- a communist, one-party, authoritarian state. On the other, a thriving democracy. The PRC threatened the ROC with three military exercises in the three weeks leading up to and during Taiwan's democratic election. The exercises interfered with international commerce and threatened investors' confidence in Taiwan. Almost daily, Beijing shrilly charged President Lee Teng-hui with using "false" democracy to establish a dictatorship on Taiwan. The Chinese also accused Lee of wanting to split Taiwan away from the motherland. Similarly, China warned the United States that it would pay a high price, more dear than in Korea and Vietnam, if it intervened in the Beijing-Taipei dispute -- China's internal affair. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
 Beijing's military intimidation proved ineffective and counterproductive. The elections took place as scheduled and Lee's margin of victory exceeded expectations. In fact, China's military exercises may have contributed greatly to Lee Teng-hui's overwhelming victory. Many analysts predicted that Lee would have difficulty winning a majority in a four-way race, especially given the good showing of the DPP and New Party in the Legislative Yuan election last December. Partly because of China's missile diplomacy, this turned out not to be the case.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing's use of force also failed to accomplish its international objective: to reconfirm to the world that Taiwan is China's internal affair in which the U.S. should not interfere. While the "one China" policy remains official U.S. policy, the PRC's show of force provoked joint resolutions from Congress that urged a stronger commitment to Taiwan's defense than even the former U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense Treaty allowed.<sup>2</sup>  That pressure from Congress almost certainly played a role in the Administration's decision to send two aircraft carriers to the vicinity of Taiwan to monitor Beijing's "war games."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing's military threats forced Washington to be less ambiguous in its commitments to Taiwan. Previously, the Clinton Administration had maintained that the use of military force to protect Taiwan would depend on circumstances and developments. The dispatch of two carrier battlegroups sent a less ambiguous message. It implied that the U.S. was prepared to use force to deter China from attacking Taiwan under current circumstances. In addition, Beijing's heavy-handed tactics soured China's image in the eyes of the American public and policymakers, making it more difficult for the U.S. to pursue its policy of "constructive engagement" with China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the March crisis, Beijing asserted its resolve to use force to keep Taiwan from declaring independence. The U.S. demonstrated its resolve to use force to deter China from attacking Taiwan. And Taiwan demonstrated its resolve to move forward with political liberalization, even in the face of Beijing's military threat. In this standoff Taipei was the clear winner, Beijing the clear loser, and Washington fell somewhere in between. Taiwan stood up to Beijing's threats, garnered favorable world-wide headlines, and elicited further demonstrations of support from the United States. By contrast, Beijing soured global public opinion with its irresponsible display of military force and provoked a stronger than expected military response from the United States. In Washington, the Congress and media pushed a reluctant Clinton Administration into a stronger position vis--vis China and Taiwan. 
<p>

<b> A New Strategic Environment</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now that the Taiwan elections are over, it is time for the U.S. to take stock of its positions and policies toward China and Taiwan. Ever since 1950, when President Truman sent the Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait at the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. has been part of a strategic triangle with the PRC and the ROC. For 46 years America's aim has been to prevent either the PRC or the ROC from using non-peaceful means to resolve the question of Taiwan's status. This triangular relationship survived near nuclear crises in the 1950s and changes in diplomatic recognition in the 1970s.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The rise of democracy on Taiwan changes this triangular relationship and forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance. Economic and political freedom on Taiwan amplify the lack of similar freedoms in China. Taiwan has proven that free enterprise and democracy are compatible with and desirable in a Chinese society. Taiwan's rapid progress leaves many Americans impatient for similarly rapid change on the mainland. For the U.S., democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking improved relations with China.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For China, democracy on Taiwan takes away Beijing's self-proclaimed ability to speak for the people of Taiwan. Beijing no longer is able to extend a hand of friendship to the people of Taiwan while slapping its leader in the face. It is increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people, while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese people who elected him.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Beijing fears democracy on Taiwan for several reasons. Democracy makes the government of Taiwan less predictable and harder to control, since it now must respond to the electorate's competing interests or be voted out of office. Democracy on Taiwan also increases the sympathy of the world's other advanced democracies for Taiwan. Moreover, Beijing fears democracy on Taiwan because it contrasts so strikingly with the leadership selection process on the mainland. In fact, it strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy. What if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative?  The answer no longer can be that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Taiwan, democracy is also of great strategic importance. Fifteen years from now, Taiwan's hostile neighbor will be economically and militarily capable of dominating it, and possibly conquering it. Democracy is more important to Taiwan's strategic defense than any weapon system it could acquire. It makes Taiwan much more likely to draw support from the U.S. and other developed democracies in the event of any real threat from the mainland.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the same time, though, democracy on Taiwan challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan. Reunification can take place only within a political system in which the government is responsive to the interests of the governed, not where the governed are beholden to the dictates of the government. By proving that democracy is possible and desirable in a Chinese society, Taiwan opens the door for Beijing to adopt such a system to protect the interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
<p>

<b>What Is At Stake</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At stake in the PRC-U.S.-ROC triangular relationship is peace and stability in Asia. American interests in this relationship range from freedom of navigation on the high seas, to control of nuclear technology and weapons of mass destruction, to the development of democracy and free enterprise in Chinese society, to access to the markets of America's sixth and seventh largest trading partners -- the PRC and the ROC, respectively. In order to best serve these interests, the U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<b><li>Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue.</b> For the Chinese themselves to resolve Taiwan issues, as posited in the 1972 Shanghai Communiqu, they must meet face to face to negotiate.<sup>3</sup>  Beijing suspended Taiwan's primary channel of communication with the mainland last July in response to Lee Teng-hui's visit to the U.S. Therefore, the U.S. should use its ability to communicate with Beijing to encourage Beijing and Taipei to restore this forum for the discussion of fundamental issues in cross-Strait relations.
<p.
<b><li>Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations.</b> Washington should lend its support to Taiwan's membership in international commercial and cultural organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank. When Taiwan meets the economic criteria for membership in the WTO, the U.S. should be prepared to exercise leadership in building international consensus for its entry, even in the face of China's determined opposition.
<P>
<b><li>Urge Beijing to allow Taiwan to play an appropriate role in the international system.</b> Beijing must work with Taiwan to evolve an appropriate role for Taiwan in the international system. Taiwan is a separate, autonomous, and prosperous region which can and should play a role in international affairs. Taiwan is simply too large and important as a trading nation for either Beijing or Washington to ignore. Beijing must accept this reality. All international economic and cultural organizations, whether they technically require sovereignty or not, should be mutually agreeable. The successful examples of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) should be followed to allow both Beijing and Taipei to participate in international organizations.
<p>
<b><li>Sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, especially strategic missile defense.</b> Washington should continue to sell arms of a defensive nature to Taiwan in accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Given recent threats from Beijing, the U.S. should assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile defense system.
<P>
<b><li>Avoid linking MFN and Taiwan issues.</b> Washington should carefully consider the unintended consequences of any actions taken against China, such as revoking most-favored-nation trade status or applying unilateral sanctions, as they may indirectly harm Taiwan and Hong Kong, not to mention U.S. workers and consumers. Many of the light industrial goods on which Taiwan's economic miracle rests are now produced on the mainland and exported through Hong Kong to the U.S. and other markets. Revoking MFN could cut Hong Kong's gross domestic product in half, deal a serious blow to Taiwan's economy, and jeopardize the 200,000 high-wage American jobs that depend on U.S. exports to China.
<p>
<b><li>Urge Taipei to avoid cross-Strait conflict and provocation.</b> Taipei must know that the U.S. wholeheartedly supports the efforts of the people of Taiwan to seek political and economic freedom and a greater role in world affairs. However, Taipei must understand that any unilateral action to determine the status of Taiwan, including a unilateral declaration of independence, is counter to the U.S. interest in peace and stability in Asia. Taipei must work with Washington and Beijing to ensure its security, and to protect its economic prosperity, by reasonably avoiding conflict and provocation.
<p>
<b><li>
Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement.</b> There is little chance of peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status if one party is negotiating with a gun pointed at its head. One possible way to defuse the tension could be for Taipei to pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time and for Beijing to respond by renouncing the use of force for that period of time. The U.S. could add credibility to a cross-Strait armistice agreement by endorsing it.
<p>
<b><li>
Engage in preventive diplomacy.</b> Beijing clearly misread the Taiwan electorate and miscalculated the international response toward China's missile diplomacy. To prevent such misunderstanding and miscalculation from occurring again, the U.S. must improve communication with Chinese leaders at the highest level. The U.S. should promptly and clearly inform Chinese leaders of the likely response Beijing's actions will provoke in a democracy where elected leaders must respond to constituent interests and public opinion. In Beijing a better understanding of America's democracy will help build stronger relations with the U.S. and the American people. Improved Sino-American relations are not only in the interest of China and the U.S., but of Taiwan as well.
</ul><p>


<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy. Despite a firestorm of military and rhetorical threats from Beijing, the electoral process in Taiwan functioned freely and fairly. Over 600 visiting journalists witnessed the triumph of democracy in Taiwan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election was truly an historic event. Leaders in Beijing, Taipei, and Washington now must assess the strategic implications of democracy on Taiwan. A new balance must be established in the PRC-U.S.-ROC triangular relationship. Central to a new equilibrium must be a new international role for the Republic of China. This role should comport with Taiwan's standing as an economic powerhouse and mature democracy. Also central to the new balance should be an increased dialogue allowing Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Strait to work out their differences. As they do so, both should accept not only the need for maintaining peace and stability, but also the fact that democracy now exists in the Republic of China on Taiwan.
<p>
<b>Endnotes:</b>
<p><ol>
<li>    The ROC's two parliamentary bodies are the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan. The National Assembly's primary function is to amend the ROC constitution, while the Legislative Yuan is the major law-making body.<p>
<li>    The U.S.-ROC Mutual Defense Treaty lapsed in 1980 after the U.S. normalized relations with Beijing.<p>
<li>     In the Shanghai Communiqu, the U.S. "acknowledge[d] that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China."  The U.S. did not "challenge that position," but urged for the "peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves."

<title>Warning to North Korea: Stop Provocations and Talk Peace With South Korea - Heritage</title>

<h3>WARNING TO NORTH KOREA: STOP PROVOCATIONS AND TALK PEACE WITH SOUTH KOREA</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/plunk.htm">Daryl M. Plunk</a><br>
Senior Fellow, Asian Studies Center<br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 273<br>
April 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
(Updating <I>Backgrounder Update</I> No. 236, "Clinton's Korea Policy Falls Short: A Call to Congressional Action," January 13, 1995, and Asian Studies Center <I>Backgrounder</I> No. 133, "The Clinton Nuclear Deal with Pyongyang: Road Map to Progress or Dead End Street?," November 4, 1994.)
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On three different occasions this past week, communist North Korea sent armed troops into the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), the border separating the North from South Korea. These provocative moves directly violate the 1953 Armistice Agreement signed at the end of the Korean War. They also raise questions about North Korea's intentions. At risk is not only the security of America's ally, the Republic of Korea, but the safety and security of 37,000 U.S. troops stationed on the Korean Peninsula. These hostile steps come at a time when the Clinton Administration continues its flawed policy of providing economic benefits to North Korea and improving political relations with its government in the absence of any improvement in relations between Pyongyang and Seoul.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

President Bill Clinton will visit South Korea on April 16. He will be stopping over on his way to the Japan summit to meet briefly with South Korean President Kim Young Sam. While on Cheju Island, off the peninsula's southwestern tip, President Clinton, in close coordination with President Kim, should make it clear to Pyongyang that unless North Korea takes immediate steps to reduce tensions, the U.S. will curtail its current policy of upgrading U.S.-North Korean relations and bolstering the North's failing economy.
<p>
<b>Pyongyang Attacks the Armistice</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

North Korea's recent military moves are a direct attack on the 1953 United Nations-brokered Armistice Agreement that ended hostilities of the Korean War. The Armistice established a Military Armistice Commission (MAC) to maintain the cease-fire, serve as a military channel of communication, and investigate violations of the Armistice. The MAC, too, is sanctioned by the United Nations. The Armistice also established the existing DMZ and the Joint Security Area (JSA) which straddles the border. The JSA is a small, circular compound where the MAC meetings and occasional North-South negotiations have taken place over the years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The North has taken steps to undermine the functions of the MAC. It refuses to attend scheduled MAC meetings, thus closing the only channel for military communication along the world's most heavily armed border. On April 4, Pyongyang declared that it "shall give up its duty, under the armistice agreement, concerning the maintenance and control of the military demarcation line and the DMZ."  The next day, several hundred heavily armed North Korean soldiers entered the North's side of the JSA and carried out what appeared to be combat training drills. Similar incursions took place on April 6 and 7. These actions are serious violations of the Armistice agreement. Each side is limited to only 35 troops in its sector. Another violation occurred when on April 7 North Korean troops carried rifles, machine guns, and mortars into the Joint Security Area. Soldiers in the JSA are restricted to sidearms only.
<P>
<b>The North's Quest for a Peace Treaty with the U.S.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Pyongyang openly admits that this deliberate destruction of the existing Armistice structure is aimed at a long-standing goal: convincing the U.S. to sign a bilateral peace treaty with the North. Pyongyang hopes that such a treaty would cut Seoul out of the military settlement and pave the way for the withdrawal of American forces from Korea. The Clinton Administration rightly insists that the U.S. will never sign such a deal. Since the U.S. fought in the Korean War under the U.N. banner, it should not be attempting to negotiate with North Korea on its own. The only sensible replacement of the existing structure is a peace treaty negotiated and signed by North and South Korean governments.
<p>
<b>U.S. Flexibility Encourages North Korean Belligerence</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The North has chosen this bold and provocative course of action because the Clinton Administration's Korea policy is weak and misguided. The foundation of Clinton's policy is the "Agreed Framework" of October 1994. Negotiated in an effort to stop the North's menacing nuclear weapons program, the Framework offered certain benefits to the North, including gradual improvement of trade and political ties with Washington, a $50 million-per-year fuel oil supply, and the construction of two nuclear reactors in the North worth about $5 billion. Washington is working with about a dozen allies to raise money to support the deal, but Seoul has pledged to pick up most of the tab. In return, the North agreed to freeze its current nuclear program, thus preventing it from amassing any more weapons-grade plutonium. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

However, the Clinton Administration backed down on its earlier insistence that Pyongyang immediately provide a full accounting of the plutonium it has produced. Inspection of its fuel storage sites, which the North is obligated to permit under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, has been delayed for years to come. In the meantime, the North may be constructing nuclear bombs secretly with the enriched fuel it currently possesses. Even the Clinton Administration admits that the U.S. has no way of detecting such a covert program. The North was pleased with the deal since it offers lucrative benefits yet allows it to keep its nuclear card. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Under the Agreed Framework, the North also promised to engage in dialogue with the South and make progress toward tension reduction. But Pyongyang has refused to do this. In fact, as the events of recent days indicate, tensions are as high as ever. The North's million-man army maintains its forward deployment. Its large stockpiles of chemical weapons are of grave concern to U.S. military commanders. The North has a growing missile arsenal which is capable of striking all parts of South Korea.
<p>
<b>Clinton's Agenda While in South Korea</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration's Korea policies have failed to protect America's interests on the Korean Peninsula: the reduction of military tension along the DMZ. The North's recent provocations are disturbing evidence not only of its contempt for the Armistice, but for Clinton's Framework agreement as well. While in South Korea on April 16, President Clinton should:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Express strong U.S. condemnation of the North's actions and reiterate Washington's commitment to the defense of South Korea.</b> The U.S. should bolster U.S. forces in South Korea with AWACS radar aircraft and temporarily deploy one more aircraft carrier to the 7th fleet in the Pacific. These additional forces are necessary to deter the North from undertaking real aggression against the South.
<p>
<li><b>Clearly state that the U.S. will never consider a bilateral peace treaty with the North.</b> President Clinton should remind the North that, in the Reconciliation Agreement ratified by the North and South in 1992, the two sides pledged to negotiate a North-South peace agreement. Clinton should demand that the North abide by this commitment.
<p>
<li><b>
Press Pyongyang for immediate initiation of substantive, high-level talks with Seoul.</b> The 1992 North-South Reconciliation Agreement is a detailed document outlining practical steps toward easing political and military tensions between the two sides and could serve as a blueprint for future dialogue. The North has refused to implement this agreement and instead has focused its efforts on improving its ties with the U.S.
<p>
<li><b>
Remind Pyongyang that the U.S.-North Korean nuclear accord explicitly links tension reduction with the political and economic benefits offered to the North.</b> President Clinton should warn Pyongyang that if it continues to violate both the spirit and letter of the Framework, it will put at risk further implementation of the Framework agreement.
<p>
<li><b>
Discuss with Seoul the appointment of a seasoned American negotiator as a special envoy to jump-start the tension reduction process.</b> A special envoy could seek regular contacts at the highest levels of Pyongyang's secretive and insular ruling elite. He could make clear to the North that the U.S. and South Korea will no longer tolerate the North's provocations. If this message is not hammered home to Pyongyang forcefully and regularly, the North will continue to underestimate America's resolve and misjudge its intentions.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Now that the Cold War is over, Pyongyang no longer has China and the Soviet Union standing in the wings prepared to back its military aggression. Nevertheless, apparently oblivious to this fact, North Korea is threatening the peace on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. needs to act now to send North Korea a message: stop the military provocation, live up to its agreements, and start talking peace with Seoul.

<title>Bill Clinton and Japan: Getting the Record Straight - Heritage</title>

<h3>BILL CLINTON AND JAPAN: GETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James J. Przystup</a><br>
 Director, Asian Studies Center<br>
<a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm"> Robert P. O'Quinn</a>, Policy Analyst<br>

F.Y.I. 95<br>
April 11, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
President Bill Clinton will visit Japan on April 16-18 to meet with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto. The major purpose of his trip will be to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance. Challenges now facing both the United States and Japan in Asia, from tensions on the Korean Peninsula to China's increasingly aggressive conduct toward Taiwan and in the South China Sea, make a reaffirmation both timely and necessary. It is even more necessary because for the better part of the Administration's first two years, Bill Clinton's Japan policy has put this critical relationship at risk.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration came into office committed to forging a new U.S.-Japan relationship. Its Japan policy, however, was based on a number of miscalculations. The first was that security issues could be de-emphasized in the U.S.-Japan relationship after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The second was the over-emphasis placed on reducing the bilateral trade deficit. Trade policy, originally viewed as but one part of an overall Japan strategy, quickly expanded in time and effort to become almost the entirety of the Administration's approach to Japan. In effect, Japan policy became an extension of the 1992 campaign theme, "Its the economy, Stupid."  Seeing Japan through a mid-1980s time warp as an immutable economic juggernaut, the Clinton team was committed to applying intense external pressure to get its way. The final miscalculation was that, in the post-Cold War world, this pressure could be applied with little collateral political damage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, the Administration was wrong across the board. Security in today's post-Soviet world remains important, as North Korea's quest for nuclear weaponry and China's aggressive behavior toward Taiwan have reminded Americans and Japanese alike. Moreover, Japan's economy was not immutable. By 1993, it was undergoing significant structural change, the result of a five-year recession brought on by the collapse of its wildly inflated late-1980s economy and a skyrocketing appreciation of its currency, the yen.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

While in Tokyo, President Clinton will try to take credit not only for improved U.S.-Japan economic relations -- in particular, the reduction of America's trade deficit with Japan -- but for the improving security relationship as well. This will be credit not deserved. After damaging U.S.-Japan relations with the threat of a trade war, the President saw his mistake and corrected course. Better late than never. But solving a problem which the President himself caused is hardly the best way to conduct foreign policy.
<p>
<b>ECONOMICS IN COMMAND</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration got off on the wrong foot early in dealing with the Japanese. Downplaying the U.S.-Japan Security Alliance, the Administration quickly placed economics and trade at the top of its agenda with Tokyo. The centerpiece of its strategy was its New Economic Framework, a combination of economic and trade policies hastily cobbled together in Tokyo in July 1993. In effect, the New Economic Framework was an attempt to manage trade with Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Through a series of negotiators the Clinton Administration attempted to pressure the Japanese government into accepting targets for American exports to Japan. The Framework negotiations essentially were geared to redeeming the President's promise to produce results in such politically sensitive sectors as computers, telecommunications, automobiles, and auto parts. Fearing that failure to meet such quotas would make Japan a target for trade sanctions, Tokyo refused to go along.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

From the outset, the Framework talks were acrimonious, marked by a high degree of suspicion, mistrust, and unprecedented personal animosity. They did not improve with age. At the February 1994 summit between Bill Clinton and then-Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese found that they could and did say "no" to the Administration's demands for managed trade. By the spring of 1995, the Administration was poised for a trade war with Japan, threatening a 100 percent tariff on the import of Japanese luxury automobiles unless Tokyo relented and signed up for managed trade.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In both countries, the media duly reported on and expanded on the tactics and personalities of the negotiators and their countries. In both countries, the media retreated to familiar stereotypes -- the untrustworthy, scheming Japanese versus the unreasonable, demanding Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the end, trade agreements were signed but none contained enforceable quotas. Typical was the conclusion of the auto parts negotiations. Two days after insisting that the government of Japan had to be part of an agreement to guarantee compliance of Japanese auto companies, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor was forced to back down. To underscore the extent of the Administration's retreat, the Japanese negotiator, Ryutaro Hashimoto, now Japan's Prime Minister, made clear at a joint press conference that Kantor was speaking solely for himself with regard to expectations for growth in American exports to Japan. The Japanese government, he emphasized, was not guaranteeing the deal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Bill Clinton set out to build a new U.S.-Japan relationship. But by placing economics at the center of his Japan policy, he short-changed the vital U.S.-Japan security relationship. And by resorting to threats of a trade war, the President caused a significant erosion in Japanese support for relations with the U.S. In short, his policies have been counterproductive for the strategic interests of the U.S.
<p>
<b>ADMINISTRATION CLAIMS AND JAPAN'S ECONOMIC REALITIES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration is claiming that its trade policies are responsible for the recent decline in Japan's trade surplus with the United States. This is political spin of the highest order and represents a striking example of the logical fallacy known as <I>post hoc ergo propter hoc</I> (literally, "after this, therefore because of this"). The root causes for this decline are to be found not in Washington, but in the impact of global economic forces operating on Japan. In reality, a substantial appreciation of the yen and high Japanese production costs are the main causes of America's declining trade deficit with Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The major factor driving down Japan's trade surplus is the soaring value of the yen. In Japan, this is known as <I>endaka</I>, which means an increase in the value of the yen against other currencies. From 158 yen = $1 in April 1990, the yen appreciated to a high of 79 yen = $1 in April 1995. Today, it stands at approximately 108 yen = $1, still substantially higher than it was in 1990. The appreciation of the yen has had a double effect: While making Japanese exports more expensive, it also has made imports cheaper. And Japanese consumers have responded to market signals by buying more imports, including those from the U.S.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Imports began to surge in April 1993. Japan's imports climbed by 22.3 percent in 1995. Semiconductors and electronic devices went up 66.6 percent, while automobile imports grew by 40.6 percent. Meanwhile, internationally, Japan's now higher-priced exports grew more slowly, by 12.0 percent, while exports of American-bound automobiles actually fell by 13.9 percent.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The <I>endaka</I> also is causing Japanese manufacturers to restructure fundamentally the way they do business. Under unrelenting pressure to cut costs, Japanese firms are beginning to open their traditional clubby business networks, known as <I>keiretsu</I>, to foreign suppliers. American and other foreign venders are now aggressively marketing their components to Japanese firms.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For example, Delphi, a General Motors parts subsidiary, hired Nissan and Toyota executives who then persuaded their former employers to designate Delco batteries as "authorized" parts for automobiles made by these Japanese companies. Consequently, Nissan and Toyota dealers now stock Delco batteries. In another instance, Tenneco, a <I>Fortune</i> 500 corporation with interests in automotive parts, energy, packaging, and shipbuilding, recently reached agreements with Toyota and Japan Energy to carry U.S.-made Monroe and Rancho shock absorbers at Toyota's 5,000 affiliated garages and at Japan Energy's 6,000 gas stations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To stay competitive, Japanese manufacturing firms are closing plants in Japan and moving to lower-cost production sites in the United States, Britain, and Southeast Asia. For example, Toyota is now investing billions in new plants, not in Japan, but in the U.S., Britain, and Thailand. While shedding jobs in Japan, Fujitsu, a leading Japanese electronics manufacturer, is building semiconductor plants in Oregon and Britain. Increasingly, Japanese firms are supplying overseas markets through local production rather than exports. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) estimates that in 1995 the value of goods produced by Japanese companies overseas exceeded the value of their exports for the first time in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Moreover, "reverse imports" -- products made abroad by Japanese firms and then exported for sale to Japan -- are becoming common in America. For example, Honda is now a net exporter of motor vehicles to Japan. In 1995, Honda exported some 45,000 Accord coupe, Accord wagon, and Civic models from North America to Japan. In sum, cost-conscious Japanese corporate decisions, not U.S. government policy, are driving down Japan's trade surplus with the U.S.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

By attempting to manage trade through quotas or targets, the Administration's trade policy was playing directly against economic forces that are working to transform, open, and deregulate Japan's economy. Trade quotas, both to expand imports and to restrain exports, empower the Japanese bureaucracy to decide which firms must buy more of a targeted import and which firms must be prevented from making profitable sales overseas. Such an expansion of governmental control would reregulate rather than deregulate Japan's economy.
<p>
<b>POLITICAL COSTS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Clinton Administration's trade war with Japan from 1993-1994 took a political toll on the U.S.-Japan relationship. According to polls conducted by the United States Information Agency in June 1995, during the auto and auto parts negotiations, 39 percent of Japanese respondents saw trade conflicts as eroding the alliance, while 30 percent saw the alliance as strong. By contrast, in May 1992, 43 percent saw the alliance as strong despite trade frictions. In the same June 1995 poll, 51 percent considered relations as "poor" and only 41 percent viewed them as "good."  In January 1996, 48 percent thought the relationship in "poor" shape.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Certainly, progress needs to made in opening and deregulating Japan's market. But, as the above polls make clear, the Administration's approach of using external pressure to force internal economic change in Japan has been counterproductive.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Against this background, the rape of a twelve-year-old Okinawan schoolgirl by American servicemen last September triggered the most serious crisis in the U.S.-Japan security relationship in decades. Calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Okinawa dominated Japan's political public debate in October. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 With the Okinawa crisis still smoldering, the President did not help matters when he canceled his November state visit to Japan to deal with the budget battle in Washington. Shortly before that decision, Winston Lord, the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, warned that cancellation would be a "body blow" to the alliance. In Tokyo, Japanese government officials noted that the cancellation was met with a dangerous indifference by the Japanese media and public, reflecting exasperation in dealing with the Clinton Administration. Shortly thereafter, the President in similar circumstances found time to visit Ireland and Israel for the funeral of Prime Minister Rabin. The Japanese media and political elite were quick to contrast the President's political priorities.
<p>
<b>ENDURING STRATEGIC REALITIES</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Despite the end of the Cold War, the alliance with Japan remains critical to American national interests. Today, the U.S.-Japan Alliance is the centerpiece of Asia's security system and the foundation of its economic dynamism and prosperity. This is of direct and immediate consequence to the security and economic well-being of all Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As John Dori of The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center has pointed out, U.S. exports to Asia in 1994 grew at a rate of 16.2 percent to more than $153 billion, the steepest increase since 1988. The prosperous nations of the region purchased over $45 billion more from U.S. exporters than did the 15 nations of the European Union, and almost $30 million more than Europe as a whole. And exports to Asia mean jobs for Americans. In 1994 more than 3 million Americans owed their jobs to exports to Asia, with 428,000 jobs being created in 1994 alone.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The United States also has enduring strategic interests in Asia. For over a century, the U.S. has worked to prevent a single power from dominating the region. Today, America's alliance with Japan enhances its ability to keep Asia open to U.S. influence. Forward-deployed U.S. forces in Japan have helped to deter aggression against allies and friends in the region. Recognizing the importance of this U.S. presence to Japan's security, the government of Japan contributes close to $5 billion annually in support for U.S. forces stationed in that country. Japan's effort in this regard represents the most generous host nation support of any of America's allies.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The strategic importance of the U.S. force presence in Japan was recently demonstrated. In mid-March, President Clinton ordered the deployment of the USS <I>Independence</I>, home-ported in Yokosuka, Japan, to waters near Taiwan at the time of the Republic of China's presidential elections. This strategic importance has also been evidenced by America's continuing ability to deter a possibly nuclear-armed North Korea from attacking South Korea, a U.S. ally, and reunifying the Korean Peninsula on communist terms. And a strong U.S.-Japan alliance will enhance America's ability to deal with China as it emerges as a great power in the first quarter of the next century.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Bill Clinton's Japan policy has ill served the relationship once defined by Ambassador Mike Mansfield as the United States' most important "bar none."  Were it not for the dedicated work of officials in the Pentagon, most notably Joseph Nye, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, there is no telling how far the free-fall in the relationship would have taken the alliance. Fortunately, these officials recognized the damage being done by the Administration's trade tactics, and in 1994 began the long, arduous task of returning the Administration's focus to the strategic centrality of the alliance. This is what has brought Bill Clinton to Tokyo. Better late than never.

<h3> ENTERING THE PACIFIC CENTURY</h3></p>
<p><b>By Senator Jesse Helms</b></p>
<p>
The Second Annual B.C. Lee Lecture, given March 26, 1996<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There are many great self-declared institutions in Washington. Some profess to have decided impacts on America's foreign policy. Then there are others truly making significant contributions; these are substantially fewer. <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/allen.htm">Richard Allen</a> are among the most significant players behind these few institutions -- but more about them in a moment.
<p>
<table border=0><tr><td><img src="lect562.gif" align=left width=277 height=196></td></tr><tr><td><font size="-1"><b>Heritage President Ed Feulner, center, introduces<br>
 Sen. Helms to Jay Lee, grandson of the late <br>
B.C. Lee, founder of the Samsung Group</td></tr></table><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage Foundation was in its infancy in the early 1970s during my first years in the Senate. But it had by then already become "self-evident," as one of our greatest documents puts it, that Heritage was moving rapidly in its remarkable leadership with its advocacy of, and its support for, great principles that deserve to survive.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
History will appropriately record the enormously important role that Ed Feulner has played in restoring and preserving the meaning and the miracle of America. And Richard V. Allen, who is so highly respected in this city and far beyond, has made the difference on countless occasions and in countless matters when America's future was hanging in the balance. Richard Allen and Ed Feulner together founded the Asian Studies Center in 1983, and Mr. Allen has served as its chairman ever since.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I mention all of this in paying my respects to these two patriots, and to thank them, and you, for the honor of having been chosen to offer my remarks at this second annual B.C. Lee lecture for the Heritage Foundation. And let me also take just a moment to recognize in this distinguished company my good friend and colleague, Representative Benjamin Gilman, the Chairman of the House International Relations Committee.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The year 1983 didn't appear to have the rosy glow foretelling the dawn of the Pacific Century. Leonid Brezhnev had just died, the Soviet Union was in turmoil, and the United States was fighting the final battles of the Cold War. The Heritage Foundation was preoccupied with those and other pressing issues of the day, but it was also looking forward. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1983, as I have indicated, Heritage founded its Asian Studies Center, a reflection of its understanding of the vital role Asia was to play in the post-Cold War future. That forward-looking vision is the reason Heritage is today one of America's preeminent think tanks, a policy center on which I and many other Members of Congress rely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In identifying the 21st century as the Pacific Century, I am merely stating the obvious: During the past decade, the world's center of gravity has shifted. And it will continue to move eastward away from Europe, toward Asia, because as the nations of Eastern Europe and the states of the former Soviet Union were struggling to break free of communism, Pacific Rim nations were busily taking care of business at home.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Their hard work has paid off. The Asia-Pacific region currently accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's trade and U.S.-Pacific Rim trade has out paced trade across the Atlantic. Thankfully for the United States -- though the political and economic center of gravity may have shifted West to East, Europe to Asia -- we remain uniquely positioned, not only geographically, but strategically, politically, and economically at the center. The United States thus remains the world's anchor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And that is where we must stay. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The fall of the Berlin Wall forced the United States to reexamine its role in the world. There were some who believed that the end of the Cold War was the time to turn inward, to spend a little time with our own problems. Others argued that the U.S. is the only country in the world with the moral, economic, and strategic strength to bring the rest of the world along. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I am convinced that we cannot be the best nation in the world unless we are willing to lead the world. We cannot lead by being the world's policeman, nor the world's babysitter, but by being what we have been for most of the 20th century -- the standard-bearer of moral, political, and military might and right, an example towards which all others aspire.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Congress, U.S. alliances in the Pacific enjoy bipartisan support. Some of us focus on political alliances, others on economic, others on strategic, and still others on moral alliances. But all of us recognize that those alliances need strengthening. The question is how to prioritize our objectives.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But, first, what are our priorities?  Clearly, one reason the United States has seemed to be flailing around in the world, rushing from disaster to disaster, is because the Clinton Administration has failed to set priorities. Everything, from Burundi to Bosnia, is equally important -- and, therefore, equally unimportant. Our old allies in Europe are watching us and wondering with amazement where the United States is headed. And you can bet that our new allies in Asia are scratching their heads, too.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In just a few short years, the Clinton Administration has managed to warp U.S.-Asia policy so badly that, at any one time, the United States is at odds with China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula. Right now, many Asian nations fear that we are propelling ourselves down the road to irrelevance. And we're not just strolling either.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In China, the United States has neither a strategy, nor resolve, for dealing with areas of key interests to the United States On the Korean peninsula, this Administration has given lip service to our allies in South Korea while dealing directly with the North Koreans on issues ranging from their nuclear program to the delivery of humanitarian food aid. Food aid, for heaven's sakes, that North Korea demanded, while South Korea -- our friend and ally -- was insisting the North did not need.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If this State Department, this National Security Council, and this White House, are determined to continue their experiments in foreign policy, let us pray that they will not make the devastating mistake of delegating decision-making to our enemies of forty years, the North Koreans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States simply cannot afford to abdicate its role in the dominant region of the 21st century. We must have priorities, and we must stand up for them. And, yes, if and when necessary, fight for them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Setting our priorities is no easy business. Asia presents daunting challenges. Consider the following:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Communist China considers itself prepared to step into the role of a dominant world power, yet demonstrates time and again that it has neither the maturity nor the decency to handle the role;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
North Korea maintains its million-man army and its militant, anti-Western propaganda machine while the United States props up North Korea's failing economy through a faulty agreement;
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Meanwhile Taiwan's dedication to democracy and capitalism deserves our continued support -- politically and militarily -- even in the face of severe opposition from Mainland China; 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Southeast Asians, proud of their continued economic miracles, are nervous about the Chinese military modernization and territorial claims in the South China Sea and are therefore pushing the ASEAN alliance into a strategic alliance, as well as an economic one; and
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India and Pakistan, like two caged tigers, compete for nuclear weaponry and missile technology, all the while scratching at their wounds in Kashmir. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But China is the greatest challenge. China is still trying to figure out how to play its own role on the world stage. In the meantime, the United States cannot be hamstrung by China's confusion. The United States must not sit still in the thrall of an awakening dragon. We must define U.S. interests in Asia now, as the dragon awakes, and hope that the dragon will awaken on the right side of the bed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Just three days ago, in Taiwan, the world watched as the free Taiwanese people cast their ballots in the first democratic presidential election ever in a Chinese-speaking country. President Lee Teng-hui scored a decisive victory in a hotly contested election. All of us, of course, congratulate President Lee and applaud his vision for Taiwan.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Think about it for a moment: In 1979, when the Carter Administration callously cut formal ties with our long-time ally, Taiwan, it was the Congress of the United States that compelled Mr. Carter to sign the Taiwan Relations Act -- the only law of the United States governing our relations with Taiwan. In passing the Taiwan Relations Act, Congress expressed its bipartisan support for Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The election of President Ronald Reagan guaranteed that the Taiwan Relations Act would be properly enforced to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself against any external threat. At that time, most countries in the world ignored Taiwan. And, like some in the United States, these same people assumed it was only a matter of time before the Communists on the mainland consumed tiny Taiwan. That hasn't happened, and it will not happen as long as I am in the U.S. Senate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the 1980s, the Reagan and Bush Administrations followed a consistent, principled policy toward Taiwan. It was not the least bit ambiguous. During this period, the people of Taiwan persisted. They accelerated the rate of growth in their free market economy, attracted high technology manufacturers, raised their own living standards, and encouraged the establishment of democracy. Even the most vigorous supporters of the Taiwanese -- myself included -- would never have thought that kind of progress possible in such a short period, especially given the fact that the Communists in Red China fought them the whole way.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So where does Taiwan go from here?  Will the Communists continue to threaten and bluster, wielding their own military machine time and again against Taiwan?  Not if the United States plays the role it should.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First of all, Taiwan deserves to participate in international organizations. Taiwan trades with the world, freely and fairly. Taiwan has a thriving, free market economy and a sound currency. Taiwan meets the fundamental criteria for membership in the World Trade Organization and should be admitted now, regardless of Mainland China's admission timetable. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, the United States must continue a vigorous and faithful implementation of the Taiwan Relations Act and all of its provisions. The United States has promised, and is obligated by law, to provide Taiwan with enough military equipment to defend itself against any external threat. The recent military exercises in the Taiwan Strait orchestrated by the Chinese Communists prove this to be more important than ever. We can and should -- we must -- remove any supposed barriers to providing Taiwan with state-of-the-art defensive systems and equipment. Taiwan threatens no one; the same cannot be said of Mainland China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Third, we must actively engage other countries in the region to encourage and assist Taiwan's peaceful democratic growth. It will be Taiwan's economic growth upon which other economies in the region will come to rely. It is those countries that should be encouraged to support Taiwan on the political front as well. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fourth, to ensure that we do not contradict our goal of encouraging Taiwan's economic growth in conditions of democracy, the United States must be exceptionally cautious concerning the technologies we sell to Communist China. The United States does not serve its own long-term interests well by augmenting Communist China's military capability.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As for Mainland China, it has become an appalling habit in various U.S. administrations to speak to China as if to a child. We outline our expectations, and when they are not met -- and they are never met -- we make excuses. But the Chinese are not children, and we are not their parents. Respect for human life, willingness to obey international agreements -- these are U.S. priorities, not homework assignments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Refusing to punish China when China does not live up to its commitments in the world only further encourages China's intransigence. Too often we don't follow through on sanctions because we worry that we will lose a share of the elusive Chinese market. But we are forgetting at least two things when we do that. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, the Chinese need us as much as, if not more than, we need them. Chinese growth and continued prosperity are dependent on a continued stream of foreign investment and trade. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Second, we forget the beloved Asian tradition of bargaining. If we explain our bottom line and then don't follow through to defend it, they'll push us to an even lower bottom line the next time around. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Twice recently, the United States has backed away from sanctioning China for its bad behavior. The United States, under the steady direction of Mickey Kantor, vowed to sanction China if it did not implement the agreement that China signed more than a year ago regarding intellectual property rights protection. Shockingly to nobody, except perhaps Mr. Kantor, the Chinese didn't live up to the terms of the agreement. But, you see, the Chinese know us too well. They dangled a $4 billion bid for Boeing planes in return for our not imposing the sanctions on intellectual property.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More serious still than thieving brand-name sneakers are China's nefarious proliferation activities. In the face of China's transfer of strategically crucial missiles to one of the world's most destabilizing, terrorist nations, Iran, the Clinton Administration has sat on its hands. The Chinese play us well: They sign an agreement, violate it, and in return are awarded lucrative contracts with U.S. firms in which the U.S. firm is required to transfer important proprietary technology. What a deal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. laws regarding sanctions for international trafficking in missiles and in weapons of mass destruction are clear. We disregard them at our own choosing -- and at our own peril.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The size of the Chinese market has blinded far too many to the Chinese threat. Military cadres in the Chinese leadership maintain a dominant role in the policymaking process. It is the generals, and not the apparatchiks, who enjoy a stranglehold over policy. It is they who have pushed China's drive to modernize its armed forces from a defensive, brown-water type to a blue-water force capable of forward deployment throughout Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By the end of the next decade, China will be capable of locking up the world's most strategic waterways. By reasserting its claims to atolls in the South China Sea and by selling billions of dollars in military hardware to the regime in Burma, while building shipping ports off the Burmese coast in the Indian Ocean, the Chinese are in a position to cut off the international right of free passage in those waters. One call from Beijing could very well cut off over 50 percent of the world's trade.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Japanese, the Koreans, the Southeast Asians, and the South Asians all see the trend and, in response, are begging the United States to maintain the 7th Fleet in the region. U.S. military presence in the region is vital. If we're willing to use U.S. armed forces to build toilets and sewers for Haitians, there is no question we should bolster U.S. forces to defend and maintain right of passage through these crucial international maritime routes. We not only would insure our own economic well-being, but also would maintain stability in markets throughout the world. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Clearly, the United States cannot shoulder the financial and logistical burden of defending Asia's waterways alone. In return for our services, the countries of the region are going to have to offer far more access and hospitality to our military.We will have to depend on our allies far more than we do now. Which brings me to the crucial role of the U.S.-Japan military alliance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States and Japan, like it or not, share common goals and objectives for the Asia-Pacific. Our economies will come to depend upon the enormous economic growth in Asia -- a peaceful Asia, that is. The economic forces of an increasingly interdependent global economy and the strategic rise of China are hurtling the United States and Japan down the same path. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If the United States is to attain its security objectives in Asia, the U.S.-Japan alliance must remain strong. However, our alliance with Japan has come under sharp scrutiny in recent months, and I am persuaded that the relationship must be reexamined -- not to determine whether it should continue, but how best it should continue.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, we must not fool ourselves. If the United States were to leave the Japanese to fend for themselves, I am convinced that Japan would go nuclear within ten years. It is entirely possible that within the course of the next century, the world may very well witness the development of a nuclear-armed Japan, a nuclear-armed and reunified Korean peninsula, a China with modern, forward-deployed armed forces, a still-divided and nuclear-armed South Asia and an arms race on a scale never seen before in Southeast Asia. That scenario is in nobody's best interest. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Japan must, however, do more. Japan must take responsibility in the world, not as a commercial buccaneer, but as a mature, responsible nation. We should be encouraging the Japanese to take a leadership role commensurate with Japan's economic standing. That means far more, for example, than affording Japan a seat on the U.N. Security Council to demonstrate its position in the world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It means that Japan will have to start making hard choices -- choices that may mean forgoing a market opportunity in a country in return for improvement in the standard of living for a nation's people. As yet, they have shied away from putting themselves on the line on some of the toughest policy issues like human rights and proliferation. It means that Japan maintains a strong enough economy that it should begin to use its influence not just toopen markets, but to leverage its power to affect change for the better in other countries. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
As Japan takes more responsibilities onto itself, I hope our trading relationship can flourish fairly. And on that note, I must tip my hat to Mickey Kantor. He has shown real gumption in pushing Japan with the threat of sanctions and retaliation in U.S. markets, all of which goes to show that not every fight needs to end in a war if the United States is willing to stand up to defend its national interests. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The South Koreans should be mindful in this regard, as well. A solid friendship underlies the U.S.-South Korean relationship. But if South Korea is to play a more significant role on the world stage, it, too, must become more considerate of, and receptive to, American goods and services. While the process of liberalization is underway, it should be accelerated.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economic front is not the only front on which Asia will challenge U.S. policymakers. All sorts of strategic alignments and realignments are occurring throughout Asia. The United States has to keep abreast of these changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the best prospects for a flashpoint in the region is the Korean peninsula. Along with 650,000 South Korean troops, 37,000 Americans face a million-man North Korean army poised along the border of North and South Korea, a little more than a marathon distance from Seoul. The results of the much-vaunted U.S.-North Korea Agreed Framework on the nuclear issue have yet to be seen, but one thing is clear: The Clinton Administration handled the North Korean regime with the same kid gloves it has heretofore used to handle all dictators from Castro to Aristide. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The United States has now agreed to supply hundreds of millions of dollars of oil to North Korea, enough oil to prop up the failing North Korean economy and thereby ensure that the Stalinist regime stays in power. That makes no sense. North Korea signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It violated it. It should not get paid for that violation
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Saddest, perhaps, is that the world has learned only one valuable lesson from the vile activities of the North Koreans. The world has sadly learned that the United States can be blackmailed. When the going got tough, the United States has been willing to offer up the checkbooks of the American taxpayer. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our great bargain with North Korea gives the North modern nuclear reactor technology that still allows them to produce plutonium for a nuclear weapon. The saving grace for the Clinton Administration?  The North Koreans won't be able to produce as much plutonium for nuclear weapons. And we are supposed to be relieved?  Give me a break.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Indeed, the Agreed Framework is so discredited with our allies that the tripartite international organization established to implement it can't beg or borrow enough to carry out its mandate. And why won't our allies ante up?  Because they're not sanguine about the deal that was struck.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One of the central tenets of our compact with Pyongyang was that the North would begin a substantive dialogue with our allies, the South Koreans. It has not happened. The Administration has tried to convince the world that by offering the carrot of a nuclear reactor to the North, the rest of the world would benefit by having coaxed the North to talk with the South. It hasn't happened yet, and there doesn't seem to be any real movement in that direction. The real path to peace on the Korean peninsula runs directly from Seoul to Pyongyang -- not from Pyongyang to Washington. Dialogue between North and South Korea is one of the only chances the world has of seeing the Korean peninsula reunified on a peaceful, democratic, and economically solvent basis. That chance is disappearing as I speak.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And now, if I may, let me turn to one of my old hobbyhorses, Russia. I am unaccustomed to regarding Russia as an Asian power, but the time has come to recognize that fully half of Russia's territory lies in Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For nearly a thousand years, Russia has been torn by competing European and Asian influences. I believe they prefer to consider themselves Europeans.But frankly, I don't particularly care how Russia sees itself -- just as long as it does so within its own borders. Which is, historically, the biggest problem with Russia: It finds its borders so confining.... 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Every so often, our friends in Moscow decide that they have neglected their Asian side. Unfortunately, their interest has tended to manifest itself in the shape of wars of expansion. At the beginning of this century, the Russian and Japanese Empires collided in a great naval battle at Port Arthur. In World War II, the Soviet Union seized a group of islands from Japan that are today held by Russia -- an act which continues to poison relations between the two countries. Under the leadership of Stalin and Mao, the Soviet Union and China experienced decades of friction, including periodic border clashes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The challenge for Russia today is to overcome the legacy of military competition in the East and to build cooperative relations with its Asian neighbors. The question for us, however, is to what extent Russia chooses this course as an alternative to closer relations with the West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Russia has indicated its interest in engaging Asia more closely -- witness President Yeltsin's widely touted trip to Beijing scheduled for early April. It is much repeated in Moscow that the "West" has not proven to be a gracious partner for Russia, and Russia therefore should look east. I will not dwell on the merit of Russia's criticism of the "West"; however, it is important that we all better understand what Russia seeks in engaging the East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Closer ties between Russia and China are not automatically bad for U.S. interests. Those two nations share one of the longest land borders in the world. They certainly must, at a minimum, learn to coexist. However, if Russia seeks a closer relationship with the current regime in China as an alternative to the West, then Russia would defy its own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Russia today advocate following the "Chinese model" of market economics without political freedom. This is pure folly. I see no chance that the people of Russia would allow themselves to be led by a government such as China's, which so callously disregards the rights of its own citizens. If Russia seeks partners in Asia, it should instead look to those nations which have found the path to economic success and political freedom. That's the best mix of East and West.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For real cooperation between Russia and China to succeed, it must be based on deeper interests than a momentary desire to unite against the West. I trust that responsible leaders in Russia know this to be true. I would not disregard the potential for the worst elements in the Russian and Chinese governments to try their very best to build such a relationship, but I doubt that they will succeed where Stalin and Mao failed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Frankly, I have less fear of a Sino-Russian partnership than I do of Russia's and China's meddling in Asia. Which brings me to a trouble spot that doesn't usually come up in discussions of the so-called Pacific Century -- that is, South Asia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Throughout the Cold War, India's own insularity allowed the United States the luxury of virtually ignoring the world's second largest nation. We no longer have that luxury for two reasons --  neither of them surprising to those of us who spend our time wrestling with the post-Cold War world.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the past decade, India has become an economic power with which we all must reckon. Slowly, in its typical one step forward, ten steps backwards fashion, India is becoming an important player in the world economy. American companies are investing millions in India, and eyeing that nation's 200-plus-million middle class hungrily.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unfortunately, as India becomes part of the world of fair-trading nations, India is also fighting to become a nuclear power. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974 and, until just a month or two ago, was on the verge of testing another. In addition, India has developed ballistic missiles and is moving quickly to produce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India's leaders would have us believe that their drive for nuclear weapons and long-range missiles has to do with the odious Chinese threat to India's north, which is only partly true. Certainly, China has been no friend to India, and a good -- perhaps too good -- friend to Pakistan. But India's real problem is to its west, in Kashmir and in Pakistan. The vast majority of India's troops are concentrated on its Pakistani border and in Kashmir, and not on the Indo-Chinese border. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Pakistan, long a good and a true ally of the United States, is persuaded that India is bent on Pakistan's destruction. It's remedy has been to turn to the Safeway of proliferating nations -- China. Nuclear technology, missiles, arms of every kind are to be had for the asking over in Beijing. China, uniquely positioned to moderate the policies of its neighbors in South Asia, has instead used tensions in that region to profit on the deadly proliferation market. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So how, ideally, does the United States respond?  Ideally, we look to one of the sources of the problem: Kashmir. We work with a portion of the vigor we have dedicated to Middle East peacemaking to forcefully persuade India and Pakistan to move to a settlement. Ideally, we slam China for fueling the South Asia arms race and demonstrate our own seriousness in fighting proliferation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But then there is the real world. The Clinton Administration makes excuses for China. Mind bogglingly, we are told -- again -- that China did not fully comprehend its commitments under the Nonproliferation Treaty and, therefore, probably was not in the "wrong" in transferring missile technology to Pakistan. Pakistan is threatened with sanctions for buying missiles and nuclear technology, and rightly so. But when Prime Minister Bhutto begs for help in dealing with India, the Clinton Administration is not interested.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
India, happy to absorb $100-plus-million in U.S. foreign aid every year, laughs in our faces when we demand that they work with us against proliferation. And at any hint that the United States might get serious, legions of companies are brought in to describe to us the importance of continuing to do business with India. After all, the Indians may not like China, but they sure have learned a thing or two from Beijing about how to manipulate Washington, D.C.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Well, now, I have spent much of my time talking about the 800-pound gorillas of Asia. Now let's talk a bit about the tigers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economies of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are booming. Over the past five years, they have averaged 7 percent growth, a trend that promises to continue for at least the next few decades. The ASEAN story is a genuine success story. Consider that a group of nations with disparate histories, languages, and economies joined together to ensure stability in the region. They recognized early on that they could provide commensurate counterweight to the economic and strategic forces of China, Japan, and the Korean peninsula only if they were united. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Developing strong ties with each of the members of ASEAN will be another linchpin in the U.S. approach to Asia. We must work -- and work harder -- with our close friends in ASEAN to encourage them to bring pressure for reform to bear on countries like Vietnam, Laos, and Burma --  - countries where repressive governments have still not adopted the rule of law or accepted the international norms for the treatment of human rights.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
For Burma and Laos, the lure of ASEAN membership is a significant enough draw to encourage these countries actually to consider liberalization. The question will be whether the current ASEAN countries make that issue a priority. Without encouragement and even pressure from the United States, they will not do so. That would be a serious mistake -- though only one more in a series of mistakes in Asia for this administration. The United States cannot afford to let this ball drop. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Somehow the Clinton Administration approach to U.S.-Asia policy reminds me of Alice in Wonderland -- if you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there. The United States today is in the position, economically and militarily, to be the dominant friendly power in the Asia-Pacific. We can't afford to squander that position in the run-up to the Pacific Century. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There's no crystal ball telling us how the world will unfold, but I am confident of Asia's central part in that world. There is a famous Chinese proverb that says something along the lines of: "If the water is murky, just wait and let it settle. Then it will all be clear to you."  The future of the region and the U.S. position there is murky now, but we cannot sit and wait for the waters to clear before we define our policies. 

<p>U.S. policy must directly address U.S. interests in Asia. There are at least five points for us to stress:</p>

<p>(1) Maintain open and peaceful shipping waters for trade; </p>

<p>(2) Maintain a strategic balance between China, Japan, the Korean peninsula, and Southeast Asia, all the while preventing a cataclysmic arms race; </p>

<p>(3) Push for more open, less regulated markets for U.S. goods and services; </p>
<p/>
(4) Show the nations in the region that we are serious about their adherence to bilateral and multilateral agreements by punishing those who transgress; and </p>
<p>
(5) Strengthen the friendships we maintain with our true allies in the region -- Taiwan and South Korea, to name just two -- rather than coddle dictators because we fear that we might lose market share.</p>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
You have been patient with me, and I thank you most sincerely for the opportunity to share some views with you this evening. I am genuinely honored to be in the company of the high caliber of Asia and foreign policy specialists in this room tonight, and I hope I will have the benefit of your views later in the evening.

<P>
(Updating Asian Studies Center <a href="asc139.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 139</a>, "China's Threats to Taiwan Challenge U.S. Leadership in Asia," March 6, 1996)
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Early in the morning of March 8, China fired three nuclear-capable missiles into two areas close to the Republic of China on Taiwan as part of missile "tests" that will last until March 15. Moreover, from March 12 to March 20, China will hold large-scale naval military exercises that use live ammunition, also in an area close to Taiwan. These military actions are targeted at the ROC's March 23 presidential election and mark an escalation in Beijing's campaign to intimidate the citizens and leadership of democratic Taiwan. Beijing has designed the missile tests to emphasize China's ability to blockade Taiwan. The three missiles fired on March 8 fell into two zones astride Taiwan's two largest ports, and Beijing has warned commercial air and sea traffic to steer clear. The tests threaten both Taiwan's economic well-being and the safety of its citizens. They also stand as test of Washington's leadership and resolve, and challenge America's historic interest in maintaining freedom of the seas.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton Administration's March 10 decision to dispatch U.S. Navy aircraft carrier groups to waters near Taiwan to deter possible Chinese escalation was correct. Congress's response to these latest threats against Taiwan also has been strong. Speaker Newt Gingrich, for example, said they amounted to "an act of terror."  But while State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns called the missile tests "reckless and potentially dangerous," another State Department official told <I>The New York Times</I> the tests did not amount to an act of terror. Washington should protest China's missile intimidation in the strongest terms, reaffirm America's commitment to defending freedom of the seas, review U.S. commitments to Taiwan as stipulated in the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, and accelerate the introduction of U.S. missile defense systems into Asia.
<p>
<b>CHINA'S MISSILE CAMPAIGN TO THREATEN TAIWAN</b>
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;China is the only Asian country using nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate its neighbors. The tests which will last from March 8 to March 15 mark the second time China has employed missiles to threaten the people of Taiwan. Last July 21 to 26, China launched four 1,125-mile-range DF-21 missiles and two 375-mile-range M-9 missiles into an area roughly 90 miles north of Taiwan. Both the DF-21 and the M-9 are designed to carry conventional, chemical, or nuclear warheads. So far, the M-9 has been used in the latest tests, which target two areas of roughly 500 square miles each. One target area is located about 30 miles off the northern coast of Taiwan, east of the port of Keelung. The second is 47 miles directly west of the southern port of Kaohsiung.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Clear Escalation of Tension.</b> The new missile tests mark a clear escalation in China's pressure against Taiwan. The location of the northern target area raises the possibility that Chinese missiles may fly over Taiwanese territory, possibly even the capital city of Taipei. The failure of one M-9 missile in last July's exercise also raises the danger of an accidental strike on Taiwan. Moreover, the March tests follow months of threats. For example, during an early 1996 trip to China, former Clinton Administration Pentagon official Charles Freeman reportedly was told that China "has prepared plans for a missile attack against Taiwan consisting of one conventional missile strike a day for 30 days." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As also occurred in July, the current tests are taking place alongside large-scale Chinese ground and naval exercises in areas near Taiwan. The latest exercises have featured practicing the largest airborne assault ever conducted by China, as well as a huge amphibious exercise aimed at Taiwan. And from March 12 to 20, naval exercises using live munitions will take place close to major air and sea routes in the Taiwan Strait.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>Virtual Blockade.</b> These new missile tests and naval exercises amount to a blockade of major air and sea lanes critical to Taiwan's survival. The southern port of Kaohsiung and the northern port of Keelung account for about 70 percent of Taiwan's trade, and exports account for about 40 percent of Taiwan's gross domestic product. Because of these tests, some shipping will have to be diverted. Moreover, about 30 flights a day that use routes near the northern test site will have to be re-routed. China's missile intimidation has damaged Taiwan's economy and threatens the economic confidence of the people of Taiwan. The March 4 announcement of the missile tests caused the Taiwan stock market to drop by 62 points the next day; the stock market has fallen 625 points since July 1995. The missile tests also have caused panic buying of gold, and the Taiwan government has had to reassure people that food and fuel have been stockpiled in the event of a blockade. Missile strikes or damage to shipping will further depress investor confidence and cause shipping insurance rates to skyrocket.
<P>
<b>TIME FOR WASHINGTON TO SHOW RESOLVE</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;China's latest missile tests challenge America's interests in Asia. For over two centuries, the United States has defended freedom of the seas and stood for freedom of commerce. Indeed, these principles have been at the heart of America's open door approach to Asia and China. By using its military to create a virtual blockade near Taiwan's two major ports, and forcing a diversion of international air and sea traffic, China is challenging an enduring and vital American interest. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing's actions also stand as a challenge to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA). Section 2 of the TRA states that "It is the policy of the United States to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave concern to the United States."  Section 3 directs the President "to inform Congress promptly of any threat to the security or economic system of the people of Taiwan.... " The tests also call into question the very basis on which the U.S. established relations with China: the assumption that Taiwan's status would be resolved peacefully by the Chinese themselves.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Above all, these tests are a challenge to American leadership and resolve in Asia. For over half a century, the United States has stood as the ultimate guarantor of stability and security in Asia. Given the stakes involved, the Clinton Administration's initial response to China's missile diplomacy was tragically weak. The Administration offered only a mild rebuke to China's missile tests in July 1995. Responding to the announcement of the current round of missile tests, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns argues that it is not "credible" to describe the missile tests as a blockade of Taiwan's ports. The Administration has yet to be as critical as former Clinton Administration CIA Director James Woolsey, who said the tests amount to a "de facto temporary and partial blockade [which is] aggressive, indefensible, dangerous.... " The Clinton Administration should undertake a stronger response to China's missiles. The U.S. should:
<p><ul>
<li>Strongly reject Beijing's use of military force. Since the U.S. is the only power able to deter China's threat to peace, the Administration should make clear to China that military action against Taiwan may undermine the basis for continued peaceful U.S.-PRC relations. The Administration should remind Chinese leaders that normalization of relations was premised on the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's status. The U.S. should tell China that its use of force against Taiwan threatens peace in Asia. 
<p>
<li> Reaffirm America's vital interest in the freedom of the seas. The Administration should inform China that its missile tests near Taiwan pose an unacceptable threat to internationally recognized freedom of the high seas and airways. Ships from the Japan-based 7th Fleet, now dispatched to international waters near Taiwan, should remain in this region after the March 23 election, both to deter China and to underscore U.S. commitment to freedom of the seas. The U.S. also should consult with Asian allies and friends regarding possible sanctions against Chinese sea and air carriers in the event the missile tests harm ships or aircraft.
<p>
<li> Report to Congress that China is posing a danger to Taiwan's economic system. These missile tests constitute an attempt to blockade Taiwan's ports and airports. They could presage a more deliberate attempt to blockade Taiwan. In accordance with the TRA, the Clinton Administration must report to Congress that these actions pose a threat to Taiwan's economy. 
<p>
<li> Sell Taiwan defensive arms consistent with the TRA. China's missile threats against Taiwan point to an urgent need for missile defense in the ROC. Thus, to enable Taiwan to defend itself against any possible missile attack, the U.S. should offer to sell the ROC the Patriot PAC-2 GEM missile defense system. This is the most modern operable missile defense system in America's arsenal. If China persists with its missile threats, the U.S. should sell Taiwan more advanced missile defense systems as they enter U.S. service. 
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing's latest missile tests near Taiwan's two major ports are, for Washington, an unacceptable escalation in China's attempt to undermine the free and democratic spirit of the people of Taiwan. These threatening tests, combined with large Chinese naval exercises, also constitute a direct challenge to key U.S. interests, including the peaceful resolution of Taiwan's future and maintaining the freedom of navigation in Asia. As the only nation capable of deterring China, the U.S. should strongly protest China's missile threats, reaffirm the freedom of the seas by deploying the 7th Fleet, and sell missile defense systems to Taiwan.

<P>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait is among the most important
challenges for American foreign policy in early 1996. Ever since
Republic of China President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the
United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating
Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of
force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and
even larger maneuvers are underway as Taiwan moves toward its
scheduled March 23 presidential election. China continues to reserve
the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare
independence. If a military clash were to occur, even a limited
one, tremendous damage would be done, both to Taiwan and to U.S.-China
relations. Failure to deter conflict also would be regarded in
Asia as a failure of U.S. leadership.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At stake in Taiwan is not only the peace and security of the region,
but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. With a population of
only 21 million, the ROC is the seventh largest U.S. trading partner,
right behind China itself. After martial law ended in 1987, the
ROC embarked on political reforms that soon will transform Taiwan
into a full democracy. Last December, free and fair elections
were held for the ROC Legislative Yuan<sup>1</sup>; and this March 23, Taiwan
will hold its first direct presidential election. The ROC is the
first full democracy in the history of the Chinese people. Taiwan
is thus a model for political reform on the mainland.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In response to the ROC's growing international stature, China
has mounted a campaign of diplomatic pressure and military intimidation
against Taiwan. On one level, these threats are directed at political
forces in Taiwan calling for independence from China<sup>2</sup>. But they
are aimed also at Taiwan's emerging democracy. Beijing's threats
have been reinforced by demonstrations of force, including large-scale
military exercises and tests of nuclear-capable missiles near
the ROC. These actions have not depressed the democratic enthusiasm
of the people of Taiwan, but they have weakened business confidence
on the island. Even larger military exercises will be held in
the days leading up to the March 23 presidential election.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Bill Clinton's failure to respond adequately to Chinese saber-rattling
in the South China Sea and against Taiwan fosters an impression
of American weakness. Several statements by Clinton Administration
officials to the effect that the U.S. will not defend Taiwan if
attacked are potentially even more destabilizing. Hard-liners
in Beijing have been encouraged to step up dangerous military
pressure against Taiwan. President Clinton therefore must take
strong but measured steps to convey to Beijing America's clear
interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Congress can
play an important role as well in reaffirming America's traditional
bipartisan support for the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. Thus, the
Administration and Congress should:<BR>
<ul>
<P>
<li>Reaffirm the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and make clear to China
that any attack on Taiwan challenges U.S. security interests.
The perception that the U.S. would not respond to a Chinese attack
will only embolden Beijing.<BR>

<P>
<li>Recognize the ROC's democratic reforms and urge China and the
ROC to resolve their differences peacefully.<BR>

<P>
<li>Privately warn China of the consequences it will face if it attacks
the ROC. China should be told it may face economic sanctions,
ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a
full U.S. economic embargo, and that the U.S. does not rule out
using force to defend Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
<li>Exercise U.S. naval forces near the ROC during the period before
and after the March 23 presidential election to deter threatened
Chinese military action against Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
<li><B>Sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan
Relations Act. These may include advanced air-to-air missiles,
conventional submarines, and missile defense systems. <BR>

<b>GROWING DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN: THE LEGISLATIVE YUAN ELECTIONS</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Legislative Yuan is the foremost lawmaking branch of the ROC
government. The December 2 Legislative Yuan elections represented
a milestone in the democratic reform process begun by former President
Chiang Ching-kuo when he lifted martial law in 1987. The elections
emphatically demonstrated the deepening of Taiwan's own democratic
political culture. Today, Taiwan's democracy includes aspects
common to all advanced democracies: competitive multi-party competition,
professionally managed and transparent voting procedures, effective
public debate, and citizen faith in the election process. This
faith was illustrated by the impressive turnout of 67.65 percent
of Taiwan's 14.2 million voting-age citizens. This occurred without
compulsory voting laws. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The elections preserved the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party's narrow
majority in the 164-seat Legislative Yuan. The KMT won 85 seats,
but its total declined by 11 seats. The main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party (DPP) made only modest gains, from 50 to 54.
Meanwhile, the New Party, a recently formed conservative party,
went from 0 to 21 seats. Because party discipline in Taiwan is
lax, the KMT will have to form coalitions in order to conduct
the business of government. Thus, the results of the election
offer prospects for the development of a culture of compromise,
a necessary element common to all advanced democracies.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The December 2 elections were judged universally to be fair and
democratic. On election day, an observer team organized by <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> visited several polling stations in Central
Taipei, witnessing voting procedures that Taiwanese appeared to
regard as routine. There was little tension because the procedures
were well known. Confidence in the secrecy and security of the
ballots is well established. That evening, the Heritage delegation
visited the National Vote Tallying Center, where computerized
tallying produced national results well before 10:00 p.m. There
were no accusations of fraud to challenge the integrity of the
process. University of Florida Professor James Robinson also noted
that &quot;Taiwan at present compares favorably with its democratic
peers in conducting fair elections.&quot;<sup>3</sup> <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Legislative Yuan elections were dominated by domestic issues.
Political and economic issues included criticism of KMT &quot;money
politics,&quot; a perceived slowdown in the economy, accusations
of government corruption, veterans benefits, and the personalities
of the candidates. In contrast to previous elections, many observers
noted that vote-buying was much less a problem in this election.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Independence and Intimidation. </B>China's military intimidation
played a lesser role in the December elections than many expected.
Some have noted that the impressive gains made by the New Party
(NP) and the defeat of one-third of the Democratic Progressive
Party's incumbents reflect opposition to Taiwan independence.
The NP strictly opposes independence and criticizes the KMT for
covertly seeking it, while the DPP advocates independence from
China despite Beijing's repeated threat to invade Taiwan if this
were to occur. In the middle of the spectrum between the NP and
the DPP, the KMT wants peaceful unification with a reformed mainland
over the long term but, in the interim, seeks to expand Taipei's
international recognition short of formal independence. The Heritage
delegation concluded that domestic issues played a far greater
role in voting preferences than did the independence issue. The
delegation also concluded that China's military threats did not
sway the Taiwanese people significantly. <BR>

<b>THE MARCH 23 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The democratic process begun by the legislative elections last
year will be consummated this year by the presidential elections
on March 23.<sup>4</sup> The front-runner in this election is KMT incumbent
President Lee Teng-hui. Lee is the first native-born Taiwanese
to become President and has followed his predecessor, President
Chiang Ching-kuo, in advancing democratic reforms. Lee has opposed
the DPP on the issue of independence from China but has sought
vigorously to raise Taiwan's international status by seeking to
join international organizations like the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, the World Trade Organization, and the
United Nations. President Lee also has pressed for greater diplomatic
support from the United States. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Lee will face three opponents in the election. Peng Ming-min of
the Democratic Progressive Party is a former political exile and
is regarded as the intellectual godfather of the pro-independence
movement. Two other candidates come from factions of the KMT.
Lin Yang-kang, former President of Taiwan's Judicial Yuan, is
supported by the New Party, which opposes both independence and
Lee Teng-hui. Also running on an independent ticket is Chen Li-an,
former President of the Control Yuan, a government watchdog body.
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>CHINA'S THREAT TO PEACE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Over the last year, China has deliberately increased tension in
the Taiwan Strait. Beijing views Taipei's attempts to gain admittance
to the United Nations and President Lee's private visit to the
U.S. last June as efforts to advance the cause of an independent
Taiwan. However, China's leaders have an even greater fear: A
free and democratic Taiwan stands as a threat to the legitimacy
of the Chinese Communist Party's political dictatorship. Thus,
Taiwan's democracy and place in the world stand as important issues
in China's own ongoing political transition. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Threats of Missile Strikes. </B>Since 1994, China has mounted
three major military exercises near Taiwan. In September and October
1994, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted combined air,
land, and sea exercises on Chou Shan Island, about 60 miles south
of ROC-held Quemoy Island. At the time, Assistant Secretary of
State Winston Lord described these exercises as &quot;the most
expansive... that China has conducted in 40 or 50 years.&quot;
In June and July of last year, the PLA conducted a similar series
of exercises near Taiwan. These exercises concluded with the firing
of four 1,125-mile range DF-21 and two 375-mile range M-9 missiles
to an area about 100 miles north of the ROC.<sup>5</sup> Both missiles are
capable of carrying nuclear or chemical warheads. These tests
mark the first time China has used missiles to threaten an opponent.<sup>6</sup>
Finally, right before the Legislative Yuan elections, in late
November, Chinese President Jaing Zemin personally presided over
large-scale combined-arms amphibious and airborne assault exercises
designed to simulate an invasion of Taiwan. These exercises involved
about 20,000 troops, in addition to about 40 ships and 100 aircraft.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China has scheduled more exercises for 1996 and has been deploying
forces to Fujian Province, across the strait from Taiwan, for
large-scale military exercises planned for late February.<sup>7</sup> These
exercises may involve up to 100,000 troops and China's most modern
combat aircraft, the Sukhoi SU-27 and J-8II jet fighters.<sup>8</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Beijing also has threatened to use force against Taiwan. Before
the December Legislative Yuan elections, China used the Hong Kong
press to discuss the possible invasion and occupation of one of
the ROC's offshore islands, followed by a naval blockade of the
Taiwan Strait. These threats were designed to compel Taipei to
begin reunification talks on Beijing's terms. Even more alarming,
former Clinton Administration Assistant Secretary of Defense Charles
Freeman, following meetings in China, reportedly has told the
Administration that while China &quot;prefers negotiation to combat,&quot;
it &quot;has prepared plans for a missile attack against Taiwan
consisting of one conventional missile strike a day for 30 days.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China does not have the capability to invade and conquer the ROC,
but it does have the capability to do significant harm. Last November's
amphibious exercise involved only a single PLA division, but the
effort required civilian ships to support the PLA Navy.<sup>10</sup> However,
the PLA can cause substantial damage to Taiwan by mining ports,
undertaking a limited blockade with its five nuclear-powered and
45 conventional-powered attack submarines, and conducting a terror
campaign with conventional missile strikes. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; To counter Chinese submarines, the ROC Navy has only two modern
conventional submarines. Moreover, the ROC lacks anti-missile
systems, and China conceivably could take Quemoy or Matsu, small,
fortified islands near the coast of China, albeit at heavy cost
to its invading forces. Even such limited PLA action might lead
to air battles that would reduce the number of ROC combat aircraft.
In addition to any physical damage, such a limited campaign against
Taiwan could depress public and economic confidence. Shipping
insurance rates would skyrocket, and foreign investors would be
deterred. ROC officials estimate that after the PLA missile tests
last July, capital flight amounted to $5 billion.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <B>Unification By Force? </B>The PRC is stepping up its efforts
to intimidate the ROC, but it may be preparing for a more decisive
confrontation with Taiwan early in the next decade. In a speech
on January 30 Premier Li Peng, the second most powerful Chinese
leader, said that &quot;During the period of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan [years 1996 to 2000] the Chinese Government will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and Macau. Therefore, settling
the Taiwan issue will be prominently put in front of all Chinese
people.&quot; Reports out of Hong Kong in mid-January stated that
the &quot;the important role to be played by the Army in taking
back Taiwan&quot; was stressed at a December meeting of the policy-setting
Central Military Commission, attended by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin. This meeting reportedly also endorsed military modernization
plans, including a decision to build China's first aircraft carrier.<sup>11</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China indeed is modernizing its armed forces. Beijing has purchased
four advanced Kilo-class conventional submarines from Russia that
are far more capable than the older Soviet-based submarines currently
used by China. The PLA Navy is building modern missile-armed destroyers
and frigates. Reports of a pending deal in which China may buy
over 70 advanced Russian SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> fighters, which
will entail co-production of this aircraft, indicate the PLA could
have over 100 of this type in about five years.<sup>12</sup> This aircraft
has superior range and may be armed already with AA-11 <I>Archer</I>
air-to-air missiles, which would threaten the U.S. F-16s the ROC
plans to put into service in 1997<sup>13</sup>. Moreover, China may be seeking
to purchase Russian or Israeli AWACS early warning and air-combat
management aircraft, which would be essential in establishing
air superiority over the Taiwan Strait.<sup>14</sup> <BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>WHY THE ROC DESERVES STEADFAST AMERICAN SUPPORT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Though Washington ended formal diplomatic relations with Taipei
in favor of Beijing in 1978, a long-standing bipartisan consensus
in the U.S., expressed in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, has
supported strong informal ties with the ROC. There are three reasons
why maintaining strong relations with Taipei is in America's interest.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #1:</b> The ROC is America's seventh largest trading partner,
following immediately behind the PRC. In 1995, trade with the
ROC totaled $47 billion. While Taipei maintains a $5.8 billion
trade surplus with America in manufactured goods, the U.S. had
a surplus of $1.5 billion in the export of services in 1994. Taipei
has a good track record of responding to U.S. concerns about trade
barriers, though differences still exist in the areas of intellectual
property rights protection, access to banking and insurance markets,
and some tariffs. Nevertheless, The Heritage Foundation has rated
Taiwan's economy as the eighth freest in the world, right behind
the U.S.<sup>15</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #2:</b> The Republic of China's transition to full democracy
reflects America's own commitment to democracy. When democratization
is completed after the country's first direct presidential election
in March, the ROC deserves to be considered a democratic ally
of the United States. The persistence of the Taiwanese people
in building their own democratic institutions and traditions despite
internal and external pressures is a testament to their courage
and determination. The American people traditionally have admired
democracies and often have come to their aid when threatened.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; <b>REASON #3:</b> Taiwan's democracy could have a positive influence
on China. China is experiencing a critical leadership transition
as President Jiang Zemin seeks to consolidate his power as Deng
Xiaoping fades from the scene. Over the last decade, Deng's economic
reforms have produced double-digit economic growth and expanded
economic freedom. Taiwan is well placed to advance this trend.
Despite the deep-seated political antipathy of China's leadership
toward Taiwan, both sides have rapidly increased their economic
and personal interaction in recent years. ROC-PRC trade now exceeds
$20 billion annually, and millions of Taiwanese have visited the
mainland for business and family reasons. The success of Taiwan's
democratic reforms could influence mainland attitudes toward political
reform in a positive way as more mainlanders learn how Taiwanese
enjoy both political freedom and economic prosperity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<b>STRENGTHENING DETERRENCE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Deterring China from taking military action against Taiwan will
be a major test of American leadership in Asia. Since 1979, three
American Presidents have provided the leadership necessary to
protect U.S. interests in cross-straits relations. That China
now feels emboldened to threaten military action against Taiwan
indicates that it senses political weakness in Washington. This
is understandable because the Clinton Administration has failed
to make clear to Beijing that its military moves are unacceptable.
When China occupied Philippine-claimed reefs in the South China
Sea in February 1995 &#173;&#173; causing alarm throughout Southeast
Asia &#173;&#173; the Clinton Administration did not issue a statement
of &quot;concern&quot; until the following May. When China &quot;tested&quot;
six nuclear-capable missiles only 100 miles north of Taiwan last
July, the Clinton Administration again did nothing but issue a
mild statement of &quot;concern.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration may have contributed to the uncertainty
in another way. In the October 30, 1995, issue of <I>U.S. News
&amp; World Report</I>, an unnamed State Department official discounted
the possibility of direct U.S. military action if Taiwan was attacked,
saying that &quot;we would not be in a position to react with
force. We would not elect to do that I'm sure.&quot;<sup>16</sup> Others in
the Administration have coined the term &quot;deliberate ambiguity&quot;
to describe U.S. policy in the event of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
Late last year, former Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye
told Chinese officials that &quot;we don't know and you don't
know&quot; how the U.S. would respond to an attack against Taiwan.<sup>17</sup>
Is it any surprise that, only three months later, Beijing is readying
another series of large military exercises designed to intimidate
Taiwan? <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The United States cannot afford to continue this policy of timidity.
President Clinton and Congress must work together to rebuild confidence
in American leadership and strengthen deterrence in the Taiwan
Strait. They should:
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Reaffirm the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act and make clear to China
that any attack on Taiwan challenges U.S. security interests.
Perhaps the most important message that Washington can send Beijing
is a forceful reaffirmation of the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act (TRA).
It was the intent of Congress in 1979 that the U.S. maintain the
ability to ensure that Taiwan's defense needs were met and that
China understand America's interest in a peaceful resolution of
Taiwan's future. The elements of the TRA which convey this intent
are:<BR>
<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
Sec. 2 (b): It is the policy of the United States &#173;&#173;
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(3) to make clear that the United States decision to establish
relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation
that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means;
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
(4) to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by
other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,
a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and
of grave concern to the United States;<BR>

<P>
(6) to maintain the capacity to resist any resort to force or
other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or
the social or the economic system, of the people of Taiwan. <BR>

<P>
Sec. 3 (a):... the United States will make available to Taiwan
such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as
may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense
capability.<BR>

<P>
(c) The President is directed to inform the Congress promptly
of any threat to the security or the social or economic system
of the people of Taiwan and any danger to the interests of the
United States arising therefrom.<BR>
<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration should remind China that these sections
of the TRA convey the clear intent of the American people. The
Administration also should make clear that the U.S. retains the
option to come to Taiwan's defense if it is attacked.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The TRA is a critical element in Washington's ability to deter
conflict in the Taiwan Strait. However, it is the Clinton Administration's
consistent weakness in the face of aggressive Chinese behavior
which threatens to undermine the value of the TRA. The Administration
should emphasize to Chinese officials that the TRA is a U.S. law
that guides American policy. To strengthen this message, early
in this legislative session, Congress should pass a joint resolution
reaffirming the TRA. Furthermore, it should insist that the Administration
fulfill its obligations under the Act, including its responsibility
to report to Congress any threats to the security of Taiwan.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Recognize the ROC's democratic reforms and urge China and the
ROC to resolve their differences peacefully. To bolster confidence
in Taipei, the Administration and Congress should acknowledge
Taiwan's emerging democracy. A former President or former Secretary
of State should be asked to lead the U.S. delegation to the inauguration
of the new ROC President. Taiwan's evolution toward democracy
belies the notion promoted by some Asians that democracy is not
suited to the Asian character.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; At the same time, Washington should privately urge both Beijing
and Taipei to resume the cross-straits dialogue which began in
1991 but was suspended last year. Washington should make clear
to both sides that they bear the main responsibility in resolving
their differences. Nevertheless, Washington should stress regularly
to Beijing that, given Taiwan's democratic evolution, blatant
threats will prove increasingly counterproductive.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Privately warn China of the consequences it will face if it attacks
the ROC. The Clinton Administration should warn China privately
of the consequences that would follow direct military action against
Taiwan. The Administration should warn China that, depending on
the degree of damage it inflicts on Taiwan, it could expect sanctions
ranging from the ending of most-favored-nation trade status to
a total trade embargo with confiscation of all Chinese assets
in the U.S., and that the U.S. will not rule out using force to
defend Taiwan. China also should be told that these sanctions
would likely receive wide support in the U.S. Congress and that
the U.S. will lead a vigorous campaign to press other allies to
join them. Finally, China should be told that if it attacks Taiwan,
the U.S. will undertake a fundamental reevaluation of its relations
with China, in which policies of economic and political &quot;engagement&quot;
could give way to policies that focus on China's breach of the
peace. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Exercise U.S. naval forces near the ROC during the period before
and after the March 23 presidential election to deter threatened
Chinese military action against Taiwan. The Clinton Administration
should order an aircraft carrier task group to be on station in
international waters near Taiwan during the period before and
after the March 23 election. This would demonstrate the U.S. commitment
to deterring conflict in the Taiwan Strait and to maintaining
freedom of the seas.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations
Act. It has been U.S. policy since 1979 to sell the ROC defensive
weapons sufficient to deter Chinese attack. As a response to China's
acquisition of the SU-27 from Russia in 1991, the Bush Administration
sold Taiwan 150 F-16 jet fighters in 1992. Should China's growing
military capabilities again threaten to tilt the military equilibrium
in the Taiwan Strait, the U.S. should be prepared to sell Taiwan
defensive weapons to redress the balance. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's purchase of additional SU-27s and its intention to co-produce
many more of this aircraft are troubling in this regard. The F-16's
combat range and weapons already are inferior to those of the
SU-27. Washington should provide the ROC advanced armaments for
the F-16, such as the advanced medium-range AIM-120 AMRAAM missile,
giving ROC F-16s a technological margin that ensures deterrence.
In addition, the U.S. should allow U.S. shipbuilders to sell conventional
submarines to Taiwan. The U.S. is the only country willing to
supply this sorely needed defensive system to the ROC. Likewise,
in view of the PRC's missile tests near Taiwan last July, it is
essential that the U.S. offer Taiwan advanced versions of the
Patriot missile defense system.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Should China attack Taiwan, the U.S. should be prepared &#173;&#173;
consistent with the TRA &#173;&#173; to resupply rapidly the ROC's
military weapons and munitions stocks. If China follows through
on threats to impose a naval blockade, the U.S. may have to supply
naval ordnance and replace ROC frigates that are lost. A naval
blockade also could lead to air battles, and the U.S. should be
prepared to advance delivery of F-16s and, more important, to
resupply combat missile stocks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Maintain a balance of power in Asia favorable to the U.S. by deploying
missile defenses. To deter China, the U.S. as soon as possible
should deploy not only theater missile defenses in Asia, but also
a national missile defense system to protect Americans. China's
willingness to use short-range nuclear-capable missiles to terrorize
countries in Asia was demonstrated by its missile tests 100 miles
north of Taiwan last July. Since then, Chinese officials reportedly
have told former Assistant Secretary Charles Freeman that China
may use conventionally armed missiles to terrorize Taiwan. Another
official stated that U.S. leaders &quot;care more about Los Angeles
than they do about Taiwan.&quot; Freeman reportedly viewed this
statement as a thinly veiled Chinese threat to use nuclear missiles
against the U.S. if it intervened to help protect Taiwan. Thus,
it is essential that the U.S. accelerate development and deployment
of theater anti-missile systems like the Navy's Upper Tier and
the Army's THAAD missiles. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's threats also make imperative the deployment of a national
missile defense system to defend Americans. As it threatens Taiwan
with missile strikes, China also may threaten the U.S. with nuclear
blackmail in the future. China is building up its nuclear missile
arsenal to include mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles.
A national missile defense system must be deployed to counter
this threat.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; China's threats against Taiwan are designed primarily to intimidate
the people on the eve of their first direct presidential election.
But they also stand as a challenge to the United States. Since
the 1950s, successive American Presidents have met this challenge
by ensuring adequate deterrence in the Taiwan Strait. But by reacting
timidly to China's military provocations in 1995, and even suggesting
that the U.S. would not come to Taiwan's assistance if attacked,
the Clinton Administration is undermining deterrence in the Taiwan
Strait. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Clinton Administration should begin immediately to reverse
this record of weakness. It should take steps to ensure that China
understands that the United States will not tolerate an attack
on Taiwan. Congress and the President should reaffirm the Taiwan
Relations Act, which will reassure Taiwan and warn China of U.S.
resolve, while urging both Beijing and Taipei to seek a peaceful
solution to their differences. If Beijing persists in its threats,
Washington should be prepared to deploy U.S. naval forces to help
deter Chinese military action against Taiwan. In the worst case,
if China does attack, the U.S. should be prepared to resupply
ROC military forces. Washington also must not rule out using U.S.
forces in Asia to help defend Taiwan.<BR>

Director, <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Asian Studies Center</a>, The Heritage 
Foundation: For the United States, as for China, this is a critical time. For the United States as well 
as for China, this is a critical relationship, one that will significantly shape the economic and 
strategic contours of the Asia-Pacific region. This is a region in which the United States has vital 
national interests at stake. Indeed, China's emergence as a great power, how it integrates into the 
international system or fails to do so, will be among the defining issues for the United States, for 
Asia, and for the international community for at least the first quarter of the next century. Our 
speakers today have played significant roles in the evolution and development of United States 
relations with China over the past 25 years. Looking ahead, their experience, both inside and 
outside the government, and their judgment should serve as useful and thoughtful guides in dealing 
with the challenges of the next century.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="free">CHAS FREEMAN</a>: Thank you very much, 
Jim. I'm going to go right into the subject of U.S.-China relations and a variety of issues that have 
arisen in those relations. 
 On one level, U.S.-China relations are flourishing. Economic interaction and cultural exchange are 
very healthy elements of Washington's relationship with Beijing, but political relations are deeply 
strained. They are drifting. The situation is highly unstable for several reasons which I will address. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The recent so-called summit meeting in New York between 
President Jiang Zemin and President Clinton was a great success in the sense that the highest 
aspiration of both sides was to prevent further deterioration in their relations, and that objective was 
achieved. The meeting accomplished virtually nothing in positive terms and left many questions 
unresolved. Indeed, it may have inadvertently confirmed a Chinese view that the United States is 
indifferent to the fate of Taiwan. The Taiwan issue, which is the central issue in U.S.-China 
relations at the moment, continues to be one that the Administration does not wish to address, and 
which the Chinese are happy to see the United States neglect.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is often stated in this city that the strain in U.S.-China relations 
on the political level is the product of some sort of succession crisis in Beijing, or of domestic 
difficulties in China. Neither proposition can stand up to scrutiny. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, the succession has in fact occurred. One of Deng Xiaoping's 
great achievements is to be a Chinese leader who turned over to others responsibility for leading the 
country while he was still alive--something that is rare in Chinese history and which will be a great 
contribution to Chinese political culture if others emulate it in the future. There are differences 
between leaders in Beijing just as there are differences in every capital between political leaders 
(we've just had an illustration of that in this city), but to describe this as a power struggle in terms of 
the 1950s, 1960s, or 1970s is a gross overstatement. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second issue that is cited is the four difficulties that China 
faces domestically, which some would call crises. I do not call them crises because they are not 
urgent; nor are they impossible to resolve. But there are four major difficulties facing the new 
Chinese government.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The first is a spiritual or ideological vacuum. The Chinese people 
are cynical about ideology, and nationalism alone now serves as a strong force for Chinese unity. 
Nationalism is not a congenial principle in terms of management of difficult issues like the Taiwan 
question.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The second problem is the pattern of Chinese economic 
development, which has rested on bureaucratic entrepreneurship. When bureaucrats buy and sell 
things, people buy and sell bureaucrats. In other words, corruption is the inevitable result. From the 
point of view of the Chinese populace, corruption is probably the central issue in Chinese politics at 
present. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The third problem is the lack of definition of relationships between 
the center and the provinces. This is not a crisis; things work. Thirteen percent economic growth for 
the last three years or so is not bad by any standard; it was 10 percent for the previous decade. Yet 
the center is trying to do things which it is incapable of doing, and the provinces are trying to do 
things which they are incapable of doing. The result is confusion and a measure of unpredictability 
about decisions that are important in economic and political terms. This is an issue which must be 
addressed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The final problem, I believe, is in the context of rising nationalism 
and an inadequate structure for civilian control of the military. I will leave that for a later 
discussion. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; These factors do have an influence on U.S.-China bilateral 
relations, but it is not the decisive influence. Let me simply make an obvious point. China now 
enjoys its best relations in history with most of the world's great powers. The relationship between 
China and Russia is the most equal and healthy that it has been in two centuries. Relations between 
China and the great powers of Europe--including Britain, where differences over Hong Kong have 
recently been set aside; Germany, which is actively courting China; and France, which after some 
difficulties over the Taiwan question has returned to the good graces of Beijing--are all as good as 
they have ever been in this century. Relations between China and Japan, due to careful management 
by both sides, have not been troubled as they were in the past. They are probably the best that they 
have been in many, many years. Relations with India are the best since the 1950s. Only the United 
States is an exception. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we look for why this is the case, perhaps we should look not in 
Beijing, but here. American relations with Japan and Britain are the least cordial and effective they 
have been since World War II. Relations with Germany are the least intimate they have been since 
the 1950s. Relations with France are the most strained they have been since the early 1960s. U.S. 
relations with Russia are deeply troubled, and relations with India still fall far short of their 
potential. So perhaps we should ask why China should be the exception in U.S. foreign relations, 
rather than looking for explanations inside China. Nevertheless, the fact is that U.S.-China relations 
have taken some very hard knocks over the past five or six years. Remember how this relationship 
began. It began at the outset of the 1970s, based on a common strategic concern with Soviet 
expansionism. It rested on several principles. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The first was to pursue, first, strategic dialogue and later, after 
1979's normalization agreement, strategic cooperation. The second was to live and let live in terms 
of ideological differences and the differences between the two societies' cultural and social 
traditions. Mutual tolerance rather than mutual harping and criticism were agreed. We set aside 
regional differences--even major ones about the Vietnam War at the beginning of the 1970s--in 
order to pursue these larger interests in cooperation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This relationship also entailed a series of very delicate 
compromises on the issue of Taiwan. These centered on American acknowledgment, and then 
recognition, of the principle that there was only one China and that Taiwan is part of China. In the 
first instance, this was a common belief in Taipei and Beijing. In the normalization communiqu, it 
was the position of the Chinese government recognized by the United States. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This principle of managing relations with Taiwan found expression 
in three communiqus. Let me review those briefly. The Shanghai Communiqu of 1972 
abandoned U.S. policies of containment towards China and reached a compromise on the Taiwan 
issue, taking the United States out of the middle of the Chinese civil war while expressing the 
expectation and hope that the Chinese parties concerned on either side of the strait would work out 
a peaceful solution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Normalization Communiqu replaced the strategic dialogue 
initiated in the Shanghai Communiqu with strategic cooperation. It strengthened the U.S. formula 
with regard to Taiwan, acknowledging the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China and that 
there is only one China. It recognized Beijing as the site of the only legal Chinese government and 
traded form for substance in U.S. relations with Taiwan so that the United States--within the 
context of recognizing one China and Taiwan as part of China--would be able to maintain 
economic, cultural, and other unofficial ties with the people of Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In August of 1982, the tacit normalization understandings about 
arms sales to Taiwan were made explicit and strengthened. China acknowledged that U.S. arms 
sales to Taiwan would continue, and the U.S. agreed to cap the quality of those arms sales and to 
reduce them step by step, leading over time to a final resolution of the dispute. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is the history. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the Chinese perspective, the United States has now strayed 
from or explicitly violated every one of the undertakings that I have just cited. This is the core of 
the problem from Beijing's point of view. From the American point of view, I would say, events 
from 1989-1991 destroyed the agreement to set aside ideology in the interest of strategic 
cooperation and replaced tolerance with strident criticism of Chinese human rights practices and an 
ideological confrontation, which has continued. These events then destroyed the strategic triangle. 
The Soviet Union itself -- the common enemy--disappeared. At the same time, Taiwan began to 
withdraw from the consensus it had previously enjoyed with Beijing, that it was part of China and 
that the division of China was an unnatural state of affairs which time and dialogue should repair. 
And, finally, over this period, the United States abandoned an effort we had conducted for 15 years 
to integrate China into global institutions. Increasingly, global institutions were crafted with China 
on the outside. That was the case with the Missile Technology Control Regime. It was the case with 
the Australia Group. More recently, it is the case with the successor to COCOM -- the New Forum. 
We thus have guaranteed that these global regimes will be a source of friction in U.S.-China 
relations. China will not be bound by rules that it did not participate in crafting. Frankly, none of 
these regimes can work because they exclude one of the principal actors with regard to their subject 
matter. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me turn now to the present and close. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This drift and the absence of consensus on a strategic framework 
for the relationship, the absence of strict adherence by either side to understandings that have been 
reached, and the emergence of a strong drive in Taiwan for a separate international identity have 
come together to produce the collapse of mutual confidence and trust. They have engendered 
Chinese effort to deal with the Taiwan issue separately from the United States. In the late spring, 
the Chinese saw Lee Teng-hui come here and Lien Chan (the Prime Minister) go to Europe. They 
saw an offer of a billion dollars to the United Nations for a separate seat for Taiwan. They 
interpreted these things as a major offensive by Taiwan against the status quo, and a breaking of the 
tacit modus vivendi which had preserved peace in the Taiwan Strait. Their response has been 
somewhat erratic but has settled down into the following pattern. You might call this <i>xuan ying 
jian shi</i> -- soft and hard policies simultaneously applied.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, the hard policy. It is clear that in the summer the People's 
Liberation Army received authorization to use force against Taiwan to re-impose a <i>modus 
vivendi</i> in the Taiwan Strait. Of the series of exercises to be conducted, two of six known to be 
scheduled have already been carried out. One is apparently about to begin. These exercises are not 
an empty show of force. They are a campaign of military intimidation which could, and may well 
as the coming year unfolds, extend into the actual outbreak of combat in the Taiwan Strait and even 
strikes against Taiwan targets. This campaign of pressure will continue until Taiwan returns to the 
<i>modus vivendi</i> from which it strayed over the preceding year. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On the soft side, at the same time that this pressure is being 
applied, the PRC has escalated indications of flexibility in terms of reunification. Without getting 
into detail, I can say that Beijing has very clearly signaled to Taiwan that many things which had 
previously seemed non-negotiable are now up for negotiation. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From the point of view of the United States, which had hoped that 
the Taiwan issue was behind us, this is a most unfortunate set of developments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There are many people in Taiwan who are convinced that the 
United States has a commitment to come to Taiwan's aid in the event that its actions provoke 
conflict with the mainland. They are not correct. There is no such commitment, and Taipei should 
not bank on such American steadfastness in pursuit of objectives that the United States has not 
endorsed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Beijing for its part contains many people, including senior 
members of the Chinese military, who are convinced that the United States will not intervene in the 
Taiwan Strait or come to Taiwan's assistance in the event of conflict arising. These people, too, are 
mistaken. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;They base their conclusions on the following factors: first, that the 
United States is legally stopped from intervening in Chinese internal affairs and that Taiwan is a 
matter of Chinese internal affairs: second, that the American performance in Bosnia and in Somalia 
demonstrates a lack of resolve which would also be played out in the Taiwan Strait; and third, that 
while Taiwan is a vital interest of China which the Chinese explicitly state they are willing to 
sacrifice millions of people and entire cities to manage, it is not such an interest for the United 
States. Nor is the United States prepared to make comparable sacrifices. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This is not a happy situation. In a legal sense, the Taiwan issue 
may well be a matter of Chinese internal affairs--that is not something I wish to dispute -- but in a 
strategic sense, it is anything but a local matter. The implications of conflict in the Taiwan Strait 
reach well beyond the immediate region of Greater China in two senses. First, I believe it is true 
that the region sometimes called Greater China -- that is, the region of "Straits China," the region 
from Shanghai to Hong Kong, including Taiwan -- will determine the future of China. The future of 
China will determine the future of the Asia-Pacific region. I believe it is most likely that the future 
of the Asia-Pacific region will determine the future of the world, at least for the next century or two. 
Second, if there is conflict in the Taiwan Strait the United States will indeed have to make a 
decision about whether we intervene or don't. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we don't intervene, I believe the strategic consequences are 
enormous. The United States has no intrinsic strategic interest in Taiwan, but we do have an interest 
derived from our responsibility for the strategic defense of Japan. That interest, plus his ideology of 
anti- communism, is what led MacArthur in 1949 and early 1950 to dissent from the Truman 
Administration's decision to let the People's Liberation Army conquer Taiwan without opposition. 
He sat in the imperial army headquarters in Tokyo. Like everyone before him who had sat there 
from the time of the Meiji restoration, he saw the strategic importance of Taiwan to Japan's defense. 
Therefore, when Kim Il-Sung attacked South Korea on June 25, 1950, the Seventh Fleet was 
interposed in the Taiwan Strait for two purposes: to prevent the spread of the Korean War and the 
outbreak from its existing borders of the Sino-Soviet bloc and, second, to discharge American 
responsibilities for the strategic defense of Japan. If the United States did not come to Taiwan's aid, 
and if we do not manage the Taiwan question in a suitable manner, Japan will feel betrayed. This is 
not simply a matter of strategic betrayal. It has emotional overtones. There are many people in 
Taiwan who have fond feelings for Japan and many in Japan who have fond feelings for those 
Taiwanese. This is rather unusual in Asia. In fact, Taiwanese are by far the most admiring of 
Japanese among Asians. This is a close emotional relationship. If Japan cannot count on the United 
States to defend its strategic interests, it must do so itself. That means Japan must assume 
responsibility for its own defense. That is Japanese rearmament. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If the United States does come to Taiwan's assistance in the event 
of conflict, we must use bases in Japan to do so. That will pose a terrible dilemma for the Japanese 
government. One strategic imperative of Japanese policy is to avoid a hostile relationship with the 
mainland of China. It would have to choose between that strategic imperative on the one hand and 
its interest in maintaining the U.S. alliance and its strategic interest in Taiwan on the other. I believe 
Japan would choose the United States and Taiwan. I also believe no future Japanese government 
would ever be willing to be put in a position again in which foreigners made such a momentous 
strategic decision for Japan. The result in this case would be rearmament, but at a slower pace. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So whether the United States chose to intervene or not, whether the 
PRC succeeded in bringing Taiwan within its orbit or not, the Taiwan issue has the potential to 
overthrow the entire Asian-Pacific strategic balance: not simply to poison U.S.-China relations for 
decades, but also to break the U.S.-Japan alliance and to reignite rivalry between Japan and China, 
with all of the implications in terms of an Asian pattern of containment of China that this might 
itself set off. Therefore, I believe the drift in U.S.-China relations, the failure of the United States 
and China to manage the Taiwan issue, and the very rash actions which Taipei has been taking are a 
great danger to the peace and security of the East Asian and Western Pacific region. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="hard">HARRY HARDING</a>: It's a great pleasure 
to be here this morning, and especially to see so large an audience, containing people every bit as 
knowledgeable about China as the four of us on this panel. The size of the crowd is not only a 
tribute to the convening power of <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">Jim Przystup</a> and his 
colleagues at The Heritage Foundation, but also an indication of the widespread interest in China's 
growing role in world affairs. As Chas Freeman has just said, China will be the determining factor 
in the future of the Asia-Pacific region.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Chas's remarks have focused on the Taiwan issue. I want to look 
more broadly at the U.S.-China relationship, organizing my comments around three headings. First 
of all, I will suggest why we have legitimate cause for concern about the future of China. Second, 
however, I will argue equally fervently that we should not exaggerate our concern about China, but 
should keep the rise of China in perspective. And finally, I'll draw the implications for American 
policy. I'll suggest that neither of the two policy alternatives most usually discussed--containment 
and engagement -- is a fully adequate or appropriate strategy for dealing with China in the decades 
ahead. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Why are we concerned about the rise of China?  Different people 
will give you different answers to this question. Some would stress China's domestic 
circumstances: that it remains a Communist country, or that it is not yet democratic. My concern is 
more with China's international behavior, and with the nature of the international community 
surrounding China. I can summarize my concern in the following four points:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First of all, we are concerned because we are seeing a dramatic 
increase in China's national capabilities, both its economic capabilities and, at least potentially, its 
military capabilities. We see rapid economic growth, we see significant increases (at least in 
nominal terms) in the official Chinese military budget, and we see a commitment to acquire force 
projection capabilities. We also know from the historical record that China is willing to use force to 
achieve its national objectives, even when others might argue that the odds are against it or that it is 
not fully rational in doing so.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, we realize that China is not a status quo power. It is a 
demandeur both regionally and, to a degree, globally. Its most obvious demands involve its 
territorial claims, most notably to the South China Sea and to Taiwan. It is also clear that China 
seeks major power status and the acknowledgment of that status by others. It seeks to expand its 
influence in the institutions and forums that make decisions economically and strategically for the 
region and the world. China's ambitions are being fueled by rising nationalism. This is not just an 
elite-sponsored nationalism; indeed, I do not yet see any concerted attempt by the Chinese 
government to fan the flames of nationalism. Instead, this is largely a popular nationalism, 
emerging among young people and urban intellectuals, many of whom we might have supposed 
were predisposed to the United States and to the West. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, China is not proving to be fully cooperative in various 
international regimes and relationships, both multilateral and bilateral. It is very skeptical about 
non-proliferation regimes, about arms control and disarmament regimes (especially in the nuclear 
field), about environmental regimes, about many global and regional economic regimes, and about 
some of the bilateral trade agreements that it has undertaken with the United States.
<p.
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, the environment surrounding China, a very important 
determinant of any country's international behavior, is not entirely stable. There are long-term 
uncertainties about the balance among the major powers in the region, and about their political 
relationships. There are important potential flash points around China's periphery, including the 
Korean Peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the South China Sea, and Indochina more generally. Key 
countries that are strategically important to China have uncertain domestic futures, particularly 
Burma, Cambodia, Mongolia, and North Korea. The collapse or the fragmentation of these 
countries could produce pressures or opportunities for Chinese intervention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But while all of these developments are grounds for concern, I 
want to emphasize that alarmist thinking is not warranted at this point. The Chinese make a 
distinction between <i>guanxin</i>, which means to be concerned about something, and 
<i>danxin</i>, which means to be very worried about something. My attitude towards China 
currently is much more one of concern than it is one of alarm. This is because each of the four 
points I've mentioned requires immediate qualification. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;First, let me return to China's capabilities. It is very dangerous to 
make the kind of straight-line long-term forecasts that figure so prominently in the discussion of 
China's future here in the United States. Although the Chinese may not be facing an acute or 
immediate crisis along any of the four dimensions that Chas Freeman identified, it is facing chronic 
problems that are potentially extremely serious. Indeed, one discovers that as one travels around the 
periphery of China, other Asian countries are at least as concerned about China's long-term 
weakness as they are about its long-term strength. Or, to put it differently, they are as worried about 
the unconventional security threats that would come from collapse as much as they are concerned 
about the more conventional security threats that would come from strength. In contrast, the 
analysis of China in the United States has not yet fully come to grips with the challenges to China's 
continued economic and social success in the middle to long term.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With regard to the military more specifically, to say that China is 
increasing its nominal military budget and is seeking to acquire force projection capabilities does 
not mean that China is in a position immediately to attain this kind of modern military force. China 
remains far behind the United States and other major powers technologically, and will remain so for 
many years. While we should monitor China's military preparations very carefully, I don't think we 
should overreact to them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, although China is not a status quo power, it also is not a 
revolutionary power or even a power that seeks major changes in the international system. In the 
1960s, China was exactly that: a revolutionary power that sought to overthrow every single major 
international institution from the United Nations to the World Bank and to promote revolutionary 
insurgencies throughout the Third World. Today, in contrast, China does not seek to undermine 
international institutions, but rather to expand its role within them, just as a claimant to major 
power status might be expected to do. Although this is a matter of some concern, it is not as 
threatening to the international community as is the behavior of truly revolutionary powers that 
regard the international structure as fundamentally illegitimate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Third, with regard to China's willingness to cooperate, I'm editing 
a volume on the patterns of cooperation in China's international conduct, which I hope will appear 
in print sometime next year. The basic thesis of the book is that, although China is by no means 
fully cooperative in international affairs, it has become increasingly cooperative over the last 150 
years. Chinese leaders have come to understand that they need cooperative international interaction 
to achieve their domestic and foreign objectives. They are therefore increasingly willing to work 
within international institutions and to forge cooperative relationships with other countries. The 
pattern of China's behavior--albeit more in the economic realm than in the security sphere--has 
increasingly been to accept the strictures of the international community. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, although the environment surrounding China is not 
entirely tranquil, still, in comparison with other regions, the Asia-Pacific region is one of the most 
vibrant and stable in the world. There are no power vacuums into which China can easily expand. 
There is a good chance of dealing constructively with the flashpoints and unstable countries around 
China's periphery. So the situation today is very different from the situation that confronted the last 
aspirant to major power status in Asia, namely Japan in the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, Japan 
faced a China in collapse and a number of European colonies in Asia at a time of European 
retrenchment. That was obviously a much more unstable and less vibrant international environment 
than we see in Asia today. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Let me turn finally to the third section of my remarks, about the 
implications for U.S. policy. I'm not satisfied with any of the three major alternatives which have 
been put out on the table in recent years. The first of these is one that I didn't even mention in my 
introductory remarks because, fortunately, it has begun to fall out of favor: a policy of fragmenting 
China, encouraging its breakup into its constituent regions and provinces. There's an internal 
contradiction in that policy that I've never been able to fully understand. If China were really so 
weak that we could cause it to break apart, then why would it pose such a threat to American 
security that a policy of fragmentation would be warranted?  Moreover, a policy of fragmentation 
would be guaranteed to ignite precisely the kind of Chinese nationalism that it is in our interest to 
avoid. And even if we were successful in catalyzing China's disintegration, the fragmentation of 
that country would be an extremely messy process that would have security consequences very 
detrimental to the interests of the United States and its allies. So a policy of fragmentation fails, 
with regard both to the end that it pursues and to the means that it entails.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Containment is, of course, the policy that is more frequently 
presented these days as an alternative to the Clinton Administration's approach. In my judgment, 
the analysis of China's intentions and capabilities that I have presented does not warrant a strategy 
of containing Chinese influence or seeking to hamper China's rise to major power status. Were we 
to do so at this point, we would find ourselves engaging in a self-fulfilling prophecy, creating a 
hostile China. In addition, we would find that no other Asian government -- not Japan, not South 
Korea, not Southeast Asia, not even Taiwan or Vietnam -- would join us in this undertaking. So we 
would be taking on China absolutely alone, condemning ourselves to an adversarial relationship 
with China and therefore to a second Cold War. If it's necessary, a containment policy can, of 
course, be adopted later. But it is by no means an optimal choice for the United States, and it is 
neither necessary nor desirable for us to select this strategy under present circumstances. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The alternative that the Clinton Administration puts forward is the 
policy known as "comprehensive engagement."  There are several problems with this strategy. One 
is that the key word, "engagement," has so many different meanings that it is very difficult to 
explain it to anyone else. It could denote, for example, a betrothal or an agreement to get 
married--certainly not what it means in this particular case. It could mean a military battle, which is 
what many Chinese believe that it means. Or it can mean a meshing of gears or a process of 
dialogue and interaction, which is what the Clinton Administration wants it to mean. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But even if we go beyond the semantic confusion that surrounds 
the term "engagement," we find that it refers to process without substance. Our engagement with 
China is guided by what vision, and directed at what objectives?  In the end, the concept of 
engagement is an empty one. It refers to dialogue and interaction but does not give a clear sense of 
what American objectives are. As short-sighted and ill-conceived as they are, at least the concepts 
of fragmentation and containment tell you very clearly what American goals towards China would 
be. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So what's the alternative?  Well, I've never been a good phrase-
maker, and I'm not entirely satisfied with the word that I will put forward. But I would recommend 
a policy of integration: attempting to integrate China into an increasingly vibrant community of 
nations in the Asia-Pacific region in which the United States is also an active participant. In other 
words, our policy should be to encourage the expansion of China's bilateral political and economic 
ties with its neighbors and its active and responsible participation in the emerging economic and 
security institutions that are being established in the Asia-Pacific region. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, people in the Clinton Administration might well say that that 
is what they mean by "engagement," even though they don't spell out their objectives quite so 
clearly. But I think there are some significant differences between a policy of engagement and a 
policy of integration. First of all, by talking of integrating China into a regional community, we 
immediately put our policy in a multilateral setting and not just a bilateral one. A policy of 
integration implies that we work together with our friends and allies in the Asia-Pacific region to 
enmesh China in a system of mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral institutions. In short, 
whereas engagement is an essentially bilateral strategy, integration is inherently multilateral, 
although successfully managing the bilateral relationship between China and the United States 
would be a prerequisite for its success. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Second, a policy of integration would require us to identify our 
common interests with China more clearly, as well as to delineate our concerns about Beijing, 
something that the Clinton Administration has still not fully done. We might say that we welcome 
China's emergence as a major actor in the international economy, including its ability to export to 
other countries, but that we are also asking that China open up its own markets to trade and 
investment from other countries, including the United States. We could make clear that we 
welcome China's growing prosperity, which is good both for the Chinese people and for the rest of 
the world, but that, at the same time, we are concerned about the environmental consequences of 
Chinese industrialization. We should indicate that we acknowledge China's right to national 
security and to a reasonable defense establishment, but that we are very concerned about the 
possibility that China's growing military capability could be destabilizing to the Asia-Pacific 
region, especially when not conducted in a transparent way. And we could say that we respect the 
desire of both the Chinese leaders and the Chinese people for political stability, but that we believe 
that genuine stability can be achieved better through a process of gradual and sustained political 
reform than through repression alone. That kind of statement, identifying both our common 
interests and our differences with the Chinese, would be an important element of an integration 
policy. Such a statement of American objectives has generally been absent from the articulation of 
our engagement policy thus far. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Finally, because of its multilateral dimension, a policy of 
integration alerts us to the importance of not just having a clear strategy towards China, but also 
promoting the stability and vitality of the region as a whole. Security threats are not produced 
simply by the rise of an ambitious or irresponsible major power. Rather, they are created by the rise 
of such a power in an international environment that provides it with either nettlesome provocation 
or easy opportunities. It's therefore very important for us and our friends in the region to maintain 
an international environment that sends a very clear signal to the Chinese: 
<p><ul>
<li>We welcome you into our international community on mutually beneficial terms.
<p>
<li>We are not going to do things that impinge upon your vital national interests. 
<p>
<li>We are not going to create easy opportunities for you to take unfair advantage of. 
<p>
<li>If you attempt to take unreasonable advantage of those opportunities, you will find that the 
community will come together to resist your encroachments and that it has both the resources and 
the political will to do so. 
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So in sum, although this policy of integration is obviously closer to 
engagement than it is to either containment or fragmentation, I think there are three differences: It 
positions the United States as part of an Asia-Pacific community seeking to integrate China, rather 
than focusing so narrowly on our bilateral ties with Beijing; it identifies our common interests with 
the Chinese, as well as the areas in which we differ; and it places as much emphasis on managing 
the regional setting surrounding China as on trying directly to influence Chinese thinking and 
behavior.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="feld">HARVEY FELDMAN</a>: I am not nearly as 
apocalyptic as Chas and I fear probably not as brief as Harry, so I hope you will bear with me, 
particularly because I want to examine the Taiwan leg of this triangular relationship between 
Washington, Beijing, and Taipei in a way that we haven't quite come to grips with yet. And the first 
thing I have to say is that it seems to me that for some 50 years now, our China and Taiwan policies 
have been built upon an interlocked set of confusions and misperceptions. From 1950 to 1979, we 
took the position that China's legal government somehow was lodged in Taipei. Since 1979 we 
have genuflected to Beijing's position that it is also the government of Taiwan. Each of these 
stances is as totally unrealistic as the other. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As Chas pointed out, successive administrations have said that our 
China and Taiwan policies are based on the three communiqus which he enumerated: Shanghai 
'72, the Recognition Communiqu '78, and the August 17, 1982, communiqu decreasing arms 
sales to Taiwan, plus something called the Taiwan Relations Act. There are substantial 
contradictions among these documents and an even more basic misunderstanding of what they 
mean in their legal effect. The three communiqus are policy statements by the Nixon, Carter, and 
Reagan Administrations. Although the Bush and Clinton Administrations also have adhered to their 
terms, the communiqus are not a body of law, international or domestic. Embedded in them is the 
famous "one-China policy" so often cited to us by White House and State Department spokesmen 
and others as the rationale for a policy which seems so often to be irrational. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Recognition Communiqu signed by Carter in '78 is the one-
China formula most often quoted: "the government of the United States of America acknowledges 
the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China."  This is a unilateral 
statement of position; it is not a treaty. Nor does it mean, despite what Chas has said, that the 
United States accepts the PRC position that Taiwan is a part of China. Had we said, for example, 
the government of the United States of America acknowledges the Chinese position that Mao 
Zedong sits on the right hand of God and has learned to brush his teeth, that wouldn't mean that we 
believed it. It would mean that we understand that is what the Chinese government believes to be 
the case. The acknowledgment formula is an elegant way of saying we hear you and we don't 
contradict you. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;By contrast, the Taiwan Relations Act, Public Law 96-8 of April 
10, 1979, is the law of the land. It establishes a continuing relationship between the United States 
and Taiwan on an unofficial basis to "preserve and promote extensive close and friendly 
commercial, cultural and other relations."  It also states that the United States considers "any effort 
to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means including boycotts and embargoes 
is a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United 
States." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The language "threat to the peace and security of the Western 
Pacific area" was chosen by the Congress for a very specific reason. It replicates the language of 
Chapter Six, "peaceful settlement of disputes," and Chapter Seven, "action with respect to threats to 
the peace," of the United Nations Charter. Moreover, in a statement which is reminiscent of the 
former Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China, the Act goes on to say, "the president is 
directed to inform the Congress promptly of any threat to the security of the social or economic 
system of the people on Taiwan and any danger arising to the interests of the United States 
therefrom. The president and the Congress shall determine in accordance with Constitutional 
processes appropriate action by the United States in response to any such danger." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;There can be no question that the TRA mandates a much closer 
relationship with Taiwan and with its people than is contemplated by the three communiqus and, 
of course, a much closer relationship with Taiwan than the PRC has wanted us to have. From Carter 
on, administrations have been pressured by Beijing to ignore the plain meaning of the Taiwan 
Relations Act and to cut back on that relationship. In varying degrees, all have been willing to do 
so, reinterpreting the law to suit policy considerations and presumed economic interests. These 
contradictions were much easier to deal with when Taiwan was, like the mainland, a police state 
with all the apparatus of repression, the political prisoners and so on and so forth. Under those 
circumstances the pretensions of the government on Taiwan could be and were treated with a kind 
of amused contempt, and the United States concentrated on getting on with Beijing while still doing 
business with and admitting students from Taiwan. And, of course, the central core of this policy 
was the need to add China as a makeweight in the worldwide struggle with the Soviet Union. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But now the situation has changed. Not only is the Cold War over, 
but in a remarkably short period of time Taiwan has evolved into a full fledged democracy. It is no 
longer that authoritarian police state. In fact, for the first time in all four thousand years of Chinese 
history, there is a multiparty democracy, a free press, no political prisoners, a representative 
Parliament in which seats are contested at election time. And the major opposition party was 
recently given license to own and operate a television station. Next March, the head of state on 
Taiwan will be chosen by free popular vote, again something unique in Chinese history. Moreover, 
the division of national income on Taiwan is probably the most egalitarian in all of Asia and far 
more egalitarian than here in the United States. To top it all off, the government in Taipei no longer 
asserts any claim to be the legitimate government of all China. It takes the position that within the 
broad historic and cultural entity of China, there are now two governments, that each of them rules 
a defined territory, that each has all the attributes of sovereignty that entitle it to recognition. The 
government in Taipei points out that the government in Beijing has never since its founding on 
October 1, 1949, ruled Taiwan even for a single day. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;So, under these circumstances, what should American policy be?  
Well, we're often given the mantra that goes: PRC is very, very large; PRC is a major military 
power; PRC is a growing economic power; PRC has a seat on the Security Council; Taiwan has 
none of those things. Therefore, the PRC is very, very important to us and Taiwan is not important 
at all, except perhaps, as Chas suggested, strategically in the case of Japan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I would make a different argument. Twenty-one million people, 
the population of Taiwan, is not an inconsiderable amount of people, unless you're comparing it 
with the population on the mainland. Twenty-one million people is, after all, the population of 
Australia plus New Zealand plus all the rest of the South Pacific combined. The PRC is much 
larger, but I don't know that size ought to be the criterion of American policy. If size were the 
criterion, we would have taken the part of Indonesia back in the Sukarno days when it was in 
confrontation with Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. In fact, if size were the criterion, we 
would never have founded NATO because, after all, the Soviet Union was very, very large and had 
a very large army and a seat in the Security Council -- all the things that China has. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In fact, policies should not be determined by size but by interests. 
We have a great many of these with the PRC, and they are often interests that deal with issues of 
global reach. We want PRC cooperation with the Security Council on non-proliferation matters and 
on specific problems of trade. In fact, the issues that we have on our China agenda are a great many 
indeed: PRC export of nuclear technology to Pakistan and perhaps to Iran; PRC shipments of 
missile components to Iran and perhaps Iraq; drug trans-shipment through Yunan; piracy of 
American intellectual property; the question of cooperation to restrain the North Korean drive to 
acquire nuclear weapons; export to the U.S. of prison-made goods; reneging on commitments to 
allow Red Cross visits to political prisoners; and, of course, the terms of entry into the World Trade 
Organization. This is without even getting into the question of PRC violation of the norms of 
human rights and fundamental freedoms as defined by the United Nations Charter and by 
international instruments which the PRC itself has signed. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The list is long and obviously contentious, but I have to say that 
the fact that it is long and contentious is not the result of American ill will. In almost every instance, 
everything that is on our agenda puts us in the position of asking Beijing either to make good on a 
promise which it had given us previously, to remain faithful to an international obligation which it 
voluntarily assumed, or to adhere to a standard agreed to by the international community at large. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From Beijing's point of view, of course, we look like an obnoxious 
bill collector who comes knocking at their door at all kinds of awkward times. But, in fact, the bills 
are important and the debts were honorably incurred. It's hard for me to take seriously the argument 
of some who say that by asking the PRC leadership to make good on these promises that they've 
given, and to live up to the agreements they have signed, we are convincing them that we have 
become a hostile power adopting a policy of containment. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We've often been told that how the U.S. behaves with respect to 
Taiwan is going to directly affect how the PRC responds to that specific agenda and, therefore, we 
have no choice but to reject Taiwan's hopes for better treatment at our hands because we need the 
PRC. We need the PRC, goes the litany, and we don't need Taiwan. Therefore, in the larger 
interests of regional stability and world peace, we have to take account of Beijing's sensitivities, and 
especially those sensitivities that concern Taiwan. But it seems to me that the claim that PRC 
behavior on regional and world issues is conditioned by how the U.S. behaves with respect to 
Taiwan is simply farfetched. How we deal with Taiwan will certainly affect our relationship with 
Beijing. It may mean that things might get pretty cold. But Beijing sold nuclear technology and 
missiles to Iran long before Lee Teng-hui was admitted to the United States to speak to an alumni 
group at Cornell. The PRC's claim that the entire South China Sea is their territorial water has 
nothing to do with Lee Teng-hui's visit or our sale of F-16 fighter planes to Taiwan. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact of the matter is, the policy Beijing adopts with regard to 
any of the items on our agenda responds to their view of their interests and, of course, to the 
exigencies of their own domestic and factional politics. Now I don't mean to suggest that their 
views are unimportant. They obviously are important. Nor do I mean to suggest that we should 
break off dialogue. Obviously, we want to continue. But there is no reason for us not to press our 
own interests with persistence and without hesitation, because they are our interests, and we should 
do so without any apology, no matter whether they refer to the Korean Peninsula, the South China 
Sea, the Philippines, or even Taiwan. I have never believed that we need or should take the view 
that a fruitful Washington-Beijing relationship has to be more important to us than it has to be to 
the PRC. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I want to point out that we do have interests in Taiwan as well, 
though they are not on the macro world level. About a million Americans have roots in that island. 
It is our fifth, perhaps sixth trading partner. But probably most important of all, it is an example of a 
one-time police state, a Chinese police state at that, that has transformed itself into a democracy. 
This is something that we should value, something we should want maintained, something that we 
should want maintained before the eyes of the Chinese people on the mainland because our and the 
world's interests would be enhanced if that example were imitated on the mainland.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As far as the strategic element is concerned, given PRC behavior in 
the South China Sea, I cannot conceive that it would be in our interest to have the PRC control both 
sides of the Taiwan Strait as well as the waters of the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the 
Philippines. This doesn't mean that we have to support Taiwan's claims or become its sponsor on 
the international scene. But I think it does mean that we should treat it with dignity and with a 
seriousness that its accomplishments deserve. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Public Law 96-8, the Taiwan Relations Act, speaks in terms of 
unofficial cultural and commercial relations with Taiwan, so it seems to me there was no reason for 
us ever to have made a fuss about granting a visa to Lee Teng-hui to speak to an alumni group at 
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Ithaca is not the navel of the universe. Indeed, it seems to 
me it was the continuing insistence of the State Department that granting such a visa would destroy 
the basis of our one-China policy that created this scandal and its aftermath. If the State Department 
says giving the visa is going to destroy our one-China policy, what can Beijing say?  It can hardly 
say anything less. Let me point out that in the year before we granted that visa, the Prime Minister 
of Taiwan, Lien Chan, spoke at a graduation at the University of Chicago, which is his alma mater, 
and his Foreign Minister Chen Fo had visited the United States twice. Beijing said nothing about it 
either time. Why?  This was all done very, very quietly. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I think, with Beijing and with Taipei, we should do what our 
interests and our honor require of us. I think our honor requires that we not turn our back on the 
government that has transformed itself into a democracy, and our interest requires that there be no 
aggression in the Taiwan Strait. Here I have to say that deterrence is a very, very important factor, 
and I agree with Chas we have to tell the people on Taiwan that they cannot count on our assistance 
if they crudely provoke Beijing to action. But we also have to say to Beijing that they cannot 
conclude we would stand idly by in the event of invasion, boycott, or embargo, exactly as is stated 
in the Taiwan Relations Act. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As far as Taiwan's hopes to raise its international profile, I think 
there are things in our interest that we can and should do. We found it in our interest to help Taiwan 
back into the Asian Development Bank. Given the fact that Taiwan has a hundred billion dollars in 
foreign exchange reserves, I see no reason why we should not try to have Taiwan enter into some 
form of association with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World 
Bank, and the International Monetary Fund. It's worth noting that Taiwan continued to be a 
member of the Bank and the Fund for nine years after it lost its General Assembly seat, making the 
point that you don't have to be a member of the General Assembly to be a member of the Bank and 
the Fund. It's also interesting to note that the PRC is that Bank's largest debtor. If Taiwan is willing 
to lend money to the PRC, I say let them do it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a name="sol">RICHARD SOLOMON</a>: This panel 
discussion has covered very rich and controversial material. Let me try to pull together some of the 
key points in terms of policy.
I should begin by saying that my political instinct--which over more than a dozen years of 
government work I've learned to trust--is that within a decade we are likely to be back in a military 
confrontation with the PRC. There are territorial and strategic issues of extreme importance to both 
the United States and the PRC that, without wise and engaged leadership, are very likely to impel 
us back in the direction of a confrontation. What I'll try to do here is to suggest there is a way to 
cope with these issues in a more constructive way than confrontation, but it does require a 
leadership commitment on both sides that I'm not sure is there. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The crisis in U.S.-PRC relations of this past summer ("mini-crisis" 
might be more appropriate) over a range of factors--the Lee Teng-hui visit, the Harry Wu 
case--played an important role in focusing our attention on issues related to the U.S.-China 
relationship that, frankly, we haven't paid much attention to. Since the Tiananmen suppression in 
the early summer of 1989, the United States has essentially been paralyzed on China policy. In one 
night of violence, as we all saw it on CNN, the political consensus in the United States for normal 
relations with the PRC was destroyed. It put the leadership in Beijing on the political defensive; it 
de-legitimized certain PRC leaders who were seen as responsible for the violence; and it made it 
very difficult to sustain a high-level dialogue between Washington and Beijing. As we all know, the 
secret Scowcroft trip to China in July of 1989, which was an effort to sustain a leadership dialogue, 
was roundly attacked in our domestic politics. And that has led to a situation where the ground rules 
for managing the U.S.-PRC relationship -- which were established during the Nixon Administration 
in the Shanghai Communiqu and the two subsequent joint communiqus on normalization in 1979 
and Taiwan arms sales in 1982 -- have now largely broken down.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;I think we also have to recognize that for the quarter of a century 
since President Nixon's visit to China in 1972, all the parties involved in this situation -- China, 
Taiwan, Hong Kong, the United States -- have really had a very good show. Everyone has benefited 
by the stability in the region induced by U.S.-PRC normalization. It has enabled China under Deng 
Xiaoping's reforms of late 1978 to make an economic takeoff that has put China on the path to 
national economic development for the first time since the early 19th century. The "self-
strengthening" effort late in that century failed with the collapse of the Ching dynasty, and there 
followed a century of foreign intervention and revolution. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The turmoil of that extended period prevented the Chinese from 
taking off economically in the way, for example, that Japan, the United States, and the nations of 
Europe did. So today, for the first time in that 150-year period, the Chinese have finally attained a 
high rate of sustained economic expansion. As you know, China today is growing at more than 10 
percent a year and is projected to become the largest aggregate economy in the world sometime in 
the second or third decade of the coming century.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Taiwan has flourished as well since the early 1970s. In the 25 
years since the secret Henry Kissinger trip to Beijing, Taiwan's per capita income has gone up 
tenfold, from a little over twelve hundred dollars to ten times that today. They've attained the kinds 
of reforms that Harvey Feldman has noted and have done spectacularly well for themselves. Today, 
of course, their interest is in trying to protect their achievements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For the United States, for the first time in over a century, we've 
benefited from good relations with all the major players in East Asia, especially Japan and China, at 
the same time. And our domestic economic growth has been fueled in large measure by exports to 
the booming Asia-Pacific economy. I call to your attention the just-released Heritage report on 
APEC, which identifies our substantial economic interests in the region.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If everyone has benefited from the situation that grew out of the 
negotiation of the Shanghai Communiqu, out of U.S.-PRC normalization, why is this mutually 
beneficial situation now breaking down?  If everybody is doing so well, why do we have such 
unease about the future?  I think our presenters today have laid out the major factors. A major 
consideration is the end of the Cold War. The rationale of "the China card," as we came to call it, 
enabled us to push off the agenda our concerns with many Chinese activities that are now at the top 
of the agenda. The human rights issue is, of course, only one factor. U.S.-China trade has grown 
tremendously, and now we're concerned about the trade imbalance and Chinese trading practices. 
We are concerned about the impact on sensitive regions of Chinese arms sales abroad. And Taiwan 
wants to find some way to stabilize its autonomy and give greater legitimacy to its 
accomplishments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, how can we fix the situation?  Is it possible to reestablish a 
set of political ground rules that will reactivate the pattern of interactions that have been so 
beneficial to all of the players in the China equation for the last quarter century?  I believe this can 
be done, but it requires an active U.S. leadership role. We have to help craft a framework for all the 
players, but without being too out-in-front on issues that are freighted with strong nationalistic and 
territorial qualities for all the Chinese parties involved.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Can we lead without being out in front?  As we see in President 
Clinton's cancellation of his November trip to APEC, our nation's leadership is preoccupied, for 
very good reasons, with domestic issues. It is difficult under normal circumstances to get our 
national leaders out to Asia. During my tenure at State, Secretary of State Baker spent only one 
night in Japan, as people will recall from criticism of that fact. Asia is a long way away, and our 
interests in the region compete in our political life with very complex domestic and international 
agendas, and to get Presidents, secretaries of state, and national security advisors out to the region is 
very difficult. I think President Clinton is due credit for elevating the yearly APEC meeting to the 
summit or heads-of-state level, but it is difficult to sustain a dialogue at that level. The question we 
face is whether we can focus our national attention on Asia, as we did over the summer because of 
all the tensions, in order to play the leadership role that we must play if we are to reset the political 
parameters on the sources of potential conflict in the region. To do so would serve our national 
interest in regional stability, but it's not easy to gain a claim on the attention of our national leaders 
in the absence of a crisis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If we don't do it, the passivity and drift in leadership that was 
induced after Tiananmen, the paralysis in our domestic politics about dealing with China, is likely 
to lead to initiatives by others who will force our hand and heighten tension as they pursue their 
own interests.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;One issue that was not mentioned this morning, but which should 
be seen as another source of potential trouble with the PRC, is the recession of Hong Kong to 
Chinese sovereignty in July 1997 -- something that is part of Beijing's 19th century agenda as it 
enters the 21st century. Hong Kong, as you know, was wrested from the Chinese by the British in 
the early part of the 19th century, and it will soon return to Chinese control. There is great concern 
and interest here about how that process unfolds. A set of basic agreements for Hong Kong's 
recession was negotiated in the 1980s between Beijing and London. Heritage has put out a good 
summary of U.S. interests as they will be affected by the transition in Hong Kong to PRC sovereign 
control. I personally am rather pessimistic that Beijing will handle that transition in a way that will 
provide confidence that it is abiding by its agreements with the British. My expectation is that the 
way Beijing handles Hong Kong as it takes over control will give Taiwan little comfort about how 
its interests will be dealt with in any reunification arrangement.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How do we try to reset some ground rules for the United States, 
the PRC, and Taiwan relations if the Shanghai Communiqu and the other parameters of the U.S.-
PRC relationship are no longer working well?  No one wants to play the role that General George 
Marshall played in 1945. One of the basic presumptions about U.S.-China policy that evolved after 
the failure of the Marshall mission to mediate the Chinese civil war back in 1945-1946 was that we 
don't want to get caught in the middle as these two parties deal with their differences. Taiwan is 
viewed by Beijing as an internal issue, and they are not interested in having us play the role of 
mediator. Yet what happens across the Taiwan Strait is of great concern to the United States. It 
affects our national interests in very important ways--and not just economically. Remember that 
East Asia was the site of our last three major wars.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Generally, we get into trouble, as we did in Korea in 1950, when 
we say we're not interested, when we don't pay attention. That leads others to say, "Well, if the 
Americans are not interested, then we'll pursue our own interests."  We have to lean forward, in my 
view, and indicate in more than just words that the peaceful resolution of these territorial and 
related issues is very much in the U.S. national interest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now what would be the objective of an American political 
initiative?  The core objective should be to make sure that the PRC-Taiwan situation does not 
become remilitarized. Beijing's missile tests and other military activities over the last six months or 
so have shown an inclination to remilitarize the Taiwan situation, which since the Shanghai 
Communiqu Beijing has approached in a political framework. It is in our interest, and in Taiwan's, 
to see that Beijing handles the Taiwan issue in political terms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Can it be done?  It seems pretty clear at the moment that the 
prospects for a successful negotiation across the Strait, which Beijing and Taipei have been 
pursuing for several years via the so-called Koo-Wong talks in Singapore, are not good. The 
question, I believe, is whether restraint will be shown on all sides, whether the deal that was struck 
between Kissinger and Chairman Mao will be sustained. In 1973, Mao told Kissinger that the 
United States and China had larger interests than a fight over Taiwan because of the Soviet 
challenge. "We don't need to resolve the Taiwan issue for a hundred years," said Mao. In effect, 
Mao was prepared to delay dealing with the issue far off into the future, as long as the United States 
supported the "one-China" principle, and to let circumstances evolve in ways that he would not be 
responsible for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Today, no Chinese leader seems prepared to compromise the 
country's 19th century agenda. While Mao put the issue on the shelf, it stands like a bookend at the 
outer limit of the country's politics. Beijing's recent military pressures on Taiwan raise the question 
of whether China's contemporary leaders are preparing to take the Taiwan issue off the shelf and 
seek a solution to their goal of reunification in the near term. This is not a question they totally 
control, but my impression, based on recent high-level discussions in Beijing, is that PRC leaders -- 
even the military -- say their first priority today is economic development.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Now, of course, their hope is that over the next 10 or 20 years they 
will sustain growth at 10 percent a year and acquire the accouterments of modern national power, 
including military power, and on that basis be in a stronger position to assert their various territorial 
and political claims.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But I believe today there is still common interest among all the 
parties involved to maintain stability and focus on economic growth. The challenge for the United 
States is to re-engage in a quiet way the various parties involved in this situation to reestablish 
political parameters which will sustain the mutually beneficial situation that persisted for the past 
quarter of a century. This will require considerable restraint on the part of both the PRC and 
Taiwan. In the case of Beijing, their handling of the Hong Kong transition will be a major mood-
setter for Taiwan and could substantially degrade attitudes in the United States about the extent to 
which Beijing will honor its international agreements. This situation also requires restraint on 
Taiwan's part about how it will handle the autonomy-independence issue. From my recent visit to 
Taipei, I have the impression that responsible people are thinking seriously about how to define that 
set of issues in ways that are not a provocation to the PRC. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In our own politics, since Tiananmen there has been a universal 
tendency to demonize the PRC. I would only note that our most recent ambassador to Beijing, 
Stapeleton Roy, says that much of the characterization of China in our domestic debate doesn't 
sound like the China that he lived in for four years. Having gone to China myself 25 or more times 
since the early 1970s, in terms of openness, social change, and economic transformation, what you 
see going on in that country is a set of developments which, if they are given sufficient time to play 
themselves out, are as likely to produce a China we can work with as they are a threatening China. 
But our tendency to demonize is very strong, and this may foreclose opportunities to deal 
constructively with Beijing.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ultimately, the issue comes down to the Administration and 
presidential leadership. We have a capacity to engage all the players involved if it is done in the 
right way. But one of the foreign policy dilemmas we have in the post-Cold War world is that our 
domestic preoccupations make it very difficult for our national leaders to pay attention to loaded 
international issues that, if handled badly or allowed to drift, may well impose great costs on our 
country down the road.

<title>At Summit, Put U.S.-China Policy On Solid Ground -- heritage</title>

<h3>AT SUMMIT, PUT U.S.-CHINA POLICY ON SOLID GROUND</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/lippen.htm">Brett C. Lippencott</a><br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 436<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	Sensing a dangerous drift in relations, President Bill Clinton and China's President Jiang Zemin have laid the groundwork for a U.S.-China summit on October 24, 1995, in New York City. A great deal of work needs to be done. The U.S.-China relationship is highly unstable and, although Beijing shares much of the blame, President Clinton has only made matters worse.
<p>	
	The Clinton Administration's China policy has been like a runaway car, careening from one side of the road to the other, always in danger of running off the cliff.  It is time to regain control of U.S.-China policies. Otherwise, both U.S. interests and the security and stability of Asia will be in jeopardy.
<p>
	President Clinton should make clear to President Jiang that the U.S.-China relationship should not be focused on only one issue, such as Taiwan, or even human rights. Rather, the relationship should be broadly based. In his discussions with the Chinese president, Clinton should concentrate on four major areas of concern: 1) trade, 2) Chinese arms sales and other military provocations, 3) America's ongoing relationship with the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan, and 4) the status of Hong Kong.  Discussing these issues would give the New York meeting a badly needed focus while finally putting U.S. China policy on more solid ground.
<p>
	<b>China Must Comply with Trade Agreements.</b>  China's inability or unwillingness to create an environment amenable to foreign business makes U.S. support for PRC membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO) impossible. Beijing has promised to open its markets to greater international participation by strengthening its legal system, easing controls on foreign exchange, removing non-tariff barriers, and opening protected sectors of the economy. However, China so far has not lived up to its promises. 
<p>
	Beijing wants to join the WTO to guarantee its continued economic access to the international community, a critical factor in its own economic advancement. China's leadership also feels that entry into the WTO would be another signal of international acceptance of China as a world power. But if China wishes to enter the WTO, it must accept the same entry standards required of every other country. This should be made clear at the New York summit.
<p>
	President Clinton also should insist that China abide by the agreement on intellectual property rights, which it reached with the United States in January 1995. Clinton should inform the Chinese that failure to enforce the terms of the agreement will invite U.S. sanctions and cause American corporations to reassess China's commercial attractiveness.
 <p>
	<b>Hold China Accountable for Arms Violations.</b>  President Clinton should make clear that if allegations of Chinese sales of intermediate-range missiles to Pakistan and assistance to Iran's nuclear weapons program are true, these actions will be considered dangerous violations of international norms. China must be held accountable for such acts and strongly encouraged to adhere to the international "rules of the road."  The U.S. cannot ignore violations of these rules.
<p>
	President Clinton should object strongly to China's hostile military actions in the South China Sea.  Earlier this year the Chinese navy took control of the Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef in violation of internationally established territorial norms.  This action challenges America's interest in freedom of navigation.  Instead of merely talking about the importance of open sea channels, the U.S. should take a more active approach and make clear that the U.S. 7th Fleet can and will protect these interests.  A statement of this sort would send the unambiguous message that America intends to continue playing an active role in the security of Asia.
<p>
	<b>Maintain Relationship with Taiwan.</b>  President Clinton must resolutely communicate America's intention to continue its unofficial relationship with the Republic of China, as defined in the Taiwan Relations Act. Though the PRC will ask, the United States should not yield to Beijing's pressure to deny visas for private visits by senior ROC officials, including President Lee Teng-hui.  The U.S. must not allow China to exercise a veto over U.S.-ROC relations.
	<p>
	China has shown flexibility by allowing Taiwan to participate in various international organizations, including the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the Asian Development Bank.  Using these precedents, President Clinton should urge the PRC to consider and support Taiwan's membership in the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and World Trade Organization and such U.N.-related agencies as the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
<p>
	It must be made clear to President Jiang that U.S. defensive arms sales to Taiwan will continue in direct response to the security situation in the region.  Thus, because the PRC's actions will have a direct influence on the nature and quantity of arms sales to the ROC, it would be in Beijing's best interests to refrain from intimidating actions, such as last July's missile tests conducted near Taiwan.  China also should scale back its military threat to Taiwan and re-open the high-level dialogue canceled in reaction to President Lee's June visit to the U.S.  The suggestion made by President Jiang earlier this month that he would welcome a meeting with President Lee should be praised as a positive first step in strengthening the strained ties between Beijing and Taipei.
<p>
	<b>American Interests in Hong Kong.</b> President Clinton should tell President Jiang that American confidence in the U.S.-China relationship will be damaged if Hong Kong's autonomy erodes after the reversion to China in 1997. Clinton also should express strong U.S. support for Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo), which was elected on September 17, 1995.  The current LegCo should be allowed to serve out its entire four-year term, free of any disruption that might arise when Hong Kong reverts to PRC rule. President Clinton should be adamant about maintaining a popularly supported legislative body in Hong Kong.
<p>
	Clinton also must make it clear that the U.S. intends to conduct substantial bilateral relations with Hong Kong up to and after the 1997 reversion to Chinese rule.  This relationship should consist of, among other things, 1) strong American support for Hong Kong's continued participation in international organizations that do not require sovereignty for membership, 2) an active American consulate general, 3) continued U.S. Navy port calls, and 4) an accelerated effort to complete outstanding U.S.-Hong Kong agreements.
<p>	

	China's emergence as a major regional and global power will be America's defining foreign policy challenge in the next decade. While the PRC's future will be decided by the Chinese, it is up to America and the international community to define and communicate to Beijing the norms by which it will be judged.  Taiwan, Hong Kong, China's military development, and trade are issues important to American interests in Asia.  How Beijing responds to these issues will be a test of its intentions and behavior in Asia and the rest of the world.  The key for the Clinton Administration in the coming months, and for the U.S. in the foreseeable future, is to conduct relations with China in a more stable manner, ignoring none of these overriding issues but at the same time allowing no one issue to derail the relationship.
<p>
	Engaging Beijing requires more than rhetoric and meetings.  It also requires a clear definition of U.S. interests and priorities that serve as the basis of what the U.S. does, not merely what it says.  Words about principle are not enough. U.S. actions must be clear enough to demonstrate unambiguously that American cooperation or opposition depends on how well China adheres to international rules of the road.  If nothing else, the October meeting provides an opportunity to define these rules, which serve U.S. interests, and to begin restoring a coherence to the conduct of the President's China policy that has been lost in recent years.

1996 found that only 14 percent of Americans regard  foreign policy as a top
priority in forming their vote. Nonetheless,  the American people still demand
that America have a strong  foreign policy that fulfills certain expectations.
These expectations  include maintaining America's leadership in the world,
upholding the  respect of other countries for America, and protecting  America's
interests and the country's future. Therefore, even though  Americans may
express little overt interest in specific foreign  issues, they have a latent
expectation that Presidents fulfill certain  expectations. Disappointing these
expectations can prove to be  politically fatal for a President.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American people are not isolationist; rather they are  largely
indifferent to foreign policy issues, focusing instead on more  immediate
domestic concerns. Isolationism implies America  must intentionally work alone
without allies, without concerning  itself with foreign matters at all.
Isolationism also implies trade  protectionism. Opinion polls show that
Americans are not  isolationist. They still want a strong America, although one
that relates  foreign policy problems to domestic concerns. Americans are 
worried about too much intervention abroad, but they understand the  need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  for the U.S. to remain engaged in
global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the end of the Gulf War, there has not been a  compelling issue to
ignite the latent interest of Americans in foreign policy.  If there were a
crisis with a clear impact on American security  and vital interests overseas,
foreign policy would return to the top  of political priorities in the polls.

<TITLE>Foreword</TITLE>
<H2>Foreword</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>

<P>	Much has been made of the collapse of state socialism and the post-Cold War global march 
toward free markets. In reality, however, progress has been slow--and in some parts of the world 
nonexistent. Even today, as the authors show in the study that follows, only a relative handful of   countries--and we are blessed to be among them--have truly free economies. And some of them, our own 
included, are backsliding.
<P>	The recent shift in the congressional balance of power provides U.S. policymakers with one of 
those truly rare opportunities to rethink the way the United States government conducts its business. One 
area in which such a reexamination is long overdue is foreign aid.
<P>	As Admiral James W. Nance, senior Republican staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee told <I>The Washington Post</I> shortly after the 1994 congressional elections, the 
amount of money the United States has spent since 1947 on foreign aid equals more than one-third of the 
federal debt. Much of it has been wasted.
<P>	U.S. development aid should have one priority, and one priority only: promoting the kind of free 
market growth that will enable the recipient country to prosper <I>without</I> foreign aid. If U.S. aid 
does not promote free market capitalism and self-sufficiency, we need to ask the question: Why are we 
giving it?
<P>	The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> provides compeling evidence 
that economic prosperity and economic freedom go hand in hand. Lasting prosperity cannot exist in the 
absence of economic freedom; and a free economy inevitably results in economic growth and rising living 
standards.
<P>	If nothing else, the November 1994 elections reflected the U.S. public's dissatisfaction with 
business as usual. Well-intentioned programs that fail to accomplish their goals--and in some cases 
make matters worse--can no longer be tolerated. The U.S. foreign aid program is a classic example of 
this: good intentions gone awry.
<P>	While U.S. and global policymakers and opinion-leaders have rightly placed considerable 
emphasis over the years on political freedom, economic freedom has received scant attention. It's almost 
as if the policy community has determined that it doesn't matter. But it does matter. In fact, it is the key. 
If a country has a free economy, it can lift itself--and its people--out of poverty. We see this today in 
Asia, Latin America, and even in the early stages in parts of the former Soviet empire. We also see that 
economic freedom is a breeding ground for political freedom. South Korea, the Republic of China on 
Taiwan, Chile, and many other emerging markets provide vivid proof that economic prosperity depends on 
the opportunities created by a free economy, not on U.S. aid, the heavy hand of government planning, or 
even advanced infrastructure and abundant natural resources. Freedom is what counts most.
<P>	Former Treasury Secretary William Simon told me after reviewing a draft copy of <I>The Index 
of Economic Freedom</I> that it may well be the single most important publication ever published by 
The Heritage Foundation, surpassing even the best-selling <I>Mandate for Leadership</I> series which 
guided the Reagan Administration in the 1980s.

<TITLE>Preface</TITLE>
<H2> Preface</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P> Despite the near total collapse of socialism around the world, most countries still do not have free 
economies.  This is the main conclusion of the<I> Index of Economic Freedom,</I> a comparative study 
of economic freedom in the world.  The authors of the <I>Index</I>, Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, 
have discovered that most rich countries are also the most economically free.  Conversely, their research 
shows that most poor countries have economies that are unfree.  Thus, economic freedom is a critical 
factor in the relative wealth of nations.  The more government interferes in the market, the more it 
hampers economic growth and lowers the standard of living of its citizens.
<P>	These issues, though subject to academic study, have never been addressed in such a 
comprehensive manner. Thus, this report should lay to rest once and for all doubts about whether 
economic freedom is integral to economic development.  As the conclusions of this study show, there 
can be no doubt that the more free an economy is, the higher the likelihood of economic development.   
<P>	The idea of creating an index of economic freedom has been long in the making.  Milton 
Friedman and other economists for years have explored ways to measure the relative economic freedom 
of countries around the globe.  Groundbreaking work was done by the Fraser Institute and others to build 
the academic foundation upon which an index could be built.  However, in the mid-1980s analysts at The 
Heritage Foundation began thinking about ways to create an index that would be useful to policymakers, 
particularly with respect to allocating levels of foreign aid.  We were looking for a "user friendly" version 
of the index that could unambiguously show policymakers and investors the positive relationship between 
economic freedom and wealth.   
<P>	Thus was born The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I>, the first study of 
its kind.  It measures the economic freedom of over 100 countries according to the most important 
economic factors determining economic freedom, such as taxes, tariffs, and protection of private 
property.  Not all economic factors could or even should be examined.  Our task was to find accurate data 
for the most important factors, and then to provide the most comprehensive and accurate comparison 
possible. That is what the authors of the<I> Index</I> have done.  Avoiding paralyzing academic debates, 
the authors focus on what is known, and not on what can never be known.  The result is the most accurate 
snap-shot possible of how the countries of the world measure up to the standards of economic freedom.
<P>	There will be many uses for the <I>Index</I>.  Policymakers will find it helpful in determining 
whether Third World countries should be receiving foreign aid; that is, whether it will be squandered in 
economically unfree countries. They can discover that the main cause of poverty around the world is not 
the failure of rich countries to spread the wealth through foreign aid programs, but the misguided 
economic policies of developing countries themselves.  They also will find a paradox: The countries that 
appear to most need U.S. aid are the ones that least deserve it because their government-controlled 
economies will misuse the money.  By the same token, the countries that are least likely to squander U.S. 
aid because they have free economies are the countries that least need it.  Either way, there seems to be 
less of a need for so-called development aid.  The key to economic prosperity in the developing world is 
not foreign aid, but economic freedom.
<P>	Investors should find the<I> Index</I> to be useful as well.  While many countries are 
encouraging foreign investment through privatization and other means, and have more open economies 
than they did a few years ago, the report shows that the countries' economic "fundamentals" can be more 
important to investors than the strengths or weaknesses of particular companies or business sectors.  
These fundamentals include tax rates, the stability of the currency, trade policy, private property rights, 
and other factors considered by the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.
<P>	The<I> Index</I> should be a first stop for any investor who wishes to explore economic 
opportunities in a particular country or region. With the<I> Index</I>, economic trends can be discerned 
and regional comparisons can be made. While investment decisions always require in-depth and hands-on 
research by the companies themselves, the <I>Index</I> can be used as a starting point of research, 
particularly regarding investment decisions in developing countries.
<P>	Finally, the study should be an indispensable source of primary data and bibliographical 
references on the world's economies.  The authors use the most up-to-date information available.  They 
also have assembled an impressive bibliography that not only attests to the depth of their research, but can 
point other researchers in the right direction in their work.
<P>	Future editions of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> will enable readers to compare 
countries over time. Thus, trends in economic freedom will be established, which should be particularly 
useful to policymakers who are concerned with assessing the impact of foreign aid.
<P>	This report is a tremendously important undertaking of which I and the rest of the Heritage staff 
are justly proud.  It should show, once and for all, that economic freedom is no less important than 
political freedom.  As a human right which governments should be bound to protect, if for no other reason 
than concern for the general welfare of its citizens, economic freedom is a critically important key to the 
well-being of people.  It can be a measure not only of how free a person is, but of how rich or poor.  This 
is a powerful, even revolutionary idea.  If applied around the world, it could transform the world's 
economy.   It is in the hope that this report will contribute to that end that I present The Heritage 
Foundation's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.

<TITLE>Acknowledgments</TITLE>
<H2> Acknowledgments</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	We would like to express our appreciation to several individuals who helped to make the 
<I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> possible.  We thank Dr. Kim R. Holmes, Vice President and 
Director of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, who edited the study, 
and Larry Di Rita, his Deputy, for providing invaluable assistance and support for the project.  
Richard Odermatt and Tom Timmons bore the brunt of the<I> Index's</I> considerable 
production work.  Their good cheer was most welcome.  Rob Chase of the Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies staff was extremely helpful with managing data.  Dr. Edward L. Hudgins, now of the 
Cato Institute, deserves credit for laying much of the foundation of the <I>Index</I> several years 
ago while serving as Director of the Center for International Economic Growth at The Heritage 
Foundation. 
<P>	Countless individuals serving with various accounting firms, businesses, research organizations, 
U.S. government agencies, embassies in Washington, and other organizations cooperated in providing us 
with data.  Their assistance, which so often went beyond our expectations, is much appreciated.  
<P>	The contribution of two individuals deserves special attention.  Christian Asis and Rebecca 
Schaefer, participants in The Heritage Foundation's summer internship program, were indispensable to the 
development of the <I>Index</I>.  It was Christian and Becky who did the legwork, tracking down data 
while exercising excellent judgment in the process.  Their unfailing good spirit and commitment were 
exceptional.
<P>	We would like to thank the Fraser Institute of Vancouver and the many scholars who have 
participated in its Rating Economic Freedom Project for doing groundbreaking work on measuring 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>  
<P>	Finally, we are grateful for the advice and criticism from the experts who reviewed this study. 
Richard V. Allen, Dr. James B. Burnham, Dr. Stuart M. Butler, Nicholas Eberstadt, Dr. Leonid Grigoryev, 
Dr. Henry R. Nau, Thomas L. Rhodes, Dr. Gerald W. Scully, and Hon. William E. Simon all helped to 
make this a better book.
<P>	Of course, we alone bear responsibility for the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Therefore, 
any shortcomings belong to us.

<TITLE> Executive Summary </TITLE> 
<H2> Executive Summary</H2> 
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	The idea of producing a "user-friendly" Index of Economic Freedom for policymakers was born at  The Heritage Foundation in 1989.  The purpose then, as it remains today, was to develop an index that 
measures the extent of economic freedom in countries around the world.  To this end a set of objective 
economic criteria has been established to grade over 100 countries. While there are many theories about the origins and causes of economic development, the findings of this study are conclusive: those countries with the most economic freedom have higher rates of economic development than those with less economic freedom.
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom measures how well these countries score on a list of ten economic factors.  The higher the score, the more government interference in the economy (hence, the less economic freedom there is). The factors are: 
<UL><B>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>

<P>	The study demonstrates unequivocally that countries with the highest level of economic freedom (the lowest Index score) also have the highest living standards (see following chart).  Likewise, countries that have the least amount of economic freedom (the highest Index score) have the lowest living standards.
<P>	A comparison of the Index scores also demonstrates an interesting phenomenon: wealthy and 
economically free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic freedom (see chart). As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare and other social programs that were not affordable when they were poorer. Thus, after they have become economically "liberated," countries like Germany, Sweden, and even the United States tend to fall back down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore. These "Asian tigers" are still growing and developing and have not yet begun to restrict their economies with post-industrial welfare and environmental policies. This phenomenon, when displayed graphically, is called the Curve of Economic Freedom. It shows that economic freedom can rise and fall and that the seeds of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.
<P>	Another conclusion of this report concerns how fast developing countries with free economies grow. The data and scoring show that developing countries that pursued economic liberalization quickly became the richest in the world. Conversely, developing countries that did not pursue economic liberalization remained poor (see chart). Clearly, the path to prosperity is paved by economic liberalization and maximized economic freedom. This is a lesson which all developing countries should learn.
<P>	For example, Hong Kong and Singapore have the highest amount of economic freedom in the world.  In these countries consumers and businesses are free from most government intrusion.  Their economies are based on the mutual consent of individuals to buy, sell, and dispose of property as they see fit.  As a result, they have had extremely high levels of economic growth. Between 1980 and 1991, Hong Kong's gross national product grew at an average rate of 5.6 percent, while Singapore's economy grew at an average rate of 5.3 percent over the same period. While their economic wealth is less than that of some industrial democracies, Singapore's and Hong Kong's economies are catching up quickly with the Western world.  These countries someday may even surpass the U.S. and Germany in per capita GDP if current trends continue.
<P>	In contrast, countries like Angola, Bangladesh, and Haiti have the least amount of economic growth.  These countries have done little to unleash the entrepreneurial forces in their economies.  Instead, they have followed the self-destructive path of central government control and state intervention in the economy.  As a result, they are among the world's poorest nations. Other countries scored poorly as well, such as the newly formed independent republics of Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine.  Their problems stem from slow progress toward free market reforms.  Their economic problems are the worst in the former Soviet Union. 
<P>	Former Marxist countries which have made rapid progress toward maximizing economic freedom are doing relatively well: the Czech Republic and Estonia, for example, score well on the Index.  The Czech Republic has halted an economic decline. It probably will have a respectable growth rate of 3 percent in 1994.  The Bank of Estonia estimates the GDP growth will be in the 3 percent to 5 percent range in 1994.  These countries have managed to begin the process used by Hong Kong and Singapore to promote large economic growth rates by maximizing economic freedom.
<P>	Above all, these findings disprove the assertion that economic growth can be bought by huge transfers of wealth from the industrialized economies to the less developed world.  People in Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, and Ukraine are not poor because wealthy people in the West do not share their riches.  They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic policies that depress free enterprise.  Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free market will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise, but inhumane.

<H3>Why an Index of Economic Freedom?</H3>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>	The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) for years has been giving aid to 
developing countries whose economies are over-regulated, protected by trade barriers, and state-
controlled. Nevertheless, despite billions of dollars of U.S. development aid, most of these countries 
are still poor. The reason is simple: their governments have done little to promote economic 
freedom. Quite simply, the recipient countries are destroying their own economies.  Not only has 
U.S. development aid been wasted, it has actually retarded economic development in the countries 
that receive it. Not one country receiving foreign aid has succeeded in developing sustained 
economic growth.
<P>	It should be no surprise that U.S. aid has done so little to bring about global economic growth. 
The experience of the past three decades shows that economic policy, not aid, is the main factor in 
moving from the ranks of developing to middle and high income countries. For example, the economies 
of Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the "Asian Tigers," expanded their gross domestic product by a rate 
of 6 percent each year between 1960 and 1985.  During this period of rapid development, neither Hong 
Kong nor Singapore received significant amounts of development aid.
<P>	Indeed, these and other Asian countries would not have grown so much if the crutch of foreign 
aid had been available.  If Hong Kong had been flooded with aid, as was Tanzania, it probably would be 
closer to Tanzania's status as the world's second poorest country.  In reality, Hong Kong is one of the 
world's most dynamic economies, growing at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent from 1980 to 1991. 
<P>	The potentially perverse effect of development can be seen in the recent history of Chile. In 
1973, Chile was the world's second largest recipient of foreign aid.  It also had a stagnating economy. 
Under the leadership of Marxist President Salvador Allende, Chile's GDP shrank 5.6 percent in 1973.  As 
with many Latin American countries, the government controlled a large part of the Chilean economy, 
estimated to be around 75 percent of the GDP.
<P>	However, by 1990, Chile's economy changed dramatically.  General Augusto Pinochet launched 
a market reform program that drastically cut back on government intervention in the economy. The 
Chilean government controlled only 25 percent of the economy after Pinochet's privatization program 
was largely complete. As a result, Chile has developed one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  
A GDP growth rate averaging 7.3 percent per year since 1988 has dramatically improved the lives of the 
Chilean people. For example, the infant mortality rate has been reduced as life expectancy has gone up.
<P>	It was with this understanding of economic development in mind that the authors undertook to 
measure the relative economic freedom of most countries in the world. The <I>Index of Economic 
Freedom</I> represents an excellent tool for deciding how best to allocate development aid.  Using it 
would help to ensure that foreign aid is not sent to countries that repress economic freedom and have no 
chance of growing economically.  Countries scoring well or improving on the<I> Index</I> would be 
eligible for development aid if they were using the money in constructive ways--i.e., to help construct the 
building blocks of a free market economy. However, using aid to pay for building stock markets, a banking 
system, and other elements of a free market will always be dwarfed in importance when compared to the 
economic policy decisions of the host country. The greatest advantage of the Index is to ensure that U.S. 
development aid does no harm and is not wasted on countries that demonstrate no commitment to 
economic reform.
<P>	The<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> is not a tool for deciding whether or not to dispense 
humanitarian aid or to promise aid for reasons of national security. A foreign country's economic 
policies have always been and undoubtedly will continue to be irrelevant when deciding whether to offer 
relief to people suffering from hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Moreover, for reasons 
of national security, the U.S. should continue providing foreign aid when necessary to bolster allies 
abroad.
<P>	There is yet another use for the <I>Index</I>.  Investors around the world would benefit from 
knowing  how well countries score on the "fundamentals" of economic freedom.  Although the<I> 
Index</I> would be of  little use in judging the advisability of specific investments or in discerning the 
relative strength of specific business sectors, it could be useful in understanding the overall economic 
environment inside a country and whether the economic trends are favorable to future investments.  
Moreover, the <I>Index</I> would be more useful as a starting place in judging investment opportunities 
in underdeveloped countries than in the advanced democracies.  The relative economic performances of 
underdeveloped countries tend to be less known than those of Western nations.  And perhaps more 
important, an understanding of the economic "fundamentals" would be more important in assessing risk 
for the lesser developed nations.   The economies of poorer countries tend to be unpredictable and 
difficult for investors to understand.  The <I>Index</I> should help them to improve their understanding.

<P>	The U.S. will spend over $13 billion on foreign aid in 1994.  This brings total U.S. bilateral aid      
since 1946 to close to half a trillion dollars.  Of the $13 billion spent in 1994, AID will distribute $2.4      
billion in bilateral economic assistance directly to specific countries.  In addition, the U.S. will give almost a billion dollars in economic support to the former Soviet Union, $1.9 billion through international financial institutions including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and $2.4 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF), which are used to advance U.S. political and security interests.

<H3>Where We Are Going in Foreign Aid</H3>  
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	The Clinton Administration in 1994 made a bid to reform foreign aid. After countless   
commissions and blue ribbon panels over the years, President Clinton introduced the Peace,   
Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994 (PPDA).  Many thought this would be the year in which   
the foreign aid program would finally be revamped.  
<P>	This, however, was not to be. The Clinton foreign aid reform plan ran out of steam, falling prey to   
politics and other priorities. The Senate Democratic leadership was unwilling to devote the floor time that   
the PPDA required. The reason: doing so would have given Clinton critics a stage for complaints against   
the President's foreign policy. Senate Democrats also were hesitant to direct congressional attention   
away from the health care debate.  Thus, the PPDA never made it to the floor for a vote.  
<P>	The PPDA was a weak attempt to reform foreign aid. It failed to address one of the fundamental   
problems of development aid: how best to use foreign aid to advance economic freedom and, as a result,   
spur economic development. <FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>   The central idea of the Clinton reform  
plan was something called   
"sustainable development." In this idea, the state manages the economy, trying to create "sustainable"   
economic growth without harming the environment or unleashing a "population explosion." But the results   
of this approach will be the exact opposite of the free market-driven growth the Administration claims to   
champion. By increasing government intervention in the economy--with intrusive environmental   
regulations and industrial policies--the Clinton plan will only strangle economic growth.  
<P>	The battle over reforming foreign aid is by no means over. AID Administrator J. Brian Atwood   
believes that the U.S. foreign aid program must be reformed or face budget cuts by skeptical legislators.   
But for foreign aid reform to succeed, more will have to be done than pouring old wine into new bottles,   
as the Clinton Administration has done. The greatest weakness of the Clinton approach is that it continues   
to give aid to countries that waste it.  Moreover, the programming emphasis of the Administration is   
wrong, focusing largely on population control and environmental protection efforts, not on economic   
growth.  Unless the purpose of U.S. development aid is to spur free market-reforms and economic   
growth, it will only prop up failing economies, doing more harm than good.  
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom is the ideal mechanism for judging which countries should   
receive foreign aid. This was the conclusion of George M. Ferris, Jr., Chairman of the President's   
Commission on the Management of Aid Programs (1992), who urged AID to establish an Index of   
Economic Freedom for the purpose of allocating development aid among countries. Representative   
Robert Livingston, then ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Foreign Operations   
<P>Subcommittee, stated on the House floor last spring that the Republican Party should "expand on [the   
Index of Economic Freedom] and ultimately adopt it in our foreign aid program."<FONT SIZE="-2"> 
(2)</FONT>    
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom, rooted in the recognition that free markets are the only means   
toward development, should be the foundation of U.S. foreign aid reform legislation. By using the Index,   
policymakers can identify which countries are making progress toward free market reforms and which   
ones are not. Countries reforming their economies could use specially targeted aid to help build market   
institutions. Aid also could provide leverage in persuading developing countries to make market reforms.   
While it may be true that reforming countries over time will have less need for foreign aid, temporary   
assistance can help jump start the process of reform. The ultimate and ideal goal, however, should be to   
end dependence on aid altogether. It is with this goal in mind that the Index of Economic Freedom was   
developed.

<H3>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</H3>   
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	There are many factors that could be used to determine how much economic freedom    
exists in a country.  Economic relations between individuals are restricted to a varying degree by    
government intervention.  By looking at such economic factors as taxes, international trade, and    
banking, the extent to which economic freedom is encouraged or hindered can be discerned.    
</P>










<P><UL>
<B>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</B><BR>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>
4. Monetary Policy<BR>
5. Capital Flows and Foreign Investment<BR>
 6. Banking Policy<BR>
7. Wage and Price Controls<BR>
8. Property Rights<BR>
9. Regulation Policy<BR>
10. Black Market</UL>

<P><B>The Grading Scale.</B> Under each factor is a grading scale.  The scale runs from 1 to 5 with    
1 being the most free and 5 the least free. After each score is either a "-," "+," or "stable" mark.  These    
indicate whether a country is getting worse, better, or staying the same, respectively, in each category.   
<P>	Countries were ranked according to four categories of economic freedom.  Countries receiving    
an Index score of 1.99 or less are considered to have economies that are "free."  Countries scoring    
between 2.00 and 2.99 have economies that are "mostly free."  For scores of between 3.00 and 3.99,    
economies were ranked as "mostly not free."  And economies that obtained a score of 4.00 and above are    
"repressed."   
<P><B>The Sources.</B> In grading the countries, the most recent available information and statistical    
data were used. Where primary sources were not available, secondary sources were used. These cases are    
footnoted accordingly. In each section, a general list of sources is provided for each country. Unless    
otherwise footnoted, these are the main sources used to grade each of the countries.  A general    
bibliography appears at the end of the study.   
<P><B>	Choosing Which Countries to Score.</B> One of the prime motives for developing    
the Index of Economic Freedom is to provide policy makers with a guide for dispensing aid among    
countries. Thus, this edition of the Index rates most current or traditional recipients of significant ($5    
million annually) amounts of U.S. foreign aid.  Some countries, such as Rwanda, Somalia, and Zaire, were    
omitted mainly because reliable data to score their economies were not available. However, this poses no    
significant problem because U.S. aid to these countries is strictly humanitarian; by no measure is it    
contributing to sustained economic growth. Some major industrial and trading countries are included,    
largely for a point of comparison. As the results demonstrate, the respect these countries show for    
economic freedom generally stands in stark contrast to that of countries of the developing world.    
Additionally, a few countries of strategic importance to the U.S., including Mexico and China, were    
included. Future editions of <I>The Index of Economic Freedom</I> might consider even more than the    
current 101 countries.   
<H3>THE FACTORS<BR>   
Factor #1: Trade Policy.<FONT SIZE="-3">[1]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Trade policy is a key factor in measuring economic freedom. The degree to which a government    
hinders the free flow of foreign commerce has a direct bearing on economic growth. Trade policy, in fact,    
is a key factor in industrialization of developing economies. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>     
International trade enables a country's    
industries to maximize production by allowing them to import raw materials and foreign goods and    
services that are cheaper than those produced at home. It can also offer a country greater access to a large    
world market, which can be the source of much wealth.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average tariff rate is used to score a country's trade policy. A    
score of 1 through 5 is given based on a country's tariff rate--the higher the tariff rate, the worse the    
score. Sources to determine the average tariff rate were derived from reports issued by the General    
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  When the average    
tariff rate was not available in these sources, the authors determined the average rate by calculating the    
revenue raised from tariffs and duties as a percentage of total imports. Most of the average tariff rates are    
valid for 1992. In some cases, adequate average tariff rate figures do not exist.  In these cases, the authors    
used publications from the United States Trade Representative's office, the Commerce Department, and    
the State Department. These instances are footnoted. <FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  Such non-tariff   
barriers as trade quotas, overly    
strict licensing, or import inspections also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a    
country's score based solely on tariff rates was moved one point higher on the scale, representing    
decreased economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. has an average tariff rate of 3.6 percent.  Based on a scale    
measuring tariffs alone, it would be given a score of 1.  However, because the U.S. maintains non-tariff    
barriers, such as import quotas on textiles and sugar, it was given a total score of 2.   
<H3>Grading Scale</H3>   




























<BR>
<BR><PRE>
	Levels 		  
	of 
Score	Protectionism	Criteria	
-----	-------------	--------
1	Very low	Average tariff rates less than 4 percent
			and/or very low non-tariff barriers. 

2	Low		Average tariff rate 5 percent to 9 percent 
			and/or low non-tariff barriers.  

3	Moderate	Average tariff rate 10 percent to 14 
			percent and/or moderate non-tariff barriers.  

4	High		Average tariff rate 15 percent to 19
			percent and/ or high non-tariff barriers.  

5	Very high	Average tariff rate 20 percent and higher 
			and/or very high non-tariff barriers that 
			virtually close the market to imports.  
</PRE>   
  

<H3>Factor #2: Taxation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[4]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Taxes are a key factor in measuring economic freedom. While every country taxes economic    
activity to pay for national defense, public health, and other vital government services, too much taxation    
stifles individual entrepreneurship. A tax is essentially a government-imposed disincentive to perform the    
activity being taxed. For this reason, exorbitant taxes slow economic growth. When analyzing this factor,    
taxes on corporate profits, income, and other significant activities are measured.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Two types of taxation are scored: income taxes and corporate    
taxes.  Each country was first scored based on these two major types of taxation, which many economists    
agree have the most negative economic impact on individuals.  These scores were then averaged to get a    
single taxation score.  Then, other taxes such as value-added taxes, sales taxes, and state and local taxes    
also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a country's taxation score was moved one-half    
point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.  This one-half point increase    
represents the relative impact of these other taxes on individual freedom.   
<H3>	1) Income taxes.</H3>    
<P>	Some countries have relatively high top income tax rates, but they apply to very few people. For    
example, Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent, but it is levied on such large amounts of income    
that very few people fall into this high tax bracket. The tax rate that applies to the average Japanese    
taxpayer is much lower.  Thus, to more accurately measure taxation policy, it is necessary to examine not    
only the top income tax rate, but the rate that applies to the average taxpayer.   
<P>	To discover the average income tax rate, a country's total gross domestic product was divided by    
total population. This per capita income figure was then used to determine which tax rate applies to the    
average income level. <FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT>  Once this was done, each country was scored on   
1) the top tax rate and 2) the    
tax rate that applies to average income.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent.  But the 50 percent tax    
bracket applies to income levels that equal about $180,000, which is more than nine times the per capita    
GDP level, which is around $19,000.  The tax level that applies to that amount is 20 percent.  Thus, based    
on the tax scale, Japan would receive an income tax score of 4.   
<H3>	Income Tax Grading Scale  </H3>   
<P>This scale lists a score from 1 through 5. The higher the score, the higher the tax rate. The highest    
level for which a country qualifies is the score that the country receives.   
 <P>  






























<BR>
<BR><PRE>
Score	Tax Rates	Criteria   
-----	---------	--------

1	Very low taxes	No taxes on income; or A flat tax rate on income  
			of 10 percent or less.  

2	Low taxes	A top tax rate of 25 percent or below; or A flat 
			income tax between 10 percent and 20 percent; 
			or A top rate of 40 percent or below, and a tax on    
			average income below 10 percent.  

3	Moderate taxes	A top tax rate of 35 percent or below; or 
			A tax on  average income below 15 percent.   

4	High Taxes	A top income tax rate of 36 percent to 50 percent 
			and an average tax level of 15 percent to 20 percent. 

5	Very high taxes	A top rate above 50 percent and a tax on average 
			income between 20 percent and 25 percent; or A tax 	
			rate on average income of 25 percent or   
			above regardless of the top rate.  
</PRE>

<H3>	2) Corporate taxes. </H3>   
<P>	The second type of tax analyzed is the corporate tax. Each country is scored according to a    
sliding scale based on corporate tax rates.    
<P><B>	Example:</B> Japan has a top corporate tax rate of 37.5 percent. Thus, based on the    
corporate tax rate scale, Japan receives a score of 4.  Japan's overall tax score average is a 4.  But Japan    
maintains additional taxes in the form of a 37.5 capital gains tax, a 3 percent consumption tax, a 17.3    
percent to 20.7 percent local inhabitant tax, and a 14.6 percent social contributions tax.  Thus, Japan    
moves from a 4 to a 4.5.

Score	Tax Rates	Criteria
-----	---------	--------	

1	Very low taxes	Considered a tax haven.  Limited or no taxes are

2 	Low taxes  	Flat corporate tax less than 25 percent or a 	
			progressive top tax of less than 25 percent.

3	Moderate taxes	A progressive corporate tax system with top rate

			between 36 percent and 45 percent.

5	Very high taxes	A cumbersome progressive tax system with top  
			corporate tax rates above 46 percent.
</PRE>

<H3>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output. <FONT SIZE="-3">[6]</FONT>     
</H3>   
<P>	The greater the degree to which the government intrudes in the economy, the less individuals are    
free to engage in their own economic activities. By taking government consumption as a percentage of    
gross domestic product, the level of government consumption of economic output can be determined. The    
higher the rate of government consumption as a percentage of gross domestic product, the higher the    
Index score, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Measuring a country's government consumption as a percentage of    
GDP reveals only an approximation of the government's role in the economy. <FONT SIZE="-2">  
[7]</FONT>  In the U.S., for    
example, the federal budget is about 24 percent of GDP.  This figure includes servicing the federal budget    
deficit and transfer payments through entitlements like Medicaid. Other government consumption figures    
for most less developed countries do not include funds spent on servicing the budget deficit and some    
transfer payments. While using government consumption figures probably understates the total    
government intervention in the economy, it is a useful tool and starting point for gauging the degree of    
government intervention in the economy.   
<P>	The next step in scoring a country on government consumption is to determine the size of the    
state-owned sector of the economy. If  a large portion of a country's GDP is produced by the state-owned    
sector, it was moved one point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.    
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Russia has a government consumption as a percentage of GDP figure    
of about 22 percent.  This would give Russia a score of 2 because the government consumption figure is    
between 11 percent and 25 percent. However, state-owned enterprises account for a majority of industrial    
production.  Thus, Russia gets a final score of 3, one point higher.   
   
<H3>Grading Scale</H3>

	Consumption of

-----	---------------		--------	

1	Very low 		Less than 10 percent of GDP.

2	Low 			11 percent to 25 percent of GDP.

3	Moderate 		26 percent to 35 percent of GDP.

4	High 			36 percent to 45 percent of GDP.

5	Very high 		46 percent or above of GDP.  

</PRE>

<H3>Factor #4: Monetary Policy. <FONT SIZE="-3">[8]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The value of a country's currency is based largely on the government's monetary policy. If a    
government maintains a "tight" monetary policy, meaning the supply of currency does not exceed demand,    
individuals have the economic freedom to engage in productive and profitable economic activities.  If the    
government maintains a "loose" monetary policy, meaning it supplies more money than demand requires,    
money loses its value and individuals are less free to engage in productive and profitable economic    
activities.  The best way to measure monetary policy is to analyze a country's inflation rate over a period    
of time. The inflation rate is directly linked to the government's ability to manage the supply of money in    
the economy.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average inflation rate was the main criterion for this factor.    
The inflation rate is the best measure of how a country manages its money supply.  Countries with high    
inflation rates have a loose monetary policy and are graded higher because they have less economic    
freedom than countries with lower inflation rates. Countries with a low inflation rate have a tight    
monetary policy and are graded lower because they have more economic freedom.  Countries of the    
former Soviet Union pose a unique problem in determining average inflation rates.  Due to the fact that    
these countries had command economies, annual inflation rate averages from 1980 to 1991 are    
misleading.  Without a market-based system, prices can be held constant because they are controlled by    
the state.  Therefore, countries of the former Soviet Union are graded solely based on 1992 or 1993    
inflation figures.  While these figures are high, especially due to their transformation to a market-based    
system, they are more accurate reflections of the conditions of today than are figures from the Soviet era.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan keeps a tight control over its money supply, and low inflation    
rates are the result. Japan's government has done this by maintaining a supply of yen consistent with the    
domestic demand for the currency.  In addition, Japan has very high savings rates. This supplies the    
financial system with yen that banks and other institutions lend to borrowers. As a result of a tight    
monetary policy, Japan maintained a very low average annual inflation rate of 1.5 percent from 1980 to    
1991. Because of its low inflation rate, Japan receives the lowest score of 1.    
   
<H3>Grading Scale</H3>   























<PRE>
Score 	Inflation Rate		Criteria
-----	--------------		--------

1	Very low		Below 6 percent.

2	Low			Between 7 percent and 13 percent.

3	Moderate 		Between 14 percent and 20 percent.

4	High			Between 21 percent and 30 percent.

5	Very high		Over 30 percent.
</PRE>

		  
<H3>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment Policy. <FONT SIZE="-2">[9]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	Foreign investment funds economic expansion. Investors from abroad supply capital to domestic    
investors who then start or expand their businesses. Restrictions on foreign investment hamper economic    
freedom and thus limit the inflow of foreign capital. By contrast, few or no restrictions on foreign    
investment maximize economic freedom and thus increase the flow of investments. For this category, the    
more restrictions a country imposes on foreign investment, the higher the score, and hence the lower the    
economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> A country's foreign investment policies were scrutinized in order    
to determine the overall investment climate. Among the specific questions asked: Are there foreign    
ownership limits placed on domestic industries? Is there an existing foreign investment code that defines    
the country's investment laws and procedures? Does the government encourage foreign investment by    
providing tax holidays or other incentives? Are foreign corporations treated under the law the same as    
domestic corporations? Are specific industries closed to foreign investment? These questions were    
answered to develop an overall description of the investment climate of the country being examined.     
Each country was graded based on its investment climate.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> Venezuela maintains restrictions on foreign investment.  Foreigners can    
own no more than 20 percent of a company engaged in one of the following industries: accounting,    
architecture, engineering, and insurance.  Foreign investment in oil, gas, coal, petroleum, automobiles,    
and iron ore is prohibited.  Finally, there are some employment restrictions.  On some investments, the    
workforce of a company with more than 10 employees must be 90 percent Venezuelan.  Thus, according    
to the criteria in the scale below, these restrictions are considered as moderately restrictive. Venezuela is    
given a score of 3 because there are restrictions on investment, but government policy at least conforms    
to established foreign investment codes.

			natural resources.

3	Moderate	Restrictions on many investments, but

4	High 		Investments permitted on a case-by-case

<H3>Factor #6: Banking. <FONT SIZE="-3">[10]</FONT>   </H3>   
<P>	In most countries, banks provide the economy with the financial means to operate.  They lend    
money to start businesses, provide services such as real estate, insurance, and securities investments, and    
furnish a safe place for individuals to store their earnings.  The more government controls banks, the less    
they are free to engage in these activities. The consequence of heavy regulation of banks is restricted    
economic freedom. Therefore, the more a government restricts its banking sector, the higher the Index    
score it receives, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> This factor is measured by determining the openness of a country's    
banking system. Among the questions asked: Are foreign banks able to operate freely?  How difficult is it    
to open domestic banks?  How heavily regulated is the banking system?  Are banks free to provide    
customers with insurance, sell real estate, and invest in securities?  The answers to these questions were    
used to develop a description of the country's banking climate.  The Index represents a sliding scale that    
measures the relative openness of a country's banking system.   
<P>	Example: The U.S. banking system is minimally regulated.  However, it maintains federal    
deposit insurance and interstate banking regulations.  Based on the scale below, the U.S. receives a 2    
score, which means that restrictions on banks are considered to be low.

	Restrictions	
Score 	on Banks	Criteria
-----	--------	--------

1	Very low 	Very few restrictions on foreign banks.  Banks can 	
			engage in all types of financial services.  
			Government controls few, if any, commercial banks. 
			No government deposit insurance.

2	Low 		Few limits on foreign banks. The country may 
			maintain some limits on financial services and have 
			interstate banking restrictions and deposit insurance. 
			Domestic bank formation may face some barriers.

3	Moderate 	Barriers to new bank formation. Heavy influence on 	
			banks by government.  Government owns or 
			operates some banks. Strict government control of 	
			credit.  Domestic bank formation may face 	
			significant barriers.

4	High 		Banks tightly controlled by government. Corruption 	
			may be present.  Domestic bank formation is 								virtually nonexistent.

5	Very High 	Financial institutions in chaos. Corruption rampant.

</PRE>

<H3>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls. <FONT SIZE="-3">[11]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	A free economy is one that allows individuals to set not only the prices on the goods and services    
they sell, but also the wages they pay to the workers they employ.  Some governments mandate wage and    
price controls. By doing so, they restrict economic activity, and thus curtail economic freedom.    
Therefore, the more a government intervenes and controls prices and wages, the higher the Index score    
and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  This factor is measured by how much a country lets the market or    
the government set wages and prices. Among specific questions asked: Are there any products whose    
prices are set by the government?  If so, which products?  Does the government affect prices by    
controlling such things as utilities?  Does the government have a minimum wage policy?  Are other wages    
set by the government? A sliding scale is developed to measure the relative degree of government control    
over wages and prices. A 1 or "very low" score represents wages and prices being set completely by the    
market, whereas at the other end of the scale, a "very high" score of 5 means that wages and prices are set    
completely by the government.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  In Hong Kong, all wages and prices are determined by the market. Thus,    
it receives a score of 1. By contrast, in Cuba, wages and prices are set by the government. Therefore, it    
receives a score of 5.

			minimum wage laws.

3	Moderate	Mixture of market forces and government-

4	High		Rationing, wage and price controls on most jobs and

<H3>Factor #8: Property Rights. <FONT SIZE="-3">[12]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The accumulation of private property is the main motivating force in a market economy.  This    
factor examines the extent to which private property is protected by the government and how safe it is    
from expropriation.  The less protection private property receives, the higher the score, and hence the    
lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The degree to which private property is a guaranteed right is    
measured. So, too, is the extent to which the government protects and enforces laws to protect private    
property. The probability that the state will expropriate private property also is examined. The less legal    
protection of private property, the higher the score.  The higher the chance of government expropriation    
of private property, the higher the score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. economic system is based entirely on people's right to    
accumulate property. America's legal system is one of the best in the world. It allows people to use the    
court system for disputes over property and to enforce contracts. Thus, based on the scale below, the U.S.    
would receive a very low score of 1, meaning that the level of protection for private property is "very    
high."

	Protection of
Score 	Private Property	Criteria
-----	----------------	--------

1	Very high		Private property guaranteed by the
				government, and efficient court system 
				enforces contracts. Adequate justice system 
				to punish those who unlawfully confiscate 
				private property. Expropriation not likely.

2	High			Private property guaranteed by the 	
				government, but enforcement is lax. 
				Expropriation unlikely.

3	Moderate		Government recognizes some private 
				property rights, such as land, but property 
				can be nationalized. Expropriation possible.

4	Low 			Property ownership is limited to personal 	
				items with little legal protection.  	
				Communal property is the rule.  
				Expropriation likely, and the government 
				does not adequately protect private
				property.  The legal system has collapsed.

5	Nonexistent		Private property is outlawed. Everything 	
				belongs to the people or the state.  	
				Expropriation is certain, or the country is 
				so corrupt and chaotic that property 
				protection is nonexistent.

<H3>Factor #9: Regulation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[13]</FONT>  </H3>     
<P>	In many less developed economies, obtaining a business license to sell a good or service is    
nearly impossible.  With so many hoops for the entrepreneur to jump through, it is very difficult to create    
new businesses. In some cases, government officials frown upon private sector initiative and it may even    
be illegal. While there are many regulations that hinder business, the most important ones are those    
associated with licensing new companies and businesses.  In some countries, like the U.S., obtaining a    
business license is as simple as mailing in a registration form with a minimal fee.  In others, especially in    
Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America, obtaining a business license requires endless trips to a    
government building and countless bribes, and may take up to a year.    
<P>	Once a business is open, that is not necessarily the end of government regulation.  In some cases,    
it is just the beginning.  Some countries apply their regulations haphazardly.  For example, an    
environmental regulation may be used to shut down one business while another is not penalized. Business    
owners become confused over which regulations must be obeyed. Moreover, the existence of many    
regulations can cause corruption as confused and harassed business owners try to work around the red    
tape.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  The purpose is to measure how easy or difficult it is to open a    
business.  The more regulations on business, the harder it is to open.  In addition, the degree of corruption    
was examined, as was whether the regulations are applied uniformly to all businesses. Another factor was    
whether the country has any state planning agencies that set production limits and quotas. The scale was    
established by listing a set of conditions for each of the five possible scores.  These conditions include    
such items as the extent of government corruption, the uniformity of the regulations' applications, and the    
extent to which the regulations pose a burden on business. At one end of the scale is the 1 score of very    
low levels of regulation, where corruption is nonexistent and regulations are minimal and uniformly    
applied. At the other end of the scale is the "very high" score of 5, where corruption is rampant,    
regulations are applied randomly, and the general level of regulation is very high. A country need only    
meet a majority of the conditions in each score for it to receive that score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Obtaining a business license in Hong Kong is very easy.  In some cases,    
one can even be obtained by mail. Hong Kong's regulation system is corruption-free, not a burden to    
business, and is applied uniformly throughout the country. Thus, Hong Kong receives a 1.

<H3>Factor #10: Black Market. </H3>   
<P>	Black markets are a direct result of government intervention in the market. In fact, a black market    
activity is one that the government has outlawed.  The larger the black market is in a country, the lower the    
economic freedom.  The smaller the black market, the higher the economic freedom.  This factor    
considers the size of a country's black market as a percentage of GDP.  The higher the percentage, the    
higher the score and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> Information available on the size of black markets in less    
developed countries is extremely scarce. Nevertheless, estimates can be made on the size of black market    
activities by answering several questions. For example, does the country have a large smuggling market?     
If so, this could be an indication that the government imposes too many restrictions on foreign imports.    
Do consumers need to turn to the black market to buy such items as televisions and video-cassette    
recorders?  If so, this could be an indication that these products cannot be bought in stores legally or that    
their prices are too high because of very high tariffs. Are there large numbers of workers who work    
illegally?  If so, this could be an indication that the economy is overly regulated and that labor must be    
supplied by the black market.   
<P>	The existence or absence of these and other activities was used to estimate the size of the black    
market as a percentage of gross domestic product.  In cases where black market information exists for    
specific countries, it is noted. At one end of the scale is the score of 1, where the black market    
constitutes less than 10 percent of GDP. At the other end is the score of 5, where the black market makes    
up 30 percent or more of GDP.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> In Peru, almost 30 percent of the GDP consists of such black market    
activities as labor and food. Other black market activities are outlawed in many cases. Peru receives the    
highest score of 5.

<H2>The Countries</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This section is a compilation of countries, each graded in all ten factors of the Index of 
Economic Freedom. Each country receives a 1 through 5 score for all ten factors. Those scores are then 
averaged to get a final Index of Economic Freedom score. Countries with a score between 1 and 2 have 
the freest economies. Countries with a score around 3 are less free. Countries with a score near 4 are 
over-regulated and need significant economic reforms to achieve even the most basic increases in 
economic growth. Countries with a 5 score are the most economically oppressive nations in the world.

<H2>Conclusion </H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This study demonstrates that the countries with free economic systems enjoy the highest 
degree of economic development.  Likewise, the countries with the least amount of economic 
freedom suffer from the lowest degree of economic development and are among the poorest 
countries on earth.  Throughout the world, free markets have driven development, while heavy 
government intervention has wrought nothing but economic disaster.
<P>	These conclusions are reflected in the scores of 101 countries examined in the <I>Index of 
Economic Freedom</I>. 7 countries were given  a "free" score, while 36 were found to be "mostly free." 
By contrast, 50 nations were "mostly not free," while 8 were deemed as "repressed." As these 
designations show, most of the countries in the world have economies that are not free. 
<P>	The <I>Index</I> demonstrates clearly the positive relationship between economic freedom and 
wealth. Five of the seven advanced industrial (G-7) democracies are among the ten countries whose Index 
score reflects the most economic freedom. By contrast, countries with unfree economies, such as Cuba, 
Mozambique, North Korea, and Vietnam, are among the world's poorest. Predictably Mozambique is 
indeed the world's poorest country.  While Mozambique's long running civil war, which ended in 1992, 
contributed to its poverty, there can be no doubt that Mozambique's long embrace of Marxism has been 
the major cause of its abysmal state of economic development.
<P>	<B>Asian Powerhouses. </B> Nor is it surprising that the Asian "Tigers"--Hong Kong, South 
Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan--are doing well economically. Two members of this enviable group, Hong 
Kong and Singapore, tie for the best score on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Each country 
scored a 1.25, receiving identical scores in all but two categories.  Hong Kong edged out Singapore by 
having lower tax rates while Singapore scored better than Hong Kong on monetary policy.  These two 
countries are paragons of economic freedom.
<P>	When compared with growth rates in many African countries, the "Asian Tiger" success is indeed 
impressive.  By 1965, the Asian Tigers and most Sub-Saharan African nations had achieved independence 
from colonial nation states.  In that year, Sub-Saharan African countries like Gabon had equal to higher 
levels of per capita wealth than Asian Tiger countries like the Republic of China on Taiwan.  For example, 
in 1965, Gabon had a per capita GDP figure of $1,286. By contrast, Taiwan had a per capita GDP of 
$1,133.<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   By 1991, Gabon's per capita wealth had risen to only $3,448. By contrast, Taiwan's per capita GDP had climbed to  $9,805. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>
<P>	Since 1965 , Taiwan has received negligible amounts of development aid. Gabon has been flood-
ed with hundreds of millions of dollars of development aid--over $500 million in the past five years. The 
conclusion is inevitable: Taiwan flourished because it became economically free, while Gabon, awash in 
development aid, languished because it refused to steer a free market course.
<P>	Right behind Hong Kong and Singapore, finishing third overall in economic freedom, is Bahrain.  
This Middle Eastern country scored a 1.60. Despite Bahrain's state-owned oil industry it maintains one of 
the most open markets in the world with average tariff rates of around 3.3 percent.  It makes no use of 
non-tariff barriers such as trade quotas and voluntary export restraints.  It taxes neither income nor 
corporate profits. Because of tight monetary policies, Bahrain actually has achieved what economists call  
"negative inflation rates"--in other words, prices actually dropped in the 1980s.
<P>	Bahrain has few government-imposed prices or set wages, minimal restrictions on foreign 
investments, a limited bureaucracy that imposes scant regulations on businesses. Its black market is 
practically non-existent. In each of the categories where countries were ranked, Bahrain scored among the 
best.  Since Bahrain's independence in 1971, it has achieved a per capita GDP of $11,536,
<FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  which makes it more wealthy than Ireland.
<P><B>	Nations Emerge from Communism. </B> The <I>Index </I>also sheds light on the 
different economic paths taken by former communist countries. Of the countries graded in this edition of 
the <I>Index, </I>the Czech Republic is ranked among the top 12 in the world with the highest levels of 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">[4]</FONT>  Thus, the Czech Republic has the freest economy of all the former East Bloc 
countries. Right behind the Czech Republic is Estonia. Both Estonia and the Czech Republic have adopted 
low rates of taxation, eliminated abusive government regulations, and minimized state constraints on 
individual economic activity. The results are that the economies of these two countries are performing 
better than any other former socialist state.
<P>	Some of the more developed countries have less economic freedom than less prosperous, 
developing countries.  Sweden, for example, scored a relatively weak 2.65.  This score can be attributed to 
Sweden's high level of taxation and the heavy role its government plays in the economy.  Neverthe-less, 
Sweden is wealthier than Malaysia, which scores a 2.15.  Sweden has a per capita GDP amount of 
$17,490, while Malaysia has a per capita GDP figure of $7,400.<FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT> 
<P> 	This finding may seem, at first glance, to invalidate the claim that economic freedom is the most 
important factor in stimulating economic development. However, this would be a misreading of the 
evidence. The Index of Economic Freedom is but a snapshot in time.  It measures economic freedom 
today.  There is no accounting for the economic history of Sweden, nor is Malaysia's past captured in its 
Index score. Sweden is richer than Malaysia, even though it is less free, because Sweden began 
industrialization long before Malaysia. Thus, it has had longer to develop and accumulate wealth. 
However, at present growth rates, it may not be long before Malaysia catches up with Sweden. Malaysia's 
economic growth exceeds Sweden's today, and Malaysia had an average growth rate of 5.6 percent from 
1980 to 1991.  Sweden had an average rate of growth for the same time of 2 percent.
<P><B>	The Curve of Economic Freedom. </B> This comparison of Sweden and Malaysia 
points to an important phenomenon discovered in this study: Long periods of economic growth resulting 
from high levels of economic freedom seem to create states that reverse course and place limits on 
economic freedom.  This is the Curve of Economic Freedom.  As the curve demonstrates, most countries 
with limited levels of economic freedom are grouped together with corresponding low levels of per 
capita wealth.  As some countries begin to reform their economies by establishing market-based systems 
that promote economic growth, per capita wealth increases.  However, once these countries reach a 
certain level of economic prosperity, as in the G-7 countries, they are tempted to regulate their 
economies, raise taxes, and add welfare programs, which results in less economic freedom and slower 
rates of economic growth.
<P>	The Curve of Economic Freedom helps to explain why economic growth rates have lagged lowed 
in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-1980s. Since that time, these countries has increased government 
spending, resulting in corresponding increases in taxation and regulation. If these trends continue, these 
countries will eventually suffer from dwindling economic growth and shrinking per capita wealth. 
<P><B>	Regions of Freedom. </B>North America, parts of Europe, and East Asia have the 
highest amounts of both economic freedom and per capita wealth.  Sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, 
and some republics of the former-Soviet Union are among the least economically free and poorest 
countries in the world.  Yet, while many countries in the developed world have rather high levels of 
economic freedom, many have reimposed restrictions on that freedom while many less developed 
countries have removed impediments to freedom and are beginning to catch up with the advanced 
industrial countries.
<P>	For example, some nations in Europe, mainly Germany, France, Italy, and even the United 
Kingdom to a lesser extent, have economic recessions.  Much of this is a result of increased government 
spending and interference in the economy.  The European Union, for example, will spend about 22 percent 
of its combined GDP on social welfare programs.  This is up from around 16 percent in 1989.  In 
Germany, government spending on social security and welfare now accounts for 49 percent of total 
government expenditures.  In the U.K., social spending is about 33 percent.
<P>	To fund social programs, these countries have raised tax rates to very high levels. Germany, Italy, 
and Japan have top income tax rates over 50 percent.  Britain has a top rate of 40 percent, while that of  
the U.S. is 39.6 percent.  Hong Kong, however, taxes income at a top rate of around 15 percent.  Other 
developing countries, like Estonia, have adopted relatively low top tax rates of 26 percent.
<P><B>	Foreign Aid Failures. </B> The <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> scores 
represent a damning condemnation of the U.S. foreign aid program.  It is well known that many countries 
which have received the largest amount of economic assistance from the U.S., including India and 
Bangladesh, are also the world's poorest countries.  Sadly, many of these countries are only getting 
poorer, and most policy makers know that the U.S. foreign aid program is doing little or nothing to stop it. 
Indeed, this is why Brian Atwood, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, is 
scrambling to "reinvent" his beleaguered agency.
<P>	It is troubling to learn that the large recipients of U.S. aid are also the countries with the least 
amount of economic freedom.  India, for example, scored a 3.70 and Bangladesh scored even worse at 
3.90.  The dearth of economic freedom permitted in these countries has produced nothing but economic 
misery.  It is tragic that this disastrous course has been subsidized by U.S. foreign aid. 
<P>	The record is particularly damning in Africa. The west African country of Ghana scores a poor 
3.20. Nevertheless, Ghana is the "star" of the international donor community, receiving nearly $1 billion 
in development aid each year. The three Sub-Saharan countries, Swaziland, Uganda, and South Africa, have 
the greatest degree of economic freedom, scoring 2.90, 2.94, and 3.00, respectively. Though good by 
Africa standards, these are bad scores when compared to Western standards. Africa's interventionist 
economic policies have drained it of economic vitality. 
<P>	Israel scored a 3.10 and Egypt 3.50.  These two countries together receive the bulk of U.S. 
foreign aid.  They are scheduled to receive over $5 billion in 1995.  Although each country has spoken of 
economic liberalization, little progress has been made, particularly in Egypt, where a reform effort has 
run out of steam.  U.S. aid to these two countries may be justified in terms of U.S. national security.  The 
peaceful relationship between Israel and Egypt is viewed as the bulwark of Middle East stability.  
However, these considerations aside, there can be no doubt that U.S. aid is doing little to promote 
economic development in these countries. In fact, it may be retarding development by delaying economic 
reforms.
<P>	The U.S. has recently occupied Haiti to restore democracy to that poverty-stricken country.  
Haiti scores a 4.20 on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  This amounts to economic repression. 
The Haitian elite has repressed economic activity by every means, including the use of physical violence.  
Haiti's lack of economic freedom has made it the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.  In short, 
Haiti's crisis is as much economic as political. Haiti's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> score 
suggests that foreign aid will do nothing to promote economic development unless the Haitian economy 
is dramatically liberalized.
<P>	Finally, nations still under the control of communist dictatorships like Cuba and North Korea, 
and to a lesser extent, Vietnam, collected at the bottom of the Index.  These countries are controlled by 
regimes that repress most forms of economic activity, saving most sources of wealth for corrupt 
government officials who use their control over the economy as the means to maintain power.
<P>	After all is said and done, the inescapable conclusion of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> 
is that the best way for a nation to grow economically is to tax less, lower trade barriers, better protect 
private property, allow foreign investment, and generally reduce the level of government interference in 
the economy. Whether they be G-7 countries or the Asian Tigers, countries that are the wealthiest and 
growing the fastest are the ones that are most economically free.  While many factors in addition to 
economic freedom account for the absolute wealth of nations--such as size, resources, the absence or 
presence of war, and even culture--no single factor is as important in determining economic development.  
The road to riches, it seems, indeed is paved with freedom.

<title>Why Congress Should Not Impose Mandates on Private Health Insurance - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>WHY CONGRESS SHOULD NOT IMPOSE MANDATES ON PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE</h3>
By Carrie Gavora<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 462<br>
September 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is poised to enact legislation which, for the first time, would require private commercial health insurance carriers to provide specific benefits. Such federal mandates inevitably increase costs while limiting consumer choice and competition. In particular, these proposed mandated benefits would increase the costs of health insurance premiums for employers, who then would either limit health benefits or pass the higher costs on to workers and their families in the form of lower wages. Worse, Congress would be establishing a precedent for legislative determination of what medical benefits, treatments, or procedures Americans must have in their personal insurance plans.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Making Health Policy Through the Appropriations Process.</b> During consideration of H.R. 3666, the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill, the United States Senate by voice vote approved an amendment offered by Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) that would require insurers to cover a mother and newborn for at least two nights in the hospital after a normal birth, and at least four nights after a caesarean section. Coverage for fewer days would be permissible if agreed to by the attending physician in consultation with the mother.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition, by a vote of 82 to 15, the Senate adopted a mental health "parity" amendment offered by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Paul Wellstone (D-MN). This amendment -- a scaled-down version of the mental health parity provision dropped from the recently enacted Kennedy-Kassebaum health insurance reform bill -- would require group health insurers who offer mental health coverage and apply aggregate lifetime and annual payment limits on coverage either (a) to include plan payments made for mental health services under the aggregate lifetime and annual payment limits for medical or surgical services, or (b) to establish a separate aggregate lifetime and annual payment limit for mental health that is equal to or greater than the limit established for medical and surgical services. On September 11, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 392 to 17, passed a nonbinding instruction to conferees on the VA-HUD bill to adopt both provisions. Both the Bradley and Domenici-Wellstone amendments represent a not-so-subtle creep of government control over the health care market.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Compounding State Regulation.</b> The overregulation of health insurance at the state level is a problem for both small businesses and insurers. In 1970, there were 48 mandated benefit laws (laws requiring specific treatments, benefits, or procedures) nationwide. As of 1995, because of intense lobbying by medical practitioners and advocates seeking coverage for various diseases, the number had risen to over 920. And this does not include almost 100 so-called anti-managed care laws (such as "any willing provider" and "mandatory point of service" laws) by which states restrict the ability of managed care plans to contract with providers and establish cost sharing.<sup>1</sup>  The most prominent form of federally tax supported, employer-based health insurance is managed care. Because of the rapid expansion of this form of health care, with its restrictions imposed on both doctors and patients, state legislatures are rapidly increasing their regulation of the insurance industry. More than 1,000 managed care bills are being considered in state legislatures in 1996; 56 have been passed into law in 35 states so far.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Imposing Higher Costs.</b> The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Senator Bradley's maternity benefit mandate would cost the federal government alone some $223 million over four years in increased outlays for Medicaid and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), and in lost revenues due to lower wages from increased health costs. The CBO also says that the new maternity benefit would increase aggregate premium payments for employee-based and individually purchased health plans by 0.06 percent. In addition to the extra costs for government programs, the CBO estimates that direct private-sector costs would increase by $180 million in 1998 and $220 million in 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to a CBO analysis conducted on behalf of the Senate Budget Committee, the estimated cost of the Domenici-Wellstone mental health parity provision of the VA-HUD appropriations bill is less than the earlier version -- estimated at $618 million over 5 years (the provision sunsets in 2001).<sup>3</sup>  The potential cost also was reduced somewhat by a modifying amendment, offered by Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX), stipulating that if a group health policy experienced a premium increase of 1 percent or more in a given year due to this provision, that insurance policy could be exempted from the mandate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While both amendments attempt to address real issues -- namely, the equitable treatment of mental health services and the health and safety of mothers and newborns -- they are bad public policy. The federal government should not be in the business of determining what benefits, treatments, or procedures private health insurance must provide to patients. This should be a contractual decision between consumers and insurers, and between doctors and patients. Whether to cover treatment for mental illness (or any illness) should be an insurance contract issue, not a political decision or an area for congressional intervention.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Moreover, experience at the state level indicates that mandates typically are the product of intense lobbying by provider interests rather than sound health policy. Thus, Congress should realize that once one group of practitioners begins to benefit from legally mandated coverage for its services, others will argue for similar legal guarantees. In the meantime, the price of legally privileged medical benefits hurts legally underprivileged medical practitioners, because businesses or insurers have to cut back other benefits to accommodate the new law. Desperately fighting for equal treatment, the excluded practitioners and advocates for certain disease groups lobby intensively for expansion of the mandates. The slippery slope of mandated benefits is transformed into  spiraling costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Let Consumers Fire Bad Insurance Companies.</b> Rather than adopt bad health care policy, Congress should allow consumers to choose not only their health insurance coverage, but also the kinds of medical treatments and procedures they want at the prices they wish to pay. In a consumer choice system, individuals and families -- not employers or managed care companies -- would choose the health plans and benefits that best suit their needs. The mother of a newborn forced out of a hospital before her time should have the right to fire her insurance company. Individuals and families, given tax relief regardless of where they work, should be able to purchase comprehensive health insurance, including catastrophic coverage, without imposing high costs on the private health insurance plans of other workers and their families with different needs. While rhetorically packaged with phrases like "incremental reforms" or "patient protections," federal mandates -- especially on top of state mandates -- do nothing to reform America's health care system. All they do is raise costs and limit consumer choice and competition.

<li>The mental health parity provision agreed to earlier this year by the Senate would have imposed huge new costs on working families. The CBO estimated that premiums for traditional fee for service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would cost the consumer an additional 4 percent. Understanding that it is workers and their families that ultimately bear the costs of mandated benefits, the CBO predicted that this provision would force employers either to cut back other benefits -- or health insurance altogether -- or to pass the higher cost of insurance on to workers in the form of lower wages.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House of Representatives soon will consider major health insurance reform legislation approved by the Committees on Commerce, Ways and Means, and Economic and Educational Opportunities.<sup>1</sup>  The Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act of 1996, a legislative proposal being coordinated by Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL), contains many of the structural improvements needed in today's health insurance market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reforms would enable Americans to keep their health insurance should they change or lose their jobs. They also would generate more genuine competition among insurance carriers and other health plan providers, thereby controlling costs through free-market forces. In addition to making health insurance more available and portable, the House proposal would address the more immediate and pressing concern facing millions of Americans -- the affordability of health insurance. It would do this by changing the tax treatment of health insurance, creating medical savings accounts (MSAs), and expanding tax relief for health insurance. This would give Americans more personal choice of health care services and make it possible for more families to own their health plans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Increasing the Availability of Insurance.</b> The House proposal would restrict the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny group health insurance coverage to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. The limitation period on preexisting conditions would be reduced by the length of time that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under any prior plan. In addition, the proposal would prohibit an insurance company from imposing any further preexisting condition exclusions if the employee had been covered under another group health plan at the time coverage was offered, and would prohibit health plans from excluding or canceling coverage for any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status. Thus, workers who changed jobs would no longer be subjected to waiting periods. The absence of portability in group health insurance, now confronting millions of workers who want to change jobs, would be alleviated in the proposed group-to-group provision.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
More important, the House bill would help create a consumer-based health insurance system by making individual ownership of health policies much easier. Individuals would be guaranteed health insurance coverage if they met certain specific requirements.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of health insurance in the individual market would be achieved under the bill by forbidding insurance carriers from imposing eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. These rules would guarantee the portability of health insurance for workers and their families in the individual market. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who provides health insurance to another employer who does not will lose coverage. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The concern has been raised that a guaranteed issue requirement would sharply raise the premiums on individual-based policies. Estimates vary, with some projecting increases of 2 to 5 percent, and others placing the increase between 10 and 15 percent.<sup>3</sup>  Because real consumer choice and genuine market competition are virtually non-existent in today's distorted health insurance market, it is inevitable that premiums would increase somewhat in the individual market under a guaranteed issue requirement. And since only employer-based health insurance is completely tax free, individuals who purchase it on their own must pay the entire cost of the higher premiums in after-tax dollars. Without any change in this tax treatment, healthier-than-average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance under a guaranteed issue requirement, while unhealthy persons would be more likely to purchase coverage, driving up average premiums. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Fortunately, the House proposal makes two key adjustments in the federal tax code that would help offset the increase in premiums.
<p><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>1.) Medical savings accounts.</b> The bill creates medical savings accounts (MSAs). As drafted, MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a significant impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other forms of tax equity Congress should consider, such as the comprehensive system of tax credits proposed in 1994 by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK) and Representative Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed, MSAs are a good start. They would provide an incentive for healthy individuals to purchase at least catastrophic health insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool to help offset the claims of future unhealthy enrollees.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>2) An increased tax deduction for the self-employed.</b> Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House bill would increase the deduction to 50 percent by 2003.<sup>4</sup>  While this would help, the federal tax code would remain biased against employees in employer-based health plans who prefer the security of choosing and owning their own plan. The House thus should establish at least a 50 percent deduction for all individuals purchasing health insurance, not just the self-employed.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Small Employer Pooling.</b> The House bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase insurance coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>5</sup>  Eighty-five percent of uninsured Americans are in households headed by a worker. The House proposal uses ERISA to preempt any state laws prohibiting groups of employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage through a multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House bill also would eliminate confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has helped insurance swindlers and bogus unions hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. The House proposal would clarify the law and give legitimate self-insured associations (including church plans, franchise networks, trade associations, and certain collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in a state permitting such practices. Alternatively, they could seek federal certification under the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Second, the House bill makes clear that entities created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business rather than ERISA. The states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage when attempting to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers. The wrong way to deal with this would be for Congress to create government-sponsored health insurance purchasing cooperatives and impose new federal regulations. By giving smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the economies of scale available under ERISA, the House proposal would make it much easier for small firms to obtain this expensive health insurance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The House legislation would be a big step toward genuine health care reform because it addresses the principal reason why Americans have been demanding health insurance reform -- their fear of losing current health benefits or being unable to afford coverage. Further, the bill begins to tackle the root cause of the financing problems -- the tax bias against purchasing health insurance outside an employer. By doing this, the House proposal would give Americans the desirable components of health care reform that were the casualties of the battle over the Clinton health plan:  availability, affordability, portability, and -- above all -- the security that comes with personally owned health insurance.

<h3>A GUIDE TO KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY</h3>

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Both houses of Congress soon will consider sweeping legislation affecting the way millions of Americans get their health insurance. In the Senate, the chief sponsors of the Health Insurance Reform Act of 1995 (S. 1028) are Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA).<sup>1</sup>  In the House, Representative Dennis Hastert (R-IL) is coordinating the efforts to introduce an improved version of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill.<sup>2</sup>  Both bills are intended to address a recurring and legitimate concern among millions of working Americans who currently have employment-based health insurance:  the threat of losing private health insurance when they lose or change their jobs, or try to obtain coverage when they have a pre-existing medical condition. But while the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill contains some useful provisions, it also contains serious flaws -- many of which would be corrected by incorporating language based on the House proposal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Anxiety about health insurance coverage stems from the very nature of today's employment-based system. Typically, workers and their dependents are covered by an employer-based health insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same employer, and for just a short time afterwards. If a worker is laid off or takes a job with a different employer, the family may encounter pre-existing condition exclusions or different health care providers. If the worker joins a firm with no group insurance plan and buys his own coverage, he receives no tax breaks for purchasing that policy -- compared with generous tax relief if an employer obtains and owns the coverage. Lawmakers thus need to address two fundamental problems in trying to fix the broken health insurance market: 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>1.)</b> Health insurance is the only type of insurance tied to the place of employment. Other major forms of insurance such as homeowners, mortgage, and life are not normally tied to a worker's place of employment. The reason health insurance is employer-based today is that federal tax relief for insurance is available only to workers who obtain insurance through their place of work. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>2.)</b> The tax code effectively limits workers and their families to only one type of insurance option:  employer-based health insurance. Insurance market reforms do not resolve this underlying problem with a distorted health insurance market.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill (S. 1028), as reported out of committee, is flawed legislation. While S. 1028 avoids the price controls and huge tax increases found in both the Clinton plan and other bills introduced in the last Congress, it contains vague provisions for federal regulation of the health insurance market, a responsibility traditionally left to the states. S. 1028 gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services disturbingly broad powers in this area.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of just trying to guarantee Americans the right to purchase health insurance, Congress should take careful steps to make sure that Americans of all incomes, health status, and employment status have the ability to buy into the health care market.<sup>3</sup>  Therefore, Congress should focus on:
<p><ul>
<li> Group to group portability;<p>
<li> Limiting pre-existing condition exclusions upon losing employer-based coverage;<p>
<li> Reasonable mechanisms to allow small employers and legitimate associations to pool together to get better prices;<p>
<li> Tax equity for individuals and families seeking health insurance outside an employer setting; and<P>
<li> Full income tax deductibility for the self-employed increased to 100 percent.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In his 1996 State of the Union message, President Bill Clinton emphasized that the goal of S. 1028 is to end the loss of portable health insurance among millions of workers and their dependents.<sup>4</sup>  The issue of portability of insurance is a broad concern among Republicans and Democrats alike. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned attempt to address it, as well as the problem of pre-existing conditions. The bill also makes improvements in the areas of guaranteed availability and portability of group coverage. Unfortunately, for jurisdictional and procedural reasons, Senate rules have prevented the addition of several key health care reform components necessary to allow individuals, rather than the companies they work for, to own their health insurance policies. If it is Congress's intention to give workers and their families true portability of health insurance, lawmakers must correct the inherent flaws and inequities that are the unintended consequences of an inequitable federal tax code that penalizes the working poor and self-employed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, even though the Senate measure does contain extensive federal regulation of the individual health insurance market, intended to address portability, it lacks the key financial incentive to persuade healthy individuals to purchase health insurance in a timely fashion. Unless Congress is willing to address the core problem of today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code -- health insurance reform will fall far short of its goals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The widespread fear of losing employment-based health insurance emerged as the driving force behind the health care debate during the 103rd Congress. An analysis of the March 1994 Current Population Survey showed that 55.3 percent of the uninsured population in 1993 were uninsured because they had lost their jobs or changed jobs.<sup>5</sup>  That insecurity stems from the design of today's employer-based health insurance system, itself the product of perverse incentives created by the federal tax code.<sup>6</sup>  Others worry about not having any form of insurance from their current employer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The best way to achieve portability is to give Americans ownership and control of the financing of health benefits. Where appropriate, financial assistance should be given to low-income working families to help pay for basic care in the form of vouchers or tax credits. If individuals and families are allowed to comparison shop among a variety of health plans and benefit levels offered through their employer, a private organization, or an individual policy, costs can be controlled. True portability also can be achieved, because Americans will no longer face the possibility of losing their health insurance based on a change in job, loss of job, or pre-existing condition. 

<p>
<b>WHAT S. 1028 WOULD DO</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would create a uniform federal standard for health insurance that is intended to increase the portability of private health insurance policies. Under the legislation, individuals with employment-based health insurance would be able to maintain coverage while changing jobs. In the area of group coverage, the bill would reduce the length of exclusions for pre-existing conditions by crediting enrollees for maintaining continuous coverage through a previous employer. Furthermore, insurers and employers would be prevented from excluding employees from an employer's group health plan based on their medical status or experience.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The proposal also would create a new state-based system of health plan purchasing cooperatives (HPPCs) intended to give small businesses and individuals greater purchasing power in negotiating more favorable rates from insurance carriers and other health plan providers.

<p>
<b>A Limit on Pre-Existing Conditions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill places a restriction on the ability of health plans and employers to limit or deny coverage in group health insurance plans to 12 months for medical conditions diagnosed in the previous 6 months. A time credit is applied against the preexisting condition period by reducing it one month for each month that a worker and his dependents were continuously covered under a previous group health plan. In addition, the bill:
<P><ul>
<li> Places a ban on further preexisting condition exclusions by any insurer once a worker has been continuously insured for a minimum of 12 months. Thus, workers who change jobs or insurance plans would no longer be subject to waiting periods.
<p>
<li> Prohibits health plans and employers from canceling or providing coverage to any employee in the employer group plan based on a preexisting condition or health status.
<p>
<li> Promotes wellness programs by allowing employers and group health plans to provide discounts to employees who participate in activities (approved by state insurance regulators) designed to promote healthy behavior, prevent or delay the onset of illness, or provide for screening or early detection of an illness.
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The guaranteed availability and renewability of health insurance in S. 1028 would alleviate the portability problem facing workers who want to change jobs. This is a welcome and long-overdue improvement in today's health insurance market.
<P>

<b>Group Purchasing Arrangements (Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives)</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 attempts to make health insurance more affordable for small employers and self-employed workers by enabling them to purchase coverage as part of a larger group. The rationale is that small businesses generally pay higher per capita premiums than larger businesses because they lack economies of scale and the power to bargain. Under current law, when an employee or dependent incurs expensive claims, typically the employer's premiums increase sharply the following year, in many cases pricing that group out of the insurance market. The danger to the worker and his family occurs when a health plan provider drops the small employer from coverage, or the employer excludes the particular employee from the group plan due to his previous year's claims experience.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill attempts to correct this problem by promoting small group purchasing arrangements. Referred to as Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs), they are private, voluntary coalitions/alliances developed to purchase health insurance and negotiate with providers and health plans. State laws prohibiting the formation of such HPPCs are preempted. Under the bill, HPPCs would require state certification and would have to be registered with the U.S. Department of Labor. In addition to purchasing insured products on behalf of members, HPPCs would not be permitted to bear risk,<sup>7</sup> although they would be given discretion in determining the eligibility requirements for employers and whether or not to include individuals -- as long as the individual's health status is not a factor.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To facilitate the formation of HPPCs, and to get them to be active participants in the health insurance market, S. 1028 provides for a limited preemption of state insurance rating laws with respect to group health plans and individual health plans offered by health insurance carriers through HPPCs.<sup>8</sup>  Health plans purchased through other avenues, however, would remain subject to state small group rating requirements, which require carriers to pool all small group businesses for rating purposes. Thus, the Senate bill creates different rules for different insurance arrangements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>An Uneven Playing Field.</b> By exempting HPPCs from state small employer group rating laws, Congress would be creating an incentive for small businesses with healthier than average employees to seek out coverage under a HPPC that has procured rate discounts:  Businesses could do this on any basis other than the health status and demographics of the HPPC's members. But there is a significant problem:  Without the premium payments from these healthy employer groups, others seeking coverage through non-HPPC arrangements could face higher than normal rates in a pool dominated by unhealthy employer groups. The Senate bill, in other words, could end up compounding the market distortions in a sector already distorted by an inequitable federal tax code. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the legislative language creating HPPCs would lead to an uneven playing field against commercial insurance companies not selling products through HPPCs. While insurance premiums in the non-HPPC market no doubt would be higher than those in the HPPCs as a result of this provision, it is not definite how severe the impact would be. Congress would be wise to ensure that an even playing field exists in the health insurance market so that competition among health plan providers is fair. At a minimum, Congress should amend S. 1028 so that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or though a non-HPPC, are exempted from state rating requirements. Members of Congress should not worsen the distortions in health insurance markets through federal legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some in Congress have expressed an interest in enacting a blanket federal preemption of any state-mandated benefit laws that would apply solely to HPPCs. State-mandated benefit laws have added to the cost of insurance, rendering policies unaffordable for many small businesses and individuals. While it is perfectly understandable that Members would want to protect small businesses and individuals purchasing insurance through a HPPC from burdensome and costly state mandates, any preemption of state mandated benefit laws, however well-intentioned, should be applied to all forms of health coverage, HPPCs and non-HPPCs alike. A better approach would be to preempt state laws which:
<P><ul>
<li> Require health insurance policies to cover specific diseases, services, or providers;<P>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to contract selectively with health care providers; or<p>
<li> Limit the ability of managed care plans to impose higher cost-sharing provisions on treatment obtained from providers outside a plan's network.<sup>9</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lower premiums are a desirable goal. However, it would be extremely unwise of Congress to distort the health insurance market further by placing HPPC plans at a marketing advantage over non-HPPC plans. As drafted, the potential for HPPCs' gaining monopoly status is very real because of the legislative language creating these new entities. Although not theoretically exclusive, as under the Clinton health plan, these geographically based HPPCs might become the exclusive means for individuals and employers to obtain fully insured health coverage, if premium rates negotiated by the HPPC are less than those otherwise permitted under state law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In this respect, Members of Congress should recall the ill-fated "managed competition" legislation introduced in 1994 by former Congressmen Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Fred Grandy (R-IA).<sup>10</sup>  Among other things, this health insurance reform proposal also would have established state-based health insurance purchasing cooperatives.<sup>11</sup>  While individual and family enrollment in these HPPCs supposedly would have been voluntary, the regulatory infrastructure and tax code revisions set up in the Cooper-Grandy plan eventually would have forced small businesses and individuals into such entities. Consistent with the managed competition model in the Cooper-Grandy plan, HPPCs under S. 1028 would be required to enroll all employers and individuals within a geographic area as determined by the state. If S. 1028 were enacted into law as reported out of the Senate Labor Committee, the combination of new federal rules with existing state insurance rules could make employee enrollment in HPPCs the only practical choice for insurance coverage. Workers and their families therefore would lose a large measure of personal choice in health plans.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Most significantly, current ERISA regulations do not prohibit states from establishing voluntary purchasing cooperatives.<sup>12</sup>  Congress should not create a regulatory infrastructure that could establish the groundwork for making such HPPCs mandatory within a state. The danger is that the instability created by the federally designed HPPCs would lead to further federal regulation to "correct" the problem -- resulting in still further problems. The result:  Congress, by degrees, would create a system of purchasing cooperatives similar to those found in the Clinton Health Security Act, which required every American to obtain health insurance through these alliances.

<p>
<b>Group-to-Individual Coverage</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;S. 1028 does take some of the first steps needed to construct a consumer-based health insurance framework -- even though other provisions conflict with this goal. Subtitle B does this by setting up an infrastructure to facilitate individual health plan portability. Insurance carriers that sell individual health plans are required to issue individual coverage when the following criteria have been met:
<p><ul>
<li> Individuals a) must have been covered previously under an employment-based health plan, b) must have paid health insurance premiums on a continuous basis without a gap in coverage of 30 days or more, and c) must have been covered for at least 18 months;<P>

<li> Individuals must not be eligible for coverage under an employee health benefit plan or group health plan, such as one offered by a new employer or by a parent's or spouse's employer;
<p>
<li> Individuals must have exhausted their eligibility for COBRA<sup>13</sup> continuation coverage (which is available for a minimum of 18 months to over 80 percent of individuals receiving employment-based coverage); and
<p>
<li> Individuals must not reside in a state which has adopted a high-risk pool or other means of covering individuals unable to maintain health coverage. 
</ul> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Guaranteed issue and the availability of insurance in the individual market are addressed by forbidding insurance carriers to determine coverage or establish eligibility, continuation, or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims experience, or medical history. Without these rules governing the group-to-individual conversion, the portability of health insurance will not be achieved. Under current law, individuals switching from an employer who offers insurance coverage to an employer who does not offer coverage would simply lose this benefit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The bill also puts rules in place for health insurance carriers to ensure their financial stability and solvency. An insurance carrier or other health plan provider offering coverage to individuals under an individual health plan may deny applicants if the health plan ceases to enroll any new individuals. A carrier also may do so if it can demonstrate to the state that its financial or provider capacity to serve previously covered individuals will be impaired if the state requires it to enroll additional individuals.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Concerns have been raised about how these provisions would affect premium costs.<sup>14</sup>  Some critics of S. 1028's group-to-individual portability provision say that insurance premiums in the individual market would increase sharply, perhaps in the range of 10 to 15 percent.<sup>15</sup>  But the American Academy of Actuaries, the national organization representing actuaries of all specialties in the United States, says the increase in premiums would be quite small, ranging between 2 and 5 percent.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since S. 1028 does not impose strict community rating requirements, or otherwise impose price caps on the premiums that insurers may charge individuals,<sup>17</sup> some insurance executives, such as those with one of the leading insurance trade associations, fear that the guaranteed-issue requirement for individuals with prior coverage would "make individual health insurance unaffordable over time."<sup>18</sup>  This concern is premised upon two assumptions:  1) that only unhealthy individuals will purchase health insurance, thereby increasing the likelihood of adverse selection in the individual market; and 2) that absent significant public subsidies, healthy individuals will not purchase insurance before they need it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Because both consumer choice and competition are frustrated in a health insurance system that is predominantly employment-based, these concerns about insurance costs in the individual market are legitimate in today's tax climate. Since health insurance is entirely optional, those who purchase health insurance on their own must pay the entire cost of the premiums with after-tax dollars. Thus, healthier than average individuals would be more likely to decline insurance in a voluntary market, while unhealthy persons could see an economic benefit in getting coverage. A guaranteed-issue requirement in the individual market would lead to higher premiums since unhealthy people would comprise a disproportionate share of the market. While concerns about rising premiums in the individual insurance market are justified, Congress can and should address this potential problem by providing consumers with financial assistance to help offset any possible increase.
<p>
<b>HOW CONGRESS CAN IMPROVE S. 1028</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill makes improvements in the existing health insurance system, there are several provisions which should be strengthened. Without further changes, the laudable intentions of this legislation will not be realized in good public policy. Millions of Americans are painfully aware of the weaknesses in the current system. The Senate Committee on Labor correctly diagnosed the problem:  "[M]illions of Americans are at risk of becoming uninsured or subject to preexisting condition exclusions under the current system because they change jobs, lose jobs, or work for employers who change insurance policies."<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Certain key policy changes can improve insurance reform legislation and better achieve the goal of portability and security in health insurance. These changes, as proposed in the House legislation, include tax equity for non-employer-based health insurance, medical savings accounts (MSAs), increased deductibility for purchasing health insurance for the self-employed, a clarification of the ERISA laws making it easier for smaller employers and individuals to pool and gain leverage in the insurance market, and medical malpractice reforms.

<p>
<b>Tax Equity Would Offset Most Adverse Effects in the Individual Market </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As noted, policy analysts and insurance industry executives have raised concerns over the effects that guaranteed issue and guaranteed renewability could have on premiums in the individual insurance market. Under the current system, unhealthy individuals leaving employment-based coverage find COBRA either the preferable or perhaps the only alternative to being uninsured. Healthy individuals have the luxury of making an economic decision to go with no coverage or purchase an individual-based policy with after-tax income. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To the extent that Members of Congress remain concerned about a potential increase in premiums, they should re-examine the core problem behind today's health insurance system -- the federal tax code. Congress should provide an incentive for healthy employees to enroll in the individual market by giving them tax equity. This means giving individuals who purchase their own health insurance policies the same tax treatment as workers who get their health insurance through their employers. As drafted, the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill would not help college graduates entering the job market for the first time who end up working for small start-up businesses unable to offer health insurance. To fix this problem, Members of Congress need to look no further than the health-related tax provisions passed overwhelmingly by both houses of Congress in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995. A majority of today's uninsured population is made up of the self-employed, those working for small firms, or young individuals. These groups are affected by the distortions in an employer-based health insurance system and are the ones typically suffering from the absence of portability and ownership.
<p>
<b> Introduce medical savings accounts (MSAs).</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
MSAs would enable group-to-individual conversions to have a widespread impact on today's uninsured population. While there are other comprehensive forms of tax equity Congress could consider (such as tax credits and 100 percent deductions for the self-employed), MSAs would be a good start. They would provide sufficient incentive for healthy individuals to purchase insurance, thereby creating a solid and solvent risk pool that offsets the claims of future unhealthy enrollees. MSAs could be constructed as passed earlier this Congress:
<P><ul>
	<li>	Contributions of up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families, including employer contributions, would be 100 percent deductible from adjusted gross income;
<p>
	<li>	Interest earned on the income would be subject to taxation;
<p>
	<li>	Withdrawals made for non-medical expenditures would be included in the individual's gross income and subject to a 10 percent tax prior to age 59-and-a-half;
<p>
	<li>	Upon reaching age 59-and-a-half, the individual could make withdrawals for any purpose without the 10 percent tax;
<p>
	<li>	In order for a health plan to be classified as such, at a minimum it would have to provide catastrophic coverage in which the minimum deductible for individuals is $1,500 and $3,000 for families.
<p></ul>
<b> Increase and expand tax deductions.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Under current law, self-employed individuals are permitted to deduct 30 percent of the amount paid for health insurance for themselves and their dependents. While a 30 percent deduction provides some tax relief for the nation's self-employed, the federal tax code still provides significant tax advantages for employees by exempting company-sponsored benefits from any federal income or payroll taxes (FICA), as well as from state and local taxes. In addition to pre-existing condition exclusion barriers, the availability of this tax exclusion for workers is one of the major impediments facing employees seeking to leave and start their own businesses. Congress should remove this bias, and also encourage creation of a sound individual-based health insurance market, by increasing the deduction for health insurance of self-employed individuals and their families.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Earlier this year, Congress passed legislation which would have increased the 30 percent deduction to 50 percent between 1996 and 2002. This proposal was vetoed by President Clinton. While a 100 percent deduction would provide tax fairness for all individuals and the self-employed, even a compromise of 50 percent would represent substantial progress.
As a condition of regulating private insurance at the federal level, consider pre-empting state mandated benefit laws. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance industry is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the American economy. Before an insurance carrier or health plan provider is allowed to enter and do business within a state, it must satisfy a litany of state requirements and regulations. Regulation of health insurance is usually within the jurisdiction of the states, not the federal government. A key component of state regulation is the imposition of mandated benefits on insurance carriers licensed to do business within their jurisdictions. These mandates are the product of intense special-interest lobbying at the state level, where medical specialists, marriage and family counselors, therapists, and other professionals have succeeded in imposing coverage requirements. Over the years, the number and scope of these benefits have grown substantially, adding to the cost of insurance plans sold to employers and individuals. Nationwide, there are over 1,000 such state mandates, ranging from in vitro fertilization to chiropractic care and psychological counseling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In principle, Congress should refrain from regulating health insurance at the federal level. But with S. 1028, Congress is doing precisely that, arguing that the weaknesses of the current insurance market (the absence of portability and the growing numbers of uninsured) outweigh adherence to the principles of federalism. If Congress decides to regulate the individual health insurance market, sponsors of S. 1028 should seek at least a net deregulation of the market by preempting state mandated benefit laws. In return for preemption, Congress may seek to require catastrophic coverage as a consumer protection measure. This would substantially reduce both the regulatory burden and the cost of insurance for small businesses which employ a majority of the uninsured population.
<p>
<b> Avoid a Clinton-style standardized benefits package.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Congress should refrain from imposing any requirements that health plans cover a particular benefit, medical procedure, or service. Several Senators favor requiring health plans to cover specifically defined medical benefits. But while such a proposal is appealing on a superficial level, this approach guarantees higher costs and unintended long-term consequences. Like the Clinton plan, a standardized benefits package forces all individuals to buy benefits they neither want nor need. It does not take into account the different medical needs and desires of individuals and families. While some Americans may want and can afford the inclusion of comprehensive and expensive benefits, millions of others -- especially younger, less well off, and healthier individuals -- may not. If a worker or family member suffers from a particular disease that is not included in the standardized benefits package, that person could be medically worse off if the required extra service he needs is unaffordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Specific benefits invariably are required if a Hollywood movie star or celebrity is willing to take up the cause of persons with a particular disease, replete with an appropriately colored ribbon.<sup>20</sup>  During the debate over the Clinton health plan and its variants in 1994, congressional staff, Representatives, and Senators were inundated with office visits, mail, faxes, and phone calls asking that a particular benefit or service be covered. If the group of patients is large and powerful enough, perhaps with the aid of a celebrity, it is likely that the benefit will be added by Congress. Supporters of mandated benefits should be honest about the unintended consequences that come with a mandated benefits package -- higher premiums and the politicization of diseases.
<p>
<b> Do not remove "lifetime limits" from employer-sponsored health benefit plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some Members of Congress are considering a prohibition on "lifetime limit" provisions in private health insurance plans as a way to protect patients facing high medical expenses due to catastrophic illnesses. The danger is that such a rule would raise employers' health care costs. For some companies, the extra cost could be severe enough to prevent a plan from being offered or continued, thus exposing the patient to 100 percent of all medical bills, including catastrophic claims.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime limits are necessary to help private insurance companies meet solvency standards required by the states. The same principle already applies to government health programs. For example, the Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) Part A Trust Fund imposes a lifetime limit on two major services:  hospitalization (150 days) and skilled nursing facility care (100 days). It is all but certain that if such a rule were applied to Medicare Part A, the Trust Fund would be insolvent long before the projected date of 2002.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;While studies have estimated the cost of eliminating lifetime caps would be an additional 2.3 percent for employers,<sup>21</sup> the findings do not take into account the added cost of prohibiting separate "inside limits" on specific categories of services already contained within existing policies. Without lifetime and inside limitations in health insurance policies, many small to mid-sized employers would be unable to purchase any type of health plan for their employees. As pointed out by the Association of Private Pension and Welfare Plans (APPWP), a majority of employer-based health benefit plans include "inside limits" on certain benefits and services:<sup>22</sup> 
<p><blockquote>
	The Standard Option benefit package offered to federal government employees enrolled in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) includes a limit of one hospital inpatient treatment program per lifetime for alcohol, drug, and substance abuse.
<p>
	The Segal Company's "1994 Survey of State Employee Health Benefit Plans" also reports that 35 states included "separate annual/lifetime maximums" for mental health and/or substance abuse treatment.
</blockquote><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The strongest cost argument in favor of outlawing lifetime limits is that average increases in premiums for employers would be modest. But the American Academy of Actuaries (AAA) has cited several consequences that make the removal of lifetime limitation provisions financially unattractive. One is the "[p]otential for increased health care inflation, potential pressure to liberalize limited benefit structures in public programs, and the potential impact on reinsurance companies and insurer premiums."<sup>23</sup>  Another unintended consequence of repealing lifetime limits would be the added cost taxpayers would be forced to bear for the approximately 18.2 million federal, state, and local government employees. A majority of health plans covering government employees already have lifetime limit provisions, and many also contain additional inside limits. While lifetime caps appear onerous, they give employers who voluntarily offer health benefit plans reason to believe that these plans will remain affordable.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Lifetime caps are but one health benefit design feature that allows employers to offer the level of benefits they can afford. During consideration of the Clinton plan, Congress and the American people rejected mandating the level of benefits that employers must provide to their employees. The issue of employer-provided health benefits is a matter best left to employers and employees. Private employers and employees, not Congress, should decide what level of benefits they can afford. Congress should avoid piecemeal additions to benefit packages based on pressure from health industry groups. If Congress bows to pressure from such groups, employers will be forced to scale back or drop the benefits they provide to accommodate a repeal of lifetime limits. Employees and their families will receive fewer benefits, and this will lead to calls for additional mandated benefits, further increasing health care costs. This unnecessary yet inevitable circle of events is sure to be triggered if Congress gets into the perennially unfinished business of benefit setting. 
<p>
<b> Consider medical malpractice reform.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there are federalism concerns involved in legislating malpractice reforms at the federal level, an urgent need exists to confront the liability problem. The federal government funds approximately half the nation's health care expenditures through Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration, Indian, and Public Health programs; and medical malpractice and other liability costs, driven by pro-plaintiff state laws, have contributed to these already large costs. In fact, medical malpractice costs have contributed greatly to increased medical costs in both the public and private sectors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In connection with medical malpractice litigation, the current legal system allows unlimited compensation for non-economic damages. Non-economic damages are separate from, and do not include compensation for, medical costs, rehabilitative costs, foregone wages, or other out-of-pocket expenses. During the first session of the 104th Congress, the House of Representatives passed legislation to limit non-economic damages associated with medical malpractice. Significant provisions of the reform included a $250,000 limit on non-economic damages and the option to pay future losses exceeding $50,000 in periodic increments. The Senate should carefully consider the House medical malpractice reform provisions while encouraging substantive reforms at the state level.
<p>
<b> Place no more power and control in the hands of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 110 of S. 1028 requires insurance companies and other health plan issuers to guarantee issue coverage, without any exclusion of coverage for pre-existing conditions, to individuals who meet certain requirements related to prior group coverage. Section 111 requires guaranteed renewal of all individual health plans. Section 112 allows states to be exempt from the requirements of Sections 110 and 111 if, and only if, they have in place (or subsequently put in place) an alternative law or program that meets the same goals and is approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In evaluating whether a state meets the goals, the Secretary of HHS is to evaluate state programs according to the four criteria:
<P>
1) Whether the state law or program provides coverage to individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
2) Whether the state law or program provides coverage for preexisting conditions for individuals leaving group coverage;<p>
3) Whether the state law or program provides individuals leaving group coverage with a choice of health plans or a health plan providing comprehensive coverage; and<p>

4) Whether requiring a state to comply with Sections 110 and 111 would have an adverse impact on the number of individuals in the state who have access to affordable health insurance coverage.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Among insurance experts, there is a wide range of estimates on how much premiums in the individual health insurance market actually would increase under S. 1028. Rather than mandate a single uniform approach, as called for in Section 112, Congress should allow the various states to experiment with alternative approaches and methods. States should determine for themselves the best way to guarantee continued availability of health coverage to their residents leaving the group market. To date, 11 states already have enacted guaranteed issue requirements in the individual market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 112 vests enormous power in the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary, in effect, can disapprove legitimate state initiatives that address the problem of how to guarantee continuation of coverage for individuals and families. For instance, the Secretary could rule that state high-risk pools are not "affordable" because their premiums are higher than prevailing market rates, even though significant subsidies are required to cover the true costs of enrollees. Under this scenario, most states' high-risk pools could be found "unaffordable" and unacceptable to the Secretary.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Instead of allowing the Secretary to control how states regulate their individual insurance markets (a traditional state function), S. 1028 should allow the state insurance commissioner (or the official or officials designated by the state to enforce the goals of this legislation) to determine whether the alternative state law or program meets the goals of S. 1028. No review or approval by the Secretary of HHS should be required.
<p>
<b> Reject Section 121's extension of COBRA.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Section 121 of S. 1028 changes COBRA (P.L. 99-272) by allowing individuals who have disabled family members, or who become disabled at any time during their coverage under an initial COBRA extension period, to extend their coverage for the additional 11 months. Currently, this extension is available only to workers who are disabled at the time they lose their coverage.<sup>24</sup>  Today, coverage under COBRA may last from 18 to 36 months, depending on the circumstances of the event leading to loss of health insurance. Under current law, covered employees and dependents are required to pay up to 102 percent of the total premium during the 18-month period. Disabled employees and dependents are eligible for 29 months of continued coverage but then must pay up to 150 percent of the total premium during the additional 11 months.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While the extension of COBRA sounds appealing to Members of Congress and the public, the reality is that employers, and ultimately workers, are required to pay the actual claims costs incurred by employees opting for coverage under COBRA. In short, such a change is another employer mandate. This extra expense has been particularly burdensome on employers already struggling to give health benefits to their current employees. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan public policy research organization specializing in employee benefits, "many employers consider COBRA to be a costly mandate. Any expansion of COBRA would almost certainly increase employer cost for health insurance."<sup>25</sup>  And according to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association, "Claims costs for COBRA subscribers, on average, are typically 40 percent to 60 percent higher than the costs of active employees. Those people who seek COBRA coverage are people who need, but cannot obtain, affordable coverage as individuals, and their high use of medical services is directly reflected in the unusually high COBRA claims costs."<sup>26</sup>  These higher than average costs, which must be borne by employers, will lead inevitably to a reduction in employee benefits and compensation, or to withdrawal from the market.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Suggestions have been made that S. 1028's COBRA provision be extended to all companies. Placing additional mandates on small employers (less than 20 employees) could jeopardize protections for beneficiaries of self-funded ERISA health plans. For example, small employers who insure their employees under federal ERISA requirements have been able to avoid costly state-mandated benefits and taxes on their health plans. It would be ironic for Members of Congress to impose a new layer of federal mandates on a class of employers who have sought protection and relief from state mandates. Furthermore, such an unprecedented reach of federal regulatory power would preempt many of the innovative and effective health reform measures that states have developed and implemented themselves. Finally, the costs associated with such an extension would be too large for small businesses operating on a slim profit margin to bear.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
<b> Replace the Senate HPPCs with House provisions encouraging multiple employer health plans.</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The HPPCs in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill as drafted are vague and will generate intrusive and burdensome federal regulations. Congress should strike this newly created infrastructure and replace it with provisions that would encourage the use of multiple employer health plans, voluntary health insurance associations, and other fully insured arrangements. Legislation to accomplish this (HR. 995) has been proposed by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL).<sup>28</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The goal of giving small businesses and individuals increased purchasing power in the health insurance market is shared by a vast majority of Members of Congress. Unfortunately, S. 1028 creates an additional federal regulatory framework in setting up its HPPCs while simultaneously placing them at a competitive advantage over non-HPPC plans in the health insurance market. Lawmakers should be cautious in supporting legislation which, in its present form, easily could turn the health insurance market into a government-run entity at either the state or federal levels, reproducing something that looks and works like President Clinton's Health Security Act.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In stark contrast, Title III of the Fawell bill would allow smaller businesses to join together under the auspices of ERISA to purchase fully insured coverage or to cover their employees under self-insured multiple employer health plans (MEHPs).<sup>29</sup>  Since 85 percent of the uninsured population are in families headed by a worker,<sup>30</sup> it is significant that Title III of the Fawell proposal seeks to use ERISA to preempt state laws that prohibit two or more employers from obtaining fully insured health insurance coverage under any fully insured multiple employer arrangement.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In addition to providing smaller employers and individuals with increased purchasing power, the Fawell proposal eliminates the confusion surrounding the responsibilities of the states and the U.S. Department of Labor under ERISA. This confusion has led to a cottage industry of fly-by-night insurance swindlers who hide behind the ERISA preemption clause. Ironically, states that have enacted statutes regulating legitimate self-insured multiple employer plans often have hurt legitimate arrangements meeting the ERISA plan definitions and caused such arrangements to dissolve. These state actions have been arbitrary and do not follow any consistent pattern of reasoning, either within a state or among states. To remedy this situation, Title III of the Fawell proposal would give states a consistent guideline for the regulation of legitimate ERISA multiple employer plans wishing to continue their operations.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Title III also would give legitimate self-insured associations (including but not limited to church plans, franchise networks, associations, certain large employers, and collectively bargained plans) two clear and distinct regulatory options. First, legitimate associations could maintain or establish multiple employer health plans by seeking licensure in the states permitting such practices. Alternatively, these plans could seek federal certification pursuant to the "exemption" provision in current ERISA law. Under Title III of the Fawell proposal, entities that are created for the express purpose of purchasing health insurance would automatically be subject to the laws of the state in which they seek to do business. In turn, the states could make these groups meet any state-defined insurance or multiple employer plan licensing requirements state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While smaller employers and individuals are at a disadvantage as they attempt to negotiate premium rates with insurance carriers, this does not necessitate the creation of new entities and additional federal regulations as prescribed in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Accordingly, the Fawell proposal gives smaller employers and the self-employed the right to take advantage of the "[e]conomies of scale that large employers and multi-union employer plans have had for years under ERISA [to gain] access to affordable insurance."<sup>31</sup>  Unlike the uneven playing field created in S. 1028, the Fawell proposal would help ensure the ability of traditional insurance carriers to compete with self-insured plans for the small employer, self-employed, and individual market.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
S. 1028 enjoys broad bipartisan support in the Senate. In Congress, there is a strong desire to reform the broken health insurance market. S. 1028 is a well-intentioned effort to address the portability problem that confronts millions of workers and their families. While the creation of group-to-individual conversion is a positive step toward making health insurance more portable, its impact is diminished by the creation of additional regulatory distortions in the health insurance market. It is unfortunate that S. 1028 fails to address the tax system that currently impedes the ability of the market to function, and that it opens up the dangers of new distortions and sources of instability.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Over 80 percent of Americans under age 65 are covered by health insurance. While they generally are satisfied with their coverage, a genuine fear exists that this security could be lost. Reform of the health insurance market should address the source of this fear -- the fact that health insurance is predominantly employment-based and that federal tax policy exclusively favors this type of arrangement. This Senate bill does not address the key problems confronting the millions of Americans seeking to gain access to the health insurance market. The sponsors of S. 1028 attempt, instead, to create a transitional phase from group (employer-based) to individual coverage through federal regulation. Despite its drawbacks, however, S. 1028 could be the vehicle for significant health insurance reform, including the individual ownership of health insurance plans. By incorporating the improvements offered in the House proposal, S. 1028 could advance the security of health insurance for millions of working families. Instead of distorting the health insurance market with unnecessary and detrimental regulations, Members of Congress should promote a free-market policy by creating a health insurance system that is driven by consumer choice and genuine competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The health insurance market is one that traditionally has been regulated at the state level. Any congressional reform should not hamper the successes and innovations produced by state initiatives. To its sponsors' credit, S. 1028 challenges the false presumption that health insurance should be exclusively employment-based, and even more important, highlights the problems of portability and affordability that are inherent consequences of such a restrictive system. Members of Congress should build on the positive features of S. 1028 while making improvements that will give working Americans what they want from health insurance reform:  true portability and individual policies that give them long-term health insurance protection against the financial devastation of catastrophic illness.

<h2>Lessons on Reforming Health Care At the State Level: 
Massachusetts, Minnesota, And Washington State</h2> 
A Physicians Council Symposium<br>
June 13, 1995<br>


<a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">DR. ROBERT E. MOFFIT</a>, Deputy Director of 
Domestic Policy Studies, The Heritage Foundation: With last year's collapse of President Clinton's 
huge health plan, we have seen throughout the country a growth in policy experimentation at the 
state level. But the striking feature about most of these state-based reforms is that, in many 
instances -- such as Washington, Tennessee, Minnesota, and Kentucky -- the health care reform 
proposals resemble, in crucial respects, the discredited Clinton health care plan.
Like the Clinton plan, these systems concentrate key decisionmaking power in the hands of 
government officials. The health care system is to be governed by a central board or commission 
that issues rules and regulations and guidelines for the system. Almost all of them have a 
comprehensive, government-standardized benefits package specifying in some detail the treatments 
or procedures that must be available to citizens. Most establish government-sponsored health care 
cooperatives, or regional alliances at the state levels, or managed care networks. Most include 
employer mandates and a system of price controls.
<p>
But state reformers have painfully discovered that, in many respects, reform at the state level is 
subject to the same explosive politics as reform at the national level. The politics of health care 
reform is like the politics of a Rubik's cube. It is an excruciating exercise in frustration: You fix one 
thing only to find that you are breaking another.
<p>
Talking about reform of health care at the state level, we have three distinguished panelists.
<p>
<a href="#mass">Charles Baker</a> comes to us from the state of Massachusetts. He was 
appointed Secretary of Administration and Finance by Governor William Weld in November of 
1994. Mr. Baker directs the preparation of the Governor's budget proposals in Massachusetts and 
serves as the Governor's chief advisor on fiscal matters. Prior to assuming that role, he was 
Undersecretary of Health in the Executive Office of Health and Human Services. As 
Undersecretary, he managed six health agencies and was responsible for the reform of the hospital 
finance system.
<p>
The second of our panelists is <a href="#minn">Dr. Ken Heithoff</a>. Dr. Heithoff is Chairman 
of the CDI Management Corporation and Medical Director of the Center for Diagnostic Imaging in 
Minneapolis, Minnesota, a physician-owned company. He is a member of the Hammond County 
Medical Society, the Minnesota Medical Association, and the American College of Radiology. 
Very active in market-based health care reform in Minnesota, he served as an advisor to 
Congressman Jim Ramstad and Senator Rod Grams, the new Senator for Minnesota. Dr. Heithoff is 
the Chairman of the Minnesota Independent Republican Health Care Task Force, which has been 
meeting regularly since April of 1994.
<p>
<a href="#wash">Phil Dyer</a> is the state representative of the fifth district in Washington 
State. Representative Dyer serves on the Health Care Committee of the Washington State House. 
He has a B.S. from Oregon State University. He also is a graduate of the Army Corps of Engineers, 
serving as a member of the Command General Staff College. Representative Dyer received a public 
service award from the National Federation of Independent Business. He was the leading opponent 
of Washington State's Clinton-style health care plan.
<p>
<a name="mass"></a>
<b>MASSACHUSETTS</b>
<p>
CHARLES BAKER: The most important thing about state-level health care reform is to remember 
the old Clint Eastwood saying about knowing your limitations. I agree with The Heritage 
Foundation and with Dr. Kevin Vigilante and others that the major genetic error in the current 
structure of the existing health care system is the federal tax code. And because that's the major, 
fundamental structural problem, it has created a corporate relationship between health plans and 
provider systems as opposed to an individual relationship between patients and doctors.
<p>
Therefore, I was never that interested, at the state level, in pursuing anything as broad and as 
comprehensive as Minnesota Care, or Tenn Care, or Washington State Care, or whatever else you 
call them. But we did have some things to deal with when Governor Weld took office in 1991. Our 
Medicaid program had been growing 22 percent a year for the previous three or four years and was 
basically "PacMan-ing" its way through the rest of the state budget. At the same time, you had an 
angry beneficiary community, an angry provider community, an angry physician community -- 
everybody was angry, but the thing was hemorrhaging money at the same time.
<p>
We also had probably the most regulated hospital finance system in the United States, second only 
to perhaps Maryland or New York. Hospital prices were still growing 10 and 11 percent a year. 
Health care costs generally were growing about 16 percent a year. 
<p>
The standard response from a lot of the folks in the political establishment was, "Well, obviously 
the regulatory model isn't being implemented hard enough."  This was directly opposed to my point 
of view, which was that the state's regulatory model was creating the perverse incentives that were 
driving the rate of spending and making everybody so cranky about what they were getting on the 
service delivery end at the same time.
<p>
<b>Deregulation.</b> So we pursued a fairly aggressive strategy on two fronts. The first was to 
disencumber the provider system from the existing regulatory mass. We managed to pass 
legislation that was signed by the Governor in the fall of 1991 that basically deregulated, on 
January 1, 1992, the entire hospital financing system. Among the naysayers, the sense at the time 
was that this was going to ruin the tight rules that had done such a good job of controlling spending 
in Massachusetts. 
<p>
The good news is that health care spending in Massachusetts in fiscal 1994, the last year for which 
we have final year data, was actually up a little less than two or three percent, and hospital spending 
was actually down a little bit. And the hospital industry overall was in pretty good financial shape. 
This was the exact opposite of what the liberals had said was going to occur. Instead, we took the 
lid off on the pricing, and a very funny thing happened: The market worked. This, of course, didn't 
come as a big surprise to me, but I think it came as a big surprise to lots of other people.
<p>
<b>Medicaid.</b> The second was to improve Medicaid. We started with two assumptions. First, 
that markets were good. Second, that doctors were good. A big part of the political problem that we 
had in Massachusetts was that nobody trusted anybody. In 1988, the head of the Massachusetts 
Medical Society went to the national annual meeting of the AMA and referred to Massachusetts as 
the Beirut of medicine. Early on, I made it a point to make sure that we had doctors involved in 
practically all of our major health care initiatives -- and I mean practicing doctors, not unpracticing 
doctors -- because I believed that they would have a lot of very positive and useful and helpful 
insights into how you could go about doing something to fix a very broken Medicaid program.
<p>
We ended up implementing what I think remains today the largest and perhaps the only statewide 
managed care initiative for Medicaid recipients in the United States. It's got almost 650,000 folks 
enrolled, and it's really two programs. We have a traditional HMO program, but that only serves 
about 100,000 folks. That is the straight plan -- a capitated payment arrangement. But the vast 
majority of the recipients that we serve are served through a primary care program managed by 
about 3,000 doctors. 
<p>
One of the things we decided not to do was to compel physicians to participate in this program. 
Rather, we proposed to raise their fee structure, believing that if we raised their fee structure, they 
would be more likely to serve Medicaid recipients. We thought one of the problems we had with 
the old system was that its fee structure was so bad, and its rules were so bad, that a lot of folks who 
otherwise would have been served by doctors were going to hospitals. This was the most expensive 
and, in many cases, the most inappropriate place for them to get served.
<p>
The other thing we learned was that, despite the statewide availability of plenty of good physicians, 
we had unbelievably high utilization of the Boston teaching hospitals as a source for primary care -- 
totally disproportionate to the population it represented -- for our Medicaid population. So we got 
very aggressive about working with the medical societies and some of the other major physician 
groups to try to create a new relationship between the physician community and the Medicaid 
program. 
<p>
One objective was to get care out of Boston and to hospitals in other parts of the state, and to try to 
develop real relationships out in the hinterlands to serve this population. As a result, there has been 
a dramatic decline in the use of teaching hospitals as sources of primary care for Medicaid 
beneficiaries. As you might suspect, this has been good for patient care, good for local physician-
patient relationships, and good for us. We saved a lot of money by giving people a local and more 
appropriate source for primary and preventive and specialty health care.
<p>
The other interesting thing that we did -- based on advice we got from people on the plan side and 
from the physician community -- was hire an independent company to help us help Medicaid 
beneficiaries make decisions about who they wanted to have do their primary care for them, and to 
help solve what I would refer to as the doctor/program conflict.
<p>
There was never anybody they could call, except some 1-800 number in Boston, to get an answer 
about some problem they were having with the Medicaid program. So one of the things we did was 
contract with a private entity to set up a field-based intermediary that could help solve, at the local 
level, physician problems and recipient problems with the Medicaid program. As a result, I think 
we were able to level the playing field and take some of the marketing and enrollment techniques 
that have dominated a lot of the public payer programs on the plan side out of the loop, and we 
created a truly level playing field. We also gave physicians a place to go to get their questions 
answered.
<P>
We now have over 3,000 doctors enrolled in the primary care program. For the most part, we 
survey them, and we have a standing advisory committee that works on particular issues. It has 
been very successful. For example, we discovered we had a big problem with hospitalization for 
pediatric asthma -- just off-the-chart numbers. It didn't make any sense. The standard way to deal 
with that would be to assume that it's bad medicine and that somehow it's the doctors' fault.
<p>
What we did instead was ask our advisory group to start talking to some of the doctors who dealt 
with significant numbers of Medicaid patients to find out why this was happening. We learned 
three things. Most physicians didn't know that nebulizers were covered under the Medicaid 
program. The two primary drugs that you would prescribe to serve kids who had asthma problems 
were on a prior approval list that was a colossal pain in the neck for a physician to get approved, 
and, as a result, they weren't prescribing them. And we found we had done a lousy job of helping 
the physician community understand what kinds of services and medications were covered under 
the Medicaid program.
<p>
So, again, working with some of the professional societies, we went through a major education 
campaign. We took all of the asthma drugs off the prior approval list, made sure people knew that 
nebulizers were indeed part of the program, and used the medical society as our primary outlet for 
information. Information from those of us in the government always ends up reading like 
bureaucratic prose, whereas if it comes from medical groups, it can be translated into a language 
that doctors participating in the program understand.
<p>
The end result has been a gradual decline in pediatric asthma admissions, which -- as the father of a 
four-year-old who has asthma and spends a lot of time with that kid on the nebulizer -- is a big win. 
It's a big win for physicians who want to do the right thing on behalf of their patients, it's a big win 
for the state in terms of cost-effective service delivery, and it's a big win for families who don't like 
to have to sleep on the chair next to the hospital bed for two or three nights while their kid's sitting 
there breathing so hard that every fiber of his being is concentrating on just making sure he gets his 
next puff of air.
<p>
<b>Treating AIDS.</b> The other thing we've done that has been kind of interesting in this area 
is take some of our most difficult populations -- end stage AIDS sufferers, for example -- and ask 
physician groups if they would be willing to capitate to serve these populations. The argument is 
simple: Medicaid is a very narrowly defined program under federal rules, and there are many things 
you can do for AIDS patients that make a very big difference in terms of dignity, quality of life, and 
cost effectiveness that aren't covered under the existing fee-for-service program.
<p>
So, we said to some of the group practices that dealt with a lot of HIV patients, "Look, we'll 
capitate you, and we'll establish some risk relationships so you're not wildly exposed out there, and 
we'll try to sell it to the federal government. The idea here will be that you'll be able to spend your 
capitation on whatever you think the patient needs, which in many cases is not traditional but is 
appropriate for somebody in those circumstances, both from a cost-effectiveness point of view and 
a quality of life point of view. We think this will be good for you. It will get us out of your hair on 
prior approval, we will refrain from looking over your shoulder, and you'll have a lot more 
flexibility about how you treat them. It will be good for us because it will give you an opportunity 
to expand your horizon in terms of how you take care of them, and if we can do it at a rate that 
looks as good, or better, than our fee-for-service average participant, then we win, too."
<p>
But, of course, we had to run it by Washington. It took us a year and a half to get the federal 
government to agree to let us do this, despite the fact that they were going to save money on their 
Medicaid program, because they paid for 50 percent of it. But the results have been astounding. 
Hospitalization, for example, for these folks has been driven practically to zero, and doctors have 
been using all kinds of interventions and service delivery techniques that are very nontraditional to 
improve the way they take care of these patients. It also has moved the knowledge base a light year 
as a result. 
<P>
What was required to make this work was a lot more flexibility on our part about how the physician 
treated the patient. People say, "Well, you can't make capitation work because the population is too 
sick," but people say this about the Medicare population, the over-65s. The best capitated program 
we've put in place is taking care of the end stage AIDs patient. You can't get much sicker than that 
population, and it has turned out to be, in many ways, a big improvement over what we did 
previously.
<p>
And, you know, our Medicaid growth rate this year is less than 2 percent. Our case load adjusted 
growth rate has seen negative numbers for three years now. We have a provider community that's a 
lot happier with what we are doing now than they were with the system before. The client 
community also is a lot happier. But most of it is really a function of giving people, at the level 
where the decisions needed to be made, more authority to make decisions and turning some of the 
incentives around. I believe you can do the same thing with Medicare. 
<p>
<b>Implications for Medicare.</b> When people say the way to fix Medicare is to cut the fees, 
they are missing the point. The way to fix Medicare is to create a system with the right set of 
incentives for both the provider and the patient to do the right thing. More often than not, doing the 
right thing is the cheapest and most cost-effective way to solve a problem. It also assures the 
highest quality.
<p>
I really hope this Medicare debate does not become fear mongering and scare tactics, because there 
is a much larger issue at stake here. The physician-patient relationship is part of it, but more 
importantly, at least from my point of view as a dad, we have to balance the federal budget for our 
children and we have to do it soon. Otherwise we are just ruining the lives of our children and our 
grandchildren and setting up an impossible dynamic for them. It will be impossible for them to 
grow and be successful in this country while carrying this huge debt and its growing interest 
payments.
<p>
<b>Federal Deficits.</b> The final point I'd like to make is also the most important: Medicare has 
to be part of the discussion about the federal budget deficit, as does Medicaid. You simply can't 
balance the federal budget unless you take an honest look at these two programs. As a real deficit 
hawk, whose four-year-old and one-year-old sons are already inheriting four-and-a-half trillion 
dollars worth of federal debt, I'm ashamed that we have let this happen. I've been saying this to all 
the folks that come see me as the chief financial person in the state and whine about this cut and 
that cut. I don't care whose ox gets gored here. I want to see a federal budget that is balanced at 
some point in the next ten years, because I'm jeopardizing the lives and well-being of my children 
by not being willing to bite the bullet on this one.
<P>
The important role that you and Heritage and others can play in this discussion is to drive home the 
core message that balancing the federal budget is something this country has to do. And you can't 
do it by raising taxes. Why?  Because it's a spending problem. It's not a revenue problem.
<p>
<a name="minn"></a>
<b>MINNESOTA</b>
<p>
<b>DR. KEN HEITHOFF</b>: I happen to agree with Bob Moffit's statement that you can't really 
achieve much fundamental reform at the state level, and that's the quandary. Representative Dyer 
has been there, and he's back from the trip. And in Minnesota, we're pretty much back.
We had a Clinton-style plan, just as Washington State did. Let me describe for you the chronology 
of Minnesota Care and how it evolved. When Surgeon General Everett Koop was there in 1992, he 
looked at Minnesota's health care system, which had been rated as one or two in the country in 
terms of quality. He said, "This system doesn't seem to be broken. Why fix it?" 
<p>
It was a political and economic phenomenon. We had a recession. There were a lot of white collar 
workers out of jobs, and the first thing that they were going to lose, because we had an employer-
based system, was their health care benefits. Liberal politicians came back from their little political 
sojourn into the rural countryside in Minnesota and decided that they needed to fix the state's health 
care system.
<p>
They had some very capable help. Although Representative Dyer in Washington and I have been 
there and are on our way back, some of you are going to begin this journey. The template for the 
Clinton-style state-based reform is going to be the same. Whether it's Minnesota or Washington or 
Tennessee or Kentucky, they will all look the same. They all have the same structure, and they all 
follow the same political agenda.
<P>
Nevertheless, after two years of this in Minnesota, I don't think there are any bad people. As 
physicians we need to stop feeling sorry for ourselves; nobody else is going to. Regardless of the 
reality, we are seen as a privileged, wealthy class. That's not the reality for a lot of our primary care 
practitioners, but nobody is going to listen to you.
<p>
I used to sit and carp about this in the doctors' lounge. I used to be very angry about it. I'm not 
angry any more. The reason: A lot of our state-based reformers simply have a different philosophy. 
It's not about health care. There isn't a damned thing that you can do, sitting in your office, to 
practice better medicine that will change how this thing turns out.
<p>
First of all, physicians have to understand that it's about economics, and it's about power. We have 
been villainized by the media and by the politicians during the past two or three or four years for a 
very specific purpose. It is not because they think we're bad people, but they have to break the bond 
of trust between physicians and their patients in order to have the kind of government disruption of 
the medical delivery service that they have been attempting. So forget all of the things that you hear 
and read in the papers. Maybe stop reading the papers for a while. Have faith in free-market 
principles, because they're extremely powerful and they do work.
<p>
I am convinced that we are at the low point. Five years from now, we will have a hard time 
recognizing the kind of fear and trepidation that we have experienced in recent years. The classic 
managed care and HMO philosophies will become pass because personally managed care -- I 
think Speaker Newt Gingrich coined that term -- is a much more powerful concept than managed 
care. "Managed care" is a misnomer. It should be called "restrictive care."
<p>
In Minnesota, we started, I think, between 1985 and 1987. Some of our legislators teamed up with 
the Children's Defense Fund. The debate always starts with access, because you can't really get 
people too excited about cost, at least at first. But the debate quickly shifts to costs. Quite frankly, 
this is the fruit of a dysfunctional third-party employer-based system of finance which has become 
unaffordable for employers.
<p>
<b>The Role of Business.</b> I don't happen to share the view that the employers are necessarily 
physicians' enemies. They now understand that they are going to be taken care of by the same 
system. CEOs in our state have come face to face with the Minnesota health care delivery system. 
The legislation collapsed the insurance market into three oligopolies, where 80 percent of our 
insurance products are delivered by three highly integrated, vertically integrated systems. The 
Business Health Care Action Group was instrumental in proposing that health care be delivered in 
that way. But after playing with the "reformers" for two years, they got very frightened by what 
happened. Why?  Because under Minnesota Care, fee for service would be destroyed, but it would 
be replaced by a tightly managed care delivery system. Care would be delivered through integrated 
service networks, and those integrated service networks, by definition, included physicians, 
hospitals, and an insurance company.
<p>
There were only a few people that could play in such a marketplace, and it was, in fact, promoted 
by this Business Health Care Action Group. They put out a request for proposal which could only 
be answered by such a very, very strongly integrated service network. But after two years of 
working with that, and seeing the competitive market collapse, they became very frightened. About 
a month to six weeks ago, they did a 180 degree about-face. They have announced their intention to 
contract directly with competing physician groups rather than obtain coverage through health plans. 
They are all self-insured employers. This is a watershed event, not just for Minnesota, but for the 
nation as a whole. 
<p>
The business leaders have gone to the health plans, the health plan not being an arrangement 
between the physician and the patients, and have said, "You know, we're really sick and tired of 
paying you guys millions of dollars and having all the recipients [the doctors] be upset about it."  
Who is upset?  The providers, the patients, and even the employers. The people who are buying the 
plans are not the people who are receiving the care. 
<p>
So now they are saying, "We want to contract directly with the physician organizations for our 
health care. We want to put the health plan outside of the physician-patient relationship, not 
between it."  The health plans have become huge oligopolies; we have a $2.2 billion organization 
which used to be our physicians' health plan -- it became United Health Care when the state 
government declared that physicians couldn't own it. United Health Care now has $2.6 billion of 
cash. Our Physicians Health Plan, which became Medica, merged with 27 hospitals into a $2.2 
billion structure called Allina, and now they're buying out the physicians that started Physicians 
Health Plan.
<P>
We have about five physician-directed organizations in Minnesota, independent physicians who 
have gathered together as an alternative, to practice and to try to stay independent rather than be 
enrolled in integrated service networks. 
<p>
<b>The Political Process.</b> Although they wanted to go to a single-payer system like the 
Canadian system -- the people who began this process were all still single-payer advocates -- there 
were a few people who understood that the single-payer option wasn't politically palatable. They 
tried it in 1991. It was vetoed by the Republican Governor, Arne Carleson.
<P>
Because the Republicans were convinced that the Governor's veto would be overridden and we 
would have a single-payer system in 1991, the Republicans in the legislature had to sit down with 
the Democrats and the Governor. We thus had a situation where both political parties and the 
Governor favored Minnesota Care, even though the people who started that process and who ran 
Minnesota Care from the beginning were dyed-in-the-wool, absolute advocates of the single-payer 
system. They pushed Minnesota Care in that direction, using emotional appeals and saying 
anything but what they were really after. Both political parties in the state went along.
<p>
Minnesota Care became a very tightly regulated, centrally controlled, Clinton-type plan instead of 
the free-market approach it was supposed to be, and which the Governor continued to say it was. It 
wasn't until 1994, when the Governor and the people in the Republican caucuses began to be very 
skeptical of where this was going, that the Governor reversed course and wrote an open letter to 
Minnesotans expressing concern over the direction of Minnesota Care. 
<p>
Minnesota Care was an incremental bill. It started in 1992, but it wasn't to be fully implemented 
until 1997. It set up a series of stepping stones along the way. The Governor signed the bill, but in 
the open letter to the people of Minnesota in 1994, he raised some very significant questions. At the 
same time, I had been working with Representative Jim Ramstad, and I had also obtained 
considerable material from The Heritage Foundation, which was really pushing for free-market 
health reform. Senior Republicans came to me and said, "Put your money where your mouth is. If 
you really want to pursue a free-market approach, if you want to have something, let's start a health 
care task force. But it has to be self-funding."
<p>
We started with an initial funding of about $18,000 and took a multidisciplinary approach to health 
care reform. The idea was to educate the legislators because it was appalling to me that after two 
years of this national and state debate, when you would think that all the legislators would be 
unequivocally informed about health care, the fact was that most of them were not. Everybody told 
them that health care was too difficult to understand. For most people, that was a convenient excuse 
for not putting forth the effort to become informed, and they really didn't understand it.
<p>
We held field hearings. We went to regional briefings for all the candidates before the election. We 
sat down with all the incumbents. We sat down with all of the new prospective candidates. We used 
Heritage Foundation materials extensively, explaining the relationship between the health insurance 
markets, tax policies, and the health care "crisis."
<P>
Initially, we couldn't talk about Minnesota Care because it was supported by the Republican Party 
leadership. We started with an anti-single-payer slant, or an anti-Clinton slant. But it was quite 
interesting that, when we talked specifically about what was bad about the Clinton health care plan, 
they had been around Minnesota Care long enough to know they were similar in many respects.
<p>
We formed a legislative subcommittee which drafted an alternative bill. I would invite you to look 
into this educational process, because it's wonderful to be inside the process and not a special-
interest lobbyist on the outside, not a physician who's complaining about something or looking for 
something. If you are promoting solid information -- which is a good policy for all, not just 
providers -- they come to trust you. The information that you're giving is something that is good for 
them and that is good for their constituents.
<p>
As a result, we drafted a bill, an alternative to Minnesota Care, which was the first time that this 
had even been contemplated. The Governor did not openly support the process. But then came the 
1994 election. We had two of the old guard of the Minnesota Republican Party who decided they 
would not run for re-election, and it gave us a chance for new blood and new leadership. The end 
result was that we proposed the bill and crafted a bill with providers, with the physicians and 
patients, with insurance people, with nurses, chiropractors, and dentists. Everybody got involved.
<p>
At the same time, we got involved in politics. We had 3,000 members. We had 800 major 
contributors, and we raised $86,000. We participated in probably six major campaigns. We worked 
closely with Rod Grams in his successful Senate bid. I personally wrote a letter to 14,000 health 
care providers in Minnesota about two weeks before the election, and a lot of those people 
contributed individually.
<p>
In the meantime, our task force crafted a reform bill. Because it had business input, and because it 
had insurance industry input, as well as provider and consumer input, it was well crafted and 
economically sound. Even though we were still in the minority in Minnesota, we came within two 
votes of passage. We weren't as successful as our colleagues in Washington State, but we came 
within two votes of having our bill supersede Minnesota Care. In the process, because our 
legislators not only were convinced of the correctness of the free-market approach, but also really 
understood it, they talked across the aisles with their Democrat colleagues, and we, in fact, had 
pretty close to a working bipartisan majority. 
<p>
We got the head of the Senate Finance Committee -- a Democrat and probably the most respected 
legislator on both sides of the aisle -- to cosponsor our health reform bill. And because our 
legislators understood the issues, and they were passionate about free-market health care reform, we 
amended the Minnesota Care bill that came out of committee. We slowed and, in some cases, 
repealed some of the more onerous parts of Minnesota Care.
<p>
In the 1994 election, 13 seats were added to the conservative Republican side. Conservatives won 
all five special elections. The Governor is going to be appointing a couple of Democrats to 
positions in the state bureaucracy. We're going to win those special elections, so I think we're going 
to have a clear majority or a working conservative majority in our House, and we're very close in 
the Senate.
<p>
It is remarkable what we have accomplished and how much fun it has been, for somebody who was 
totally out of politics or the policy process before this, to be part of this effort. I had never chaired 
anything like this before. I tried to shy away from it, but I saw my ideas begin to have effect, and 
we continued to show gains and gather momentum. It also would not have been possible if we had 
not been supplied an executive director. The chairman of the Republican Party gave us a 
remarkable young woman who had worked in Congressman Bob Michel's office. She knew the 
political arena. She knew who was important at meetings and how to approach them -- what we 
could and could not say. I got the credit for being the chair, but she was responsible for the success 
that we had in terms of setting up the meetings, the agenda, and providing continuity and vital 
advice and contacts. 
<p>
In terms of education, <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a> and <a 
href="/heritage/staff/moffit">Bob Moffit</a> of The Heritage Foundation came out and did a 
remarkable job for us, along with Molly Bordonaro from the American Legislative Exchange 
Council. The education of legislators was (and continues to be) the most important function we 
perform. We are back, and what we did not get this year, we will get next year. We repealed price 
controls on providers. We put off the mandated universal coverage that was supposed to go into 
effect in 1997. We put that off indefinitely. We also changed the universal defined benefit plan and 
repealed the regulated all-payer system. This was supposed to be left for us independent 
practitioners. It was a highly regulated, impossible situation. Only now are people beginning to 
admit that it was never intended to be implemented but proposed to frightened independent 
physicians to persuade them to voluntarily become employees of the large integrated service 
networks.
<p>
We have come back -- not as far as Washington State, but we are on our way. What are the lessons? 
 First, you should trust free-market principles. They will work. What has been unleashed in this 
debate are the free-market ideas: medical savings accounts, personally managed care, voucher 
systems, and so forth. That is so compelling to me. I have no fear that we independent practitioners 
will continue to exist and that private medical practice will see a real comeback. But we have to do 
nationally what we've done in Minnesota: form larger organizations of independent physicians.
<p>
We have 1,300 physicians in five physician-directed organizations. I sat on two of their boards, and 
it was heart-breaking for me to see these proud professionals go hat in hand to the three large health 
plans, essentially begging for some insurance product that the PDOs -- physician directed 
organizations -- could offer through the health plan. I knew it wasn't going to happen because it was 
not in the interest of the health plans to do so. They don't want us to succeed; they want physicians 
subjugated to their bureaucracies.
<p>
We have been meeting to try to put together a physician-directed organization where all five would 
come together and offer an insurance product. One of the ideas was that physicians and their 
families and their employees -- all 12,000 of us -- would offer a medical savings account (MSA) 
and demonstrate to the employers in our market that we could, in fact, drive down the cost of 
medicine by 30 or 40 percent with an open access, consumer-friendly plan -- to use our own 
practices as a beta test site.
<P>
We are looking at other options. I don't think we can out-HMO the big corporate players, but if we 
come to the market with some very creative alternatives, such as MSAs and managed care in its 
best sense -- best practices, best practitioners, and so forth -- we can succeed.
<p>
Given my recent experience, and the successful momentum generated by a relatively small group of 
dedicated individuals, I have little sympathy for people in the medical profession who say that they 
do not have the time and money to become involved in the political process. I've seen the 
chiropractors do a lot more with a lot less money and a lot more contributions. They were very 
helpful in getting bipartisan support. They also bought into the idea of medical savings accounts 
and wrote a letter of support.
<p>
We have to educate ourselves. Most physicians haven't heard about The Heritage Foundation. I 
think that's a problem. They don't understand that health care reform is not about how they practice 
medicine, but about the perverse incentives of the current financing system; that turning our 
delivery system upside down can cure the ills if the financial incentives aren't damaged. Thankfully, 
that is occurring.
<p>
The underlying principle and meaning of professionalism is a primary focus on our vocation and 
disinterest in economic gain. I firmly believe that 98 percent of the professionals that I practice 
with, and all of you in this room, are interested in taking care of your patients and would just like to 
get back to doing that. But you can't ignore the economics. Instead of playing golf, we have to do 
this. If it's another hour, then do it. You all worked 24 hours a day when you were interns. I think 
you have to go back to that for a short period of time. I don't want to do this for a long time, but I 
think that for the next year or two it is essential.

<b>WASHINGTON STATE</b>
<p>
<b>REPRESENTATIVE PHIL DYER:</b> Dr. Heithoff talked about sacrifice. I don't mean to 
sound "Woe is me," but I'd like to take you back in history just a little bit. In 1990, in the state of 
Washington, Governor Gardner, the predecessor to our current Governor Lowry, in his second term 
convened a broad, bipartisan, cross-cultural, horizontal agglomeration of business, labor, all the 
players, and called it his Health Care Commission. There were 13 voting members, plus a large 
number of advisory committees.
<p>
I, for 24 years now, have worked in the medical malpractice insurance field, so I come with a little 
bias in understanding the delivery system and the finance system. I worked for the task force 
regarding tort reform, which had been a crusade for me for many, many years.
<p>
I watched as the 13 Commission members, through 1990, leading up to 1992's election, sat and 
narrowly voted for provision after provision. You are going to hear some similarities between what 
Ken talked about in Minnesota and what Washington State adopted, as if the two states were 
literally lying on top of each other.
<p>
For instance, in 1992, the Commission voted, by one vote, to go with the single-payer system. It 
was an insidious setup for what they called managed competition, the system that was introduced 
following the 1992 elections in Washington State. The political complexion of the Washington 
state legislature at that time then became very heavily Democratic, which it had narrowly been for a 
long time.
<p>
I was not an elected official. We had an open district where there was an open seat, a Republican 
district. And I, a white male Republican, found myself facing a female Democratic opponent. I 
won, with 50.4 percent of the vote, less than 51 percent. 
<p>
I went to the legislature as a freshman. I walked into a caucus in the House of Representatives of 98 
members, and the ranking minority leader turned to me and said, "We need a chairman for the 
Health Care Committee. We've got a minor little debate going on on major policy here. Phil, you're 
it. You're all we've got."
<P>
Four days into the legislature, I became the ranking minority member on the Health Care 
Committee, where I watched the passage of a bill that was constantly being revised, with 202 FAX-
headers -- the latest wisdom from Washington, D.C. -- coming into the Democratic caucus, because 
in that spring of 1993, the Ira Magaziner task force had been formed and was, in fact, operating.
<p>
We ended up with a "managed care only" law that had premium caps, a broad-powered health 
services commission independent of public accountability, a uniform benefit plan dictated by that 
commission, and employer mandates. The only difference between the Clinton plan and ours was 
that Clinton was an 80 percent mandate and we were 50 percent sponsorship. We also had alliances 
that were unique geographic monopolies, and government-certified health plans -- a mimic of what 
we saw introduced later here in the lesser Washington, as we prefer to call it.
<p>
In 1993, the liberal mantra was not dissimilar to our friends at Nike: "Just do it."  And in "just 
doing it," you'll see another similarity. It was later admitted, in reviews with the legislators that 
passed the law in 1993, that fewer than ten out of 147 legislators had even read the bill. They were 
caught up in the emotion of the reform rhetoric and compassion for the downtrodden. No 
understanding of either the current system or the damage they were going to do to that system was 
evident. 
<p>
Nor did they understand the dissimilarities between health care financing and health care delivery. 
They would mix their rhetoric in talking about universality and access as if no one was getting any 
health care at all. This was in direct contradiction to the 1986 COBRA, which had said to all 
facilities, "You're going to take somebody in whether they've got a dime to their name or not."  No 
discussion of uncompensated care was contemplated.
<p>
The similarities are dramatic. Dr. Heithoff and I had talked briefly, but in listening to his 
presentation, I could have listened for another hour, because it would have been my speech. It's 
what happened in Washington State.
<P>
I referenced my manic compulsiveness, and I referenced back to his sacrifice. I turned to my wife 
and said, "Let me remind you of a fellow I worked for out of Texas years ago. He told me as a 
young insurance salesman following my departure from Washington, D.C., having worked for 
President Ford and not winning against President Carter, I had to go get a real job. He said, 'When 
you get out there to sell, don't make your competition angry, because they're going to work real 
hard to beat you if you do.'"
<p>
In 1993, I think the latter occurred, because I left that session, and I said, "This is absurd. This was 
a fraud on the people of the state of Washington. It has been a fraud on my fellow legislators. And, 
by God, we're going to turn this thing around."
<p>
I was not alone. There was a large employer community that became concerned, particularly the 
small business community. It was not only the denouement of the Clinton plan, but the denouement 
of my own business. I had to sell my business. I became preoccupied.
<p>
Over a space of 18 months, I did 168 speeches around the state of Washington. I would talk to 
anybody who would listen to me. It came to the point where I thought I would be wearing a 
sandwich board walking in downtown Seattle. I felt like Don Quixote. I had one Sancho, then two, 
then three, then four. And pretty soon, the windmill was no longer ethereal. It became quite real. 
We started being able to predict, and to see, what the implementation of that law would mean.
<p>
Dr. Heithoff referred to Minnesota's as a staged and incremental plan, not unlike the Clinton health 
care plan. We had the same staging, and, in fact, the time frame is so similar it is scary. Ours was 
implemented July 1, 1993, with final implementation in 1999. This is the frog and water syndrome. 
It is easy to take a frog and throw him into boiling water. The frog is not stupid. There's a 
neurological response: The water is hot, and he jumps out. It's not good for the frog. But put the 
frog in a pan of tepid water and turn the degrees up incrementally over time, and he will sit there 
and cook in his own juice. 
<p>
That was the staging of these Clinton-style health care scenarios in both Washingtons. But it 
became their downfall. It gave us time to get the word out. As I began to tour the state, my 
audiences in the fall of 1993 were this Rotary Club of 20 and that Kiwanis of 25. But by the fall of 
1994, in September and October, I was not speaking to an audience of less than 500.
<p>
<b>Business Interests.</b> The coalitions built by the Association for Washington Business 
included Boeing, Weyerhauser, and Microsoft -- names you all know -- along with the National 
Federation of Independent Business. We soon found that we had strange allies. Organized labor 
began to come on board, starting with the traditional Republican labor organizations of police and 
fire fighters and municipal employees. They were affected because they were no longer ERISA-
protected. They are never ERISA-protected, and they had given up cash wage benefits to negotiate 
nontaxable, noncash benefits in health care for the last 20 years.
<p>
When we showed them what the uniform benefit plan was going to do to their negotiated plan, and 
what the community rating on a one-to-one compression -- just like New York's great plan -- was 
going to do, that they were going to get less and pay more for it, we soon started picking up Boeing 
Aerospace 751 machinists' union. And the next thing you know, instead of a 98-member House 
with 33 Republicans, on the morning of November 9 we had 61 Republicans and 37 Democrats. 
Even more important, conservatives got control of the process.
<P>
<b>Political Change.</b> And I became Chairman of the House Health Care Committee with two 
years under my belt, and they said, "Watch out. He's got the gavel."  Well, "By God," I said, "We're 
going to do it," and we did it.
<p>
We had that bill out of committee in three and a half weeks. It was a 47-page bill; 44 pages were 
repealers. Three pages included three things. The first was continued expansion of our basic health 
plan, which is a complement to the Medicaid asset-based program for providing care to the 
uninsured. We agreed: You have to treat the uninsured. We also had the insurance reforms in there 
-- portability, guaranteed issue, and guaranteed renewability. And then we had MSAs. Beyond that, 
and the repealers, we had a pretty tight bill. 
<p>
We passed the bill through the committee and onto the floor of the House. Then we sat there with a 
slingshot, waiting for the Senate to figure out what they were going to do if we sent it over there. 
They panicked, because we started reminding them of the players who had supported the 1993 act. I 
said, "Can you find one who is vocal about the act being good, who is still elected today?"And with 
half the Senate up next year in 1996, looking around them, realizing they had a one-vote majority 
where they used to have a seven-vote majority in a 49-member Senate, all of a sudden two of the 
Democratic Senators came over and supported my bill. That was all it took.
<p>
We passed it out of the Senate and on to the desk of the Governor, who for two years, arm and arm 
with Bill and Hillary, had been touring the nation's capital as a hero of the populace. He was staring 
us down earlier in the session, saying, "I will veto any changes to my health care act."  He now was 
saying, "Because of the failure of Congress to give me an ERISA waiver, I can't have my plan, so I 
have to make it workable by making this change."  An interesting reversal of theme.
<p>
On April 23 of this year, Governor Lowery signed my bill. It was April 22 of 1993 that the original 
bill passed. I missed it by 24 hours: two years to the day.
<P>
What's next?  We have essentially a level playing field and an opportunity for enfranchisement, to 
bring the public back to the table. They have had an education. The federal health policy debates 
were essential to our success in Washington State because they educated the rank and file through 
the media. All we had to do during the course of the debate was say, "They are, in fact, alike. The 
principles are the same."
<p>
So what am I saying to doctors?  Listening to this morning's discussion, I'm noticing that your 
themes here at The Heritage Foundation are not dissimilar to the themes I see in Washington State.
<P>
Your traditional organized medicine is not always your friend. The Washington State Medical 
Association supported the Washington State health care plan. They had a distinct change in their 
Board of Trustees and their executive management. Politically, family practice physicians and 
specialists were engaged in civil warfare. For years, there had been a balance between primary care 
and specialty care, but in recent years there was no longer a balance; primary care had taken over 
organized medicine, and they were going to stick it to the specialists. 
<p>
And they were going to support this Clinton-style plan because it put them in charge, not realizing 
that we never changed the litigation playing field in the courtroom and that the four-week rotation 
in orthopedics for the primary care doctor is going to be adjudged in a malpractice action by the 
standard set by a board-certified orthopod. They are now beginning to wake up and realize that. Be 
careful what you wish for.
<p>
I also found that organizations like the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which 
had 38 members in Washington State, has now over a thousand in the space of 16 months. Doctors 
were bailing out of the state medical association right and left. Traditional medical organizations 
had been critics of mine for two years but are now giving me every opportunity to speak.
<p>
The animosity between providers and financiers as a result of profits and intrusions in clinical 
standards, and between financiers and providers on utilization controls, employers and financiers on 
premium costs, and employers and financiers or employees and financiers regarding deductibles 
and copays, are only a hint of the battles to come.
<p>
To providers, if you are ahead of the curve, my advice would be to get close to the employer 
community. Managed care organizations don't pay for health care. Employers, 87 percent of them, 
are the source of the funds. Politically, you have to build a relationship to the employer, not to the 
managed care organization.
<p>
In terms of your everyday practice, the challenges yet to come are managed care contract provisions 
that intrude upon your ethics and clinical sovereignty. Most of you have signed, I'll bet, a managed 
care contract that says you cannot criticize the plan to your patient. That is an absolute violation of 
your own ethics. 
<p>
Because you can't write contract standards, how can you get around ERISA and get to those self-
funded plans and not let them have those contracts?  I just gave you the clue. I'll have a bill in 
January that does it using your own licensing boards. It will enable you to make it illegal for 
yourself, under your license, to sign a contract with those provisions that's not ERISA-protected for 
those plans, and no plan can operate without a provider.
<p>
Antitrust has yet to come under safe harbor. It doesn't have the right tolerances, and scoped 
utilization review is my next hope in Washington State, where we don't -- and my apologies, 
because I made the analogy to Texas -- but we don't have an RN in Lubbock, Texas, telling a 
radiologist in Seattle what the standard of care is, and how that patient is going to be treated. I want 
to see utilization review that matches the scope of practice. But it can be superior to subordinate, 
not subordinate to superior, in the rank of scope and training.
<p>
So there's more to come. All we did was take the Nike theme of "Do it,"and just undo it. And now 
we're back to a level playing field, but we have a lot of work to do.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
Later this month, members of the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee will begin filling in the details of the $245 billion package of tax relief approved in the FY 1996 budget resolution. In addition to finding the savings needed to balance the federal budget by fiscal 2002, the budget resolution requires an additional $75 billion in savings, which combined with the estimated $170 billion "fiscal dividend" produced by the balanced budget plan, is sufficient to finance a substantial package of tax relief to help families with children and to stimulate economic growth.
<p>
Congress must now determine how to allocate a limited pool of $245 billion in tax relief. The committees should begin this process by using the $354 billion House plan as a menu from which to craft a tax relief package. Because the House plan contains roughly $110 billion more tax relief than is now available under the conference agreement, the committees must use some criteria for narrowing their choices. While each of the tax relief proposals in the House-passed plan addresses particular inequities in the tax code or specific weaknesses in the economy, some of the proposals have additional qualities that should make them top priorities for inclusion in the final package.
<p>
The cornerstones of the House-passed plan, which also should form the cornerstones of the new tax relief package, are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>$500 per child tax credit, 

<li>Reduction of the capital gains tax, and 

<li>An IRA-Plus plan. 
</ul><p>
These tax relief proposals have been the core of the House plan because they provide direct tax relief to American families and they would do most to spur economic growth. The other tax cuts in the House plan are far more targeted in their impact on various taxpayers or far more limited in their impact on the economy. To be sure, these other tax cuts are important, but their inclusion in the final tax cut package will rest on the relative merits of each proposal. 
<p>
In the final analysis, however, the answer involves an important and fundamental decision by Congress about who should control spending -- the government or taxpayers. That is why both tax and spending reductions are needed to effectively move control of spending out of Washington and into the hands of ordinary citizens. By including tax relief in this year's budget, Congress is allowing American taxpayers, rather than the government, to keep and spend more of the money they earn.
<p>
<b>Relief for Families.</b> Most important, American families must share in the savings from reduced government spending. Families also are more likely to support such reductions, for example, if they know they can keep $500 for each dependent child. This is especially true as Congress is considering substantial reforms in welfare. For working families earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year, the $500 per child tax credit (giving a family of four a $1,000 tax cut) will eliminate their entire income tax burden. Indeed, these families would need less government assistance if they did not have to send so much of the money they earn to Washington in taxes. 
<p>
These overtaxed families can also be turned into a powerful constituency for smaller government if Congress directly links the benefits of balancing the budget to family tax relief. The families of 52 million children, or 35 million working families, would be eligible for the $500 per child tax credit. Taking money away from wasteful government programs and placing it in the pockets of working families gives these taxpayers a stake in the budget process and the incentive to stand up to the advocates of big government.
<p>
Overall, the House-passed plan is very "family-friendly," since some 65 percent of all tax relief will go to families or seniors. About 35 percent of the tax relief will benefit the business or investment communities, contributing to economic growth through job creation. Some of the tax relief targeted to "business," such as reductions in estate and gift taxes, also will benefit owners of family businesses and farms. As they craft a new tax relief plan, the House and Senate committees would be wise to maintain the "family-friendly" nature of the House plan by keeping the relative ratio of tax relief targeted to families and to economic growth and businesses.
<p>
Other tax relief proposals contained in the House-passed plan would improve the fairness of the tax system for senior citizens and businesses, too. For instance, seniors will be more likely to accept Medicare reforms if they no longer have to pay today's surtax on their Social Security benefits; and businesses will be more likely to accept losses in corporate welfare programs if they know the tax code will not punish them for capital investments and risk-taking.
<p>
<b>Relieving the Pressure on Spending.</b> Members should also keep in mind that certain tax relief can change the behavior of some taxpaying groups in ways that ultimately reduce federal outlays for specific programs. Two examples in the House-passed plan are the tax credits for adoption and the improved tax treatment of long-term health care expenditures. Studies show that in many states, putting one child in foster care can cost taxpayers $10,000 to $30,000 per year. This cost could be reduced substantially to the extent that the adoption credit encourages more families to adopt foster children. Similarly, Medicaid's nursing home costs are exploding as many seniors are "divesting" themselves of their assets in order to become eligible for this taxpayer financed program. These public costs could be substantially reduced by the improved tax treatment of long-term care insurance and out-of-pocket expenses.
<p>
Members of Congress should understand how different elements of tax relief benefit their states. Many Members opposing tax relief choose to look only at the impact of reduced federal spending on their states or districts. They forget that if Washington does not spend the money, families will have more to buy necessities for their children, seniors will have more to pay for their own medical services, and businesses will have more to invest in their workers. While this private spending is not as politically visible as unveiling a new pork-barrel project, it does far more to improve the lives of citizens back home. 
<p>
The <a href="/heritage/">Heritage Foundation</a> has estimated the benefits of some of these tax relief proposals -- in some cases, as much as $10 billion to $20 billion over seven years -- for each state (see Appendix). Taxpayers do not need more government spending or new social programs to improve their well-being. Shifting the resources from Washington bureaucrats to families, seniors, and businesses should be viewed as a prudent way to reduce future government spending and encourage work saving and investment.
<p>
As Members negotiate over how to allocate the $245 billion in agreed-upon tax relief, they must remember the importance of putting families first. Working families have borne the largest burden for the rampant growth of government spending and stand to feel the greatest pinch as the rate of spending declines. Furthermore, family incomes have been declining since 1989 thanks to large tax increases imposed on them in 1990 and 1993.
<p>

<b>FAMILY TAX RELIEF</b>
<p>
	The House-passed balanced budget plan contains a substantial package of "family-friendly" tax cuts, including a $500 per child tax credit, expanded Individual Retirement Accounts, and tax credits for families who adopt and those caring for elderly relatives. Over seven years, these family tax cut provisions total $184 billion, comprising 50 percent of the overall tax cut plan. Families, especially families with children, will benefit more than any other group of taxpayers from cutting more wasteful government spending. 
<p>

<b>#1) $500 per Child Tax Credit</b>
<p>
The centerpiece of the Republican Contract with America and the centerpiece of the House-passed plan is a $500 per child tax credit benefiting 35 million working families raising some 52 million children. Such tax relief for working families is long overdue. In 1948, the average American family with two children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal government in taxes. Today the same family pays 24.5 percent. The family income lost in taxes over the past 45 years exceeds the annual mortgage payment on the average family home. Giving the typical family of four a $500 per child tax credit is equivalent to giving them one month's mortgage payment.
<p>
The House plan's $500 per child credit is "non-refundable," meaning the total value of the credit may not exceed a family's income tax bill. But it does provide uniform tax relief to all families with up to $200,000 per year in income, thereby reducing a low-income family's tax burden by a much greater proportion than an upper-income family's. 
<p>
Example:  A $500 per child tax credit would eliminate the entire federal income tax liability for families of four earning between $17,000 and $24,000 per year; cut by 50 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $30,000 per year; and cut by 30 percent the income tax burden of a family earning $40,000 per year. Meanwhile, the same credit would reduce the income tax burden of a family earning $100,000 per year by only 6.8 percent and the income tax burden of a family earning $200,000 per year by just 2.6 percent.
<p>
Based on Census Bureau data, Heritage Foundation analysts have calculated that the typical congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for a $500 credit. This means families in the typical district would receive $59 million per year in tax relief. The Appendix shows the amount of family tax relief by state. It is difficult to imagine that any single federal spending project of similar magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the same time. Thus, the political advantages of family tax relief would more than outweigh the political disadvantages of cutting the federal spending needed to pay for it.
<p>

<b>#2) Tax Credit to Reduce the Marriage Penalty</b>
<p>
Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a joint return can end up paying more taxes than two single taxpayers filing individually. The House-passed bill takes a small step toward reducing this "marriage penalty" by giving these working couples a tax credit with a maximum value of $145 per year. The size of this credit would be determined by Treasury Department tax tables comparing the tax liability of a married couple filing jointly with their liability if they filed as unmarried workers. While the size of this tax credit is relatively small, it is a first step toward removing the tax code's bias against marriage and intact families.
<p>

<b>#3) New Individual Retirement Accounts</b>
<p>
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) reduce the tax bias against savings by deferring taxes on income (up to $2,000 per year) placed into these special accounts. However, this income and the interest generated by these savings are taxed when retirees begin to withdraw their money. 
<p>
The House-passed plan offers another way for taxpayers to avoid punishing taxes on retirement savings by creating a new IRA called the "American Dream Savings Account" ("ADS account"). Contributions to this account would be made from post-tax income, but the interest from such savings would not be taxed upon withdrawal if the contributions remain in the account for at least five years and the retiree has reached age  59<over>1/2</under>. This new form of IRA would give workers the incentive to save taxed income today in order to reap tax savings in retirement. That is why the ADS account is sometimes known as a "back-ended" IRA. 
<p>
Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be limited to $2,000 per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple), but this amount would be indexed to the rate of inflation in subsequent years. The plan also allows penalty-free withdrawals for a first-time home purchase or to pay certain educational or medical expenses.
<p>
The House-passed plan also modifies current restrictions on the amount married spouses may contribute jointly to an IRA. Under current law, and subject to certain restrictions on workers with other retirement plans, individuals may place up to $2,000 into an IRA. However, spouses filing jointly are allowed to contribute only a combined $2,250 to their IRA, not $2,000 for each spouse. The new ADS account allows this same couple to contribute $2,000 for each spouse for a full $4,000, even if one spouse is not working. This provision would greatly assist the retirement plans of families in which one parent chose to stay home with the children. This change also would encourage lower-income taxpayers to save more for their retirement and rely less on Social Security.
<p>

<b>#4) Tax Credit for Adoption</b>
<p>
The estimated two million families ready to adopt children face huge expenses during the adoption process, but current tax law does not allow them to deduct adoption costs from their tax bill. The House-passed plan makes a substantial commitment to encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of $5,000 to offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to families earning up to $60,000 per year and gradually phased out for families earning up to $100,000 per year.
<p>
This credit could go a long way toward encouraging families who want to adopt less fortunate children but are prevented from doing so by the enormous cost. By encouraging more adoptions by solid middle-class families, this credit could lead to a long-term reduction in the cost of taxpayer-supported social service and foster care programs at both the federal and state levels. According to the American Public Welfare Association, close to 500,000 children were in the foster care system in 1992. Studies show that taxpayers pay an average of $10,000 per child per year for foster care programs and as much as $30,000 per child per year for more intensive shelter care programs.<sup>1</sup>  And while many couples want to adopt, they often are discouraged by the initial costs of the adoption process, especially if they have only a modest income. Thus, to the extent that the credit encourages additional parents to adopt, reductions in state and federal outlays to maintain these children in foster care or institutions would offset the revenue cost.

<p>
<b>#5) Tax Credit for Dependent Parents</b>
<p>
	The current tax code provides little relief to families who choose to care for an elderly parent or grandparent. The standard personal exemption of $2,500 is available for these families, but, as with the dependent child exemption, the value of the credit is greater for middle- and upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15 percent income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower their income tax by $375, the same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent bracket to lower their tax by $700.
<p>
The House plan offers additional -- and more equitable -- tax relief to families who care for their parents and grandparents in the form of a uniform $500 tax credit. Such a credit could help many families who prefer to care for their elderly relatives at home but cannot afford the expense. To avoid burdening their children and grandchildren with this expense, many seniors are divesting themselves of their wealth in order to become eligible for the long-term program funded by Medicaid. This program, which pays for nursing home care for seniors, is quickly becoming the fastest growing program in the federal budget. The $500 tax credit could help reduce this cost by encouraging more families to take an active role in caring for their elderly relatives.
<p>

<b>TAX RELIEF FOR SENIORS</b>
<p>
The House budget proposal contains provisions that are especially important to many retired or terminally ill Americans with particular financial needs. It repeals the "elderly surtax" provisions of President Clinton's 1993 tax increase, which imposed a high tax rate on income from savings, investments, and pensions.<sup>2</sup>  In addition, it provides tax incentives for the purchase of private long-term care insurance, allows terminally and chronically ill people to receive insurance benefits before their death without an income tax penalty, and increases the amount individuals between age 65 and 69 may continue to earn from employment without losing their Social Security benefits.

<p>
<b>#6) Repeal of the Tax Increase on Social Security Benefits</b>
<p>
	Over four million retired Americans were shocked to discover a severe penalty in their 1994 federal taxes, imposed by the 1993 tax bill on their income from savings for retirement. The penalty imposed by Section 86 of the Internal Revenue Code creates a higher marginal tax rate for all Americans over age 65 who supplemented their Social Security pensions with personal savings and pensions earned during their working years. Withdrawals from IRA savings accounts are particularly hard hit, and these withdrawals are mandatory after age 701/2. Retired people above that age cannot avoid turning over significant portions of their retirement savings to the tax collectors.
<p>
The House plan gradually repeals the 1993 increase in this tax on savings over a five-year period but does not eliminate it entirely. It cuts the maximum tax to 75 percent in 1996, 65 percent in 1997, 60 percent in 1998, 55 percent in 1999, and 50 percent in 2000 and later years. The complete elimination of this highly complex section of the tax code should be a top priority in Congress, since it is a direct attack on responsible individuals' ability to prepare for retirement by saving. House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) has identified this tax as a priority for repeal:  "punishing people who work and save all their life...is not only morally wrong, it is bad social policy."<sup>3</sup><p>All Social Security recipients must fill out a complicated worksheet just to calculate whether they are subject to the higher tax rate, which adds to the complexity of the tax code for these senior citizens. The tax computation also obscures the higher rates, since the method of figuring whether it is due has been made extremely confusing and depends on how much income anyone receives from savings. For most Social Security recipients, the additional complicated paperwork this April 15 was simply bothersome, because their calculations placed them below an exempt threshold. But the higher rates hit hard those taxpayers with retirement income greater than $25,000 ($32,000 for married taxpayers) from private pensions, withdrawals from an IRA or 401(k) savings plan, and dividends or interest from investments. Although incomes below the exemption are not subject to the higher rates, the tax threshold amounts are not indexed for inflation, so in a few years most if not all retired Americans with income from savings will be penalized.
<p>
The elderly surtax has two brackets. The first increases the taxpayer's marginal rate by 50 percent (for example, from 15 to 22.5 percent); the second, by 85 percent (from 28 to 51.8 percent). The second bracket applies to individuals with incomes above $34,000 and married taxpayers above $44,000. As the table on the following page illustrates, for taxpayers in the top income tax bracket of 39.6 percent, the elderly surtax imposes an effective marginal tax rate of 73 percent on any funds they withdraw from IRA savings. These high rates begin to wipe out mandatory IRA withdrawals at age 701/2.
<p>
The low savings rate for retirement among middle-income Americans in the prime of life is one of the most serious policy concerns in Congress today. Yet the surtax on savings for Social Security recipients, of which many seniors often are unaware until they start withdrawing their IRA savings, makes a mockery of the incentives to save. It is a cruel joke because the tax rates are higher, not lower as most savers were promised. Repealing this vicious surtax on the savings of elderly Americans is not just good social policy. It is the right thing to do.
<p>

<b>#7) Modify the Social Security Earnings Test	</b>
<p>
	Approximately two million Americans over age 65 supplement their Social Security benefits with income earned through part-time jobs. For many elderly people, retirement is out of the question because it would mean economic hardship. They simply have inadequate savings or no private pension benefits. The Social Security law has cut benefits severely for retirees who continue to work and earn more than $11,280. This limitation applies to those between the ages of 65 and 70 and is indexed annually for inflation. Those who earn more lose $1 in Social Security benefits for every $3 of wages earned. The House of Representatives budget proposal would raise the annual earnings limit to $30,000. The increases would be phased in over five years:  from $15,000 in 1996 to $19,000 in 1997; $23,000 in 1998; $27,000 in 1999; and $30,000 in the year 2000. The earnings limit thereafter would be indexed for inflation.
<p>
The earnings limit requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to recalculate pension benefits and attempt to collect amounts paid to retired people who earned more than the law permits. Retirees must forecast their year's earnings in advance and have their Social Security cut, but if their estimated income is too low, they must fill out application forms to recover their lost benefits. The SSA estimates that 60 percent of all overpayments and 45 percent of all underpayments occur because of the earnings limit. This limit costs over $200 million per year in administrative paperwork, most of which would be saved by expanding the earnings limit as proposed in the House budget resolution.
<p>
In the next few decades, the generation approaching retirement generally will have inadequate savings to enjoy leisure without supplemental earnings. In addition, the lower birthrate in the past two decades will have tightened the labor market, so many elderly workers may find their experience and skills still very much in demand. The U.S. economy will enjoy higher economic growth and semi-retired workers will have a more adequate standard of living with the proposed modification in the Social Security earnings test.
<P>

<b>#8) Provide an Incentive for Private Long-Term Care</b>
<p>
	As the health of elderly Americans improves and more people live to very old age, the financial burden of providing care for this increasingly dependent group has become a challenge for public policy. Increasingly, middle-class Americans discover later in life that despite the prudent decisions they have made to cover their income and health care needs during retirement, they face unanticipated and staggering costs for nursing home care. Many see the savings and other assets assembled during their working lives disappear rapidly when they become chronically sick or frail and need institutional care. One response to this threat has been for elderly Americans to transfer assets to their children so that they can qualify for nursing home assistance under the Medicaid program. States and the federal government are concerned about the rising cost of the long-term portion of Medicaid, partly because of this "gaming" of Medicaid. 
<p>
In an attempt to control future budget outlays for health and welfare benefits, people should be given effective incentives to provide for their own long-term care. The House budget resolution provides several new tax provisions to encourage individuals and employers to provide long-term care insurance. Starting in 1996, long-term care insurance generally would be treated the same as accident and health insurance, and employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical benefits. Individuals would be allowed to exchange existing life insurance policies or annuity contracts for long-term care policies without incurring any income tax liability. They also would be permitted to withdraw funds from IRAs and other tax-sheltered retirement plans to purchase long-term care insurance.
<p>
Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes when they exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care expenses today generally are not tax-deductible. Under the House budget resolution, eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for qualified long-term care services would be treated the same as other medical expenses, and benefits received under a long-term care insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $200 per day).
<p>
Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health care and financing them under tax provisions similar to those for medical insurance makes good sense, especially in view of the growing elderly population. Delaying the incentives to prepare for an easily foreseen future problem would be shortsighted, making more likely even heavier state and federal spending on nursing home care.
<p>

<b>#9) Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the Terminally Ill</b>
<p>
	Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but insured individuals and their families have no way to obtain benefits prior to death without a severe income tax liability -- even though many insurance companies are willing to offer such "accelerated benefits."  In the case of lingering illness with no prospect of recovery, an elderly person could exhaust all his savings and apply for Medicaid, unable to claim potentially huge life insurance benefits. And if the elderly person no longer has the means to make premium payments, his policies may be allowed to lapse.
<p>
The House budget includes a provision to facilitate the practice by which some insurance providers pay benefits prior to death if the insured person is terminally or chronically ill. Such payments would be excluded from a taxpayer's gross income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition, similar tax-exempt treatment is allowed for amounts received from the sale or assignment of a life insurance contract to a qualified settlement provider. In these cases, the insured would receive a payment comparable to the value of insurance benefits, and the settlement provider eventually would collect the insurance. As in the case of long-term care benefits, the tax-exempt amount for someone who is chronically but not terminally ill would be subject to the $200 per day exclusion limit.
<p>
The tragedy of terminal illness and the financial burden of chronic illness ought to be sufficient misery for anyone, but the federal tax code adds a degree of bureaucratic hostility. Life insurance is offered with benefits payable under these circumstances, and older policies can be sold or converted to obtain benefits before death. The income tax code should be made more consistent with this humane and increasingly common practice.

<p>
<b>TAX RELIEF TO PROMOTE JOBS AND ECONOMIC GROWTH</b>
<p>
	In addition to family tax relief provisions, the House-passed budget resolution includes a number of reforms designed to reduce the tax burden on savings and investment. Included in this category are:
<p>
<b>#10) Reduction in Capital Gains Tax</b>
<p>
	The U.S. tax code unfairly and unwisely punishes capital investment by taxing investment income more than once:  twice through the corporate and individual income taxes and again by taxing capital gains. The current maximum tax rate on capital gains is 28 percent, and these gains are not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, exempt capital gains from taxation entirely or tax them at a greatly reduced rate while often indexing the basis of the gains to inflation.
<p>
The House bill lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the maximum capital gains rate to slightly below 20 percent. Second, it permits individuals to index the value of assets to ensure that they are not being taxed on purely inflationary gains. This rewards new investment and risk-taking. As the Appendix illustrates, this provision will reduce the tax burden on investment by an estimated $63.2 billion between 1995 and 2002.<sup>4</sup>  It is a positive, albeit limited, step toward the goal of eliminating capital gains taxes.<p><b>#11) Neutral Cost Recovery </b><p>Under current law, businesses must write off capital investments from their tax liability over a number of years. This is different from all other business expenses that can be deducted in the year of purchase, or "fully expensed."  However, the value of a long-term write-off is less than the original cost of the investment because the amounts deducted in later years lose their value.
<p>
The House plan corrects these penalties in the tax code by indexing the depreciation schedules for business investments to inflation and the time value of money. The House bill adjusts depreciation schedules (which determine how fast businesses can deduct the cost of new investments) to protect investors from inflation and otherwise remove biases against investment, particularly for long-term projects. The provision is designed to approximate the ideal tax policy of immediate expensing of capital investment (as found in the flat tax). By correcting this flaw in the tax code, Congress would help encourage businesses to invest more heavily in America's future economic growth.

<p>
<b>#12) Alternative Minimum Tax </b>
<p>
	 The House bill repeals the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax and modifies the individual AMT. These provisions impose some of the heaviest compliance costs and raise limited revenues. Combined with the Neutral Cost Recovery provision, AMT relief would ease the tax burden on American business by about $42 billion over seven years (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>

<b>#13) Expensing for Small Business</b>
<p>
In addition to neutral cost recovery, the House bill increases the amount of investment which can be immediately expensed. Along with other modest reforms, small business will realize $11.4 billion of tax relief (see Appendix for state totals).
<p>
The House tax provisions are a positive first step on the road to pro-growth tax reform. Adoption would boost incentives to save and invest, thereby ensuring faster growth for the economy and higher incomes for American workers.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The dilemma facing the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee is how to allocate among families, businesses, and seniors the $245 billion in tax relief provided in the fiscal 1996 budget resolution. The priorities established in the $354 billion House-passed tax relief package are the place to start. 	 Family tax relief, capital gains cuts, and expanded IRAs should be the centerpiece of the new package, as they were for the House-passed plan, because of their widespread benefits to taxpayers and the economy. In particular, the $500 per child tax credit will benefit some 35 million working families, more taxpayers than any other measure. Further, the halving of the capital gains tax and the expansion of IRAs will generate more investment and savings than any of the more targeted measures in the House plan. And as Members add other elements to the new plan, they should also keep in mind the impact that certain tax relief proposals may have on federal outlays. Tax relief that returns money to Americans, and gives them an incentive to make provision for such things as nursing home care for their parents or themselves, also can reduce the cost of federal and state programs.

<P><B>A</B>merica is a global power with vital interests in key regions of 
the world, specifically in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the  Middle East.
America fought two world wars in this century to  preserve freedom and stability
in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region,  and then endured the long twilight
struggle of the Cold War,  including shooting wars in Korea and Vietnam, to
protect Europe and  Asia from communist domination. In effect, the U.S. is both
a  European and Pacific power. It has maintained a military presence in  Europe
and Asia since the end of the Second World War to protect  vital links of trade,
communication, and cultural exchange. And  even though the Cold War is over,
U.S. security interests still  require America's military, political, and
economic involvement in  European and Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf War dramatized the vital interests of  America and the
world's industrialized democracies in the Middle  East. U.S. air and naval
forces patrol the Eastern Mediterranean  and keep watch on the potential threat
from Iraq and Iran to the  Persian Gulf, still the source of much of the free
world's energy  supplies. In fact, the U.S. depends more on crude oil from the
Gulf  today than it did when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To make the world safe for America, the U.S. needs to keep  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vital regions of Europe, Asia, and
the Persian Gulf free of  hostile domination. This strategy requires a mixture
of diplomacy  and military deterrence. The U.S. must maintain its military 
alliances in these regions and adapt them to new conditions. At the  same time,
new types of relationships with friends and allies, based  on trade and
commercial ties, must be advanced to supplement  (and possibly, in some cases,
replace) old ones based on military  alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect America's interests in various regions of the world,  the U.S.
needs some forces deployed overseas, the capability to  respond rapidly and
effectively to regional crises, and the ability  to support U.S. forces that
have been deployed overseas from  the continental United States. Effective
regional security  strategies, coupled with the means and the will to carry them
out, not  only will allow the U.S. to prevail in the event of a conflict, but 
also may deter aggression in the first place.

</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the Cold War, the U.S. was primarily responsible for  guaranteeing
that Western Europe would not be dominated by a  hostile power. With the demise
of the Soviet Union, many  Americans wonder what role America should play in
Europe and exactly  how the American role in the Atlantic alliance should be
defined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans believe that the U.S. should simply pull its  military forces
out of Europe. Others warn against such an action.  Historically, when it has
taken no notice of European affairs, the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  has been called upon to intervene
in conflicts that threaten the  global balance of power and the safety of
America as well. This  was the case in the First and Second World Wars and
during the  Cold War. Proponents of U.S. military involvement in Europe argue 
that America had to help defend Europe in order to defend the  security and
liberty of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue today is how to structure America's participation in  European
security. Should the U.S. be primarily a peacemaker in  settling civil wars like
the one in Bosnia?  Or should it confine  itself to the core mission of
collective defense, defending Europe  from major power threats regardless of the
source or sources of  those threats? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These questions are at the heart of the debate over NATO's  future. NATO has
been undergoing an identity crisis since the  Soviet Union collapsed. At issue
is whether the U.S. and its allies, in  order to make NATO more relevant, should
task the alliance  with out-of-area missions, including peacekeeping, peace 
enforcement, and other security activities NATO was never intended to  perform.
But this search for a new role could turn NATO into an  organization like the
United Nations, which, because of its many  different members and missions, is
not suited to organizing and  directing significant military operations. In the
end, some fear NATO  could become no more effective than the U.N. is now.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For some in America, the question is not how the U.S. role  in NATO should
be defined, but whether the U.S. should be  in NATO at all. Others argue that
America's 100,000 troops in  Europe act as a stabilizing force that enhances
European  security; they believe that the American military presence in Europe
is  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  insurance policy against the
threat of war between any of  Europe's major powers. The cost of maintaining
these troops is a matter  for legitimate debate, but given the costs of a
European  conflagration, it is well worth paying. Those Americans who advocate 
pulling U.S. military forces out of Europe or reducing the U.S. presence  to a
skeleton force are saying, in essence, that the U.S. has no  vital national
interests in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious NATO issue involves the peacekeeping  operation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. is heavily involved in  the NATO Peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia, and while  the Clinton Administration has
promised to end the mission after  a one-year deployment, many questions arise:
If the promised  peace does not take hold, and especially if Americans are drawn
 into combat with one or more Bosnian factions, will the U.S. be able  to
withdraw on schedule?  
</P>
<P>Will the U.S. be able withdraw in the midst of renewed  fighting and
possible American casualties without the appearance of  an ignominious retreat,
and without harming U.S. credibility  and prestige?  What happens if peace has
not taken hold at the end  of one year?  Will the U.S. pull out anyway, bringing
the  European peacekeepers out with it? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>NATO expansion is another significant issue in the debate  over Europe and
the U.S. role in Europe. NATO expansion would  extend NATO's zone of peace,
democracy, stability, and freedom  to its new members. Many security experts
believe that the  Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO
enlargement out  of fear of offending Russia. They maintain that Russia has an 
implicit veto over extending NATO membership to new democracies  in Central
Europe. However, critics of expansion maintain that  en
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  larging NATO will only encourage
an adversarial response  from Russia and may precipitate a return to Cold
War-style  relations. These critics also insist that expanding NATO will dilute
the  alliance, enlarging its commitments while weakening its basic  structure.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The economic prosperity of the United States is closely tied 
to trade with Europe. Europe is America's second largest  customer, taking 31
percent of American exports and providing 29 percent  of imports. Fifty percent
of direct American investment abroad is  in Europe and over 60 percent of direct
foreign investment in  the U.S. comes from Europe. Over three million Americans
are  employed in the U.S. by European-owned firms, and another 1.5  million
American workers are supported directly by U.S. exports  to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The United States maintains approximately 100,000 troops in 
Europe, and most of the troops involved in the Bosnia peace  implementation plan
were taken from U.S. forces based in  Europe. These forces are a key element in
America's national strategy  for two reasons:

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1) European-based forces contribute directly to European 
stability and security</B> by giving clear evidence of America's  commitment,
and 
</P>

<P><B>2) The forces stationed in Europe are one ocean closer to many  of the
regions</B> in which the U.S. might be called to fight.  Approximately half of
the U.S. combat units deployed during  Operation 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  Desert Storm came directly from
Europe.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     NATO still consists of the 16 nations that belonged to the 
alliance at the end of the Cold War. France recently decided to rejoin  the
integrated NATO military structure, at least partially, after  leaving it in
1966. Spain, the NATO Secretary-General's home country,  is not integrated fully
into NATO's military structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Besides NATO's 16 full members, there are 27 states enrolled 
in the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program, a  U.S.
initiative that enables non-NATO nations to associate with  and apply for
membership in NATO. Almost every country of  Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union is a member of the  Partnership for Peace, designed as an
intermediate step to membership  in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A European collective security organization often touted by 
the Russians as a possible substitute for NATO is the Organization  for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. Despite having over 50  members, however, OSCE is
little more than a &quot;talking shop&quot; for  general issues of European
security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Clinton Administration estimates that the Bosnia Peace 
Implementation Force will cost the U.S. between $2 billion and $3  billion per
year, but this does not include costs for the  reconstruction of civilian
infrastructure in Bosnia. Many experts believe that  the actual cost will be
closer to twice that predicted by the  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     European integration under the auspices of the European  Union
(EU) is proceeding more slowly than expected, and there is  no 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  certainty of a federal Europe, a
European army, or even a  unified currency in the immediate future. Last year
the EU expanded  to include Sweden, Finland, and Austria. Further expansion, 
especially in Eastern Europe, is not expected anytime soon,  although most
former Warsaw Pact countries are eager to join the EU.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO  enlargement and
missed an important window of opportunity for  offering membership to Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary,  and Slovakia, the most likely candidates for NATO
membership.  Instead of expanding Europe's zone of peace, security, and  freedom
to Central Europe, President Clinton has taken counsel of his  fears and handed
the Russians an implicit veto over when, where,  and how NATO should expand.
What has the U.S. received in return?   A meaningless Russian troop
participation in the Bosnian  peacekeeping operation  something of only marginal
interest to  the U.S. Every day NATO delays enlargement, opposition from  the
Russians grows. Former communists have regained power in  Central and Eastern
Europe and may soon do the same in Russia.  Unless the U.S. Administration acts
soon, the opportunity to  enlarge NATO may disappear.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The GOP's Contract With America called for NATO expansion  in the form of
near-term membership for Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia.
Both the House and Senate versions of  the foreign operations bill contained
language supporting this  expansion but neither specifically nor legally
mandating a concrete  time frame for expansion.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even as the Clinton Administration has delayed NATO  expansion, it has
committed U.S. power and prestige to a questionable  peacekeeping operation in
Bosnia. President Clinton has deployed  over 35,000 U.S. troops to support the
Peace Implementation  Force (IFOR). These troops are stationed in Croatia,
Hungary, Italy,  and afloat in the Adriatic Sea, and include 20,000 U.S. combat 
troops in northeastern Bosnia. His reason: to keep faith with U.S.  allies and
preserve NATO. But failure in Bosnia could wreck the  very cohesion that the
President hopes to preserve. If IFOR  fails, NATO could fail with it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration does not have an exit strategy for U.S.  forces in
Bosnia, the President invented one by promising that U.S.  forces will return
home in &quot;about a year.&quot;  Such an ambiguous and  poorly defined
commitment endangers the U.S. soldiers involved,  opens the door for &quot;mission
creep,&quot; and raises the possibility of a  long and open-ended commitment to
a mission that may never succeed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President assumes unrealistically that within a year the  new state of
Bosnia-Herzegovina will have resettled all  refugees, settled all territorial
disputes, conducted free and democratic  elections, and formed a new
constitutional central government  based on an elaborate power-sharing
agreement. Most experts agree  that these issues will take much longer to settle
and that U.S.  troops either will leave too soon to make a lasting contribution
or,  even worse, will be drawn into new roles and mandates that prolong  an
already ill-advised U.S. commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most troubling issues is what to do with indicted  war criminals.
If NATO tries to arrest them, the aggrieved faction  may pull out of the
agreement. But if these war criminals are ignored  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  released, the other side may take
matters into its own hands  and resume the fighting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>From the beginning, Congress was reluctant to support  the Bosnian mission.
On December 13, 1995, the Senate voted  69-30 in favor of the Dole-McCain
resolution, which supports the  men and women in uniform but &quot;does not
endorse the President's  decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton.&quot; 
The House was  more critical and voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while 
expressing support for the troops being deployed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect U.S. interests in Europe, the Administration and  Congress
should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Declare that America's vital national interest in Europe lies in 
preventing the domination of the continent by a hostile power or  bloc of
powers.</B> This is a clear and focused national interest. A  major power threat
to Europe would present a political and  economic threat to the peace, security,
and prosperity of the United  States itself, and America must be prepared to
defend this interest  with military action. This is done most effectively
through NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Clearly define the role the U.S. will play in European security 
affairs and NATO.</B> First, an American military role must be  focused on the
core mission of NATO: collective defense. America  can support peacekeeping or
other out-of-area operations, but  the American contribution to NATO operations
should be  focused primarily on this core mission. Second, American military 
involvement should make a unique and decisive contribution to  any NATO
operation. American power will be squandered if it is  used 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  only to address peripheral and
marginal security issues that  the European allies are reluctant to undertake
themselves. This  will promote a clear and sensible division of labor with
America's  European allies and show the American people that the Europeans  are
&quot;pulling their weight&quot; as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the Europeans to take the lead in addressing  marginal
and peripheral security problems while guaranteeing an active  U.S. support role
in these endeavors.</B> In the past, an  American-led NATO effort was the only
option available for dealing with  a range of security issues in Europe. The
U.S. must promote a  more flexible range of responses to the many different
types of  security problems in and around Europe. When the U.S. role is 
re-focused on collective defense, the European powers can work  through other
structures (such as the Western European Union or OSCE)  to manage more marginal
security problems. This also will  prevent NATO from trying to become all things
to all people,  thereby minimizing the risk that the alliance could become an 
unwieldy and emasculated collective security organization instead of a  focused
and robust instrument of collective defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Offer immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary,  the Czech
Republic, and Slovakia and drop the implicit guarantee  of membership for other
countries in the Partnership for Peace.</B>  The addition of these countries to
Europe will expand NATO's zone  of peace and freedom and contribute to the core
mission of  collective defense against a major power threat to Europe. These 
countries are best suited for NATO membership. They have  demonstrated their
commitment to democracy, and their membership makes  strategic and geopolitical
sense for NATO. While other countries  can maintain a relationship with the PFP
or develop new ties with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  Western European Union, these
four Central European  countries should be the only new members admitted to NATO
itself.  Any more countries would be practically impossible for NATO to  defend
and assimilate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Lower expectations for &quot;success&quot; in the Bosnia peace 
implementation mission.</B> This can be done by limiting the U.S. military role 
to purely military functions and to operations that are both  clearly definable
and achievable. Above all, the U.S. must avoid  &quot;mission creep,&quot; or
escalation of the mission, in which IFOR might be  given long-term
nation-building or war crimes tasks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the European Union to maintain free trading  relations
with the U.S. and avoid instituting protectionist trade  measures.</B> The U.S.
should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested European countries,
including those in Central and Eastern  Europe. This should be initiated through
a &quot;framework agreement&quot;  to ensure that the EU and the U.S. stay on
track to create a  world-wide free trade regime in line with the WTO and GATT 
agreements.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Cold War is over, and Europe is now full of many  prosperous
democratic states. Can't they bear the burden of their own  security?  Why do we
need to keep hundreds of thousands of  American troops over there?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> To defend our own freedom and security. A secure Europe is  a
vital U.S. interest. American freedom could not long endure if  all of Europe
with its resources and power were turned against  us. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Besides, the continued peace and
stability of Europe gives  considerable economic benefit to the United States.
Europe takes  almost one-third of U.S. exports and supplies 30 percent of
American  imports. Almost half of U.S. direct investment abroad is in Europe. 
In addition, millions of Americans are employed in the U.S. by  European-owned
firms, and millions more are supported by U.S.  exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't NATO expansion alienate Russia and risk creating a  new Cold
War with a new Iron Curtain in Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NATO membership brings security and stability. Therefore,  by
extending membership to Poland, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, and Hungary, NATO
can help stabilize an area of Europe that  has rarely been either stable or
prosperous. NATO can work with  Moscow throughout this process to explain that
limited enlargement  is no threat to Russia. This should be done while the U.S.
has  relatively good relations with a friendly Russian administration.  The
return to power of a more nationalist Russian administration  is possible down
the road and would make NATO expansion  considerably more difficult. In any
event, however, Russian opposition  to NATO expansion is motivated mainly by
internal political  debates and economic instability, not by any real fear of
the West.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't expanding NATO just draw a line between East  and West, fueling
a new Cold War?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This is a line that inevitably must be drawn somewhere, 
sometime, unless you assume Russia will become a NATO member   something that is
both inadvisable and highly unlikely. Those  who complain about drawing lines
between East and West are  really 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  saying that they do not want the
free and democratic systems  of Western Europe moved east. NATO need not expand
to all  countries in Central and Eastern Europe, but it should incorporate 
those Central European states that strategically make sense to  NATO and which
politically, economically, and culturally already are  part of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should U.S. soldiers fight and die in a place like Bosnia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. soldiers should not fight and die in Bosnia, at least  under
current circumstances. American troops should be committed  to hostilities only
where their sacrifice is needed to protect  America's vital national interests.
That interest in Europe is to prevent  the continent from being dominated by a
hostile power or bloc of  powers. This is the core mission of NATO. American
combat  troops should not be deployed in the middle of peripheral civil wars  in
order to enforce a tenuous and cosmetic peace. The contribution  of American
combat forces to NATO must be unique and decisive,  as well as oriented toward
NATO's core mission of collective  defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What are U.S. interests in the Balkans?  What should we  do there now
that we are involved in the peacekeeping operation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. has a vital national interest in ensuring that Europe 
is not threatened by a major hostile power. To guarantee that  this vital
interest is protected, the U.S. should be willing to use  American combat
forces. The ethnic conflict in Bosnia does not  threaten the peace and stability
of Europe in this way. However, the  U.S. can assist the lead efforts of its
European allies in containing  and helping to resolve this conflict. The U.S.
can provide  logistical, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  intelligence, and air support for
European peacekeeping  operations, but American troops need not be involved
where  European troops can do the job. However, now that U.S. troops are there 
as part of IFOR, the U.S. should ensure that their mission is limited  to purely
military operations. Military objectives should be  clearly defined, and upon
achieving them, U.S. military forces  should leave. U.S. forces should not be
involved in rebuilding  Bosnia's political, economic, or social institutions.
This would be the  first step on the road to &quot;mission creep&quot; and would
ensure that  U.S. forces are drawn into the conflict with no clear exit in
sight.

<p>
<P><A NAME="ISSUESA"><B>THE ISSUES
</B></A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's interests in Asia have remained consistent for two  centuries.
These interests are freedom of navigation, commercial  access to markets, and
preventing the domination of the region by  a hostile power or coalition of such
powers. The question  looming before America today is whether the United States
will retain  the leadership role in Asia required to defend these interests. 
After over three years of indecisive and faulty leadership from  the Clinton
Administration, the U.S. leadership role is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nowhere is this more evident than in the President's policies  toward the
People's Republic of China (PRC). The Clinton  Administration has failed to
follow a consistent and coherent strategy  in dealing with China. As a result,
the U.S. has lost much of its  credibility in the region. For example, the
President, like many  liberals, tried to link trade with China to Beijing's
performance on  human rights issues. Conservatives, on the other hand, believing
that  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  best way to encourage democracy
and promote human rights  is through open trade, opposed early attempts by
Clinton to  deny China most-favored-nation trading status. Ultimately, the 
President had to reverse course, implicitly admitting the bankruptcy of  his
policies, but his inconstancy weakened his hand in dealing  with the Chinese and
undermined U.S. credibility in the region.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is how to deal with the PRC's attempts  to
intimidate the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC). Bill  Clinton has demonstrated
an inclination to succumb to bullying  from Beijing. In early 1995, he sided at
first with the mainland  Chinese against granting a visa to permit Taiwan's
President, Lee  Teng-hui, to make an unofficial visit to the United States. He 
reversed course abruptly, granting the visa in May 1995, but only after 
pressure from Congress. Subsequently, the President was  painfully slow to
recognize the seriousness of Beijing's threats of  military force against the
ROC, including the testing of  nuclear-capable missiles in the vicinity of
Taiwan. Even when the  Administration abandoned its policy of ineffectual
diplomacy in March, after  three test missiles landed near two Taiwanese ports,
the Clinton  team shrank from labeling the Chinese actions for what they are  
political terrorism. Finally, mainly because of opposition  from Beijing,
Clinton has failed to provide adequate support  for Taiwan's entry into
international economic organizations like  the World Trade Organization, the
World Bank, and the  International Monetary Fund. Taiwan deserves membership in
these  organizations because of its growing status as an economic  powerhouse
and emerging democracy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of the President's China policies argue that  Beijing should not
be allowed to dictate the terms of America's  unofficial 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  relations with Taiwan  terms
established by the 1979  Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which stipulates that
although the U.S.  does not have official relations with the ROC, it does stand
ready  to help Taiwan defend itself. Critics of the President insist that 
Taiwan should have the weapons necessary to defend its security  and that, if
necessary, the U.S. should provide the ROC with  these weapons. In particular,
it should be working with Taiwan to  build a defense against the PRC's ballistic
missiles, which threaten  Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the Korean peninsula, the issue is how to restore trust and  confidence
to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. In pursuing its  nuclear bargain with North
Korea, called the Agreed Framework,  the Clinton Administration marginalized the
role of its ally South  Korea. Negotiating directly with North Korea, the U.S. 
got Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear weapons program in return  for help in
converting its nuclear reactors to peaceful purposes.  The North has used the
agreement to open a direct channel to the  U.S. while continuing to vilify and
shun South Korea.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of Clinton's policies contend that this approach  has damaged
relations with an important ally, South Korea. They  also insist that progress
in the North-South dialogue should be linked  to implementation of the Framework
Agreement. America has a  vital interest in deterring a North Korean attack on
the South  an  interest that has not been given adequate attention by the
Clinton  Administration. North Korea's million-man army stands only a  few miles
away from the South Korean capital of Seoul and the  37,000 U.S. troops near the
North-South border. Reducing this  conventional military threat from the North
should be equally as  important as eliminating Pyongyang's nuclear weapons
potential.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On Japan, the issue dividing Clinton and his opponents is how  best to
sustain and strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance while  advancing deregulation and
the further opening of Japan's markets.  Critics argue that Bill Clinton made
two fundamental mistakes in  his policy toward Japan: He put economics and trade
at the center  of the U.S.-Japan relationship, and he attempted to use a highly 
confrontational managed-trade strategy to force internal change  in Japan.
Neither policy worked. Clinton's November 1994 and  June 1995 trade deals with
Japan did little to open Japan's market  to U.S. goods; instead they damaged
U.S.-Japan military alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S.-Japan security alliance remains the key to peace  and prosperity in
Asia. Relations with Japan must be managed  with this fact in mind. This is a
realization Bill Clinton came to  only belatedly. In 1995, the Pentagon, under
the leadership of  Assistant Secretary Joseph Nye, undertook a major initiative
aimed  at strengthening the alliance; at the same time, the Clinton trade  team
backed off from its confrontational approach. Managed trade is  not the answer
to the trade deficit with Japan; it only reinforces  the clout of bureaucratic
elements hostile to free trade. A far  better approach, Clinton's critics
maintain, is for the U.S. to  support forces inside Japan advocating
deregulation and the further  opening of Japan's market. These are America's
allies inside Japan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On trade in Asia, the issue is whether the U.S. will or will not  take the
lead in opening up Asian markets to U.S. goods and  services. Bill Clinton
claims to support trade liberalization in Asia, but  he leaves the heavy lifting
to others. In 1994, the President agreed  to work with leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum to create an Asia-Pacific
free-trade area by the  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  2020. But at an APEC meeting in
Tokyo last year, he not  only failed to show up; he also left the U.S.
delegation without  authority to make substantial commitments on his behalf.
Critics  believe the President's commitment to APEC and free trade in Asia  is
lukewarm and largely rhetorical. To advance free trade and  American prosperity,
they believe, the President should ask Congress  for &quot;fast-track&quot;
authority to negotiate free-trade agreements in  Asia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major issue in Southeast Asia is how to respond to rising  instability
in Cambodia, where Bill Clinton has failed to use the  leverage provided by U.S.
economic assistance to advance  American interests. Indifferent to Washington's
diplomatic protests, the  government of Cambodia has proceeded to ban political 
opposition parties, attack press freedoms, and even assassinate  journalists.
Critics of the President argue that the U.S. should not tolerate  such assaults
on the democratically elected government in  Cambodia and that future U.S.
economic assistance must depend  on Cambodia's respect for democratic freedoms
and human rights.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Asia is the home of the world's most dynamic and
most  rapidly growing economies. America's two-way trade across the Pacific  is
now approximately one-third larger than America's trade with  Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Exports to Asia in 1994 totaled more than $153 billion, with 
the nations of the region purchasing $45 billion more from  American companies
than the 15 nations of the European Union and  $30 billion more than Europe as a
whole. In 1994, more than 3  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  Americans owed their jobs to U.S.
exports to Asia, and of these  3 million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in
1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The most immediate threat to U.S. security interests comes 
from North Korea's enduring hostility toward South Korea, a U.S.  ally. During
the 1970s and 1980s, North Korea pursued a nuclear  weapons development program,
now frozen under the 1994  Framework Agreement between the U.S. and North Korea.
North  Korea's graphite-moderated reactors have produced between 7 and 22 
kilograms of plutonium, enough for from 2 to 6 nuclear devices.  In addition,
North Korea has an active missile development  program; its Soviet-made <I>SCUD
</I>ballistic missiles are capable of  reaching Seoul, the capital of the
Republic of Korea, and even  threatening U.S. forces stationed in Japan. And its
million-man  conventional army remains deployed within 26 miles of Seoul. South 
Korean active-duty forces number approximately 650,000; U.S. forces  in the
Republic of Korea number approximately 37,000, forward  deployed mostly along
the 38th parallel.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      A second major threat to U.S. security interests arises  from
China's aggressive behavior. In February 1995, the Chinese  navy occupied
Mischief Reef, an atoll in the South China Sea  well within the Philippines'
Exclusive Economic Zone, which is  internationally recognized by the Law of the
Sea Convention.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Against the Republic of China on Taiwan, Beijing has conducted
 a campaign of military intimidation in response to the visit to  the United
States of Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. This  campaign was highlighted by
Beijing's testing of nuclear-capable  intermediate range ballistic missiles 100
miles north of Taiwan.  Six test firings of these missiles took place on July
21-26 1995.  On 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  March 8, 1995, China fired three
test M-9 missiles into two  zones astride Taiwan's largest ports and near
international sea and  air lanes. The M-9 missile can carry conventional,
chemical,  or nuclear warheads.

<P><B>*</B>     In l978, the U.S. diplomatically recognized the People's 
Republic of China as the sole government of China. However, the U.S.  has
maintained unofficial relations with the Republic of China on  Taiwan under the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. The TRA  has allowed the U.S. to maintain
commercial, educational,  cultural, and defense  but not diplomatic  relations
with Taiwan.  The U.S. acknowledges that Beijing claims a &quot;One-China 
policy,&quot; which the PRC interprets as including sovereignty over  Taiwan,
but the U.S. does not officially recognize the legitimacy of  this claim.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan held its first democratic

This was the first democratic election  of a leader in Chinese history.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan, like the PRC, has made clear 
its interest in joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).  This body was set
up in 1995 under the auspices of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT. Thus far, however,  neither the ROC nor the PRC has met the requirements
for WTO  membership.

<P><B>*</B>     Japan is America's largest overseas market, importing more 
goods and services from the U.S. than the United Kingdom and  Germany 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  combined. Japan imported some $70
billion in goods and  services from the U.S. in 1994, supporting 1.4 million
American jobs.  Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan is made up of 
manufactured goods, which support 840,000 American jobs. Japan is  America's
largest overseas market for agricultural products.

<P><B>*</B>     In 1989, with strong support from the United States, the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) was established  to promote trade
liberalization in the region. Five years later,  at Bogor, Indonesia, the

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      United States security strategy toward the Asia-Pacific
region  is based on a network of bilateral alliances with Japan, the  Republic
of Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines. America's  military forces
in Japan and the Republic of Korea are committed  to the defense of U.S. allies
and to the protection of American  interests in the region.1  U.S. forces in
Okinawa also are an  integral part of this commitment. Japan provides some $4
billion in  host nation support for U.S. forces and another $1 billion in a 
facilities improvement program. ROK cost-sharing is $330 million for  1996 and
will increase to $400 million by 1998.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORDA">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in Asia is one of  confusion and failed
leadership. In a startling admission, Clinton's own  Assistant Secretary for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Winston  Lord, in 1994 said that the
Administration's Asia policies have  produced an &quot;emerging malaise&quot; 
an environment in which &quot;Asian  and others view us as placating domestic
special interest groups  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  criticize us for tactics that
destabilize relationships which are  central to the region's peace and 
prosperity.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt17.htm#1">1</A>  Unfortunately,
the mid-course corrections which Lord called for have not been  made. As a
result, the danger of lost influence has only increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Risking Alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea.  The Clinton
Administration's Japan policy, focused initially on  efforts to manage trade,
has been acrimonious and counterproductive.  In 1993-1995 talks with the
Japanese, the Clinton trade team  demanded that the Japanese government accept
numerical targets  or indicators to ensure that the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan would  be reduced. While taking constructive steps toward deregulation, 
the Japanese government successfully resisted the U.S. demand  for enforceable
targets. After denying that its confrontational  trade policies were harming the
U.S.-Japan alliance, the  Administration, led by the Pentagon, in 1995 belatedly
engaged in a damage  limitation effort to reaffirm the alliance. Known as the
Nye  Initiative, after then-Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye, this 
undertaking publicly highlighted the importance of the security  relationship
with Japan. But U.S. relations with Japan received  another blow in late 1995
when, citing domestic priorities during the  November budget negotiations with
Congress, the President  canceled a scheduled trip to Tokyo which was supposed
to be the  centerpiece of this campaign to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan  alliance.
Clinton's Asian advisors had warned that shunning the  Japanese would amount to
&quot;a body-blow&quot; to the alliance. To patch up  relations, Clinton
scheduled a summit with the Japanese in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another key relationship in Asia has been weakened by  the President's
policies toward the Republic of Korea. A  democracy and free-market economy,
South Korea is a military ally of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  United States. This alliance is
aimed at Communist North  Korea, which remains focused on uniting the Korean
peninsula under  its leadership. In addition to the threat of its million-man
army,  North Korea has long been suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons 
development program. The Clinton Administration struck a  diplomatic bargain
with North Korea in October 1994 to freeze  its nuclear program in exchange for
internationally financed and  constructed light water reactors. Thus was born
the U.S.-North  Korean Agreed Framework, which permits North Korea to put off
for  at least five years international inspections of its nuclear  facilities.
These inspections are required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty  of 1968, to
which North Korea is a signatory. So far, North Korea  has honored its
commitments in the Framework Agreement and  maintained the freeze on its
reactors, but it remains to be seen  whether it will do so in the future. And
the fact remains that North  Korea was able to extract concessions from the U.S.
in exchange for  doing what it already was obligated to do under international
law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the biggest casualty of the Framework Agreement  has been the trust
and confidence of America's South Korean allies.  In reaching its nuclear
bargain with North Korea, the Clinton  Administration marginalized the input and
role of South Korea in the  negotiations. Indicative of the Clinton
Administration's  diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula, recent opinion polls by
the  United States Information Agency show South Korean support  for America's
military presence in the ROK at 72 percent, down  10 percent from 1994. In
addition, overall opinion of the U.S. is  down and, for the first time in 12
years, more unfavorable (53  percent) than favorable (43 percent).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the record shows, America's Asian alliances, which are key  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  protecting commerce and U.S.
security interests, have been  weakened by feckless and myopic Administration
leadership. No  one can say whether such damage is permanent, but four more
years  of these policies could set the stage for a general retreat of U.S. 
influence and power from Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton's Misguided China Policy. </B>After campaigning in 1992  to link
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China to  its human rights record,
President Clinton reversed himself in  1994 and, two months after the Chinese
leadership had publicly  humiliated the Secretary of State during his March
visit to  Beijing, dropped its human rights demands and supported MFN for 
China. This was the correct decision, but the Administration's  ill-conceived
linkage strategy forced it into a series of policy retreats  and flip-flops
which have undermined U.S. credibility throughout  the region.<A
HREF="ftnt17.htm#2">2</A>  More and more, America's word in
Asia has come  to matter less and less.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the best example was the Administration's mishandling  of ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in  June 1995. At first, the
Clinton Administration caved in to  Beijing's protests and resisted granting a
visa so that Taiwan's President  Lee could pay an unofficial visit to his alma
mater, Cornell  University. Agreeing with Beijing, the Administration argued
that granting  a visa would violate its &quot;One-China&quot; policy. However,
in  response to nearly unanimous congressional condemnation of its  decision,
the Administration relented and permitted President Lee to make  a private visit
to Cornell last June. While the decision to let  President Lee visit the U.S.
was the right one, it should have been  made at the beginning. The ROC should
have been spared this  painful ordeal that angered all involved and undermined
U.S. credibility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In yet another misstep, the Clinton Administration in  February 1995
mishandled the Chinese navy's occupation of Mischief  Reef in the South China
Sea. Mischief Reef is a small atoll well  within the Philippines' 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone, but it is in  an area also claimed by China, Taiwan,
and Vietnam. It took  the Clinton Administration three months to respond to this
breach  of international law, and even then it could muster only a mild 
diplomatic protest. In addition to the Mischief Reef episode, China  decided to
express disapproval of U.S. support for President  Lee's visit by conducting
large-scale military maneuvers, including  the firing of nuclear-capable
missiles, in the vicinity of Taiwan.  Only after the Chinese launched these
missiles near two Taiwanese  ports on March 8, 1995, did the Clinton
Administration belatedly  take action, dispatching two aircraft carriers to the
area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The President's ineffectual and delayed reactions have  cost America much
in lost prestige and credibility in Asia. The  ROC feels more threatened, the
PRC more emboldened, and the  entire region of Asia more uncertain, not only
about China's  intentions, but also about America's credibility and staying
power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Half-Hearted Support for Asia-Pacific Free Trade. The  Clinton
Administration's record on advancing U.S. trade interests in  Asia is mixed. In
1994, the President joined other leaders of the  Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in declaring his  support for the idea of a free-trade
and investment area in the  Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020. This is a
worthy goal, but then  the President failed to attend the 1995 APEC meeting in
Tokyo,  which focused on developing a blueprint for implementing the 1994 
declaration. In addition, the U.S. delegation came without the  fast-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  track negotiating authority
needed for the U.S. to move  ahead more quickly with a free-trade agenda, and
U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor threw roadblocks in the way of gaining 
fast-track authority from Congress. Kantor, for example, refused  to compromise
when Congress opposed environmental and labor  provisions that the President
wanted included in trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Failure to Defend the U.S. Investment in Cambodian  Democracy. The U.S. is
in danger of losing its $500 million investment in  the United Nations
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. In  May 1993, the Cambodian people voted
freely for a government to  be led by non-communist political parties. However,
the  communist Cambodian People's Party (CCP), installed by Vietnam in  1979,
bullied its way into a coalition with the non-communists.  While claiming
Cambodia as one of its supposed diplomatic success  stories, the Clinton
Administration has failed to censure the  government of Cambodia as it has
proceeded to attack press  freedoms, assassinate journalists, and ban opposition
political parties.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To protect U.S. interests in Asia, the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain strong alliances with Japan, the Republic of Korea,

five decades, economic growth and prosperity across the  Pacific have been based
on the security provided by the United  States. Even today, the Cold War's
bilateral alliance structure remains  the firm foundation of regional stability
and security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Better define U.S. interests and priorities with respect to 
China.</B> 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  These are: 1) a peaceful
resolution of issues outstanding  between Beijing and the Republic of China on
Taiwan; 2) non-use of  force by China in the South China Sea; 3) stopping the
proliferation  of missiles and missile technology into the Persian Gulf and 
South Asia; and 4) respect for human rights by China. America  should assume
neither China's friendship nor its hostility. By  sustaining Asian alliances,
clearly defining interests and priorities  toward China, and measuring China's
actions against them, America  can judge the nature of Beijing's intentions and
adopt appropriate  policies. Once these policies are adopted, Washington needs
to stick  to them and not, as the Clinton Administration has done,  abandon them
under pressure from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Insist that China uphold international standards and &quot;rules
of  the road.&quot;</B>  China's willingness to observe international &quot;rules
of  the road&quot; with respect to non-proliferation, the protection of 
intellectual property, and human rights should be used as a benchmark  to
measure China's conduct as a responsible international  power. China should be
told that the degree to which it will be  respected and integrated into the
international economic and political  community depends on how well it abides by
international rules  and standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Support the Republic of China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization.</B> Should the Republic of China meet the criteria for  admission
to the WTO, it should permitted to join. Taiwan's joining  the WTO should not be
held hostage to Beijing's insistence that  the People's Republic of China be
admitted first. This would be  unfair to Taiwan, which is not only one of the
world's most  vibrant economies, but also a democracy.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Closely monitor implementation of the U.S.-North Korea  Agreed
Framework.</B> North Korea must not be allowed to avoid  compliance with the
terms and conditions of the Framework agreement.  In particular, it must
continue the freeze on its nuclear  program. Should the North restart its
plutonium-producing reactors or fail  to allow inspections of the facilities
agreed to under the terms of  the Framework, the U.S. should build an
international coalition to  support sanctions against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand opportunities for greater American trade with Asia.</B> 
The United States should explore with Australia, New Zealand,  Chile, and
Singapore the possibility of their accession to the  North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). Similarly,  America should offer to negotiate a merger
between NAFTA and other  existing free-trade agreements, including the
Australia-New  Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER) and the  ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Explore with allies and friends in Asia the construction of an 
integrated anti-missile defense system. North Korea's missile  program threatens
South Korea and Japan, while China's tactical and  strategic missile arsenal is
a threat to the security of the entire  Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. should
equip its own ground and  naval forces with missile defense systems and then
offer to sell  those systems to key allies and friends. Missile defense should
be a  key mission for U.S. forces in Asia in the next decade.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restructure America's approach to U.S.-Japan trade issues.</B> 
The Clinton Administration's approach to trade with Japan is based  on using
external pressure to force internal change. This  approach was confrontational
from the outset, and it has not worked.  More
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  over, it has damaged the U.S.
military alliance with Japan. A  more effective approach would be to recognize
that change in Japan  is internally driven, and align U.S. trade and economic 
objectives with reformers inside Japan who advocate deregulation and a  further
opening of Japanese markets. For example, the U.S.  should propose a
deregulation summit to Japan, aimed at producing  commitments to an action plan.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&AA">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the United States still need to maintain a large  military
presence in Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The end of the Cold War has not ended threats to peace in  Asia.
North Korea's large conventional military force and its  nuclear program pose a
direct threat to South Korea and Japan, both  of which are U.S. allies. China's
rapid military buildup and its  willingness to use force to pursue territorial
claims in the South  China Sea and against Taiwan also are cause for concern. 
America's military presence in Asia has been reduced significantly  since 1990,
but it remains large enough at its current 100,000-man  level to deter possible
threats. American forces in Japan and South  Korea receive significant financial
support from their host  countries. By helping to preserve peace, the U.S. is
helping Asians  and Americans alike to become more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the United States need to press for freer trade  in Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> By pressing to reduce trade barriers, both within Asia and 
between the United States and Asia, Americans will benefit from  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  jobs created by economic growth.
More U.S. exports mean  more American jobs. In 1994, U.S. exports to Asia grew
at a rate of  16 percent, totaling over $153 billion. In that same year, more
than  3 million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.  Of these 3
million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in  1994 alone. In addition,
greater prosperity in Asia reinforces  regional stability and strengthens the
democratic political evolution  underway in countries like Taiwan, South Korea,
and the  Philippines. Democracy and stability reduce the risk of armed conflict 
between states.

<P><A NAME="ISSUESR"><b>THE ISSUES</b>
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The future of U.S.-Russian relations is uncertain. Much  depends on the
outcome of the presidential elections in Russia,  currently scheduled for the
summer of 1996. Among candidates for  the Duma (the lower house of the Russian
parliament) in the  December 1995 elections, communists, nationalists, and their
allies  captured over 50 percent of the popular vote. President Boris  Yeltsin,
who declared his candidacy for the presidency in February 1996,  is trailing the
pack of presidential candidates. The most popular  candidate is Gennady
Zyuganov, leader of the unreformed  Communist Party. Another dangerous contender
is Vladimir Zhirinovsky,  an anti-American ultra-nationalist. Victory for either
Zyuganov  or Zhirinovsky would seriously endanger Russia's young  democracy and
market reforms. A communist or extreme nationalist at  the helm could well put
the world's second-largest nuclear power on  a collision course with the United
States in Central Europe or  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  Middle East.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Yeltsin's own prospects look grim. His health is  failing, and
Russia's internal economic and political crisis continues  unabated. The war in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya  and Russia's economic difficulties have
eroded the popularity  of Yeltsin's administration to the point where polls show
 approval ratings at around 10 percent to 15 percent. Moscow is awash  in rumors
of coups and falsified presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No one knows who will rule in Moscow by the end of 1996,  but the period of
romantic partnership with the U.S. and the West  is over. Russia is striking out
on its own, taking a path that  already has led to confrontation with the West.
In fact, Russia is in  the midst of a political turbulence fraught with dangers
for the  West, and the chances are good that the next American President  will
have to deal with a new and very different set of players in  Moscow.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major point of disagreement between President Clinton and  his U.S.
critics concerns the U.S. support for President Yeltsin.  Critics charge that
the Clinton Administration's continued  unquestioning support for Boris Yeltsin
makes less and less sense. According  to critics, Yeltsin today is presiding
over the return of the  hard-line Soviet nomenklatura to top positions of power.
He has lost  the support of the Russian reformers and is pursuing an 
increasingly confrontational foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Anti-Western sentiments are growing in Russia. Moscow is  attempting to
re-establish its influence in neighboring regions  that once were part of the
Soviet Union. The Kremlin is  employing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  economic, diplomatic, and
military means to achieve a sphere  of economic and military influence in what
Moscow calls its  &quot;near abroad&quot;  the Baltic States, Ukraine, and the
non-Russian states  in Central Asia and the Caucasus that used to be part of the
 Soviet Union but became independent when it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's critics believe that preventing the  emergence of a
Russian empire in the lands of the former Soviet Union  should be a top Western
priority, both to help assure the development  and survival of Russian democracy
and to safeguard vital Western  interests. Moreover, an anti-Western policy
could lead Russia  to forge alliances with anti-Western forces in Iran, Iraq,
China,  and Libya. Yet, critics allege, the Clinton Administration has given 
the Russians a free ride in the &quot;near abroad.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics of the Clinton Administration also claim that the U.S.  has turned a
blind eye to the atrocities in Chechnya. The President  and his aides have bent
over backwards not to offend President  Yeltsin as he has crushed the rebellion,
which so far has resulted in  over 30,000 deaths and more than 300,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A critical concern is the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to  Iran. The
Islamic regime in Tehran has launched a bid to  acquire nuclear weapons. It is
buying two Russian-made nuclear  reactors capable of producing plutonium that
can be enriched to  become weapons-grade raw material for atomic bombs. The
Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself does not support this sale, 
believing it could endanger both Russian and Western security.  Nevertheless,
the sale goes on, primarily because of pressure from the  powerful Russian
Ministry of Atomic Industry (MinAtom) headed  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Victor Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is aid to Russia and the NIS  countries. Aid to
Russia has attracted bipartisan support, but this may  be weakening as Russia
becomes more anti-Western and  expansionist. The Bush and Clinton
Administrations have provided over  $4 billion in aid to Russia since 1992.
Combined aid monies  and loans to the former Soviet Union and Russia for 
1985-1995 amounted to over $100 billion. The results of these aid  programs have
been mixed; critics argue that U.S. aid programs often  disregard Russia's real
needs and are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also dividing President Clinton and his critics is NATO  expansion. The 1994
Contract With America stipulated that NATO  enlargement (to include Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech  Republic) should be a top national priority. However,
the Clinton  Administration has put NATO expansion on the back burner, both to 
secure Moscow's cooperation in peacekeeping in Bosnia and to  appease Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics charge also that the President is appeasing Yeltsin on  missile
defense and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans  the deployment of a
missile defense system from the U.S. The  Clinton Administration opposes
ballistic missile defense (BMD) and  wants to expand the scope of the ABM Treaty
to limit even shorter  range (tactical) missiles  something which it was not
originally  intended to do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another point of contention concerns conventional arms  control. The
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty places limits  on the numbers of
conventional weapons (such as tanks and  cannon) 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  in Europe and Russia. It was
signed with the now-defunct  U.S.S.R. in 1990 after more than two decades of
negotiations. Critics  became worried when Clinton agreed to a unilateral
revision of  the treaty that permitted the Russians to exceed agreed limits on 
conventional weapons in Russia's northern and southern states.  Beefing up the
numbers of tanks and cannon on the borders of  Russia's neighbors, be it the
Baltic States or nations in the Caucasus,  raises questions about Moscow's
long-term intentions. Moreover,  critics point out that Russia is already far
behind on meeting the  weapons system destruction targets stipulated by the CFE
agreement.

</P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has made relations with Boris Yeltsin too  personal. As
Yeltsin's popularity plummeted, Clinton fed the  flames 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  of Russian resentment toward the
U.S. with his unequivocal  support of the Russian president, especially after
the dramatic  shooting at the parliament building in October 1993 and the 
beginning of the Chechen war. As a result, the U.S. is now perceived  by many in
the Russian political elite as partisan and uncritically  supportive of
Yeltsin's faltering policies. The Clinton policy has  endangered the ability of
the U.S. to maintain a relationship  with segments of Russian society that
oppose President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration paid lip service to the idea of  enlarging NATO
to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech  Republic. However, it has done very
little to make this happen. Critics  accuse the Administration of promising not
to expand NATO  in 1996 in exchange for Russia's cooperation on peacekeeping  in
Bosnia. Republican Members of Congress, who included  NATO expansion in their
Contract With America, generally are more  supportive of a rapid expansion of
NATO than the Clinton  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has been too slow to  recognize the
importance of countries other than Russia. For example,  without Ukraine, the
Russian empire cannot be recreated and will  have only limited access to the
heart of Europe. Azerbaijan  controls vital oil and gas reserves, while Georgia
is situated in a  strategically crucial location in the Caucasus. Nevertheless,
the  Clinton Administration has neglected these countries, promoting a  &quot;Russia-first&quot;
policy and recognizing Moscow's domination of  the &quot;near abroad.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has failed to prevent the sale  of nuclear
reactors to Iran, despite America's share in the  massive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  financial aid provided to Moscow
by the International  Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other multilateral
financial  institutions. The reactors are a vital component of the Iranian bid
to  acquire &quot;Islamic&quot; nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>U.S. assistance to the reform efforts in Russia and other  former Soviet
states has been poorly executed. Much of the $4.1 billion  in U.S. assistance
allocated to date has been wasted. The Bush  and Clinton Administrations erred
in choosing the U.S. Agency  for International Development as the main
implementing agency  for assistance. AID has its expertise in the developing
world, not  in post-communist transitional economies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Russia and other New Independent States (NIS) have become  leading exporters
of crime, together with Colombia, Southeast  Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and
others. Law and order in Russia have  collapsed, organized crime is merging with
legal government  structures, and it is difficult to say where the mafiosi end
and the  government begins. Many Russian and Eurasian criminal  organizations
operate internationally, including in the United States  and Western Europe.
Russian organized criminals and corrupt  officials have access to weapons and
technology of mass destruction,  including uranium, chemical and biological
weapons, and the  raw materials and components for their manufacture, as well as
 scientists with specific weapons-related expertise. Despite all of  this
evidence, the Clinton Administration has continued to hail the  success of
economic reforms in Russia, failing to raise the crime  and corruption issue in
bilateral talks with the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration championed the START II  nuclear arms reduction
treaty with Russia. The main obstacles to  START 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  II ratification are not in
Washington (the U.S. Senate ratified  the treaty on January 26, 1996) but in
Moscow, where a majority  of deputies in the newly elected Duma probably will
refuse to  ratify it. Objections have been raised based on America's presumed 
intention to build a missile defense, but the real reason for the  Russian
intransigence lies elsewhere: The Russian military  establishment wants to keep
large, land-based multiple-warhead  missiles, such as the SS-18, SS-19, and
especially the mobile SS-24.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weakest part of Clinton's arms control record concerns  the ABM Treaty.
Russia today claims to be the heir to the  now-defunct Soviet Union, and is
demanding that the U.S. abide by  the 1972 ABM treaty. The Administration not
only wants to abide  by the treaty, it wants to expand its scope. U.S.
negotiators  reportedly have accepted a Russian demand to limit the performance
of  the most promising U.S. short-range missile defenses. And  President Clinton
vetoed the FY 1996 defense authorization bill because  of its missile defense
provisions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in conventional arms  control with the
Russians has not been much better. The  Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
treaty places limits on the numbers of  conventional weapons, such as tanks and
cannon, permitted in the  European theaters of operation. It was signed with the
U.S.S.R.  in 1990, and the U.S. agreed in 1995 to allow Russia to exceed  the
limits imposed by the CFE on weapons stationed on its  northern and southern
flanks. Russia's neighbors in the Baltic region or  the Caucasus are now more
insecure as the number of weapons  and tanks on the Russian border continue to
grow. This is  especially worrisome because of all the rhetoric in Moscow about 
restoring the Soviet Union. Moreover, Russia is far behind in meeting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  weapons system destruction
targets stipulated by the CFE.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Develop a Russian policy based on support for ideas
and  interests, not individual politicians.</B>  The U.S. should support
democracy  and free markets in Russia, as well as political forces advocating 
these ideas, not controversial individual politicians like Boris  Yeltsin.
Yeltsin is the elected president of Russia and was a key figure  in bringing
about the collapse of Soviet communism. Today,  however, today some of his
policies and his personal style are  extremely controversial, and his popularity
is plummeting.  Moreover, there are other reform-oriented politicians in Russia 
with whom a dialogue should be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Advocate broad-based cooperation with Russia and
other  NIS members to ensure their integration into global markets and  the
democratic community of nations.</B> The U.S. should continue  selective and
targeted technical assistance programs and provide  support to pro-democracy
forces and nascent market institutions in  the NIS. The U.S. must design and
implement trade, investment,  and assistance programs for Russia and the NIS
that reduce  inflation, lower market barriers, and stimulate growth. Thriving
Russian  and Eurasian markets would create jobs and export opportunities  for
American businesses. U.S. assistance programs should be  taken away from AID and
given to an independent board  of policymakers, area specialists, and business
representatives.  Such a board can be appointed jointly by the President and
Congress.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's interference in the affairs of its
neighbors.  The survival, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all NIS 
countries are important to future peace and prosperity in Eurasia.</B> The  U.S.
should support the independence of Ukraine, Azerbaijan,  Georgia, and the
Central Asian states, many of which are being drawn  unwillingly back into the
Russian orbit. Washington should  intensify its ties with Ukraine, the Baltic
States, and countries in  the Caucasus and Central Asia. The West should assist
them in  developing foreign and domestic policy decisionmaking bodies  and
mechanisms, training their bureaucracies, and increasing  security cooperation.
Technical assistance in privatization of industry  and agriculture also should
be provided.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's brutality in Chechnya.</B> The U.S.
should  make clear to Moscow that the use of force against other states or 
areas of the former Soviet Union could trigger U.S. retaliation  against Russian
economic and political interests. While the U.S.  should support the territorial
integrity of the Russian Federation, the  West should oppose the brutal methods
of the Russian military in  handling internal dissent, such as those used in
Chechnya. The  Clinton Administration should stop issuing declarations of
support  for Russia's actions in Chechnya and instead support OSCE efforts  to
resolve the Chechen crisis peacefully. The OSCE should  undertake a high-profile
mission to Chechnya and Russia. If Russia is to  integrate into the world
community, it must abide by its rules of  conduct, including international law
and custom. Washington  should clarify to Russia that aggressive military action
against her  neighbors could result in international isolation and possible 
economic sanctions. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Not allow Moscow to veto the opening of NATO to new 
members.</B> The U.S. should maintain a constant dialogue with Russia  on NATO
expansion, pointing out possibilities for  Russian-NATO cooperation and
stressing that NATO is not a threat to  Russian security. While NATO enlargement
will occur, Russian  participation in the Partnership for Peace program should
be expanded  simultaneously as appropriate to assuage Russian concerns. But 
under no circumstances should Moscow be allowed to prevent  sovereign countries
in East and Central Europe from joining the  NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Oppose Russia's policies of nuclear proliferation.</B>
The U.S.  should take every step to prevent Iran, Iraq, and other rogue states 
from gaining nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities. For  example, voluntary
export controls similar to those developed by the  Coordination Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls  (COCOM) regime during the Cold War could be
imposed on technology  sales to these countries. Pressure should be applied
against the arming  of rogue states, up to and including the imposition of
selective  economic sanctions. At the same time, Russia should be  encouraged to
pursue other less threatening commercial ventures, such as  commercial space
launches. These could bring about a voluntary  cancellation of the reactor deal.
The U.S. also should cooperate  with pro-Western circles in Turkey and
Azerbaijan to promote  democracy and oppose radical Islam in Eurasia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Assist Russia and other NIS countries in fighting organized  crime
and corruption. The U.S. could do this by helping the  Russians devise
comprehensive criminal and criminal procedure  codes.</B> Some of the leftover
Soviet laws in Russia make it difficult to  fight organized crime; for example,
there is no adequate law against  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  conspiracy to commit a crime. In
addition, U.S. law  enforcement agencies should cooperate with trustworthy and
reliable law  enforcement personnel in the East. In particular, they can assist 
in developing a witness relocation program. They should strive  to track and
penetrate Russian and NIS criminal rings dealing  in weapons of mass destruction
and narcotics. Finally, American  law enforcement agencies should monitor
East-West financial  transactions more closely. Deposits that originate in the
NIS should  be carefully screened and the legitimacy of earnings established.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Reject Russian demands for broadening the ABM
Treaty.</B> The  U.S. needs to be defended against missile launches by rogue
states  and terrorists and against accidental launches. The Clinton 
Administration and the Russians are attempting to extend the life of the  ABM
Treaty by designating Russia and other states as successors to  the Soviet Union
under the treaty and broadening its scope to  cover theater missile defense
systems. Ballistic missile defense is a  vital goal for the U.S. These moves by
Clinton and the Russians  therefore should be resisted firmly. The ABM Treaty
needs to be  eliminated, not extended or broadened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&AR">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should we provide aid to Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The window of opportunity for the West in Russia may be  closing.
While there is still time, we should provide aid that  strengthens free markets
and free minds. Communism worked to  destroy both of these for 70 years. Many
Russians still want to learn  about democracy and capitalism, and we should
provide them with  a fighting chance before it is too late. However, we must
ensure  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  the aid is used wisely. Aid to
Russia needs to be customized  for Russian conditions. If a hard-line government
were to take over  in Russia, making U.S. aid meaningless or worse, we probably 
would have to cut off all aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What do we do if hard-liners take Yeltsin's place?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should act now to strengthen relations with all countries  in
the region, which will be threatened even more than the West  if hard-liners
come to power in Moscow. We should expand  NATO to include Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and  perhaps Slovakia, and should prevent any U.S. or
international  assistance to Moscow if an aggressive, anti-American, or
anti-Western  government emerges. Even under these severe circumstances, 
however, the U.S. should maintain a dialogue with Moscow,  clarifying what price
Russia may pay if &quot;red lines&quot; are crossed. Eventually,  if the need
arises, we may need to plan for military  contingencies and even to contain
Russia if it becomes aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't NATO expansion endanger Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. NATO enlargement is aimed at creating a zone of  stability
and security in Eastern and Central Europe. Opening NATO  to new members 
something which has happened repeatedly in  the past  will hasten the
integration of the Czech Republic,  Poland, Hungary, and other new members into
the West. NATO is a  defensive alliance, and its posture in Central Europe
should remain  defensive.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why shouldn't we be more cooperative with Russia?  After  all, the
Cold War is over. Russia is a democracy and a great  power. Why shouldn't we
allow Moscow a greater role in policing  unstable regions, such as the Caucasus
or Central Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We can cooperate with reformers in Russia who are  interested in
building a market economy and democracy. It will take  time, however, to assess
whether democracy has taken root in  Russia. Russia will always have a
considerable role in the region  because of its sheer size and economic,
political, and cultural weight,  but there are forces in Russia that dream of
re-establishing the  Soviet Union or the Russian Empire. These anti-Western and 
anti-American forces desire to expand Russia's power and influence to  compete
with the West, not cooperate with it. We should  oppose Russia's heavy-handed
interference in the affairs of its  neighbors and attempts to violate their
sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In view of Chechnya, what should the U.S. do to prevent  Russia from
invading its neighbors?  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should enhance our relations with Ukraine, the  Baltic States,
and countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. There  are as many people in
these countries as there are in Russia.  We should draw &quot;lines in the sand&quot;
and stick to them. For example,  we should warn Moscow that we will block all
IMF and World  Bank assistance if an NIS country is invaded, and that the U.S.
will  lead the international diplomatic campaign to restore the  independence of
a violated country. If Russia crosses these lines, we should  consider imposing
both restrictions on exchanges and economic  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  trade sanctions against Russia.
We also should demand from  Moscow that the war in Chechnya stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are democracy and reform the causes of crime in Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is widespread crime and corruption in Russia, and  some
Russians mistakenly think that the cause of crime is  free-market capitalism.
Crime is rampant, of course, but because there is  no rule of law in Russia.
Moreover, real democracy barely exists,  and the country still has a long way to
go before a free-market  system is fully established. Free markets mean the rule
of law, not the  rule of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is Russian organized crime a threat to U.S. and Western  security?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, because Russian criminals are very sophisticated, 
well-educated, and well-connected worldwide. They often boast  advanced college
degrees, as well as KGB and special forces  training. There is great potential
danger in the merger of former  communist, KGB, and criminal elements in Russia
and the NIS,  and the threat from the possible access of organized criminals to 
weapons of mass destruction is particularly acute.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUESP">THE ISSUES</A></B>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf is the strategic storehouse of roughly 55  percent of the
world's oil reserves. The U.S. cannot allow hostile  powers such as Iran or Iraq
to gain hegemony over Persian Gulf oil  supplies. This would allow them to gain
an economic stranglehold  on oil-importing states and could fuel a military
buildup that  includes weapons of mass destruction. The issue is how best to
contain  Iran and Iraq. Congressional Republicans, led by Senator  Alfonse
D'Amato (R-NY) and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich  (R-GA), have pushed for a
hard-line policy of aggressive  containment of Iran and the stiffening of
economic sanctions against it, but  the Administration has dragged its feet. On
Iraq, the  Administration came to office prepared to improve relations with
Baghdad if  Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein behaved himself, but Saddam's 
repeated provocations have convinced the Administration that the U.S.  must
contain Iraq vigilantly and firmly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Arab-Israeli conflict, one of the many cleavages that  threaten the
stability of the region, has been muted substantially but  still poses a threat
to the security of Israel and moderate  pro-Western Arab regimes. A renewal of
this conflict also could help fan  the flames of Islamic radicalism and lead to
an upsurge in  international terrorism. The issue is how to help advance 
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The Clinton Administration has pushed for  a
peace treaty between Israel and Syria. It has offered to  deploy American
peacekeeping forces on the Golan Heights, following  an Israeli military
withdrawal from that strategic border area,  to monitor compliance with a
possible Syrian-Israeli peace treaty.  A growing chorus of conservatives
questions the wisdom of an  open-ended U.S. peacekeeping commitment on the Golan
Heights  which could divert U.S. military forces from other missions, erode 
military readiness, and serve as a lightning rod for terrorist attacks  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  Middle Eastern terrorist groups
opposed to peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third issue is how to help contain the rising tide of Islamic  radicalism
that threatens to sweep away the Algerian military  regime and undermine
pro-Western regimes in Egypt, Jordan,  Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Turkey.
Islamic radicals also threaten  U.S. interests by promoting international
terrorism and opposing  the Arab-Israeli peace process. The Clinton
Administration has  established diplomatic contacts with Islamic radicals and
has called  for a political dialogue between them and the states they seek to 
overthrow. Many conservatives oppose such contact because it  undermines secular
Middle Eastern regimes that the radicals seek  to overthrow, makes it easier for
Islamic radicals to seize power,  and would not change their anti-Western
policies if they did come  to power.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTSP">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein remains a dangerous, albeit 
weakened, threat to regional stability. The Iraqi army remains the  strongest
regional military force in the Persian Gulf region, and  Iraq continues its
efforts to build weapons of mass destruction, such  as chemical, biological, and
nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein  will remain a threat to Western interests in
the Persian Gulf as long  as he remains in power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran looms large as the principal long-term threat to U.S. 
interests in the Persian Gulf. It has launched a massive military buildup  and
continues to support terrorism against its neighbors and  Western countries,
including the U.S. It also has sought to intimidate  the Arab emirates across
the Persian Gulf by rattling its saber. In  1992 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  Iran seized three disputed
islands at the mouth of the Persian  Gulf and fortified them with 8,000 troops,
chemical weapons,  anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran, like Iraq, has launched a clandestine program to build 
nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian nuclear power program.  Russia,
China, and Pakistan have provided technology, equipment,  or training that could
help advance Iran's nuclear weapons  program. Western companies, including many
from Germany, have  sold Iran dual-use (civilian/military) technologies that
could aid  its nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>    The Arab-Israeli peace negotiations achieved the October  1994
Jordan-Israeli peace treaty, but Syrian-Israeli negotiations  have been
deadlocked by Syrian intransigence. The  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have
lurched along through two interim  self-rule agreements that have led to an
unstable, uneasy peace  continually undermined by persistent terrorism from
Palestinian Islamic  radicals. The most difficult issues  borders, Palestinian 
statehood, security arrangements, Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements, 
Palestinian refugees, and water resources  have been relegated to  the final
status talks, set to begin in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Islamic radicals form a tiny majority of the world's more than
 900 million Muslims. They pose a threat primarily to secular  regimes in the
Muslim world, which they have not had a great deal of  success in overthrowing.
But when they seize control of a state,  as they did in Iran in 1979 or Sudan in
1989, their power to  threaten U.S. interests greatly increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. has suffered repeated terrorist attacks from Islamic 
radi

hostage crisis, the 1983 bombing  of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, the 1983
bombing of the U.S.  embassy in Lebanon, the kidnappings of 15 Americans in

has done marginally better at assisting  in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations but
also has offered to  commit American peacekeeping forces to a risky open-ended 
deployment on the Golan Heights if Israel signs a peace treaty with Syria.  The
Administration has fared worst of all in its policy toward  Islamic radicals.
For example, the Clinton Administration's May  1993 &quot;Dual Containment&quot;
policy, which calls for the simultaneous  containment and isolation of Iraq and
Iran, takes a passive approach  to containing these two countries unless prodded
by Iraqi  provocations or concerned members of the U.S. Congress. Another 
example: Clinton in June 1993 ordered an attack by  Tomahawk cruise missiles
against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's  secret police in retaliation for the
failed April 1993 Iraqi-sponsored  assassination attempt against former
President George Bush in  Kuwait. But this was a mere slap on the wrist in view
of the  grave nature of the terrorist attack against a former American head  of

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  state.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on  increasing pressure on
Iran to halt its support of terrorism. Clinton on  April 30, 1995, announced the
signing of an executive order banning  all U.S. trade with Iran, but he did so
in part to prevent the U.S.  Congress from going farther and placing an import
ban on any  foreign company that continued to trade to Iran. The Administration 
feared this would create tensions with U.S. allies in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress has tried to strengthen America's policy toward  Iran. Led by
Senator D'Amato, the Senate passed a bill on December  21 that would punish
foreign companies that invest in Iran's oil  industry. The House is likely to
pass this measure. House  Speaker Gingrich also forced the Administration to
toughen its policy  on Iran by insisting that the intelligence authorization
bill include  $18 million to support covert actions against the Iranian 
government by Iranian opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the Clinton Administration's policies toward Iraq and Iran  have been
unsuccessful, its role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations has been
overrated. President Clinton hosted  Israeli-Palestinian signing ceremonies at
the White House in September 1993  and September 1995, but the interim
Palestinian self-rule  agreements signed at those two ceremonies came about
through bilateral  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, not through U.S. diplomatic
 efforts. In October 1993, the Administration pledged to provide $500  million
in foreign aid to the Palestinians over five years. In 1994  Congress passed the
Middle East Peace Facilitation Act requiring  the State Department to certify
each year that the Palestine  Liberation Organization had complied with its
commitments under the  treaty 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  before this aid could be
disbursed. Representative  Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House
International  Relations Committee, has denounced the State Department
compliance  reports as a &quot;whitewash.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yielding to pressure from Congress, the President signed into  law a bill
requiring that the U.S. move its embassy in Israel from  Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
Israel's capital, by May 31, 1999. The  legislation contains a provision that
permits the President to delay  the embassy move if he considers it harmful to
U.S. national  security interests. The Clinton Administration had opposed the
bill,  arguing that it would upset the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which 
include conflicting claims to Jerusalem, but the embassy would  be located in
Western Jerusalem, which is not claimed by the PLO.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To facilitate the negotiation of a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty,  the Clinton
Administration has offered to dispatch a U.S.  peacekeeping force to the Golan
Heights, strategic territory along the  Syrian-Israeli border which Israel
captured in the 1967 Six Day War  and which Syria demands be returned to its
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has been much more active than  previous
administrations in establishing diplomatic contacts with  Islamic radicals, such
as the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in  Algeria. This is dangerous because it
undermines confidence in  secular governments battling Islamic movements,
thereby helping  these movements come to power. The Clinton Administration has 
called for a political dialogue between the FIS and the Algerian  military
regime. It believes that the FIS can halt terrorism and enter  a power-sharing
arrangement with secular Algerian parties,  despite the fact that the FIS is
unable to control the more radical  Armed 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Islamic Group which perpetrates
much of the terrorism in  the country and increasingly is eclipsing the FIS.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To protect U.S. interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf, 
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain a strong military presence in the Persian Gulf to  deter
Iran and Iraq from aggression and safeguard the free flow of  oil from the gulf
region.</B> Both countries have staged military  maneuvers in recent years to
intimidate their smaller neighbors. The  U.S. needs to maintain strong air and
naval forces in the region, as  well as pre-positioned military supplies that
can be deployed rapidly  by air transport to equip ground troops in a crisis.
Kuwait and  Qatar have agreed to provide facilities for pre-positioned military 
equipment, but the Saudi government has refused American requests  for a similar
arrangement in Saudi Arabia because it fears that  Islamic militants will
denounce such an arrangement as an American  base. Given such local political
sensitivities, the U.S. must seek to  limit the number of military personnel
stationed on the ground in  Saudi Arabia while depending on naval and air units
deployed in the  region to deter aggression from Iraq and Iran and relying on
rapid  air and sea transport to bring ground troops to the region in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq as long  as
Saddam Hussein remains in power, if necessary by vetoing  any move in the
Security Council to lift the sanctions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Tighten economic sanctions against Iran and press the  European
allies and Japan to stop lending money to Iran or renegotiating  its foreign
debt.</B> Iran is having increasing difficulty in financing  its 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 -->  roughly $30 billion foreign debt.
The stagnant Iranian  economy has been plagued by government mismanagement and
by  continued low prices for oil, its principal export. The U.S. ban on  trade
with Iran has cut into Iran's export earnings but has had  limited impact
because Japan and Western European states continue  their policy of &quot;constructive
engagement&quot; with Iran, which amounts  to business as usual. Washington
should press its allies to join  the embargo on trade with Iran and halt their
efforts to help Iran  reschedule its debt until the regime ends its support of
terrorism  and Islamic revolution. Washington should make a point of 
publicizing Iranian involvement in terrorism and subversion to  embarrass
Western leaders that turn a blind eye to Iranian aggression. If  the allies
continue to neglect the Iranian threat, the U.S. should  impose trade sanctions
on Western companies that continue to do  business with Iran. Banning such
companies from selling their goods in  the United States would force them to
choose between the  American market and the smaller Iranian market.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Pressure Russia, China, and Pakistan to halt their support of 
Iran's nuclear power program, which is being used as cover for  Iran's
clandestine nuclear weapons program.</B> These countries have  signed agreements
to provide nuclear technology, equipment, or  training to Iran. The U.S. should
increase pressure on all three countries  to break off their nuclear cooperation
with Tehran or risk U.S.  economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Take a cautious, go-slow approach to the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations.</B> Washington should demand that the PLO comply with  its past
commitments, especially to fight terrorism and revoke  provisions in the
Palestinian Covenant, the PLO's charter, that call  for the destruction of
Israel. The U.S. should not pressure Israel  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  make any concessions in the final
status talks, which begin in  May 1996, but should allow the two sides to work
out their  differences on their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Withdraw the offer to deploy U.S. peacekeeping forces on  the
Golan Heights. If peacekeeping forces are needed to monitor  a Syrian-Israeli
peace treaty, they can be drawn from other  nations, as is the present United
Nations peacekeeping force on the  Golan Heights.</B> American forces should not
be used because they will  be a lightning rod for terrorist attacks by groups
based in  nearby Lebanon, such as the militant pro-Iranian Hezbollah. If the 
forces deployed are too small, they will not significantly reduce the  military
risks that Israel would run in returning the heights to Syria;  if they are
large enough to deter Syrian aggression, they will  divert other U.S. military
units from more important missions and  erode U.S. military readiness by
interfering with combat training  schedules. For a Golan peacekeeping force to
be credible would  require the commitment of a heavy brigade of roughly 5,000
troops.  To maintain a long-term deployment would require the  commitment of
three brigades: one for deployment, one for retraining for  combat missions
after deployment, and one for training and  preparing to deploy. This represents
roughly 10 percent of the U.S.  Army's active duty combat strength, a
prohibitively high burden for  an open-ended peacekeeping commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Break off diplomatic contacts with the FIS and other radical 
Islamic groups.</B> Such contacts undermine the embattled secular  regimes
challenged by these radical groups. The U.S. also  should halt efforts to
pressure the embattled Algerian military regime  into a suicidal power-sharing
arrangement with Islamic radicals.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 57 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage free-market economic reforms, including the  development
of a European Union - North African free trade area, to  fuel economic growth in
North Africa and the Middle East.</B>  Economic reforms will create jobs for the
unemployed youth who serve  as the vanguard of Islamic revolutionary movements.
The U.S.  also should encourage the development of secular political parties 
that can give voice to political opposition and preclude Islamic  radicals from
monopolizing the opposition to established regimes.
</P>
<P>In addition, Congress should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Strengthen congressional oversight over the $100 million in 
annual U.S. aid to the Palestinians.</B> Congress should judge for  itself
whether the PLO has lived up to its peace commitments,  including its pledge to
end terrorism. Congress should withhold all U.S.  aid if the PLO fails to
comply.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. seek to maintain U.N. economic  sanctions on Iraq
when the Iraqi people, not the regime, appear to be  doing all the suffering?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.N. specifically exempted food and medicine from  its
embargo and gave Iraq the opportunity to export $1.6 billion  worth of oil to
pay for its imports if it did so under U.N.  supervision. Saddam Hussein
rejected this as an infringement of Iraqi  sovereignty and prefers to use the
suffering of his own people to  manipulate international public opinion. The
U.S. cannot afford to  lift the sanctions because Saddam has not complied with
U.N.  resolutions requiring that he provide a full accounting of his  military
buildup, recognize of the border with Kuwait, return Kuwaiti  hos
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  tages and assets, and halt
terrorism against his own people.  Moreover, Saddam remains a threat to the
region. If Iraq is allowed  to resume its oil exports, both Saddam's hold on
power and his  ability to threaten his neighbors will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be the U.S. role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Paradoxically, the U.S. should minimize its role as much  as
possible to encourage the Israelis and Arabs to negotiate with  each other, not
with Washington. Some of the biggest breakthroughs  in the peace negotiations,
such as Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat's 1977 visit to Jerusalem and the 1993
Oslo Accords, came  about without any direct U.S. involvement. Washington should
let  the two sides work out their problems by themselves to the  greatest extent
possible, suggesting ways to break diplomatic  impasses only when both sides
request that it do so. A lasting  Arab-Israeli peace must be negotiated
painstakingly by the parties to the  conflict and should not be imposed by
outside powers. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, who has traveled to the
Middle East  17 times, should adjust his priorities and spend more time 
addressing more important issues, such as U.S. policy toward Russia  and China,
which he has visited less frequently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. reject a peacekeeping presence on  the Golan
Heights when it has maintained a similar  peacekeeping force in the Sinai
peninsula since 1982 to monitor compliance  with the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. forces would face a very different political, military,  and

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  terrorist threat environment in
the Golan Heights.  Peacekeepers would be deployed close to large armored
forces, in a  constricted area, and in positions that would become important
military  objectives if fighting erupts. Moreover, Golan peacekeepers could  be
subject to terrorist attacks from nearby Lebanon or from  terrorists hiding
among Syrian civilians. Finally, unlike Sadat's  Egypt, Hafez al-Assad's Syria
is one of the world's leading exporters  of terrorism. Syria supported
Hezbollah's terrorist attacks  against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon
in 1983-1984 and  may be tempted to do so again in the Golan Heights to drive 
peacekeepers away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. By firmly opposing Islamic radicalism, can the U.S. be  accused of
being anti-Muslim?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. Muslims are the chief victims of Islamic  radicals,
who are totalitarian ideologues willing to use violence,  terrorism, and
intimidation to impose their narrow religious and  political views on their
countrymen. The U.S. has cooperated closely  with fundamentalist states such as
Saudi Arabia and President Zia  al-Haq's Pakistan. The U.S. is opposed to
terrorism and the export  of violent revolution, not to the religious beliefs of
any group.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUESL">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America has two vital national interests in Latin America:  countering such
ongoing threats to U.S. national security as illegal  drug trafficking and Fidel
Castro's Cuba and encouraging the  development of prosperous and stable
capitalist democracies  throughout 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Latin America's economies are among the fastest growing in  the world, and
the United States has been one of the principal  beneficiaries of this growth.
U.S. exports to Latin America more  than doubled between 1988 and 1994, rising
to $94 billion, and  now support over 2 million American jobs. Moreover,
democratic  reforms are advancing at a quicker pace in Latin America than 
anywhere else in the world. Today, Cuba is the only  undemocratic country in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Trade expansion drives U.S. relations with Latin America,  and NAFTA (the
North American Free Trade Agreement) will be  the main instrument for achieving
America's principal foreign  policy goals for the region. These goals consist of
expanding U.S.  exports and investment as quickly as possible and assuring
long-term  economic and political stability on America's southern flank, 
particularly in Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1989, the Bush Administration unveiled the Enterprise of  the Americas
Initiative, a bold proposal to create a single  free-trade area encompassing the
entire Western Hemisphere. The  following year, in 1990, the U.S. and Mexico
agreed to negotiate  NAFTA, the first comprehensive free-trade agreement ever
signed by  the U.S. with any Latin American country. NAFTA was signed  into law
by President Clinton on December 8, 1993. One year later,  at the Summit of the
Americas in Miami, President Clinton and  33 other hemispheric heads of state
agreed unanimously to create  a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.
President Clinton  also pledged at the summit to expand NAFTA to Chile in 1996,
but  that presidential promise has not yet been fulfilled.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 61 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most immediate threat to stability and security on  America's southern
flank is the crisis in Mexico. The peso's collapse on  December 19, 1994,
plunged Mexico into the worst economic  and political crisis it has suffered in
more than a century. The  peso crisis also weakened support for NAFTA in the
U.S. and may  have derailed further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Western 
Hemisphere for a period of two or three years. The Clinton  Administration is
aiding Mexico with a $50 billion emergency bailout  package, and the government
of President Ernesto Zedillo has  stepped up the pace of economic and political
reform, but the turmoil  will not subside quickly. It remains to be seen whether
the  Clinton Administration's bailout and the Zedillo government's  emergency
economic reforms will be enough to end the current crisis; if  not, Mexico will
be forced to implement even tougher reforms in  1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other threats to stability and security in Latin America  include
corruption, the widespread absence of the rule of law,  inadequate protection of
property rights, drug trafficking, organized  crime, and guerrilla activities in
several countries. These are  structural problems for which there are no easy or
quick solutions.  However, without sustained economic development, prospects for
 confronting these threats successfully are poor. The expansion of  NAFTA to
include Chile and other Latin American countries is the  vehicle proposed by the
U.S., and embraced by the emerging  capitalist democracies of Latin America, to
achieve sustained economic  development and create a 21st century hemispheric
partnership  based on free trade and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most important Latin American issues is whether  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 62 -->  include Chile in NAFTA. Some
American protectionists  oppose NAFTA's expansion, arguing that NAFTA caused the
 Mexican crisis and that free trade is bad for the United States. Others 
believe that expanding NAFTA is the only way to expand the  economies of the
U.S. and Latin America. Thus, they advocate  extending fast-track negotiating
authority to the President. Fast-track  negotiating authority authorizes the
President to conduct trade  negotiations with a view to achieving specific goals
established  by Congress. Agreements negotiated under fast-track are submitted 
to Congress for an up-or-down vote, but Congress may not amend  or otherwise
alter the proposed agreement submitted for its approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether the U.S. should be bailing out  Mexico's economy.
In 1995, the Clinton Administration bailed out  Mexico with a rescue package
totaling nearly $50 billion. About half  of this amount has been borrowed by the
Mexican government so  far, yet the economic crisis has not ended. Critics of
the  Administration argue that it is both unwise and wasteful to  subsidize
Mexico's economic inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third important Latin American issue is whether the U.S.  should impose
sanctions on Colombia for not doing enough to curb  the drug cartels operating
in that country. President Ernesto  Samper financed his 1994 election campaign
with more than $6 million  in political contributions from the Cali cartel. In
1995, the  Clinton Administration renewed Colombia's annual certification with 
a &quot;national interest waiver,&quot; which is analogous to flunking a  final
exam but receiving a passing grade anyway. The Republican  majority in Congress
criticized Colombia's national interest  certification in 1995 and urged Clinton
instead to decertify Colombia  and impose trade sanctions. The Administration in
March 1996  decerti
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 63 -->  fied Colombia as a sign of U.S.
opposition to the penetration  of Colombia's presidency, Congress, and court
system by  corrupt drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTSL">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean have more 
than doubled in just six years, rising from $46.4 billion in 1988 to  over $98
billion in 1994. These exports support nearly 2 million  American jobs. Total
U.S. exports to Latin America represent 19  percent of all U.S. exports, making
Latin America the fourth-largest  U.S. export market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since 1990, U.S. exports to all countries in the Western 
Hemisphere, including Canada, have increased over 50 percent,  from $137 billion
to nearly $207 billion. In all, these exports  support over 4.1 million American
jobs. Total U.S. exports to all  countries in the Western Hemisphere in 1994
represented over 40 percent  of America's exports worldwide. The Western
Hemisphere  is America's second-largest export market, after Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Negotiations for NAFTA were substantially concluded in 1992 
by the Bush Administration. The final agreement was approved  in 1993 by the
U.S. Congress, but only after the Clinton  Administration forced Mexico and
Canada to accept unnecessary side  agreements on labor and the environment.
NAFTA is to be  implemented over a period of 15 years, with full implementation
scheduled  for 2009. Chile is next in line for membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Trade growth during NAFTA's first two years surpassed even 
the most optimistic forecasts. In 1994, two-way trade between the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 64 -->  and Mexico increased over 22
percent, to more than $100  billion. The U.S. reported a trade deficit of nearly
$16 billion with  Mexico during 1995, mainly because Mexican exports had
increased  by more than one-third since 1994. However, despite the peso  crisis,
U.S. exports to Mexico in 1995 fell by less than 9 percent from  the year
before, and were still higher than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The South American Common Market (Mercosur), which is led  by
Brazil and also includes Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, is  rapidly
developing a free-trade area in South America while  seeking closer trade
relations with the European Union and several of  the APEC countries, including
Japan. If NAFTA is not  expanded quickly to include Chile, and subsequently
Argentina, the  U.S. may be sidelined from South American trade liberalization 
centered on Mercosur at the expense of American exports, jobs,  and U.S.
leadership in that region of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Drug cartels in Colombia and Mexico have become a  significant
threat to U.S. economic and security interests. Colombian  drug traffickers
financed the election of President Ernesto Samper  in 1994 and have penetrated
Columbia's Congress, courts, and  law enforcement institutions. Moreover, over
80 percent of the  cocaine imported illegally into the U.S. is transported
through Mexico  by powerful drug cartels in league with corrupt politicians, law
 enforcement, and military personnel. Belatedly, the Clinton  Administration
appears to have acknowledged that drug traffickers are  a national security
threat to America by appointing former  Army General Barry McCaffrey as the new
head of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORDL">THE RECORD</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 65 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The high watermarks of the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy toward
Latin America were the approval of NAFTA  in 1993 and the Summit of the Americas
in 1994. It was at this  conference that the President pledged to expand NAFTA
to  include Chile in 1996 and promised to create a Free Trade Area of  the
Americas by 2005. Both achievements were eclipsed by the  collapse of the
Mexican peso in 1995, and the crisis in Mexico  has derailed further U.S.-led
trade expansion in Latin America for  one or two years at least. The Clinton
Administration is  pretending otherwise, but without NAFTA's expansion to Chile,
the  President has nothing to offer Latin America, and the U.S. is  temporarily
sidelined from the process of hemispheric trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, with NAFTA's expansion pushed off  the Administration's
agenda, at least for now, President Clinton  has little to show for his efforts
in Latin America except a string  of foreign policy blunders. These include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The U.S. military occupation of Haiti.</B> President
Clinton  ordered the invasion of Haiti to establish a lasting democracy in that 
country. In truth, however, the Clinton Administration restored  Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power and then  provided Aristide with over
$2 billion in military security and financial  aid as he consolidated his
one-man rule. New Haitian President  Rene Preval is Aristide's closest friend,
chosen by Aristide to  succeed him in power. Moreover, political violence has
continued in  Haiti since the start of the U.S. military occupation. Since
Aristide  was restored to power, more than 20 leaders of the political 
opposition have been murdered. Now that the U.S. has left Haiti, there  are
fears of renewed political violence.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 66 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The Mexican peso crisis.</B> The Clinton Administration had  more
than a year's advance warning, during 1993 and 1994, of  Mexico's impending
financial collapse but did nothing to prevent it.  When the crisis hit,
President Clinton rushed to the  Mexican government's rescue with a $50 billion
bailout package that  assured Americans holding Mexican government bonds of full
 repayment at the expense of American taxpayers. However,  the Mexican economy
suffered a brutal contraction that will be felt  for many years by the Mexican
people, and the expansion of  NAFTA to Chile and other Latin American countries
was derailed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Dealing secretly with Castro.</B> The White House secretly 
negotiated an agreement with Castro that requires U.S. Navy and Coast  Guard
ships to intercept Cuban refugees fleeing the island and  return them forcibly
to Cuba. However, Clinton obtained no economic  or political concessions from
Castro, except a promise not to  permit any new mass departures of Cubans
seeking freedom.

<P><B>*     Allow no more bailouts for Mexico or any other country.</B> 
Clinton's bailout of Mexico is a case of throwing good money after bad.  The
crisis in Mexico is not over. As soon as 1997, another peso  crisis 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 67 -->  could force the Zedillo
government to request more financial  aid from the U.S., and possibly also to
call for a new round of  debt negotiations to prevent a default. The U.S. should
refuse all  future Mexican requests for emergency financial bailouts and should 
urge Mexico instead to resolve its economic difficulties with  market-oriented
solutions.

<P><B>*     Expand NAFTA to include Chile.</B> Including Chile in  NAFTA would
send the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean a  strong message that U.S.
commitment to creating a Free Trade Area  of the Americas (FTAA) remains firm.
It also would  enhance America's leadership in the Western Hemisphere while 
expanding export and investment opportunities for U.S. companies in  South
America, creating a South American gateway to Asian markets  for U.S. producers,
and strengthening the relative bargaining power  of U.S. trade negotiators in
future talks between NAFTA and  the South American Common Market (Mercosur)
headed by  Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Give Caribbean and Central American countries  NAFTA-level trade
parity.</B> Raising the countries of the Caribbean Basin  Initiative to NAFTA
parity with Mexico would not cost the U.S.  anything. To the contrary, it would
increase market access for U.S.  companies and investors in the Caribbean and
Central America  and would compel countries in the region to accept NAFTA 
standards in other areas beneficial to American commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Negotiate a framework free-trade agreement between NAFTA  and
Mercosur, the South American Common Market.</B>  A  free-trade agreement between
NAFTA and Mercosur is an essential step  in creating a Free Trade Area of the
Americas. At present, Brazil  is 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 68 -->  pursuing a policy of
consolidating Mercosur first in order to  create a South American Free Trade
Area (SAFTA), centered on  Brazil, that would exclude NAFTA initially. This
would have  adverse long-term consequences for U.S. exports and investments in 
South America. The U.S. should try to counter this Brazilian strategy  by
expanding NAFTA to include Chile, and subsequently  Argentina, in order to push
Mercosur toward a convergence with NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Suspend all U.S. government aid to Haiti.</B> The Clinton 
Administration has withdrawn the American military presence from Haiti,  but it
plans to continue funding the Aristide-sponsored government  of President Rene
Preval with hundreds of millions of dollars in  financial aid disbursed through
the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) and multilateral
institutions like the  IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank. 
However, lasting democracy has not been established, and American  taxpayers
should not be dunned for the cost of maintaining the illusion  of democracy in
the least democratic country in the Americas  (after communist Cuba).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Continue pressure against Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba.</B>
 The Clinton Administration has agreed to return to Cuba all  refugees
intercepted at sea, but Castro has made no economic or  political concessions.
Castro wants the U.S. trade embargo lifted, but  he refuses to relax his
totalitarian enslavement of the Cuban  people. Until Castro agrees to make real
free-market and democratic  concessions aimed at freeing the Cuban people, the
U.S. should  continue to turn the economic screws against Castro, as it did 
recently by approving the Helms-Burton Bill that tightens sanctions  against
Cuba.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&AL">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican peso crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso  collapsed
because the Mexican economy is not free and  because Mexico is not a
full-fledged democracy. NAFTA prevented  the Mexican crisis from becoming much
worse, because it  provided Mexico with a strong institutional anchor that
encouraged the  government to stay on course with the economic and political 
reforms that, over the next decade, will foster the consolidation of a  true
capitalist democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is NAFTA responsible for growing illegal immigration  and drug
trafficking from Mexico?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Mexicans emigrate to the U.S., legally and illegally,  because
they are fleeing poverty and repression. Mexicans have been  migrating to
America for over 100 years and will continue to do so  as long as they are
denied opportunities for economic advancement  in their own country. NAFTA
compels the Mexican government  to open up the Mexican economy; over the next
10-15 years,  therefore, more economic freedom in Mexico will be reflected in 
reduced immigration to the U.S. Similarly, NAFTA is not  responsible for drug
trafficking in North America. The real cause is  the lack of economic and
political freedom in Mexico, combined  with incoherent U.S. anti-drug policies.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Wouldn't America be better off without NAFTA?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Without NAFTA, relations between the U.S. and Mexico  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 70 -->  deteriorate. NAFTA is the first
successful effort, in nearly  200 years of frequently difficult U.S.-Mexico
relations, to build a  lasting partnership based on economic prosperity and
democratic  stability. Abolishing NAFTA would not end common security  concerns
related to economic relations, immigration, and drug  trafficking. However, with
NAFTA in place, the U.S. has an  effective foreign policy instrument with which
to create a durable  cross-border relationship for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Was the military occupation of Haiti a mistake?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Yes. President Clinton's commitment of U.S. troops to  Haiti was
driven by domestic policy concerns. Haiti has no  democratic tradition, and
history teaches that democracy cannot be  imposed forcibly by external power.
The creation of a true democracy  in Haiti is important to all democracies in
the Americas, but the  drive to become a democracy must come from within.

</P>
<P><B>M</B>ost Americans believe that America, for all its flaws, is a 
peaceable, generous, and benevolent nation that has been a force  for good in
the world. Today, the industrialized democracies, led  by the United States,
face rising new challenges to their security,  interests, and prosperity. The
fall of the Soviet Union and  Warsaw Pact has meant not the end of threats to
U.S. and allied  security, but the unleashing of forces contained by 45 years of
the  Cold War. U.S. leadership is still vital if America and other free  nations
are to deal effectively with these forces. To provide this  leadership, the
United States needs to remain engaged in world  affairs, working to create
conditions that serve the interests of the U.S.  and its allies and trying to
shape the kind of world in which  democratic institutions, free trade, and the
unimpeded flow of ideas can  flourish.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America cannot be -- nor should it try to be -- the world's  policeman. But
neither can the nation retreat into neo-isolationism.  This is an era
characterized by the global spread of ballistic  missiles; nuclear, chemical,
and biological weapons; and other  high-tech weaponry among potential
adversaries. And while the threat  of thermonuclear war has subsided, at least
from the former  Soviet Union, threats from nuclear proliferation, terrorism,
and tribal  and ethnic conflict have not. Even in this new &quot;Age of Chaos,&quot;
 however, the world remains linked by innumerable strands of  trade, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  commerce, and telecommunications;
and these essential links  must operate despite conflict, confrontation, and
dislocation. A  &quot;Fortress America&quot; strategy in this kind of world is
not workable.  The U.S. could not put its head in the sand for long even if it
wanted  to. The North Koreas, Iraqs, and Irans, not to mention the  positive
demands of trade and commerce, would not allow it.  America needs access to the
world's markets and resources and must  maintain the ability to move goods
freely and safely.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Consequently, acting in concert with friends and allies when  possible but
unilaterally when necessary, the United States should  use all the components of
national power and influence -- diplomacy, trade, communications, and (as a last resort) armed force -- to shape a world friendly to America's interests and
values. In  short, the U.S. needs to make the world safe for America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. has global interests and must be a world leader in  ways that suit
its interests, values, and capabilities. Because it is a  trading nation
dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and  goods, America has commercial and
political interests in almost all  corners of the world. Therefore, the U.S.
must be engaged -- through diplomacy, trade, and other means -- in practically all
regions  of the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. does not have security interests  everywhere. Some of the
world's regions are more important than others.  Since the U.S. cannot be the
world's policeman -- it has neither  the means nor the will to impose a security
order on the world -- it  will have to choose carefully in deciding when, and
under what  cir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  cumstances, to engage its military
forces and prestige. It will  have to choose strategies, alliances, and military
capabilities that  are best suited to its unique position as the world's only
global  military power. It will have to choose when its use of military force 
is decisive and unique.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To exploit this unique and unenviable position, the U.S.  should adopt a
military strategy of selective engagement  whereby America, lacking a single
global threat, engages its military  power primarily to maintain a balance of
power in regions that are  most vital to her interests. The U.S. must always be
prepared to  protect its borders and regions close to home; for this reason,
security  matters in the Western Hemisphere will always be vitally  important.
But as a global power, the U.S. also must be prepared to  intervene militarily
to maintain a positive balance of power in other key  regions of the world. Now
that the Soviet Union has dissolved,  no single power can challenge the U.S.
globally, but smaller  powers in Europe, Asia, and the Persian Gulf can threaten
U.S.  security interests in these vitally important regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's &quot;global&quot; strategy is both global and regional. The 
primary aims of U.S. military strategy should be: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)</B>  <B>To defend the American people and territory
from attack. </B> Thus, America's top priorities should be not only to deploy a 
ballistic missile defense for the U.S. homeland, but also to take a lead  role
in countering nuclear proliferation and other global threats to  security. <B>
</B>The greatest threat to the peace and stability in the world  today is the
acquisition by rogue regimes or hostile forces of  weapons of mass destruction
(nuclear, biological, and chemical).  The proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, along with the  ballis
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  tic missiles to deliver them, will
result inevitably in greater  confrontation and conflict unless the free
nations, led by the  United States, take steps to keep dangerous weapons out of
the hands  of potential enemies. America has the resources to counter the 
proliferation of advanced weaponry, including the ability to build  an effective
defense against ballistic missiles, thereby rendering  them less useful.
Harnessing these resources and demonstrating the  leadership necessary to use
them should be a top priority for U.S.  foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  To maintain a balance of power in Europe, Asia, and the
 Persian Gulf.</B> It is still a vital interest of the U.S. to prevent the 
domination of Europe, Asia, or the Persian Gulf by a hostile power  or bloc of
hostile powers. NATO and other military alliances  remain the best ways to
prevent such domination. These alliances are  insurance policies against the
instability and chaos that  brought America into two world wars in this century.
Without an  American military presence in Europe, Asia, and the Persian Gulf,
chaos  and conflict will fill the vacuum if security arrangements among  the
free nations of the world erode. The U.S. must cultivate good  relations with
allies in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and  Latin America, and where possible
bring emerging democracies  into security partnerships. Top priorities include
bringing new  democracies in Central Europe into NATO and strengthening 
alliances and friendships in Asia.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Therein lies not only the basis of American leadership in the world -- not as the world's policeman, but as the only power capable  of
preventing major regional or even global wars -- but also a  new division of labor
with allies. America's allies should take the  lead in settling purely regional
conflicts, such as the civil war  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  Bosnia-Herzogovina, while the U.S.
focuses primarily on the  core military mission of collective defense. The U.S.
should not try  to put out every brushfire that breaks out in Europe or Asia, 
but should husband its resources to deal with larger threats that  endanger the
overall security of these regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This strategy of selective engagement is very different from  the one
pursued by the Clinton Administration. The President calls  his strategy &quot;engagement
and enlargement.&quot;  No one is sure  exactly what these terms mean, but his
strategy entails a heavy focus  on peacekeeping, multilateralism, appeasement of
large powers  like Russia and China, and a general neglect of military 
capabilities, military alliances, and the core military missions of those 
alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The strategy of selective engagement is practically the opposite  of
Clinton's approach. Peacekeeping would be downplayed (and  U.S. troop
participation in such operations avoided); multilateralism  de-emphasized except
through military alliances; policies  toward large powers like Russia and China
toughened; military  capabilities maintained at higher levels; and military
alliances focused  on core missions of collective defense, not peacekeeping or 
crisis management. Leadership would be demonstrated not by  engaging in global
social work, as the President has done, but by  emphasizing America's unique and
decisive contributions to world  peace and stability as a global power.


<P>
</P>
<P><B>ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR AMERICANS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is more to maintaining America's leadership role in  the
world than military strategy. There also are the key issues of  trade 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  and economics. To be sure,
America's standard of living  depends on its role as a global power; the wealth
of America as a nation  is inconceivable without the security provided by
America's  armed forces and alliances. But it is also true that America's 
wealth would be inconceivable were it not for its access to overseas  markets
and the relative stability of the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For this reason, the U.S. has a vital interest in free trade and  open
overseas markets. As a maritime nation dependent on  foreign trade, the U.S.
depends on access to world markets, raw  materials, and energy resources for its
prosperity and security.  Protecting these interests depends on the free and
safe transit of the air,  space, and the world's sea lanes and maritime choke
points.  Historically, the U.S. has been compelled to intervene with armed force
to  protect these freedoms, and it must remain prepared to do so  when
necessary. But persuasion is always preferable. Therefore, the  U.S. should
conduct an enlightened diplomacy to remove artificial  barriers to the free flow
of goods, services, and ideas,  especially among the industrialized democracies.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>PROMOTING FREEDOM ABROAD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans care deeply about the morality of their foreign 
policy. They wish to see a reflection of themselves as a people in the  foreign
policies which their government pursues. For this reason,  they wish to support
freedom and democracy abroad, not only for  the practical benefits of spreading
peace and stability, but  because doing so is a reflection of their own values
in the world. It also is  a source of inspiration which sustains their
commitments  beyond what is required by self-interest.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, most Americans do not wish to see their country  embark on some
overseas crusade for democracy. They understand  the limits imposed by reality.
It makes little sense to imply, as  the Clinton Administration did in Haiti,
that creating democracy is  a general and unlimited goal of U.S. military
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it is both a practical and moral benefit for the U.S.  to help
free institutions take root abroad, particularly in  regions where old
totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed.  Free nations grounded in
democratic institutions generally do not  start wars. The freer and more
democratic the world becomes, the  more peaceful, and therefore the more
congenial to U.S. values and  interests, it will be. The best tools with which
to help emerging  democracies are foreign aid and public and private diplomacy, 
not direct military intervention, which should be undertaken  only when vital
interests are threatened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>CONCLUSION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These principles can and should guide policymakers, not only 
in the next Administration or next session of Congress, but in  successive
Administrations and Congresses for decades to come. In  short, they should be
viewed as the basic principles of foreign and  defense policy for America in the
21st century. They are, in  essence, the foundations of a post-Cold War national
strategy for the  United States.

<h3>The U.S. Response to Castro's Aggression: Tightening the Embargo Is Not Enough</h3><BR>

F.Y.I. No. 88
<br>
February 29, 1996<BR>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The destruction by Cuban MIGs of two U.S.-registered civilian
aircraft flying over international waters in the Florida Straits
on February 24, 1996, proves once again that Fidel Castro will
never allow real economic and democratic reforms in Cuba. The
Castro regime is lying when it claims that the downed aircraft
were inside the 12-mile territorial limit recognized by international
law. The first aircraft shot down was approximately five miles
north of Cuban airspace, and the second was at least 16 nautical
miles north of Cuban airspace. Four American citizens were killed.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;As usual, the Clinton Administrations rhetoric was sharp, but its initial actions were timid.  In fact, the President did not get tough with Castro until it became clear that there was strong bipartisan support in Congress for immediate tightening of the economic sanctions against Castro.  As a result, on February 28, 1996, the Administration and Congress finally reached agreement on a new version of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act (H.R. 927, the "Libertad" bill) that is much tougher than the House and Senate versions passed last fall.  The new provisions include:
<p><ul>
<li> A section that gives the weight of law to all executive orders and regulations regarding Cuba, thereby ensuring that the economic embargo against Cuba cannot be lifted by presidential order unless there is a democratic transition in Cuba without Castro.
<p>
<li> The mandatory denial of U.S. visas to anyone -- corporate officers, principals, or shareholders -- who acquires or uses American-owned property confiscated in Cuba by the Castro regime.
<p>
<li> The inclusion of Title III, allowing U.S. citizens to use American courts to sue foreign companies and individuals who buy confiscated property in Cuba.  This was not in the bill approved by the Senate last fall.  However, to win Clintons support, congressional negotiators agreed to language that gives the President the authority to waive the implementation of Title III for six-month periods.  Since the waiver can be renewed, this means that Title III could be delayed indefinitely.
</ul><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Administration and Congress hailed the compromise package as the toughest bill ever passed to bring about the demise of Castro.  However, while passage of the "Libertad" bill is a major step forward, Castro's regime is not likely to be very impressed.  In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force. Specifically, the U.S. government should:


























<P><ul>
<li><b> Announce that the U.S. will enforce international laws in the region.</b> This means that Cuba's so-called Air Defense Zone ends
at the 12-mile limit established by international law, not the
24th parallel as claimed by the Castro regime. The U.S. should
make clear to Cuba that any more attacks against civilian aircraft
or boats outside Cuba's 12-mile territorial limit will prompt
an immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces.
To make sure Castro gets the point, U.S. warplanes should patrol
the Florida Straits below the 24th parallel and should respond
to any provocation by Cuban air, sea, or ground-based forces both
immediately and forcefully. A similar policy was pursued with
regard to Libya. In February 1986, U.S. Navy aviators shot down
two Libyan MIGs threatening them in international airspace over
the Gulf of Sidra.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Inform Castro that a new refugee crisis will be considered a
hostile act against the national security of the United States.</b>
The Castro regime has agreed to abide by the immigration act signed
in 1995 between the U.S. and Cuba. This agreement stipulates that
up to 20,000 Cuban &eacute;migr&eacute;s will be issued visas
annually, that the Castro government will not permit any new mass
departures by sea of illegal Cuban immigrants, and that any Cubans
intercepted at sea by U.S. naval forces will be repatriated to
a Cuban port. The U.S. should insist that all aspects of this
agreement be respected by all parties. <BR>

<P>
<li><b>Ban all cash remittances to Cuba from the U.S.</b> This undoubtedly
would affect many Cubans who depend on regular remittances from
their relatives in the U.S., but it also would deprive the Castro
regime of a source of hard currency that now totals over $500
million a year.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by American citizens.</b> This prohibition
should include journalists, academics, and business people and
should be extended to include visits by way of third countries.
Similarly, Cuban journalists, academics, and other professionals
should not be granted visas to visit the U.S. until the Castro
regime allows independent Cuban professionals and opposition leaders
the same travel privileges it allows its communist apparatchiks.
<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Declare that U.S. countermeasures are aimed at Castro, not the
Cuban people.</b> Radio and television broadcasts to Cuba on Radio
Mart&iacute; and TV Mart&iacute; should be expanded to inform
the Cuban people that U.S. economic sanctions are directed not
at the Cuban people, but at Fidel and Raul Castro. To undermine
the Castro regime's efforts to rally the support of the Cuban
people with anti-American communist propaganda, the U.S. should
launch a vigorous, sustained effort to inform them that when Castro
leaves power, the U.S. will lift the trade embargo, quickly restore
Cuba's most favored nation status, and remain committed to supporting
the economic and democratic reconstruction of Cuba. To make sure
the broadcasts are beamed into Cuba, U.S. aircraft with broadcasting
equipment should be stationed permanently in the international
skies over the Florida Straits to break the Cuban government's
jamming efforts. Any aggressive acts against these aircraft by
Cuban forces should be countered immediately by American Navy
and Air Force units patrolling the area.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Impose tight controls over the activities and movements of Cuban
officials in the U.S.</b> Efforts by the Castro regime to spread its
lies and propaganda in the U.S. should be banned. If the regime
does not allow democratic and human rights groups to meet freely
and openly in Cuba, and does not allow Americans to participate
in such meetings, the U.S. should not allow Cuban officials to
participate in any similar events within the United States. Moreover,
any Cuban official who violates this restriction should be expelled
from the U.S.<BR>

<P>
<li><b> Declare that the U.S. opposes activation of the nuclear reactor
in Cuba.</b> The U.S. should make clear to Castro that America will
not allow Cuba to build and operate a nuclear reactor on the island,
even if the reactor is to be used only for electrical power generation.
Since 1991, construction of a nuclear reactor near Cienfuegos,
about 130 miles east of Havana on Cuba's southern coast, has been
stopped by a lack of funding to complete the project. Three-quarters
of the construction needed to finish the project has been completed.
The plant is not the same design as the Chernobyl reactor; it
more closely matches safer ones built in East Germany during the
Cold War. However, these plants were shut down by West German
officials after unification because of their poor safety record,
and the unfinished reactor in Cuba has been built with faulty
rods and shoddy materials. If completed, Cuba's reactor could
pose a broad safety risk to U.S. lives and property in Florida
and the U.S. Southeast Coast.

</P>
<P>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Operation Joint Endeavor Fact Sheet December 7,
1995
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This fact sheet provides information on the role and mission of  the
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why The U.S. Must Play A Role In IFOR</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The United States has vital political, economic and security  interests in
Europe. The war in Bosnia threatens these interests.  We now have the first real
opportunity to end this war. To seize  this opportunity requires a commitment of
U.S. troops as part of  a NATO peace implementation force (IFOR). The risks to 
the United States of allowing the war to continue are greater than  the risks of
enforcing the peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What U.S. Forces Will Do At First</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will take approximately eight weeks for the entire U.S. force  of
approximately 20,000 soldiers to arrive in the northeastern  portion of Bosnia,
with a division headquarters in Tuzla. Most of  the troops will come from the
1st Armored Division in Germany.  They will travel to Bosnia mainly by road and
rail using routes that  are currently in use and clear of mines. A Nordic
brigade and a  reinforced Turkish battalion will also be located in the U.S. 
sector which will be under the control of the U.S. Army Major  General William
Nash, the commander of the 1st Armored Division.  Eventually a Russian brigade
will also be located in the U.S. sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When this main body of U.S. forces arrives, they will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force
</P>
<P>-      Execute transfer of the U.S. sector from the United Nations  Protec
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  tion Force (UNPROFOR)
</P>
<P>-     Establish Joint Military Commissions

<P><B>What IFOR Will Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two complementary aspects of the overall peace  implementation
mission  civil and military. The civil aspect  includes rebuilding the Bosnian
infrastructure, economic  development, elections, and refugee resettling  not an
IFOR mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The military aspect  the mission of IFOR  is to create a  stable environment
for the civil aspects to proceed. IFOR, including  U.S. forces, will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force by ensuring self-defense and freedom of
 movement for IFOR
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce required withdrawal of forces to respective territories
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Establish a man a zone of separation
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce the cessation of hostilities
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-      Provide a secure environment which permits conduct of  civil peace
implementation functions.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>NATO and U.S. forces will enforce a peace, not fight a war.  Robust NATO
rules of engagement reflect the philosophy of  sending in a heavy force,
authorized to use deadly force for self  defense, force protection, and to
enforce compliance with the peace plan.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the U.N. mission, there is no dual key in  NATO's rules of
engagement. Field commanders will have authority to  defend troops under their
command and to ensure compliance  with the military aspects of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFORs first task will be to oversee the withdrawal of  Federation and
Bosnian Serb forces behind the agreed cease-fire line  within thirty days. Once
this is done, IFOR will monitor and patrol a  four-kilometer (2.5 mile) wide
Zone of Separation along the  internal boundaries between Federation and Bosnian
Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What Parties Must Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Beginning when the peace agreement is signed in Paris on  December 14, the
parties to the agreement  the Bosnian Federation  and the Bosnian Serbs  have
specific time frames by which they  must meet specific obligations, as follows:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     DAY 1 Begin withdrawing forces, removing mines from Zones
 of Separation, making boundaries
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 3 Air defense radar shut down

</P>
<P>-     DAY 30 Foreign troops (mercenaries, etc.) out of Bosnia.  Military
forces complete withdrawal behind cease fire lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 45 Complete withdrawal behind inter-entity boundary lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 120 Complete withdrawal of all heavy weapons and  forces to
cantonment/barracks areas

<P><B>What IFOR Will Not Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not patrol Bosnia's external borders.
According to  the peace settlement, supervision of Bosnia's external borders
will  be done by other organizations, most likely the International  Commission
on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY), which currently  performs this function.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not act as a police force. That function will be the
 responsibility of the civilian side of the peace implementation  operation.
IFOR personnel will have the authority to detain any  persons who interfere with
the IFOR mission or those individuals who  may be indicted for war crimes, but
they will not try to track  them down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      IFOR will not be involved in reconstruction, humanitarian 
relief, political reform, or human rights efforts. Other civilian  agencies and
organizations will be responsible for those tasks. IFOR  also will not be
involved in arming and training Bosnian  Federation forces, if that becomes
necessary to achieve equilibrium  with Bosnian Serb forces.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>When IFOR Will Leave</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFOR will deploy long enough to give the civil aspects an  opportunity to
take hold and start making an impact on the lives of  the people of Bosnia. With
high confidence, we believe the  military mission can be completed in
approximately twelve months  from 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  the start of deployment. (If
there were to be a complete  breakdown of the settlement, the President does
have the authority to  withdraw U.S. forces from Bosnia.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The civil aspects will continue for many years. However, at  the time of
IFOR's withdrawal, conditions in Bosnia will be  substantially different and
more stable than they are today. The forces  will have been separated, the
territories will have been transferred,  and the cycle of violence will have
been broken. We expect the  newly-elected government to take root and economic
reconstruction to  be under way.
