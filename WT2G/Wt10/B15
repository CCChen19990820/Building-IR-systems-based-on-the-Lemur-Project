<h2>Our Industry's Stake in Physicians' Ethical Problems</h2>
</center>

<h5><i>by Kirk Johnson</i></h5>

<hr>

<b>Editor's Note:</b> In our March 1993 issue, we interviewed Kirk Johnson, whose responsibilities at the American Medical Association include the defining and enforcement of medical ethics. Much of that conversation centered on the then new AMA promotion guidelines (see <A HREF="HTTP://www.cpsnet.com/mmm/reprints/mar95/indthun.html">"Thunderbolt Limits Physician Samples"</A>), which banned company gifts to physicians. Since then, managed care has become the hot subject, so we went back to ask him: what ethical issues has the healthcare revolution brought about? We also asked him to provide an update on the guidelines and on the status of FDA's long-threatened regulations of continuing medical education.

<hr>

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<i>AMA's general counsel summarizes the ethical issues raised by managed healthcare. Individual doctors, professional associations and pharmaceutical companies all need to be aware of what these issues are and how to cope with them. What's at stake is nothing less than the right of physicians to prescribe what they consider best for their patients.</i>
<p>
The basic premise of medical care in the '90s is that physicians have an ethical obligation to manage the care of their patients efficiently and that "managed care" is here to stay. However, the intense focus on cost control has created troubling ethical problems for physicians in these plans. By threatening doctors' traditional role as patient advocates, with the potential for conflicts of interest, some managed care plans are placing doctors under pressure that calls for support from professional organizations such as the American Medical Association, as well as other interested parties, including the healthcare industry. 
<p>
Whether conflicts of interest are now affecting medical care or are only potential threats is hard to say, since clinical outcome data that would show a difference between types of practice are hard to come by. What we can say with certainty is that physicians who are part of a network with rigid utilization controls, or are heavily rewarded for meeting cost benefit parameters, or capitation calculations, must have special care that they protect their professional obligations to their patients.
<p>
Physicians have an obligation to be cost conscious, but they have a special duty to the health of their patients that transcends that responsibility. That duty remains, no matter how harassed they are, no matter how much pressure is put on them. We at AMA are helping physicians be leaders in managed care so these values remain paramount. We are going to assert basic principles and set some ground rules that apply regardless of the plans.
<p>

<h3>The ground rules</h3>
The rules that must be observed are very simple.
<p>
First, physicians have to maintain responsibility for patient care. If the plan they belong to restricts their options in a way that materially affects the health of any patient, they have to protest that. They have to let the plan know that in this particular instance, the rules are inappropriate.
We realize, of course, that often these decisions will fall into grey areas, that sometimes they are marginal. Everyone has to accept that there has to be some sort of cost-benefit or risk-benefit analysis, but if that analysis errs too far on the side of restricting care or does something that a physician feels isn't right—something that would be of some danger to a patient—that doctor has to stand up and protest: be an advocate. 
<p>
Second, physicians have to be honest with their patients. If need be, they must inform them that there might be other treatment options that may not be available in their plan and help them to make arrangements to get care elsewhere if they want to. Again, that's the basic duty of a professional.
<p>
Third, if the plan has a drug formulary or any kind of medical policies, participating physicians in this plan must demand medical involvement in the decision making process. They should want to be represented on the pharmacy and therapeutics committee. In fact, each managed care company or delivery system should have a medical staff structure like that of hospitals. Let the building and the business side be run by administrators, but physicians have to have substantial responsibility for the shaping of medical policy. Hospitals, to get accredited, have to have a self-governing medical staff. The structure in HMOs doesn't have to be identical to the medical staff model, but there has to be a clear responsibility, a clear area of influence for the physicians who are practicing in that plan. Otherwise, physicians should not join.
<p>
The fourth principle is disclosure. Patients need to know. They have to know, from their doctors, everything about the plan that might affect their medical treatment. They need to know how the plan operates, about the care that is provided, how it is provided, the doctor's options, the limitations, the financial incentives that might restrict either the physician's judgment or restrict his or her freedom. There shouldn't be anything that might affect the patient that's not fully and clearly explained. 
<p>

<h3>Achieving the objectives</h3>
There is, of course, another side to this coin, and that is to protect physicians against retaliation if they try to protect their patients' rights. That's one of the reasons why AMA is fighting hard for patient protection legislation.
<p>
Many of the healthcare reform bills that competed in Congress last year included provisions which come from an act AMA drafted called the Patient Protection Act. It provides a mechanism for physicians to find out the criteria for participation in the various plans. We excluded group practices and small HMOs, but with regard to networks that are created by insurance companies, for example, we believe that physicians—and the public—have a right to know how they pick the doctors for their panels. Are they, for example, trying to find only physicians that fit a certain economic profile? If so, they need to be honest and clear about what the profile is, and they ought to give patients who belong to the plan the opportunity to stay with a physician whom they may have been with for many, many years and who may be the best physician for them. That can happen only if that physician has the opportunity to sign up—not the right, but at least the chance—if he or she meets the plan's criteria.
<p>
The legislation also provides for an appeal process for doctors who have been de-selected. Maybe a mistake was made, maybe the criteria were too arbitrary, maybe it was geographic, maybe this physician was de-selected because in the month in which someone was doing a practice profile he or she had a lot of very sick patients, making it appear as if this were an expensive doctor. There ought to be something a little more objective than an inaccessible black box somewhere in some manager's office that makes these determinations.
<p>
Incidentally, this is not an "any willing provider" provision, which would give doctors the right to join any panel they wished. We recognize that such a provision, if strictly enforced, would defeat the managed care principle; certainly you can't force such a provision on a group practice. Nothing we are asking for is anti-managed care. But we are asking for a balanced approach to managed care; one that will enable doctors to maintain their proper role as patient advocates.
<p>

<h3>Industry's stake</h3>
This is an effort which we very much hope will enlist the support of the healthcare industry. Take the issue of closed formularies. If a physician wants to prescribe a drug that is considered essential for the patient's health but which the plan does not reimburse, there should be some appeal process. 
<p>
It's really unethical not to allow the physician make the final judgment on what treatment is best for the patient. It certainly is unethical for the physician not to take ultimate responsibility for the selection of a particular drug—or for any other kind of treatment—for his or her patient. That doesn't mean that the physician can't be guided to practice within a formulary, but if there are pharmaceuticals that the doctor believes are better for the patient—that will make a material difference in the patient's well-being—that physician has got to be able to use that drug. If that fails, the doctor has the responsibility to fully advise the patient that there is a better alternative but that the plan won't pay for it, and to explain just what the difference is in regard to side effects or drug interactions or the patient's particular physical condition. The patient then has to make a judgment as to whether to incur the additional cost.
<p>
I hope it doesn't often come to those conflicts, that instead the doctor has an opportunity to participate in making formulary decisions and to obtain the necessary approvals for exceptions when necessary. I don't believe that, either as individuals or as a society, we are ready to accept rationing that denies patients important material benefits. Physicians can quite ethically live within certain restrictions, but if there is a conflict, their first obligation is to their patient, regardless of what the formulary says.
<p>

<h3>Easier said than followed</h3>
I fully realize that this is very easy to say but often very difficult to do. Unfortunately for today's physicians, however, that is their duty as professionals. What needs to happen is that they become more active in their plans. To do so effectively, they need to know more about pharmaceutical processes and costs. After all, there are only 10 to 15 drugs that an average physician uses regularly, so we're not talking about massive amounts of data. Obviously, this is where pharmaceutical companies can be of tremendous help by providing accurate, reliable information in readily accessible form. 
<p>
Nonetheless, there's no denying it can get complicated, especially as treatments get more complicated, but physicians cannot abdicate their responsibilities to an aggressive managed care administrator or a pharmaceutical benefit management clerk, even if it's a pharmacist. I think physicians need to be reminded of these responsibilities and they need to feel there is some support for them when they fight to maintain their patient advocacy role. 
<p>
In a sense, pharmaceutical manufacturers help to provide that support when they inform doctors about their products' benefits and characteristics. It would also be helpful to stand up to managed care organizations that are too aggressive about this issue and make them recognize that, yes, cost benefit judgments are necessary and important, but when they reach the point where they countermand choices only a physician can make, because only the physician knows this particular patient's situation first hand, then industry should take a firm stand both in dealing with the plan and in educating the public. 
<p>
Most formulary managers and therapeutic committees, especially if physicians are participants, realize that doctors must be permitted to have the last word. But not all. Some plans are looking for the easy way to save money. The original premise was that managed care would save money by providing better preventive care. Unfortunately, that's a long way off. Instead, the focus seems to be on reducing hospital stays and saving money on drugs, and without question there is room for savings. But, again, a balance has to be maintained. 
<p>

<h3>Personal perspectives</h3>
We're not at a point yet in this country where we're going to jeopardize the health of patients, and I don't believe our society will change the basic contract that makes physicians their patients' advocate. And while there is still room for greater efficiency in healthcare, we are in fact getting more efficient and good managed care is helping to achieve that. As a result, I believe that this country will soon have the most efficient healthcare delivery system in the world. 
<p>
People say we spend more on healthcare than other countries, but that's not inefficiency; that's because we have a higher standard of living. The fact is that the cost of care per capita in the United States is going down while it's going up elsewhere. The fact is that we spend more on all kinds of things in this country, and healthcare is a wonderful thing to spend money on. It means we're providing more comprehensive treatment, more technology—things people want. That's not waste. 
<p>
This growing efficiency is a reflection of the fact that for physicians today managing care appropriately has become a professional value. But efficiency is not the same as arbitrary cost cutting. No matter what reforms we wind up with, we will be spending a lot on healthcare. It will probably be well spent, because people in this country want good care. Indeed, they want the best care. I think that's the way it ought to be and that it's the way it will be.

<H2>1994 Medical/Surgical Ad Spending Review</H2>
</CENTER>

<HR>

<I>After a banner year in 1992, advertising in medical/surgical journals has declined steadily and fell below 1991 levels in 1994.</I>
<P>
Ad spending in medical/surgical publications climbed to a record level of $442 million in 1992, seeming to indicate a resumption of strong promotion after a relatively flat period. However, the tall at the end of 1993 showed a 19-percent decline to $357 million, a total that dropped another 10-percent to $323 million in 1994.
<P>
The tables included list the <A HREF="adspent1.jpg">25 most-advertised products</A>, the <A HREF="adspent2.jpg">25 largest advertisers</A>, and the <A HREF="adspent3.jpg">25 top product types</A>, ranked by the HCI Medical Promotion Audit™ (MPA), an audit that includes journal advertising revenue. Comparative data for 1992 and 1993 are included.
<P>
Nineteen-ninety-four was a quiet year for new products. There were six among the top 25, the same number as in 1993. However, looking at new products spending $2 million or more reveals a definite trend downwards. In 1992 there were 21 products in this category, with combined spending of $102 million. In 1993 this number had dropped to 1 products and a total of $48 million. In 1994 only seven new products spent $2 million or more, with products spent $2 million or more, with combined expenditures of $30 million.
<P>
Support for new indications played an important role for two products. Difulcan's spending increased 27 percent in support  of its new "vaginal yeast" indication, while expenditures for its existing indication remained level. The result of these combined campaigns pushed its ranking from 17th to eighth. Capoten's spending rose 346 percent, and its ranking soared from 112th to 24th, with support of its diabetic nephropathy indication.
<P>
After dropping to third place in 1993, Cardizem CD boosted spending eight percent to become the heaviest spender in '94; however, t spend 36 percent less than it did in 1992. Procardia XL, the most-advertised product in 1993, cut spending by 43 percent and dropped to sixth position.
<P>
Reviewing spending by company shows that Wyeth-Ayerst increased advertising budgets by 18.5 percent and moved into the number-one position in 1994, after being second in 1992 and 1993. Most of the increase was due to the launch of Effexor and increased promotion for Oruvail. Roerig, the largest advertiser in 1993, cut spending for Cardura and dropped to third spot. Miles Pharmaceuticals continued to move up the rankings. It climbed from 10th to fourth, with budgets up 11 percent, mainly due to increased support for Cipro.
<P>
Three other companies that moved up the rankings of top spenders were Jannsen, whose launch of Propulsid and Risperdal expanded ad outlays by 57.7 percent and moved the company to 11th position; Allen & Hanburys, with strong support of Serevent that virtually doubled spending and moved it up to 16th; and Key Pharmaceuticals, which increased advertising for Imdur and climbed to 28th after being 121st in 1992.
<P>
On the downside, Hoechst slashed spending by almost 84 percent and dropped from 24th to 72nd. Knoll cut back advertising for Isoptin SR, roughly halving total spending and reducing its rank to 39th, while Schering's reduced programs for Claritin cut its total ad budget by two-thirds, resulting in a drop from 19th to 37th.
<P>
Reviewing advertising patterns by product type reveals that calcium blocking agents continue to be the most heavily supported product class, accounting for almost 11 percent of all spending and four of the top 10 products—Cardizem CD, Norvasc, Procardia XL, and Adalat CC. While this is still the most-advertised product group, spending for these products has declined 45 percent since 1992. New product activity is responsible for most of the changes in the rankings, with Effexor, Zoloft, and Paxil lifting antidepressants to second place, Zovi and Famvir propelling systemic antivirals from 73rd to sixth, and Serevent's launch moving beta agonists to 22nd. Despite the introduction of Glucotrol XL, spending for oral diabetes products fell 52 percent, dropping this product group from 11th to 27th.

<H2>What is the WLF and Why is it challenging the FDA?</H2>
</center>

<H5><I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></H5>

<hr>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>The Chairman of the Washington Legal Foundation (WLF) talks about its history, programs, philosophy, and criticisms of FDA in an exclusive interview with MM&M.</I>
<P>
"Will Anybody Sue FDA?" asked the headline of a column by James Dickinson in the October 3, 1993, issue of Medical Marketing & Media. Dickinson pointed out that for years the FDA has been expanding its regulatory authority, beyond what legal observers considered its legislative mandate, unopposed by the pharmaceutical industry. Almost in answer to the question, a citizens' petition was filed that same month challenging the FDA's proposed CME guidelines by the Washington Legal Foundation (WLF)—an organization little known to the rank and file in the Rx industry. The WLF took issue with FDA restrictions on "truthful speech" on off-label indications for drugs and medical devices in CME programs, arguing that FDA's position was in violation of the First Amendment.
<P>
The WLF's petition was a bombshell at the FDA and to the health education firms, advertising agencies, publishing companies, medical organizations, and CME departments at manufacturers which, after wrestling with the FDA on the issue for two years, had assumed a workable compromise had been reached. In the face of the petition, FDA held up its final regulations, but chose not to respond to the WLF. When the statutory time limit for response to the citizens' petition had passed, the WLF took the next step and sued the FDA in June 1994 to block the regulations. The FDA then acknowledged the challenge by requesting additional comments on the regulations and, at the same time, going into court to have the WLF suit dismissed on technical grounds. Until now, notice of the WLF petition/suit had been confined to news items in the trade and business press and occasional squibs in the back pages of major newspapers. However, before dismissal of the suit came before a judge, the WLF was suddenly highly visible, with full-page ads in USA Today, The National Journal, Roll Call, The Wall Street Journal, and The New York Times, sharply critical of the FDA on much broader grounds than CME.
<P>
Over a photo of two gravestones ran the headline, "If a Murderer Kills You, It's Homicide. If a Drunk Driver Kills You, It's Manslaughter. If the FDA Kills You, It's Just Being Cautious." Body text asserted that FDA delays in approving drugs and medical devices had cost thousands of lives. The signature line was, "The Problem with Health Care in America is the FDA." A second ad was illustrated by a casket with the headline, "The FDA Can Delay Medications and Safety Devices for Years. Too Bad It Can't Delay the Consequences."
<P>
The advertising was attacked in a letter to the New York Times from the American Heart Association, and by syndicated columnist Anthony Lewis. Lewis found "the tone of the attacks on the FDA É uncommonly brutal" and termed WLF's claim of the number of lives lost by FDA delay "dubious." WLF responded with a statement defending the ads as providing the public with information "they were not getting from the FDA" and citing its "dubious" facts as originating with an American Heart Association spokesperson.
Out of nowhere, the Washington Legal Foundation had become a major player in the debate on FDA's regulatory practices. In discussing the CME suit and the WLF's advertising, many in the industry had questions about the source of these hard-hitting, anti-FDA actions. "Who are these people?" was a typical reaction.
<P>

<H3>MM&M makes a house call</H3>
To find out more about the WLF, I visited its headquarters in Washington in mid-February and talked with its chairman and general counsel, Daniel J. Popeo. The organization's home is a town house at 2009 Massachusetts Avenue N.W. off the DuPont Circle. Mr. Popeo picked me up in the downstairs reception, and as we proceeded upstairs to his office, he explained that the building, which WLF owns, had once been the home of Teddy Roosevelt's daughter Alice and her husband Nicholas Longworth, a noted Speaker of the House of Representatives (a Congressional office building is named for him).
<P>
The WLF is using what once must have been comfortable, refined suites as offices, reference libraries, conference rooms, and press briefing halls, complete with electronic hardware. However, the high ceilings, classic moldings, and graceful stone staircases remain, lending it a historic atmosphere.
<P>
Popeo showed me around the building with understandable pride, since he explained that he had founded the organization just seventeen years ago with "a hundred dollars worth of furniture."
<P>
 In his office, I asked him about the WLF, and he began with a formal definition—"a 501(C)(3) charitable on-profit organization," then went on to explain it is a "proÐfree enterprise, public-interest law and policy center." Adding color to the description, he concluded, "I like to think of us as a small business version of the American Civil Liberties Union. Only our stress is on economic civil liberties."
<P>
Essential to understanding the WLF, is that it is a legal organization. Its governing body is a "legal policy advisory board" of 55, comprised almost entirely of lawyers and judges and including legal academics from Harvard, Northwestern, Yale, and the Universities of Virginia, Chicago, and Indiana. Of its staff of 18 to 24 people (depending on work load), six are full-time lawyers.
<P>
Not surprisingly with such an array of legal talent, the WLF is immersed in litigation. It sends its legal staff and pro bono volunteers into court on a broad range of cases. Forty-eight firms donated professional services to the WLF in 1993, among them such prestigious names as Arnold & Porter, Covington & Burling, and Vinson & Elkins. In addition to the Litigation Division, the WLF program is rounded out by its Legal Studies Division, which publishes on legal matters in a number of formats from one- and two-page bulletins to comprehensive monographs.
<P>

<H3>The WLF in court and in print</H3>
A sampling of cases and regulatory proceedings that the WLF has recently participated in expresses its pro-business philosophy and the breadth of its activities. The WLF has supported the rights of home owners to display signs on private property, supported claims that permit fees imposed by a city for hotel conversion constitute compensatable taking of property, opposed efforts by environmental groups to limit logging in California's timber industry based on concerns for the spotted owl, supported the right of a Hispanic student to compete for an academic scholarship without regard to race, opposed damage awards based on fear of cancer, supported the rights of those injured by illegal lawyer solicitation to sue for damages, and supported regulations barring drug users from sensitive positions in nuclear power plants.
<P>
Some titles of recent WLF publications also reflect the group's range of interest: How to Survive an OSHA Inspection in Today's Regulatory Climate, More Openness Needed in EPA Violations of Paperwork Reduction Act, Balancing Endangered Species Regulations and Antitrust Law Concerns, and Supreme Court Decisions Reaffirm Need to Provide Commercial Speech Full Constitutional Protection.
<P>
The WLF is also concerned about the legal profession itself. Its SCALES (Stop the Collapse of America's Legal Ethics) project is aimed at "litigation [that] imposes monetary liability grossly disproportionate to any harm caused by a defendant's conduct." Accordingly, it is involved with contingency fees, attorney advertising, tort reform, frivolous litigation, and judicial ethics.
<P>
Overall, the WLF is dedicated to defending business against governmental regulation, but it also finds time for the rights of voters, taxpayers, and crime victims, federal sentencing policies, and the proper functioning of the legal system. The philosophy that melds these wide-ranging interests was stated by Popeo in the WLF's 1993 Annual Report: 
<P>
"Most of the problems we have in America today, from cost-prohibitive government regulation to unchecked violent crime, can be traced back to activist lawyering by well-entrenched organizations committed to promoting an agenda through court action, new regulation, and enforcement activity, and advocacy-educational campaigns."
<P>
I asked Popeo about the WLF's finances. He told me the annual budget is approximately $3,000,000 and that the money comes from over 500 companies and foundations and many individual contributors, with no concentration of support for any particular industry. He was emphatic that the WLF is not a spokesperson for the drug or medical devices industry, or for any sector of business. The WLF is ready to fight for any business against excessive governmental regulation. Greatly supplementing the work of its staff is the pro bono help it receives from the legal community—time and brainpower which increases its operational effectiveness many times beyond the basic $3,000,000 budget.


<H3>WLF's beginnings</H3>
The WLF opened its doors in September 1977, founded by Popeo, who had left a job as a federal trial lawyer to set up the organization. Popeo is a Georgetown law graduate who, after college, worked in the Nixon White House before moving to the Justice Department and there representing the government in court. What prompted leaving federal service and the creation of the WLF? "My last case for the government did it. I represented the Interior Department, and we closed down a one-man mining operation because there was no two-man stretcher or two-way radio in the shaft. That was just too much."
<P>
Had anything in his family background inclined him toward his pro-business philosophy? No, just the opposite, he said, describing himself as having a "working-class background."
<P>
I asked about a New York Times (February 12th) story linking the WLF by implication with an anti-FDA, conservative coalition ("FDA Becomes Target of Empowered Group"). The article singled out the Progress and Freedom Foundation (which funds Newt Gingrich's college video course), the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Citizens for a Sound Economy, and other "conservative advocacy groups" and displayed a WLF ad. It also highlighted the donations to conservative causes of the John M. Olin, David Koch, and Smith Richardson foundations. Popeo did not like being associated with any coalition or funding source and again emphasized that WLF's independence is assured by the breadth of its financial support. He thought the article was an example of a pro-FDA prejudice in the media. However, although lumped with a coalition he maintains he is not part of, he did not object to the use of the ad in the news story since, as he sees it, the message obtained additional exposure.
<P>

<H3>WLF vs. the FDA</H3>
Turning to the ads, I asked their objective. Popeo said they were intended to educate the American public, to call attention to the "abysmal" performance of the FDA. What about the shrill tone? That was needed to gain attention and "to raise the level of public discussion" on important issues. Commenting further, Popeo said, "We did not do these ads for the elite of the advertising industry or the healthcare business. We did them to reach the American public."
<P>
Budget for the campaign? "We do as much as we can where we can," he said.
<P>
Creative work on the ads was from Tim Kenney Design Partners, a full-service agency in Bethesda, Maryland. Popeo hints that the WLF provided the central themes. Proximity to Washington has gained advocacy campaigns for Kenny. In the past, it has worked for Common Cause and Green Peace, and lately the Republican Party on the Contract for America.
<P>
As to the response to the advertising, Popeo considers it successful. "We've struck a nerve," he says. "I've had mail bags of letters from ordinary citizens agreeing with us, and I've heard from some top health people, as well, who feel that their industry groups have been too polite to the FDA. We could be forcing some trade groups to be more aggressive." As for the criticisms? "Again, we hit a nerve," he says smiling, "one that was very tender for obvious reasons!"
<P>
I next asked Popeo about WLF's suit on FDA's CME regulations. A common question in the industry has been what had sparked the citizens' petition and the eventual court challenge? Popeo could not fix a crucial conversation or triggering event. As a partial explanation, he pointed out that the WLF has always monitored the FDA. Given the WLF's mission and its watchdog role on governmental regulation, the collision between FDA and the WLF on CME appears, to me, to have been inevitable. The CME guidelines were sure to appear on the WLF's radar screen, and given the organization's philosophy, an intercept becomes understandable.
<P>
On February 14, 1995, the case went before Judge Royce Lamberth, U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia. The FDA had contended that no regulations had been issued and that the WLF did not have proper standing to bring the suit and had asked that it be dismissed. Judge Lamberth ruled March 9, 1995, against dismissal, and the suit will now go to trial.
<P>

<H3>WLF and FDA reform</H3>
With the suit and the WLF's advertising in mind, I asked Popeo what changes he would like to see at FDA. Was he in the de-regulation camp that would dismantle the agency? His response was a clear no. "All I want is for the FDA to stop acting like a dysfunctional federal bureaucracy and do its job right."
<P>
The WLF has no proposals for FDA reform, and Popeo sees no need for structural change. He urges managerial changes, however, and is particularly incensed with what he calls FDA's "autocratic style." Dr. Kessler should change his regulatory philosophy, says Popeo. "He doesn't understand his function. He has the master/servant relationship mixed up. Look, he's making life-and-death decisions." Isn't that the FDA's job? I asked. "Yes, it is," said Popeo. "All we want is that what they do be openly examined and that they are held accountable for what they do. That the FDA holds some unquestionable expertise that places it above scrutiny is a powerful lie."
<P>
A key WLF executive and FDA critic, Alan Slobodin has moved to the Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives as counsel. Does the WLF plan to testify at anticipated oversight hearings on FDA? There will be a role for the WLF, says Popeo, in compiling a record on FDA and in presenting the facts it has collected from the public on FDA's performance.
<P>
From Popeo's statements and the activities of his organization, it is clear that the WLF is in tune with the Republican movement to reduce governmental regulation. Leaving no doubt as to his allegiance, Popeo, on the day of the interview, was wearing a red, white, and blue tie patterned with flag-draped GOP elephants. The WLF, although independent and with a long record of opposing big government, will, undoubtedly, be an active player in the antigovernment tide which has engulfed Washington since the November elections.
<P>
In the WLF, Kessler's FDA has met a formidable adversary. The organization is well-connected ideologically with the Republican majority in Congress and will speak out in the upcoming examination of the Agency. It is firm in its beliefs in a free enterprise system and skilled in antiregulation litigation to advance its beliefs. Regardless of the aggressive tone of its advertising, it is also experienced in advocacy campaigns, as evidenced by the splash it made with the ads which registered their message well beyond the amount of space purchased. The WLF knows the value of ads which are picked up by the media and generate additional PR for their sponsor.
<P>
Additionally, when the WLF suit comes to trial, the WLF will act as accuser of the FDA as an abuser of the Bill of Rights. Based on past performance, the FDA will undoubtedly try to paint pharmaceutical and devices promotion as so irresponsible and dangerous to public health that it has to keep the lid on. In the absence of another thalidomide tragedy, it will be hard for the FDA to make a credible case. In the process, however, the industry will experience some adverse publicity as past promotional mistakes are exposed yet again.
<P>
Popeo may not be aiming at drastic changes at FDA, but success of the WLF suit on CME may have greater impact than he anticipates. If the court rules against FDA on CME, its powers over other aspects of medical communication—including advertising and promotion—will be subject to further reinterpretation and challenge. It would not be the first time that the courts—consider civil rights and abortion, for example—have reshaped our institutions.

<H2>1994 Specialty Journal and Non-Journal Media Advertising Review</H2>
</center>

<hr>

Specialty journals bag mixed results, plus first figures for non-journal media
<P>
Who is the largest spender in journals? In nonjournal media? What are the leading non-journal media? Effective with this issue, HCI, Inc., is publishing this information from its Medical Promotion Audit™ (MPA) exclusively in Medical Marketing & Media.
<P>
<A HREF="adrevt1.jpg">Table One</A> lists the 25 largest advertisers in all types of media in 1994. Wyeth-Ayerst was the largest single advertiser overall, and in journals, but spent only about a quarter of its total in non-journal media. Marion Merrell Dow was by far the biggest spender on non-journal media, splitting its spending almost equally between journal and non-journal media. Among the top 12 advertisers, Lederle and Sandoz concentrated most heavily in journals, while MMD and Merck spent the largest percentages of their totals in non-journal media. Alone among the top 25, Cerenex spent more in non-journal media than journals, splitting its outlays 2:1 in favor of the former.
<P>
<A HREF="adrevt2.jpg">Table Two</a> lists the 25 most-advertised products in 1994, based on all spending. Cardizem CD ranked first overall and in journals, followed closely by Zoloft, which was the largest spender in non-journal media. Among the top 12, only Zoloft and Calan SR put the majority of their promotional dollars in non-journal media. Beyond the top dozen, Relafen, Imitrex, and Tylenol Extra-Strength followed suit by spending more dollars in non-journal than journal media. Zovirax was notable in spending nothing in non-journal media in 1994.
<P>
<A HREF="adrevt3.jpg">Table Three</a> lists the top 10 non-journal media according to HCI. Medical News Network garnered by far the most revenues. Grouped closely behind were Medi-Scripts RX Pads, Triple I Rx Pads, and American Medical Television. In a third tier were Medical Telelog/Teleguard and Formedic Patient Record Forms. Monthly Prescribing Reference and Physician's Weekly each captured more than two percent of all spending, followed by Compendium of Drug Therapy and Physicians' Marketplace with 1.6 and 1.2 percent, respectively.
<P>
For details on how HCI gathers data for the non-journal media section of MPA, readers should contact Robert A. Girondi, Senior Vice President of HCI, at 609 452-0211.
<P>

<H3>Specialty markets mixed</H3>
Three of the specialty areas audited by HCI registered increased activity in 1994, 16 percent for optometry journals, 14 percent for hospital management journals, and three percent for dental journals. Radiology journals saw revenues drop by 15 percent, while nursing titles experienced an eight percent decline, and both laboratory and ophthalmology spending fell by six percent. 
<P>

<H3>Dental: Spending rises slightly</H3>
Advertising support for dental products rose by three percent in 1994. HCI added two journals to its audit in 1994, Journal of Clinical Orthodontics and Dental and Managed Care News, and dropped two titles, The New Dentist and Functional Orthodontist. Expenditures in journals audited in both 1993 and 1994 rose by two percent.
<P>
Dentsply maintained its number one ranking with ad budgets that accounted for 6.6 percent of the total. Procter and Gamble slashed spending by more than 55 percent, eliminating advertising for Peridex, 1993's most-promoted product, and Crest Baking Soda, which was number six in 1993. Despite the heavy cuts, P&G remained the second-largest advertiser in dental journals. Colgate Palmolive returned to its former sixth-place rank based on heavy spending for Gelkam Fluoride Gel and the introduction of Platinum Tooth Whitening System. Overall, Colgate Palmolive dental advertising increased 41.7 percent. While that figure was impressive, Bisco, another top-10 company, boosted spending by 65.3 percent, promoting three new products, Aelitefil, All-Bond 2, and Bis-Core.
<P>
Fifteen of the top 25 companies increased spending in 1994 (see <A HREF="adrevt4.jpg">Table 4</a>), while 10 cut back. GC registered the largest increase, a healthy 382.5 percent, in support of the Orbit Light Curing System. Kerr, Henry Schein, and Jeneric/Pentron all dropped out of the top twelve with cuts of 35.1, 38.7, and 62 percent, respectively.
<P>
Crest Tartar Control toothpaste regained the number one spot among most-advertised products (see <A HREF="adrevt5.jpg">Table 5</a>), with a spending increase that topped 150 percent, with Listerine in second place. Only four of 1993's top twelve repeated in 1994, Listerine, Lynx F, Prisma Alloy, and G.U.M Toothbrush, while no new products showed up in the top dozen. After Crest, the biggest increases were made by the Braesseler Matching Drill and Post System (122.6 percent), Statim (67.7 percent), and Plax Dental Rinse (60.7 percent.) The deepest cuts were recorded for Pendex, Crest Baking Soda, and Cascade Chairs.
<P>

<H3>Hospital Management: Healthy growth in advertising</H3>
HCI's audit of Hospital Management publications recorded a healthy 14 percent increase in advertising in 1994, second only to the optometry field. As the list of journals tracked did not change between 1993 and 1994, this growth was real, not the result of a broader audit.
<P>
Hill-Rom Hillenbrandt Industry, the number one company, increased advertising support for its Hill-Rom Services by almost 300 percent, making it the most-advertised product/service. Hewlett Packard, 1993's largest advertiser, cut ad spending by 70 percent and dropped to 39th. Six of 1993's top dozen advertisers repeated, Hill-Rom Hillenbrandt (1st), Kodak (2nd), Marion Merrell Dow (7th), Zeneca Group (8th), HBO & Co., (10th), and Sherwood Medical (12th).
<P>
The biggest spending increase among leading companies was recorded by Lederle Laboratories at 377.7 percent (see <A HREF="adrevt6.jpg">Table 6</a>), primarily as a result of heavy promotion for Verelan. 3M Healthcare increased its advertising by 123 percent to move it into fourth place; Owen Healthcare boosted budgets by 168.5 percent to capture ninth place; and Coastal Physician ended the year in 11th position with a 115 percent increase in advertising. The Greenwood Trust Company spent well over three thousand percent more to advertise its Discover Card and jumped from 727th to 17th place.
<P>
There were a lot of changes in the list of leading products and services in hospital management journals (see <A HREF="adrevt7.jpg">Table 7</a>). None of 1992's top 15 made the list in 1994, and only four of 1993's top 15 repeated in 1994: Zeneca Group (3rd), Servicemaster Management (5th), Emcare (6th), and Marion Merrell Dow Corporate (8th.) There were only two new products among the 15 most-advertised, Portfolio Director (10th), and Source Data (15th.) In fact, there was limited new product activity with only five new products in the top 25 and 17 in the top 50. The volatility in the rankings was due to budget changes for existing products. As noted, major increases in spending were recorded for Greenwood Trust's Discover Card, Verelan, and Hill-Rom Products. Zovi also registered a major increase of 895.2 percent, as did Central Health Services at 254.5 percent. On the negative side, the products with the largest cutbacks were SDS/Infinet Software at 98.1 percent, Ulticare Single Patient Data System at 84.1 percent, GE Medical Systems at (82.7 percent, and Hewlett Packard at 73.3 percent).
<P>

<H3>Laboratory: Advertising is off</H3>
Spending in the journals tracked by HCI dropped six percent in 1994. As no journals were added or dropped from the list tracked, this figure represents the cutback in spending among advertisers in this field.
<P>
Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics consolidated its hold on first place by increasing advertising 38.7 percent to account for almost six percent of total spending. Miles Diagnostics had a 46.5 percent increase to move into a distant second place. Syva boosted ad budgets 718.8 percent and moved up 64 places to sixth. The next largest increase in the top 15 companies were 14th-place Biomerieux Vitek at 61. percent and 15th-place Coulter at 64.6 percent. (see <A HREF="adrevt8.jpg">Table 8</a>)
<P>
Baxter Healthcare eliminated all advertising support for its products in laboratory journals. Otherwise, the largest declines were 56.4 percent for Roche Diagnostics, which dropped from third to 13th, and 53.2 percent for Abbott Diagnostics, which declined from sixth to 16th.
<P>
Change is the way to describe the product rankings. Only four 1994's top 15, and 18 of its top 50 products were advertised in 1992. One of 1992's top 15, Dimension AR, and five of 1993's repeated in 1994: B-Max Microscopy Systems, Cxpress Laboratory Approach Test System, Dimension AR, Axsym Immuno Analyzer, and ACA. Of the six new products in the top 15 the highest ranked was Cardiac T Assay in third place, followed by Kodak's Ektachrome 950/RC Analyzer in sixth.
<P>
Many of 1993's most-promoted products experienced severe cutbacks. (see <A HREF="adrevt9.jpg">Table 9</a>)
Venoject 2, 14th in 1993, had no advertising in 1994. Spending for the ACS:
180 System was cut 73.2 percent, dropping it from first in 1993 to 30th in 1994, but this was offset by support for its successor, ACS:180+. Olympus EW-10 Cleaning/Disinfectant System advertising was slashed 90 percent, moving it from second to 163rd, while Kodak's Ekta Chem OTGO Analyzers dropped from fourth to 66th due to a 75.3 percent spending cut.
<P>

<H3>Nursing: Another year of reduced spending</H3>
HCI added the American Journal of Critical Care to its nursing publication audit for 1994, and dropped The American Nurse. Advertising in these publications declined eight percent, nine percent if the American Journal of Critical Care is not counted.
<P>
Advertising in nursing journals is dominated by recruitment ads, particularly those for local recruitment. At present, recruitment advertising accounts for 33 percent of total advertising in nursing journals, down from 48.7 percent in 1992. This decline is the reason for the shrinkage in revenues for nursing journals.
<P>
The top four companies were stable from 1992 through 1994. The greatest increase in spending was for Professional Nurses Organization, a liability insurance company, which rose from 113th in 1992 to sixth in 1994. 3M Healthcare, Calgon, Roerig, and Pfizer all increased advertising support of their products significantly. (see <A HREF="adrevt10.jpg">Table 10</a>)
<P>
Of the top 15 products and services, 10 are recruitment. The top two non- recruitment advertisers are insurance, nurse insurance and professional liability. The most-advertised product is Genius Thermometer, in 11th position, up from 20th in 1993. (see <A HREF="adrevt11.jpg">Table 11</a>)
<P>

<H3>Ophthalmology: Spending Slides</H3>
Advertising in ophthalmology journals declined six percent in 1994. HCI added the Review of Ophthalmology to the list of journals it tracks in this field. If its revenues are excluded, spending fell by 14 percent. The ophthalmology market is stable at the company level. Of the 15 top companies in 1994, 11 were in the top 15 in 1992 and 12 in 1993. (see <A HREF="adrevt12.jpg">Table 12</a>)
<P>
The biggest factor in the Alcon Laboratories 87.7 percent increase in spending, and rise to first place, was the launch of Alomide. Similarly, increased support for Ocupress was the principal reason Otsuka America Pharmaceuticals advertising outlays grew by 105.1 percent, moving it up from 14th position to seventh. Coherent Medical Group boosted advertising by 102.6 percent to move up to 13th position. On the downside, Association Seminars  spending fell by 72.1 percent, while Chiron Intraoptics slashed 78.6 percent from advertising outlays and dropped from 10th to 35th place.
<P>
Ophthalmic solutions dominated the product rankings, filling the top five positions, and seven of the top nine. Oculflox Solution ranked first, with 4.43 percent of all dollars spent. It was launched in 1993, and increased outlays by 310.4 percent in 1994. Alomide ranked second, with 3.21 percent of all advertising. Major spending increases were recorded by 15th-place Microseal (752.8 percent), sixth-place Healon (157.9 percent), 10th-place Ocucoat (126.4 percent), and 14th-place Ezvue Lenses (105.3 percent). There were only two new products in the top 25, Alomide Solution in second place and Livostin Solution in ninth. On the downside, the only product in the top 15 with reduced spending was Volten Ophthalmic, down 3.3 percent. Pred Forte Solution, fourth in 1993, did not advertise at all in 1994. (see <A HREF="adrevt13.jpg">Table 13</a>)
<P>

<H3>Optometry: Advertising continues to grow</H3>
HCI added three new journals to its optometry audit in 1994, Eyewear comes of Age, Frame Buyer, and Lenses & Technology. Excluding revenues for those three, spending grew by 10 percent in 1994. When their revenue is included, that figure grows to 16 percent.
<P>
Not surprisingly, the optometry market is dominated by frame advertising, which tends to be volatile. This category accounted for five of the top 12 products, including four of the top six. Support for frames as a product class grew by 29 percent. The lens and ophthalmic supply companies, such as Varilux, Brain Power, and Bausch & Lomb, tend to be more stable. Having noted this, the top four companies in 1994 were the same as in 1993, but only first-pace Marchon held the same rank. The greatest growth was recorded by eighth-place Allergan at 140.4 percent, much of it centered on support for its "Complete" Lens Care line, while Signet Armorlite boosted spending 122.7 percent in support of Kodak lenses. Four companies dropped out of the top 12, including Viva Optique, which slashed spending almost 80 percent to drop from ninth to 91st. (see <A HREF="adrevt14.jpg">Table 14</a>)
<P>
Looking at the ranking of most-advertised products and services (see <A HREF="adrevt15.jpg">Table 15</a>), lenses dominated with seven of the top 12. The volatility of advertising in these journals is apparent in the fact that only one of 1992's top 12 products, Varilux, remains in that group in 1994. Varilux has been the largest advertiser in all three years. Of 1993's top 12, only Varilux, Hart Specialty Frames, Sola's Single-Vision lenses, and Calvin Klein Eyewear repeated in 1994. There were five new products among the top 12, and two introduced in 1993, Kenmark Frames and Renu Multi-Purpose Solution.
<P>

<H3>Pharmacy: Little change in</H3> '94
HCI added four journals to its pharmacy audit in 1994, Supermarket Pharmacy, Pharmaco Therapy, Managed Care Pharmacy Practice, and Continuing Long-Term Care Pharmacy. Two journals were dropped from the audit, Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Pharmacy Business. Advertising was flat in 1994 (see <A HREF="adrevt16.jpg">Table 16</a>). If the new journals are excluded, spending fell by one percent.
<P>
Wyeth-Ayerst held onto the top position despite reducing advertising in pharmacy journals by 17.8 percent. This year most of the advertising was product support rather than corporate campaigns. Effexor, Cardene IV, and Stuart Natal Vitamins were advertised for the first time. Amgen, last years' number two advertiser, cut spending by 44 percent with less support for Epogen and Neupogen, and dropped to eighth. There were several companies that cut back heavily, lead by Warner Wellcome at 83.4 percent, and Parke Davis at 65.7 percent. After boosting spending by 223.3 percent in 1993, West Point cut back 52.1 percent in 1994, dropping it from 14th to 51st. Mc Neil Consumer Products ceased advertising Imodium A-D and dropped from 5th to 16th with outlays almost 54 percent below 1993's level.
<P>
On the positive side, Burroughs Wellcome spent nearly $1million on Zovirax, and climbed 16 positions to second. Janssen rose from 49th to sixth with strong support for Propulsid and Risperdal. Allen & Hanburys' launch of Serevent helped it rise from 76th to 15th, while the largest increase was registered by Syntex, 1,267.8 percent, as it pumped money into promotion of Aleve.
<P>
The product rankings are very fluid. Zovirax topped the list, accounting for 1.87 percent of all spending. Premarin, number one in 1993, cut advertising by 67.5 percent and dropped to 23rd. Neupogen, number two in 1993, cut back 58.7 percent. Only five of 1993's top 12 remained in that list in 1994, Zovirax, Procardia XL, Adalat CC, Verelan, and Epogen. Four new products made the list, lead by Risperdal in fourth.(see <A HREF="adrevt17.jpg">Table 17</a>)
<P>

<H3>Radiology: Another weak year</H3>
HCI added one journal to its radiology audit in 1994, Academic Radiology, and ceased tracking four, The Radiology Resident, Seminars in Interventional Radiology, Neuroradiology, and Seminars in Roentgenology. Radiology journals saw another weak year, with advertising down 15 percent.
<P>
Siemens Medical Systems rose from third place to first, despite cutting ad spending 22.9 percent. Nycomed dropped to second as a result of a 58.2 percent reduction in outlays. Interestingly, nine of 1994's top 15 companies were in the top 15 in 1992, but only seven were in 1993's. The three 1992 companies that dropped out and returned were GE Medical Systems, Dupont RadioPharmaceuticals, and Elscint. The companies that moved up strongly were Toshiba, up 96.3 percent to third; GE Medical Systems, up 57.3 percent to eighth; Acuson, up 72.5 percent to ninth; 3M Healthcare, up 246.3 percent to 11th. Among those who cut spending heavily were Fischer Imaging Group (78.6 percent), Berlex Imaging (77.8 percent), and Syva (62.2 percent). (see <A HREF="adrevt18.jpg">Table 18</a>)
<P>
This is another category with a lot of turnover in leading products (see <A HREF="adrevt19.jpg">Table 19</a>). Of the top 15 products in 1994, only three were advertised in 1992. Of the top 50, only 12 were advertised in 1992. Three products/services were first advertised in 1994.
<P>
The biggest spending increases were for Hitachi Ultrasonic Transmission media, up 1,712.7 percent to fifth; 3M Healthcare's Image Management System, up 1,012.6 percent to 13th; Unitone and Varitone Image Printers, up 256.3 percent to 14th; and 3M Healthcare's Laserimage, up 152.2 percent to 15th.
<P>
Fischer cut advertising for its Mammovision Imaging and Mammotest Biopsy System by 93.3 percent, dropping it from 16th to below 200th. Mallinckrodt stopped its Multi-Product Campaign, which ranked 13th in 1992. Hitachi stopped advertising its MRI System in March. Fuji Medical cut advertising for the DRC Imaging System 76 percent. Magnevist, the most-advertised product in 1993, spent 75.3 percent less in 1994 and dropped to eighth, while Omniscan Injection cut 79.8 percent from its budget to drop from second to 16th.
<P>

<H3>The Leading Medical/Surgical Journals in 1994</H3>
Due to delays in verifying data, we were not able to include a listing of leading publications in our March advertising review of the medical/surgical market, so we are providing them in this issue.
<P>
<A HREF="adrevt20.jpg">Table 20</a> lists the top 50 medical/surgical publications based on projected billings, according to HCI's Medical Promotion Audit (MPA). As with the data presented in our September midyear review, split-run editions have been combined with the full-run totals.
<P>
Information for each publication includes rank and share of market for 1994, 1993, and 1992, and the percent change in revenue from 1993 to 1994 and 1992 to 1993.
<P>
Medical Economics informed us at press time that its figures do not include $1,819,450 for its General and Orthopedic Surgery editions which were converted to demographic status in late 1994.

<H2>Gaining Acceptance for Innovative New Products</H2>
</CENTER>

<H5><I>by Jacob Drapkin</I></H5>

<HR>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>Managed care organizations are apt to say no to new products that are higher priced than what they're now using. Even if you can make a case that your product will improve patient outcome—and hence improve long-term cost effectiveness—MCOs may be unwilling to assume the risk. The author describes one way to overcome this hurdle: implementing an Outcome Guarantee Program.</I>
<P>
Within today's ever-changing healthcare landscape, there is no greater challenge than selling an expensive new product with a limited clinical track record to the managed care market.
<P>
Even if improved patient outcome offers a good chance that your product will improve long-run cost effectiveness, the purchasers for the managed care organizations may be unwilling to run the risk. One way to overcome this hurdle is for you, the manufacturer, to say: we will share the risk...in effect, to offer a money-back guarantee. A more dignified term is Outcome Guarantee Program. Ortho Biotech was one of the pioneers in exploring this approach.
<P>

<H3>How the program works</H3>
Outcome Guarantee Programs create a true partnership and benefit-sharing environment. The programs stipulate that if a specified product or procedure is used appropriately, the manufacturer will offer a guarantee on its performance. (<A HREF="acceptc1.jpg">Chart 1</A>) If the product or procedure does not meet the agreed-upon therapeutic expectations, the manufacturer will replace it with no charge. Some manufacturers are even looking at the possibility of paying for the alternative approaches that would be used if their product does not meet the therapeutic expectations. 
<P>

<H3>An Evolving Capitated Marketplace</H3>
Such programs are usually implemented with products that are not only high in cost but are utilized in smaller populations, such as growth factors in the case of biologics. Obviously, appropriate use plays a key role in making the programs work, since outcome is based on the product's performance, and without agreed-upon appropriate use, the manufacturer could not guarantee it.
<P>
An example of this approach is the Efficacy Guarantee Program1 for PROCRIT¨ (Epoetin alfa), the Ortho Biotech Inc. brand of recombinant erythropoietin. If a patient receives PROCRIT therapy according to appropriate use guidelines but does not respond to treatment, Ortho Biotech replaces PROCRIT free of charge to an MCO or other payer or institution. Thus Ortho Biotech limits the risk that might otherwise deter the MCO from utilizing such a new therapy.
<P>
Development of outcome guarantee programs requires a multidisciplinary approach which involves the managed care entity, provider, and manufacturer. The following steps provide a good template to follow if you decide an Outcome Guarantee Program is appropriate for one of your products.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Understand your product	
<LI>Define the guarantee	
<LI>Develop appropriate use guidelines
<LI>Collect data	
<LI>Seek partnerships—commitment and pull through	
<LI>Assess the risk
<LI>Reinsure
</UL>
	
Let's take a closer look at each of the steps noted above.
<P>
Understand your product In order to decide on the most appropriate approach for your product, you will need input from different disciplines (marketing, sales, and medical) so as to identify where your product is most effective. After all, the guarantee must complement the product's overall marketing strategy, and in some cases, the sales strategy may need to be modified to support the objective of the guarantee program.
<P>
Define the guarantee It is important to fully understand the clinical trials and phase IV studies to define the guarantee. It is equally important to understand that you are analyzing efficacy data and not effectiveness. Efficacy data are the clinical results under controlled scenarios (clinical trials), whereas effectiveness data are a “eal-world” reflection of the use of a product. Obviously, effectiveness data may not exist at the time of FDA approval or for some time thereafter. Retrospective analyses of third-party insurance claims can help you understand potential risks which may be associated with an Outcome Guarantee Program. 
<P>
Claims data will also provide information about how the alternatives to your product are being utilized. Such an analysis will help you to develop risk assessments of alternate scenarios, so you can make a decision as to whether to guarantee only replacement of your product if it fails to meet expectations, or whether you will pay for the alternative therapy. 
<P>
Develop appropriate guidelines Work with your own medical team, as well as with physicians in the medical community and professional societies, in the development of appropriate use guidelines. The guidelines should cover disease states that have clear clinical boundaries, and should include
<P>

<UL>
<LI>identifying the appropriate patient (lab tests and results using specific parameters)
<LI>proper dosing to achieve therapeutic expectations
<LI>dose titration to achieve therapeutic expectations
<LI>defining the therapeutic response and outliers
</UL>

The guidelines cannot be outside of your FDA-approved Full Prescribing Information.
<P>
Collect data Next, you need to develop a system to monitor the outcomes associated with these guidelines. The data captured should demonstrate that following these guidelines helps make your product more efficient. You may also want to capture other data to demonstrate the value of your product (i.e., as an alternative to surgery or invasive procedures, fewer/shorter hospitalizations, decreased work loss, or any other reductions in healthcare spending). These programs create an ongoing outcomes data base to demonstrate your product's value.
<P>
Issues to be resolved are the means of verifying that the guidelines have been followed, and what the data reporting requirements will be. The provider and payer should be included in the development of these parameters.
<P>
Seek partnerships Partnership is the new buzz-word, but it truly is basic to successful Outcome Guarantee Programs. To succeed, pharmaceutical manufacturers/distributors and managed care organizations will need to seek each other out and work together as partners.
<P>
Finding an appropriate partner will not be easy (see <A HREF="acceptt1.jpg">Table 1</A>), and there will be growing pains. 
<P>
It is important that the objectives and goals of the organizations be aligned when you are seeking a partner. The manufacturer, of course, expects preferred formulary status and coverage as a benefit of the program. It is essential, therefore, to seek partners who control the use of the product/therapy and are motivated to create change. Equally basic is that the partners must be willing to work together and share the risks, and that they be willing to invest the appropriate resources in each other so they can both achieve success.
<P>
Assess the risk Using retrospective claims as data bases may help you understand some of the risk. It may be important to segment the patient populations into various risk pools associated with outcome guarantee guidelines.
<P>
Flexibility needs to be built into the partnership so a win-win program can be developed. As previously explained, most of the data used to create the initial guidelines will be efficacy data, and the guidelines may need to be modified as effectiveness experience is gained. The data collected from the monitoring system can also help modify the guidelines and offer a quality assurance check.
<P>
Developing pilot programs in selected environments may allow you to assess risk and modify your programs appropriately before they are launched.
<P>
Reinsure Shared-risk programs can be considered insurance since you are offering a guarantee tied to the performance of a product. Most manufacturers are well capitalized to assume the risk. However, you should also give consideration to a stop-loss arrangement, such as reinsurance, in order to cover unanticipated risks.
<P>

<H3>Challenges</H3>
There are many challenges that need to be met in order to make outcomes guarantee/benefit sharing programs successful. The biggest challenges (see <A HREF="acceptt2.jpg">Table 2</A>) will be the pull through of these programs, which will include the sharing of data, the implementation of appropriate utilization and incentives.
<P>			
The sharing of data will help modify the appropriate use pathways and continue to add a quality check to the program, and the audit verification procedure needs to be suitable to all parties involved. 
<P>
Traditional marketing incentives encourage the manufacturer to sell a maximum number of units. This will need to change, and the sales force must be given incentive to sell appropriate use, even if it means fewer units. The incentive aspect is also important for those who control the use of a product. Physician incentives under fee-for-service are to increase utilization. Under outcomes guarantee/benefit sharing programs, the rewards must again be linked to appropriate use, and possibly lower utilization.
<P>

<H3>Summary</H3>
While outcome guarantee/benefit sharing programs are most effective under a managed care or institutional setting, they will succeed only if there are individuals within the organization to champion them. They require strategic partnerships throughout the supply chain, and that means that all participants must focus on aligned objectives. 
<P>
If these criteria are met, Outcome Guarantee Programs
<P>

<UL>
<LI>create partnerships
<LI>ensure that providers and payers get value
<LI>reduce reluctance to use new products
<LI>signal the manufacturers' commitment to the quality and value of their product
</UL>

These programs involve many steps and are admittedly complex. But in today's environment, they may be the only way a new and more costly product can penetrate the managed care market. In addition, they are a component of disease management and offer increased quality of care for the MCO patients.

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>In the last six months, pharmaceutical stocks have staged a handsome recovery. Some analysts see this as a hopeful sign that the industry, severely buffeted by price erosion, has turned a critical corner. MM&M's market observer is less hopeful. He thinks external factors made the stock go up and cites the role of HMOs, PBMs, and Medicaid as generating continued pricing pressure—with physician cost-consciousness and therapeutic substitution as additional sources of worry.</I>
<P>
Since August 1994, there has been a very impressive rally in the stock of pharmaceutical companies. That should be good news.
<P>
There is, however, a big controversy in the financial community as to what is driving this rally. There are some who say it reflects a fundamental improvement in the expected profit performance of Rx drug manufacturers. Others disagree. They look at the pressures of worldwide cost- containment É the increasing growth of health maintenance organizations (HMOs) and pharmacy benefit management companies (PBMs) – the increasing demand for discounts by all bulk purchasers, and see continued tough times ahead.
<P>
Frankly, I'm one of the bears. I think that we are still in the early innings of these negative trends and the resultant price erosion.
<P>
That raises two questions: what is making the stocks go up? And what is the evidence for my continued pessimism? By way of answers, let's take industry's temperature as we head into the second quarter of 1995.
<P>

<H3>Why stocks are going up</H3>
The stock rally started in the third quarter of 1994 when American Home Products bought American Cyanamid. (See <A HREF="drugfig1.jpg">Figure 1</A>) It was the hope of investors to make money on continued horizontal consolidation. Another, though less important, factor was the official death of Clinton's healthcare proposals. Even though most of us had already concluded that radical healthcare reform wasn't going to happen, or if it did, that it wasn't going to be particularly onerous for our industry, the stock market still staged a little celebration. The third reason why drug stocks are doing well has little to do with our industry. It reflects how large portfolio managers managed their money. As they became bearish on cyclical stocks in light of their concerns about a slowing economy, they needed counter-cyclical stocks to invest in.
<P>
None of these three factors, it is obvious, has anything to do with the operational realities of the pharmaceutical industry. There was, however, a fourth factor that did reflect reality and that was that the onslaught of bad news seemed to have ended and the collapse of earnings growth bottomed out. Indeed, earnings expectations for 1995, as compared with those of 1994, have modestly improved. 
<P>
The investment controversy lies in deciphering the underlying implications of this modest earnings improvement. The optimists say, with a sigh of relief: the industry has dodged this bullet. They've adjusted to managed care, they're cutting costs, and everything is going to be okay. 
<P>

<H3>A look at the earnings pickup</H3>
That's where I disagree. If you pick apart the basis of the current earnings growth and analyze whether it can be maintained, I think there's reason for concern. One of the major reasons for the improvement of current earnings is that compared with the brutal increase in tax rates in 1994, the jump in 1995 is relatively modest. Last year, industry lost 40 percent of the Puerto Rico " 936" tax credit. This year and for the next three years we'll lose another five percent per year, for a total 60-percent cut. That's still painful, but compared to a 40-percent slash in a single year, it obviously means less impact on earnings. 
<P>
Another reason for this year's improvement is the weakness of the dollar, so that U. S. companies are making more money on their foreign operations. 
<P>
Since these improvements have nothing to do with the pricing environment that's been the source of our troubles, you have to ask yourself whether we have seen the worst in terms of pricing pressure and, closely related to that, whether the risk of therapeutic substitution is real or not. 
<P>
Let's take a look at pricing pressure first.
<P>
Any hope that pricing power will return to the industry is highly unrealistic. Last year, when industry was so concerned about government control of prices, most companies made a promise that they would keep prices within a certain range, generally not to exceed the increase in the cost of living by more than one or two percent. By and large they have kept that promise and are still keeping it. Incidentally, as a result of this and other public relations efforts, industry has done a phenomenal job of improving its standing in Washington and with the public.
<P>
But just as last year, when I felt that the greatest risk wasn't <A HREF="drug2.html">what government would do</A> but what managed care was doing (see MM&M, August 1994), so this year, I think it's inevitable that the continued growth of managed care will continue to have a negative impact on prices.
<P>

<H3>Sources of industry pain</H3>
There are three different managers of pharmacy benefits that affect industry's fate: HMOs, PBMs, and Medicaid. All of them are growing and all three are getting tougher concerning what they spend on drugs, what drugs are allowed, and what discounts they require. The only good news is that the Medicaid requirement that companies must give even more than the required 15-percent discount if they offer a better price to any other customer has created a discounting floor. Rarely will drug companies offer discounts below 15 percent, since they would have to offer that price break to Medicaid as well, and Medicaid accounts for about 15 percent of the market. 
<P>
There is a fourth source of bad news. Even the fee-for-service doctor, who used to be indifferent about price, isn't so indifferent any more. Two recent cases document this conclusion. The first is the success Sandoz has scored with Lescol, a cholesterol-lowering agent in the same therapeutic class as Merck's Mevacor and Zocor and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Pravachol. 
<P>
At the FDA-approved dosing levels, Lescol doesn't lower LDL cholesterol quite as much as its competitors. When Sandoz introduced it at a 50-percent discount compared with the competitive agents, Lescol—despite its weaker clinical profile—gained market share faster than any other late-entry, me-too product in recent history. Currently it commands 13 percent. The significant point is that this success derives primarily from the fee-for-service setting—not managed care. That can mean only one thing: the average American doctor in private practice has become more price conscious. After all they've heard and read about Rx prices, when a sales rep now comes to visit and says, " By the way, doctor, this costs 50 percent less," that works. Add to that the spill-over effect. If a physician in private practice is also connected with an HMO and has to be constantly aware of its formulary, there's a big risk that he may adopt that formulary even for his fee-for-service patients. 
<P>
Both Merck and Bristol are fighting Lescol (as well as one another) with some very interesting data that their products can lower mortality, can reduce atherosclerotic plaque—claims Sandoz can't make because they haven't done the clinicals. In the good old days, such data would have been decisive, but in these price-conscious days they don't seem to be working, or at least not nearly as well. However, this battle is still just heating up.
<P>
The other weather-vane example is the market history of Pfizer's Zithromax. It is one of the new class of macrolide antibiotics, competing primarily with Abbott's blockbuster Biaxin. The primary advantage of Zithromax is its considerably improved dosing convenience: once a day for five days, compared with twice daily for seven to 14 days for Biaxin, and even more for other competitors. 
<P>
Zithromax was launched with a course-of-therapy price comparable to its major competitors', such as Biaxin. But because the standard prescription called for only six pills, the price of $10 per pill seemed extremely high to the consumer. Pfizer worked hard to educate doctors about its comparability on a total regimen basis, but nonetheless they flattened out at about a 25-percent share of prescriptions. Pfizer management clearly viewed that as unsatisfactory, so last November they took a 26-percent price decrease. It worked. Ever since, their market share has been growing aggressively. By January—in almost no time at all—their share of prescriptions was up to 30 percent. And price was the only major variable.
<P>
I think those two examples demonstrate that price works as part of the marketing mix, even in the private practice sector.   That raises the question: how will new products be priced? And, in turn, how will their competitors respond? The answers seem inescapable, and one of the reasons I'm so concerned about this industry is that this pattern presents a very basic macroeconomic argument that price erosion will not only continue but may very well accelerate. 
<P>

<H3>The threat of therapeutic substitution</H3>
In a previous article in this series (see MM&M, August 1994), I pointed out that the fate of Zantac after Tagamet went generic would be a bellwether index of how real the threat of therapeutic substitution was going to be. We all had learned that once a giant product such as Tagamet goes generic, its profitability goes rapidly down the tubes. What no one could predict was whether the sales of a still-patented competitor in the same therapeutic class would also get hurt. In other words, would the HMOs and PBMs try to influence doctors to prescribe less expensive generic Tagamet in place of therapeutically but not chemically equivalent and still patent-protected Zantac? It was a risk that scared the heck out of Wall Street and contributed to the big decline in drug stocks through mid-'94.
<P>
In the event, the damage to Zantac has not been nearly as severe as many had expected. Its prescription volume stayed essentially flat during the course of the year. That's the good news but there's a but: the revenue picture isn't nearly as good. What Glaxo was able to hold onto in unit volume came at the expense of price. Early in February, they reported the Zantac 1994 U. S. sales results, and here is an analysis that shows why the raw figures are deceiving:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Unit volume was up one percent. (All these percentages are rounded off.)
<LI>List price was increased by 4.5 percent. 
<LI>Reported sales, however, were down four percent.
<LI>It follows that discounts off list price were increased by nine to 10 percent.
<LI>And since only between 40 to 50 percent of Zantac is sold via contracts to the MCO marketplace, it appears that Zantac discounts to the managed care market were increased by 20-plus percent. 
</UL>

In other words, while Glaxo didn't have to match the price of generic Tagamet, they were not totally immune. And while the optimists are cheering because therapeutic substitution didn't happen, I come to a more discouraging conclusion: yes, you can fight off substitution, but it will cost you.
<P>
There also is a bright side: apparently the managed care segment of the market is still not sufficiently powerful to be able to put over wholesale therapeutic substitution. Staff-model and other tightly controlled HMOs and some PBMs are doing it, but you can bet that all the others are trying to learn how they can do it, too. After all, controlling doctors' behavior is what managed care is all about—not only as far as prescribing goes, but in all their clinical decisions. As the inevitable growth of managed care plans continues, therapeutic substitution will become more important in the overall market.
<P>
Another critical issue is the future breadth and depth of discounting. The first steps into discounting are the hardest—and the good news, I suppose, is that those steps are behind us. When a company goes from no discounts to discounting half or more of its products, even if it's only five or ten percent, that hurts a lot. By now there are virtually no companies left that still have a no-discounting policy. But still to be seen is how long and how severe the squeeze will be from here on. If it's five percent this year, will it be ten next year? Or 15? Or " only" seven? And if it covers 40 percent of a company's market this year, what percent will it be next year? My crystal ball doesn't have the answers—and I'm kind of glad it doesn't.
<P>

<H3>The long-term outlook</H3>
In the short run, as I have indicated, the outlook remains bleak. We are still at a stage where a large portion of many companies' profits come from blockbuster me-too products. These are the companies that are most vulnerable since, until that excess is wrung out of the system, continued profit erosion is likely. 
<P>
The products most at risk are those which are viewed by prescribers as the least differentiated clinically, and therefore the most substitutable. The other risk factor is how much is spent on the category: the higher the impact on MCO budgets, the more aggressively they will be managed and the greater the vulnerability. (See <A HREF="drugfig2.jpg">Figure 2</A>) 
<P>
Down the road, things look more hopeful. The marketplace will always reward different and better drugs. As industry's continued R&D effort pays off, therefore, there will be a more normal and a higher rate of growth—not as good as the panacea days, but a lot better than what we are witnessing today. The big question is how long it will take and who will be left to enjoy it. (See <A HREF="drug3.html">Sidebar</A>)

<H2>Managed Care: A view from the inside</H2>

<H4>A Medical Marketing & Media Senior Executive Panel Discussion</H4>
</CENTER>

<PRE> </PRE>

<H4><I>by Phyllis S. DeJesse, RN, BA</I></H4>

<HR>

Our distinguished panel, representing healthcare institutions across the United States, analyzes the revolutionary changes affecting the very structure of the healthcare industry and the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
<P>
Managed care promises to drastically alter the way the healthcare industry operates. Cost of product and services will be a deciding factor in healthcare. There will be less money available, affecting capital investment, especially when it involves lab and diagnostic equipment and new, expensive technologies. Patient education and disease prevention emphasizing high-risk patients will take on increased importance. We will see the end of independent physicians as they become salaried employees of organizations. Hospital operation will change radically — more outpatient services, fewer beds and closing of facilities as bed-count shrinks. Pharmaceutical cost will be considered part of a matrix that includes frequency of follow up, lab work, as well as patient education.
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> As capitation becomes more prevalent, how will this affect patient care, particularly your purchasing decisions?
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> Capitation not only affects patient care, but drastically reverses everything. Patient care will be much more outpatient focused, much more prevention focused, away from acute care and away from disease treatment. The focus is going to be more on the process of patient care, rather than episodic treatment of illness. As far as the purchasing decisions, emphasis becomes what is the most cost-effective way that we can deliver care to the patient. The least complex setting that care can be delivered to meet patients' needs, as well as a product that helps promote that, are what's going to be favored.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> Capitation will make us more price sensitive. The big issue is, what systems do we need to do it cheaper without sacrificing the quality of patient care.
<P>
<B>Makkers:</B> Capitation shifts the risk from the insurance company to the physician. The physician now must know the cost of the services that he or she is using when decisions are made about patient care.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> Physicians are realizing that very marginal improvement in the product is not worth any price and that, if there is only a very small improvement in treatment, some of these new products are simply not going to be accepted.
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> In radiology, the cost of our equipment is very high and a lot depends upon the richness of the capitated product. If a ratcheting down occurs, that definitely will affect the resources available to acquire equipment.
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> Cost is clearly the driver under this system. While there will be words mouthed about quality, it will be quite the secondary—if not the quaternary—interest of the payer or insurer.
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> Quality of care has been maintained relatively well because we're in a very competitive atmosphere. You can't shortchange quality. If this happens, patients will switch to a competing plan. One of the problems is continuing to try to work with less money and maintain quality. Thus far we have not seen signs that our outcomes have been affected. We are living off the infrastructure that we built for fee-for-service. So much of the technology and equipment we bought in the past has been based on available money. With managed care there is less money, and purchasing of capital equipment will be much more specific and restricted. Physicians are going to be more cautious about purchasing diagnostic and lab equipment because they're not sure about the reimbursement under managed care. With pharmaceuticals, you have to realize who's in control of the pharmaceutical risk, and most of the time the insurer or the payer is maintaining that part of the economic piece of the pie. They are saying, we will determine what the formulary will be and they've not passed on that risk. In California, a few of the providers are actually taking full risk in purchasing the pharmaceuticals directly. The payers are determining what the formulary will be and they're working directly with the pharmaceutical companies.
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> Have any companies come to you with product-specific capitation programs?
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> Not to that specificity. Companies approach me with capitation, but on a much broader perspective than just being product-related.
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> No, in Denver we have a pretty high penetration of managed care programs, but none of them are from pharmaceutical companies. They're all from insurance companies.
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> Under the umbrella of capitation, how important is patient education and the need to track your patient base? What role will your institution play to enhance wellness, compliance, and prevention? How can the pharmaceutical industry help? 
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> Patient education is really critical. If you shift the emphasis to preventive care, there will be a lot more emphasis on taking individual responsibility for health. Education is going to be a big piece of that, as well as the whole health assessment area. We need to know where we are versus where we're going. I think that the pharmaceutical industry will focus on preventive care. 
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> A lot depends upon how comprehensive the program is and what is the long term perspective. Right now some of our capitation contracts are limited in scope and also in time. One of them, for example, is cancelable by either party on 90 days notice and that sort of mentality doesn't lead to the prevention and education aspect. If the person doing the capitating approaches the provider with a long-range plan, then education and prevention play a very important role. 
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> In Philadelphia, in particular at St. Chris, the only capitation contract we have is for a Medicaid managed care population. We have been involved with patient education, outreach education and a healthy babies-type project and program. Education becomes a critical component as a consequence of a capitation system for that particular managed care population.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> In preparation for the capitated environment, it is crucial for the hospital to identify its high-risk patients. The hospital and medical staff will be taking a lead role in establishing wellness, compliance and prevention services. Case management is one strategy that can be used. 
<P>
<B>Makkers:</B> In theory, the pure HMO patient should be more educated about their benefit plans, as well as the prevention and wellness programs that those companies offer. The pharmaceutical companies will work closer with primary care physicians in the development of preventive medications.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> One of the issues is to separate the higher risk patients from the routine patient. The issue of tracking your patient base really falls into those two separate categories. You can't survive in capitation if you aren't paying close attention to your highest utilizers and making sure that they're following protocols for prevention and compliance with the best medical advice. We'll end up knowing a lot more about our patients and having a lot more regular contact with the higher utilizing patients.
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> In San Diego about 50% of our patients are HMO, about 45% are PPO and about 5% are indemnity. Each month the number of HMO patients increases. We have many wellness programs that have been provided by both the payers and also by Sharp Healthcare, which is very wellness oriented. The incentive of the provider to stress prevention programs is somewhat limited by the commitment of the patient or the purchaser of care to your system. If you were sure that you had that patient for five years, the amount of effort that you could put into prevention would be much greater. 
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> Hospitals will make money as a result of empty beds. How will this affect your unstable population?
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> When you're in managed care, particularly in HMO at full risk, empty beds do help drive down your costs and provide you with monies to spend in other areas, including wellness. The only problem with wellness programs, again, is that it takes a while for you to see the benefits of such programs. In OB, it's a little different. You can see the benefits more quickly through good prenatal care. The prevention benefits of chronic conditions, such as pulmonary and cardiac illnesses, are measured in terms of years, not months. That's part of our problem.
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> Beyond cost, what drives the decision as to who you will do business with when selecting drugs and other health-related products for your institutions? 
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> Quality! I relate that not just to the product but to the vendor relationship. This includes their past performance in other situations and the actual efficacy of the product, particularly if it has documented impact on clinical outcome.
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> In addition to price, vendors are offering other services to their customers. One of them is service support, not only the negotiable charges but also the availability, the after-hours charges and emergency work. Also, some of the vendors are willing to provide other kinds of incentives, particularly if you are a preferred customer. They will build a library or conference rooms. Additionally, they'll provide education for the staff, give software releases early and they will make arrangements to try certain products, either at a very reduced cost or possibly at no cost at all. This all relates to the decision of what particular manufacturer or vendor that you select.
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> Of critical importance in the selection process, beyond cost, are the efficacy of the drug, the quality, the knowledge of the particular product by the users, e.g. the physicians and the company's service abilities, capabilities, and responsiveness.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> Customer service means prompt service in terms of delivery and repairs, easy use of the product and, more specifically, how is it packaged and is it user friendly.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> We need to identify vendors who are going to promote appropriate use. Cost is one thing, but we really need a partnership with the vendor to develop information about appropriate use, and not just maximum use.
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> As managed care becomes more entrenched, how will physicians' roles be affected?
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> We're right in the middle of working out a network among seven hospitals in the Denver area and there's a huge amount of physician anxiety. Currently various doctors and specialties don't know if their services will be needed. We continue to hear and read that the need for specialists is going to go down and the need for primary care physicians will go up. In our area, there's extremely heavy recruitment activity for primary care physicians. Then we get to the issue of gatekeeper, which relates to the preventive care question. From some perspectives, the best patient you have is the patient that you don't see, at least in terms of cost. Sometimes, many of us worry about the gatekeeper concept and whether or not there's an inherent conflict of interest, particularly if that physician is given an incentive in terms of economic rewards to cut back on services provided to that patient. 
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> One of the most significant changes that we're beginning to see is the shift toward physicians becoming salaried employees versus independent practice physicians. In the current environment, physicians must act as small businesses. Even if they are not becoming employees or joining groups they will need more general business knowledge.
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> Physicians who have been in private practice are now looking to become part of larger entities or organizations, for example, having their practices acquired by institutions. Also, the notion of what they do and how they do it becomes more important. They'll be more concerned about the use of services, the use of specialists' services, and the use of hospital related services. The nature of their practice will certainly change as managed care spreads.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> You'll see more and more physicians who are part of managed care and a reduction in entrepreneurship. With the critical paths and the case management process, we're experiencing a change in practice patterns and a change in habits for ordering diagnostic studies. We'll see more and more collaboration with the hospital staff in outcome-based practice.
<P>
<B>Makkers:</B> Physicians will become a lot more involved in their practice, especially the business side. Physicians will need to know the demographics of their patients and will look to be part of larger physician groups.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> I certainly agree with the comment about physicians finding it more attractive to be in larger groups and larger organizations. They certainly are recognizing a pressure on their income. Two other things are happening as well. They're going to have to provide their services in a much more collaborative framework. The only way to conserve resources is to do it together with specialists. Specialists are not going to take over cases the way they used to and primaries are not going to take on all the specialty work. They're going to have to find a new kind of partnership. Most likely, that will be based on many more defined protocols for the care of patients. Physicians will to have to look at general work redesign issues because they can't simply maintain their income by doing more. They're going to have to find a way to work in a different fashion. 
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> The emotional aspect is affecting physicians. Initially, there was a lot of denial on the part of physicians that their practices would change specifically and so they tried to avoid any contact with managed care. Then they realized that it was going to affect them and they became angry. After they dealt with their anger, they got into an acceptance phase, realizing that fee-for-service was dying. Once they got into the acceptance phase, they were able to start looking more positively about new relationships between physicians and physicians as well as physicians and hospitals. Also, the matter of control is very important. In managed care, individual physicians have less control over what's happening to their patients, particularly in specialty care. When our medical group started about six years ago we had six specialty physicians for every one primary physician. Our goal is to have one primary to one specialty because that's what most of the plans like Kaiser seek to achieve. This causes us to re-examine in great depth the working relationships between specialty and primary physicians. We see our primary physicians utilizing mid-level care providers such as physician's assistants and nurse practitioners. To maintain income levels in managed care, the number of enrollees has to increase. This requires giving up some control over the day-by-day care of individual patients. It becomes necessary to delegate to mid-level providers. I emphasize the loss of solo practices in San Diego. Within another two or three years, there will be no solo practitioners in San Diego.
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> Realizing that San Diego is probably about ten years ahead of the rest of the country, do you see the same happening elsewhere as managed care sweeps across the U.S.? 
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> We're going to see it much quicker than it came on the West Coast. The changes that took ten years on the West Coast happened in approximately six months in Cleveland, Ohio. We're going to see it happening very, very quickly.
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> You're going to see less physicians in private practice and more being employed by organizations.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> We've had big changes in the number of physicians who are participating in managed care. We have a very active process going on with many of our physicians. Some are forming into groups and adding partners while others are having their practices purchased. It's happening very quickly.
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> I wonder how this whole process is going to evolve in areas like Youngstown, Ohio. Its been my feeling for some time that the only way managed care can really get a stronghold in a medical economy is to be able to play one provider against another. Whether it's a hospital or physicians, it doesn't matter. In order to do that, there has to be pretty heavy competition. In places such as Denver and Southern California, there are probably an excessive number of beds and an excessive number of physicians. That produces a breeding ground for anxiety, competition and concern among the providers. What happens if you're in a fairly underserved area, like a Youngstown, Ohio? How do they get into those markets? I would think it would be much more difficult.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> More and more physicians are going to be joining partnerships. We've seen some increase in Atlanta with the Healthcare Alliance.
<P>
<B>Makkers:</B> A number of physicians have formed groups. One group of primary care physicians formed an equity partnership with one of the insurers. From a year ago, the pace has really picked up a lot.
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> In urban centers, the problem is too many providers and too few dollars. Certainly in large urban centers the major players can't compete with one provider against the other until they get the lowest possible cost. In more rural areas, the majority of primaries are forming a statewide HMO group. What I think may happen in areas like Youngstown, Ohio, is that someone will come in and organize the providers. They probably will not do it on their own. It actually is to their benefit if they're on the bandwagon early.
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> What role do you see healthcare companies playing as managed care takes over?
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> As we become more involved in dealing with managed care, we're putting a lot more emphasis on clinical maps, CareMaps and standards of care. Clinical maps are protocols for care. There will be room for companies to help with those kinds of care delivery styles—specifically, to help create pathways using products that shorten length of stay or prevent length of stay completely. I think that's a good mechanism.
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> The people who are driving managed care right now are primarily the insurance companies, and I'm not sure how a pharmaceutical company would get ahold of the action. 
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> There will be more partnerships and contracts between pharmaceutical companies and insurers to direct how the institutions will use these services, where they will get those services, at what price, in what form and in what fashion. The overall use of durable medical equipment or drugs will be more controlled by insurers, through contracts, directly between the companies and insurers.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> Each year we get more disciplines as well as external agencies involved in developing critical paths and CareMaps for patients. We will see more companies getting involved with that whole process and they will be looking to see what works best. Also, they will be working with the individual hospital or satellite to develop programs that have been researched to improve patient outcomes. Critical paths/CareMaps are tools that identify expected patient/family and staff behaviors against a timeline for a case type. They reflect the best practice patterns of all physicians and clinicians who author the CareMaps.
<P>
<B>Makkers:</B> It's hard to see how the pharmaceutical companies are going to be able to take a lead role, although I believe they are catching on very quickly. For example, in Atlanta some of the larger employers have formed a pharmaceutical buying cooperative and put all their business, about 600,000 covered lives, out to bid. I think the pharmaceutical companies are coming up to speed pretty quickly about what managed care is and how managed care will have an impact on their businesses.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> There are two directions. First, the recent experience of large group discounts has an end and ultimately these vendors will have to consider taking on capitation themselves. Secondly, vendors like the insurance companies will consider getting into the provision of services. Merck's acquisition of some behavioral health companies is an example of that.
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> There are too many providers and too few dollars. In terms of pharmaceutical companies, a lot have been able to survive in the marketplace by producing look-alikes and maintaining a profit on those products. There will be less and less pharmaceutical companies providing products in the future. Those that survive will be broadening their approach to the medical marketplace to include products other than just pharmaceuticals. As the profit margins shrink, they're going to have to form other relationships with providers such as information systems or other types of management services. The relationships will determine who controls medicine in the future. Is it going to be the insurance companies in control or will the providers gain some control? While there are too many providers, we don't have leverage. The day will come when physicians and hospitals will be in the best position to deal directly with the pharmaceutical companies. In San Diego, we've been permitted to take full risk for some of the health plans that we're providing. We accept the full premium from the payer and then we also deal directly with the pharmaceutical companies for the products. 
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> In the future, will we see fewer hospitals? And if so, why? Will mergers take place? Will some go out of business? 
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> The answer is clearly yes. I think it's regional and by geographical distribution. Certainly there are rural areas that still are underserved. But in our service area and I think in most of the Northeast corridor, we are terribly overbedded and we will see that change in the next few years.
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> The answer is yes! Our length of stay has been reduced by approximately fifty percent—it's somewhere around three days. The outpatient work has exploded. If our volume in the department of radiology and the income that it produces, were dependent upon inpatients, we would have had to cut back services, radiologist personnel and equipment quite awhile ago. I don't see any way around it with the alliances that are forming. They're going to have to arrange for certain sites of excellence and probably those facilities will sub-specialize in areas such as OB-GYN, children's, orthopedics, etc. I doubt very much that they're going to need anywhere near the beds that they have right now.
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> I would concur with that. There will be less admissions and a decline in the length of stay. With more capacity and less patients, facilities will be forced out of business.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> Hospitals will have to learn how to operate more efficiently and I would agree with "yes" to all the questions!
<P>
<B>Makkers:</B> Overall the hospitals will have to learn to operate more efficiently.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> We're going to have fewer admissions, shorter lengths of stay and will need many, many fewer beds. Hospitals have proven to be very resistant to closing. Many more small hospitals will be created out of the large hospitals and if people can figure out how to manage the fixed assets, they'll stay alive. Hospitals are not going to close in the numbers that are often talked about even though there will be a dramatic increase in the number of open beds.
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> I would say, yes, cubed! We see a major decrease in the need for beds in San Diego, perhaps a 50% reduction. We are downsizing all of our hospitals. The amount of money left over in managed care is much less than there was under fee for service. So the number of centers of excellence will increase because you just can't have hospitals dabbling in pediatrics, dabbling in obstetrics, or dabbling in cardiac surgery. The centers that provide excellent outcomes at lower cost will quickly put their competitors in the dust. There are going to be major closures of hospitals under managed care. 
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> In today's healthcare environment, some claim that it is no longer a learning curve, but a learning cliff, and those that don't learn are going to fall off. Reform is at a stalemate in Washington. Do you see a stalemate in your region? 
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> No, I don't see a stalemate. I see things happening very, very quickly. I think that almost what happens at the federal level is going to be a secondary issue. We're seeing things happening very quickly at the state level but even more quickly in the private level. The payers are putting lots of controls and expectations in places that we haven't had before. They are causing significant changes in the way we deliver care.
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> Sometimes healthcare providers, in particular doctors and hospitals, are somewhat like anxious, hysterical lemmings and they can't get to the edge of the cliff quickly enough! I don't know that we need to panic—and there certainly is a sense of panic in Denver. In terms of providers getting some sort of control over the quality of care and over their own professional lives, it looks like we're going to be forming a whole variety of colors of Kaiser. Our particular institution is horizontally and vertically organizing so that, in a short time, we'll be able to go directly to companies like Xerox or IBM and advise them that we can provide everything that XYZ Insurance Company can. Additionally, we'll cut out their profit and we'll do it for you for 15% less! I see this happening right here.
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> Certainly, there's been no slowdown in the pressure for change in the local environment. The smaller institutions are looking for partners through stronger affiliations or, indeed, mergers into the larger systems. The insurers are doing some things differently with some of the systems and also with their provider networks. Hospitals are changing the way they behave. We're all more careful about our costs. We're downsizing and trying to make sure that we keep our costs as low as we can. Also we're assuming quality is going to be exactly where it should be and nobody's going to pay us any more for that. There are a lot of factors mandating that we change the way that we behave and it's occurring with or without Washington.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> We are looking at the system in terms of the way we provide care in order to improve the quality that we deliver. We're seeing that quality doesn't cost more, it costs less. We are redesigning/restructuring systems to deliver care in a more seamless effort.
<P>
<B>Makkers:</B> Insurers have become very aggressive and are trying to grab a larger share of the market in terms of members and lives. Also, we've seen rapid development with PHOs.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> Certainly, there has been no slowdown in the transformation in Philadelphia. I think one aspect of change that's just beginning to emerge and will take on much more importance in the next several years, is physicians reasserting their control over healthcare in general. They're going to have to get into the business aspects of this in an organized way. There's going to be a very strong move for physicians to try to regain some control of this marketplace.
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> Regardless of what happens in Washington, the steady beat of the drum in the march for managed healthcare is going to continue moving ahead. Now that purchasers of care realize they can get medical care for much less, they're never going to go back to the system where they're going to be paying more. This is only going to speed the process of managed healthcare moving down the road. 
<P>
<B>DeJesse:</B> How will managed care affect formulary decisions? We know that cost is driving healthcare. If there is a drug that is superior and yet costs considerably more, do you believe your institutions will make it available to patients? Will physicians prescribe it?
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> We are much stricter about maintaining compliance with the formulary than we were. Previously, it was very easy to get a nonformulary drug. However, we also are trying to have a reasonable, rational approach to adding drugs to the formulary that are appropriate. Cost is not the only criteria that we evaluate. We also are looking at the use, the outcome and the cost savings that might be generated from lower morbidities.
<P>
<B>Wilder:</B> In radiology, for example, I believe that we would provide nonionic contrast material to all of our patients were it not for cost. But yet, because of the cost, which is about ten times or so of regular contrast material, we select certain outpatients to whom we give the nonionics. On a national basis, I'm reading more and more about decreased profit margins and how it's forcing departments to use the older, less safe ionic contrasts. I really think that, in the end, if you're facing survival or demise, the cost will be the deciding factor and not so much the efficacy.
<P>
<B>Bland:</B> I have yet to hear any conversation that only focuses on costs as it relates to drugs and drug utilization or its inclusion within the formulary. Cost is certainly one factor in deciding on a particular drug, but all the issues about efficacy and appropriateness are pertinent. I have not seen a change in the way drugs are selected for inclusion in the formulary.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> We are developing CareMaps for our patients. For example, we are looking at the cost of the antibiotic, what is the effect of the antibiotic and what has the best outcomes for the particular case as we are developing the CareMap content. We are evaluating our clinical and financial outcomes. Therefore, we haven't made any decisions at the present time. I can state that the quality of patient care comes first.
<P>
<B>Makkers:</B> A couple of our managed care companies have published their formularies and outlined their different costs. This allows physicians a choice.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> We haven't changed our process by which we select and include drugs in the formulary. We haven't changed the size and the number of drugs in the formulary very much but we have put a lot more emphasis on understanding the proper uses of these drugs. We have gone from a lot of resistance from physicians who suspected this was merely a cost-generated effort, to having them participate much more collaboratively in these studies. We're moving from a very difficult situation of resistance to one where there's a little more light and a little more harmony.
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> Deciding the cost of a drug is getting much more sophisticated in managed care. Initially, you thought about the cost for the initial prescription. When you look at cost in a truly integrated healthcare system, the cost of a particular pharmaceutical product is also based on the amount of physician and provider follow up necessary, laboratory costs, making sure the drug is tolerated by the patient, how much time is spent on patient education and how frequent a followup is needed. The actual cost for using a particular medication becomes much more complex in a fully integrated system. Certainly, outcomes are very important, too. If a pharmaceutical company can show that managing a disease system is much more cost-effective when you include laboratory and physician time as well as everything else that is involved, rather than just pointing out the clinical efficacy, then I think they're going to have a much more marketable product. 
<P>
<B>Teasley:</B> We are just starting to do CareMaps and we have not been doing them long enough to realize significant outcome data.
<P>
<B>Fuller:</B> We've only started to do our first three CareMaps and we'll be able to give you more information in about a year.
<P>
<B>MacBride:</B> We've installed a number of CareMaps and I think we've found these protocols are a lot easier to develop in surgical procedures than they are in medical ones. We do have many months' experience with some of them and I think we've found very good compliance. In fact, in some neurologic and surgical procedures, we've really converted a number of physicians to following these protocols and now they are taking part in adjusting them to be even more effective.
<P>
<B>Reeb:</B> We are doing a number of outcome studies. We've been taking a number of disease systems and following them through on different outcomes but, we have yet to come up with anything particularly enlightening.

<H2>Ten Things You Should Know About<BR>
the Long-Term Care Market</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by Todd Keitz</I></H4>

<HR>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>There is no such thing as a single managed care market. One of its most important components is long-term care, and in view of America's aging population, its importance will continue to grow. A review of the pertinent data shows that this market is still underserved by the pharmaceutical industry and that there are ways for companies to strengthen their position with long-term care decision makers.</I>
<P>
Say "managed care" to the average healthcare marketer and he or she will think of HMOs and other types of managed care organizations. Often overlooked is the fact that there are sub-sections of managed care, and that one of the most important is the long-term care market. Since the elderly are heavy consumers of pharmaceutical products and their number keeps increasing, it pays to review these ten basic facts about this market and how to cultivate it.
<P>

<B>1.</B> Long-term care will constitute an ever larger segment of American healthcare. The oft-quoted statistics tell the story. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, nearly 43 percent of the 2.2 million people who turned 65 in 1990 will enter a nursing home sometime in their lifetime.
<P>

<B>2.</B> Nursing homes are full. The occupancy rate now hovers around 90 percent. Despite recent mergers within the LTC industry, the actual number of nursing home beds in the US has remained virtually unchanged at 1.7 million since 1988. This seems incredible when you consider that Americans are not only aging but also living longer with multiple chronic illnesses—a situation that used to mean frequent and prolonged hospitalization with subsequent nursing home admission. Now, the majority are treated at home and monitored through regular visits to the physician's office. This phenomenon translates into socio-economic as well as medical concerns for care providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers alike. Providers must manage complex cases while keeping a vigilant eye on economic realities. 
<P>

<B>3.</B> The LTC sector uses a lot of drugs. Nursing home patients are heavy users of drugs. Estimates of the average cost of drugs per bed range from $600 to $1,000 annually, representing a market of over $1 billion per year. 
<P>
The top national corporate pharmacy providers dispense an average of almost 88,000 prescriptions per week, up from about 62,000 in 1993. This represents an increase from 1.3 Rxs per bed per week in Ô93 to 1.5 in 1994. During that time, average annual drug expenditure increased from $39.2 million to $48.5 million, from an average of $672 per bed to $731. 
<P>
These numbers will only get bigger. To understate the case, it's surprising that the pharmaceutical industry has not paid more attention to the LTC market. 
<P>

<B>4.</B> Like all other healthcare segments, the LTC sector wants to save money on pharmaceuticals. Of the 149 nursing home pharmacy providers profiled by Scott-Levin Associates, over 80 percent report a 50 percent or greater Medicaid patient population. It's no surprise, therefore, that virtually all nursing homes use some type of formulary or preferred drug list. Almost all use a state Medicaid formulary; almost 40 percent also use a formulary developed by their pharmacy provider. 
<P>

<B>5.</B> Mergermania is rampant in LTC. Control of pharmacy services for nursing homes is in fewer and fewer hands as pharmacy providers merge and consolidate. Larger pharmacy providers are buying up the smaller ones. Note the purchase of five smaller companies in the past six months by OmniCare, and the purchase of InstaCare and Syntetics by PCA. 
<P>
According to Scott-Levin's latest semiannual Long-Term Care Pharmacy Providers Profile, pharmacy services for about one-third of the 1.77 million U. S. nursing home beds are under the control of the top nine pharmacy provider companies. The number of nursing home beds whose pharmacy services came under corporate control increased by 50 percent from 1993. 
<P>
The profiles also show how regional nursing home pharmacy providers are tightening control over drug dispensing. Over half (56 percent) of regional providers use formularies—up from only 44 percent in 1993.	 
<P>
More control of pharmacy in fewer hands means that this customer group is in a far stronger position in negotiating with pharmaceutical manufacturers. 
<P>

<B>6.</B> Integration is speeding up. Virtually every major long-term care company has rushed towards integration, by establishing alliances with other healthcare providers and establishing sub-acute and other specialty units such as Alzheimer's and assisted living programs. The goal for nursing homes now is to participate in a network of services that stretches from hospital to home. 
<P>
Integrating LTC into managed care makes for good value. Services such as chemotherapy and certain postoperative care traditionally provided in specialists' offices and hospitals can now be performed in a skilled nursing or convalescent center. The emphasis is on getting clients out of expensive settings into less expensive facilities. Nursing homes are actively looking at income sources besides Medicaid.
Specialty units are creating a demand for LTC providers who offer such services as pain management, chemotherapy, total parenteral feedings, and antibiotic and hydration therapy. 
<P>
LTC pharmacists are also participating more in disease management and "outcomes" research—large-scale studies to determine the best treatments for various ailments. Such projects could mean using fewer or less expensive pharmaceutical products, but could also open up opportunities for companies providing disease management services. 
<P>

<B>7.</B> LTC clients want to talk to sales representatives who really know the market. Nursing home pharmacy providers and consultant pharmacists value pharmaceutical companies that offer competitive pricing and contracting. Lilly once got poor marks from pharmacists in terms of having their overall needs satisfied, but now the company ranks at the top of pharmacists' most-favored-companies list. (See <A HREF="tentab1.jpg">Table 1</A>) Reason: Most pharmacists feel Lilly has listened, learned, and responded to the needs in LTC, and established a better working relationship with the pharmacists in this market. 
The more forward-looking pharmaceutical manufacturers are using fewer of their traditional sales force and more specialized LTC forces in this market. Companies that show no commitment to long-term care are not taken seriously by their would-be clients. 
<P>

<B>8.</B> Consultant pharmacists are overlooked and underserved by the pharmaceutical industry. The top 132 regional providers employ an average of six full-time and two part-time consultant pharmacists. The larger the institution, the more consultant pharmacists you'll find: an average of three for providers serving 500-5,000 beds, and of 15 for providers serving more than 15,000. 
<P>
The average consultant pharmacist receives 1.1 visits per week from a pharmaceutical sales representative. This is considerably fewer than the 2.8 visits per week received by HMO pharmacy directors, or the 2.1 visits per week received by office-based physicians.
<P>
Consultant pharmacists are often hard to find but are worth seeking out, because they exercise an influence over prescribing that belies their relatively small numbers. 
<P>

<B>9.</B> The LTC sector likes value-added services. The pharmacists contacted in our surveys put great importance on extra services from the pharmaceutical industry, including continuing education programs and other services for physicians, pharmacists, consultant pharmacists, and registered nurses. Lilly and Merck devoted about one-third of their LTC marketing efforts to such programs; also active in this area were Sandoz, Glaxo, and Burroughs Wellcome.
<P>

<B>10.</B> Despite its slow start, the pharmaceutical industry is trying harder. The most active pharmaceutical companies are doing a lot more than they used to. Of the 20 most active companies, 70 percent increased their contacts compared to the previous year. The most active companies reached an average of about 30 percent of Scott-Levin's nursing home pharmacy panel. The panelists are affiliated with companies that control about half the estimated 1.7 million nursing home beds in the U.S. 
<P>
Individual companies showed huge increases in effort. The most dramatic change was registered by Marion Merrell Dow, which increased its contacts fourfold. (See <A HREF="tentab2.jpg">Table 2</A>)
<P>
Conclusion: Our studies show how quickly a company can improve its ranking once it takes the trouble to understand its market and deploy its resources accordingly. Just two years ago, Ciba-Geigy was the market leader. Sandoz took that position in Fall 1992, and now Lilly is king of the hill, having made tremendous progress in changing the perceptions of LTC providers. Clearly, there are lessons here for every pharmaceutical company that sincerely wants to serve the LTC market.

U.S. Medical Technology

<HR>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>Medical technology companies will succeed only if they are architects of innovation. Much of our R&D, however, is shifting overseas, in large part due to regulatory barriers at home. U.S. regulatory bodies, then, must redesign the environment for innovation to deliver on their dual objectives of ensuring safe products and providing innovative therapies in a timely manner. Restoring the innovative process will require focusing approval on the efficacy of the device, not of the therapy; opening the process to third-party review bodies; rethinking export controls; and redefining the reimbursement code.</I>
<P>
The challenge for U.S. medical device manufacturers is to remain competitive in the expanding world marketplace. The key is innovation. Medical technology companies will succeed in the changing world market only if they are architects of innovation, striving for continuous improvement and never resting on their current technology. 
<P>
But innovation cannot be assumed as a constant. It has to be nurtured and encouraged. I see the need to improve the climate for innovation in such areas as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, postmarketing research and surveillance, use of third-party review bodies, control over exports, reimbursement policy, and product liability.
<P>
First, some background:
<P>

<H3>The Overseas Technology Drain</H3>
Unfortunately, the U.S. is currently suffering a steady depletion of its medical technology base that has for so long dominated the world market. This trend is evident in the movement of research, development, and manufacturing operations to overseas locations. A recent survey conducted by the Gallup Organization examined 58 U.S. medical electronics manufacturing companies. Of the companies surveyed, 40 percent said they had reduced the number of employees in the U.S. as a consequence of regulatory delays, and 22 percent  said they had already moved U.S. jobs overseas. Today that trend is accelerating, with the recent moves by Sci-Med, Ventritex, ATS, and Minntech to set up European production.
<P>
Medtronic is also among the companies shifting R&D and manufacturing operations overseas. Twelve of our last twelve major new products or ventures are now being developed, tested, and produced in Europe first. All twelve of them will be available to patients overseas long before their introduction in the U.S. And just recently, we announced that we are moving the headquarters of our Ventures Management Group, the business unit directly responsible for coordinating the development of breakthrough medical therapies, from our corporate headquarters in Minneapolis to The Netherlands. We did so because the gap between commercial availability in Europe and the U.S. has widened from 1-2 years to 5-7 years. The current regulatory and reimbursement environments are simply not conducive to innovating in the U.S.
<P>
The real losers from these delays, however, are not the U.S. medical technology companies. Most of us have global operations. We can choose our venue for conducting research, performing clinical trials, and manufacturing high-quality products. U.S. clinical medical researchers may still be the best in the world, but they are not unique and they may be losing their edge. There are outstanding research-oriented physicians throughout the world who can conduct clinical trials in accordance with the strictest Medtronic and FDA protocols. 
<P>
The real losers here are American patients, who cannot get access to the latest, and most innovative, medical therapies needed to keep them alive. They have only two choices: accept older technology or, some cases, no technology at all, or travel to Europe or Canada to receive the therapy which may save their lives. The problem is that many of these patients are far too sick to travel or cannot afford the added cost, so they face uncertain futures, suffering from what may be a terminal disease.
<P>
We simply cannot afford to continue to hinder technological advancement or usher it overseas. The "brain drain" of medical technology research and development from the U.S. economy threatens to diminish the global leadership of the U.S. medical device industry, and its effects will be felt far down the road. High-quality jobs are being lost, and the training in the development and manufacture of emerging technologies will now be received by foreign workers. What's more, the intellectual infrastructure at U.S. academic medical centers is weakened as leading-edge clinical research is moved overseas. (For example, for the first time, the American College of Cardiology has received more abstracts from outside the U.S. than from inside for its 1995 meeting.) Venture capital is drying up for start-up innovations in our field and, as a consequence, the number of new PMAs (applications for premarketing approval of a major new device) being submitted to the FDA is declining. Over the past three years, the number of original PMAs has declined by 45 percent, from 75 to 41. PMA supplements, an indicator of incremental improvement in a device, have declined by 37 percent, from 593 to 372. 
<P>
There are four major barriers to innovation that are largely responsible for hindering the development of new medical technologies in the U.S.: (1) unpredictable and inappropriately focused U.S. regulatory practices; (2) controls on the export of unapproved devices; (3) restrictive reimbursement policies; and (4) the onerous effects of widespread product liability lawsuits.
<P>
 
<H3>Regulatory Barriers</H3>
Problems with the pace and predictability of the regulatory process can be attributed to an outmoded view of how medical innovation evolves and—at the same time—how to protect patients from unsafe technology. The FDA has the legislative mandate from Congress to protect the public health, both by preventing unsafe products from reaching the market and by processing approval applications so that safe and effective new products can be available to patients in a timely manner. We at Medtronic strongly support this mission and the need for the FDA to enforce the law in a fair and effective manner. In its execution, however, the regulatory approval process has become progressively ponderous, overly prescriptive, and increasingly out of step with the way medical technology develops.
<P>
Progress has been made in recent months in reducing the 510(k) backlog from 5,100 to 4,300. However, review times continue to increase. To quote recent FDA statistics, the active review time for PMAs, PMA supplements, and 510(k)s have all more than doubled over the past three years. For the year just ended, the total elapsed time for a PMA is 898 days, or nearly 21/2 years. 
<P>
When compared to regulatory systems used by other industrialized nations, the U.S. regulatory structure is slow, overly complex, and highly unpredictable. This is driving product development costs up dramatically from trying to satisfy continually evolving requirements and cope with delays in product introduction. The economic impact of regulatory costs and delays is causing conscious decisions to restrict investments in new technology.
<P>
At Medtronic, we have reduced our product development cycle, from four years to less than two years for major new products. At the same time, the prolonged time necessary to negotiate the randomized trial protocol necessary to obtain an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to start human trials, followed by the added time to conduct trials and complete the review process, has increased the PMA regulatory cycle from two years to an average of five to six years at present! To make matters worse, the end date is so unpredictable that we cannot do adequate organizational, sales, production, or financial planning. As a consequence, the R&D cost of a major new product is today three times what it was in 1990, from $25 million to $75 million. The bulk of the funds are being spent not on research and product development (in our labs and research centers), but on clinical trials. 
<P>

<H3>Regulatory Challenges</H3>
We see several difficult questions:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>Should medical device research in this country be limited until the clinical work is well underway overseas?
<LI>Are randomized trials a realistic form of research at the outset of new procedures, or should they be conducted after the products have been proven safe and effective? Should the product be released then with an extensive postmarket randomized trial?
<LI>Is the role of the FDA to regulate the safety and effectiveness of the device, or the effectiveness of the therapeutic procedure? What is the role of the medical research community in determining the effectiveness of a procedure? Does the FDA have the medical resources needed to make medical judgments?
</OL>

While these questions must be considered, make no mistake about our philosophy: Medtronic and the medical device industry want and need an effective approval process and a well-run FDA. The greatest risk to our company would be the sale of an unsafe product, by us or by our competitors. We support a rigorous enforcement process by the FDA, including thorough factory inspections using existing international standards, such as ISO 9001, conducted by local inspectors. Unfortunately, over the years, the FDA's prescribed product approval process has been broadened from evaluation of the safety and efficacy of the device to the evaluation of the efficacy of the therapy. This broadened role is not a part of the original legislation, nor is it part of the legislative intent.
<P>

<H3>Europeans Keep Hands Off</H3>
The Europeans recognize that evaluating the effectiveness of therapies is an inexact science. Requiring it to be done through a regulatory process can result in long delays in getting technologies to market. Their system is no less committed to patient safety than is the U.S. system. But they are conscious of the need to carefully balance regulation with the impact of unnecessary delays on patients who benefit from innovative new therapies. They concentrate their resources on the safety and efficacy of the device, instead of on the efficacy of the therapy. The European regulatory process is careful not to inject itself in the practice of medicine, leaving efficacy considerations to the judgment of the medical community. Our own academic medical community can and should fulfill this role. 
<P>
How, then, should we modify our regulatory system in the U.S. to best serve patients—in other words, to deliver on the dual objectives of ensuring safe products and providing innovative therapies on a timely basis? One way that has been suggested by Dr. Bruce Burlington, Director, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, FDA, as well as other experts, is to open the device approval process to private parties approved by the FDA to provide certification services.
<P>
In Germany, private panels of experts sanctioned by the government grant relatively quick safety approvals for new devices. Total approval time can be a fraction of the time required here. German regulators pride themselves on their efficiency and believe that patients receive a very high level of safety from their system. The system includes vigorous postmarket surveillance to ensure continued safety, which allows them to provide for a quick market release.
<P>

<H3>Quick Approval</H3>
Medtronic's submissions for premarket approval of our transvenous defibrillator lead systems illustrate the responsiveness of a third-party review system. Utilizing a private testing agency, the German regulatory system took only one month to evaluate and approve the system, after which the leads immediately became available to German patients. 
<P>
The same product approval took over two years to obtain in the U.S., and the product was not available to American patients until December 1993, four years after German approval. As you can well appreciate, we are not just talking here about time, but the well-being of patients as they wait for life-saving innovations. 
In addition to approval process issues, legislated controls on exporting PMA devices not yet approved in the U.S. are also adversely affecting our ability to innovate in this country. A new device on the PMA track developed and produced domestically must secure FDA approval to be exported, even if the importing country has approved the product for importation and clinical use. Rather than lose valuable testing time waiting for FDA export approval, companies like ours move. It must be asked what regulatory goal this achieves.
<P>

<H3>Reimbursement</H3>
Also directly impacting the ability of U.S. manufacturers to conduct technology development in this country is the decision of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to stop reimbursing providers for procedures which use medical devices that are implanted under FDA-approved clinical trials. This conflicts with FDA policies that allow the manufacturers to charge hospitals for clinical devices. There can be thoughtful debate regarding the timing of reimbursement for pioneering technologies that are, as yet, unproven, but denial of coverage for next-generation clinical devices already covered by a reimbursement code does not reduce cost to the payer.
<P>
This decision by Medicare has profound implications for senior citizens and the clinical research community. The Medicare patient will still get a device, but one that is soon to be obsolete. The manufacturer is forced to pay for the devices and therapeutic costs and is faced with drastically increased development costs that have a severe impact on their ability to finance international product development and maintain this development in the U.S. And clinical researchers are denied the ability to expand their expertise through participating in the advanced researched projects. 
<P>

<H3>Biomaterials Availability</H3>
Turning now to materials availability, our nation's product liability system is scaring suppliers away from high-technology medical industries. In the medical malpractice area, total tort costs increased from $900 million in 1974 to $9.2 billion in 1991. In our sector, growing product liability concerns have prompted an increasing shortage of raw materials necessary for the manufacture of implantable devices.
<P>
The threat of being joined in product liability lawsuits has caused many raw material and component suppliers to restrict the use of their commodity materials for use in implants. In one example, DuPont incurred tens of millions of dollars of legal costs defending itself because one of its standard materials was used in a jaw implant that did not perform appropriately. While DuPont had no role in the design, specification, or manufacture of the medical device and is prevailing in court, the cost of defending the company is prohibitive. Thus, it will no longer permit the sale of its materials for implantable devices.
<P>

<H3>Restoring U.S. Leadership in Innovation </H3>
Over the long term, our objective must be to redesign the environment for innovation, creating a system recognized around the world as the best place to develop new technology, and to provide life-saving devices to American patients on a timely basis. The alternative is to face the loss of another vital U.S. industry and watch the $4.5-billion trade balance wither away. 
<P>
The U.S. government must play a key role in ensuring that this country offers a climate that rewards those manufacturers who develop safe and cost-effective new products that offer innovative new therapies. Successfully achieving this reform will involve changing the culture under which medical advances are evaluated in this country. Technology in the 1990s moves much faster than when the Congress designed the current regulatory process in the mid-1970s.
<P>
I believe eight steps are necessary and required to restore the innovative process for medical devices in this country and to make safe, effective, life-saving medical devices available to American patients in a timely manner:
<P>

<OL>
<LI>Now is the right time to reassess the entire device approval process with the emphasis on an accelerated review which focuses on design, engineering, and testing of the medical devices themselves. 
<LI>Life-saving devices should be placed on a truly accelerated track and incremental improvements and innovations made available commercially without the long delay inherent in prospective randomized trials. 
<LI>We do believe that randomized trials should be performed on the therapies, but not until after the device has been released to the market as safe and effective. 
<LI>With this approach, postmarket surveillance and device follow-up reporting could be expanded and intensified. 
<LI>The product review process could be further accelerated by use of authorized third-party review bodies. 
<LI>At the same time, the export control issue can be simply rectified by having the U.S. accept the import approval of countries with established regulatory systems. 
<LI>Reimbursement can be reestablished for clinical trials authorized by the FDA under an approved IDE, with the promise that no added cost will be incurred by Medicare when compared to the approved product or procedure. 
<LI>Finally, legislative reform of the product liability laws should give full protection to the producers of commodity materials with the liability burden transferred through indemnification to the medical device manufacturer.
</OL>

Ultimately, the U.S. Congress and the regulatory bodies involved with medical technology need to recognize the importance of innovation and redefine their role as facilitating the pace of product development in synchronization with the pace of innovation needed by patients and providers. If they do not, both manufacturers and patients will be forced to seek alternative solutions outside the U.S.
<P>
If we are to keep the U.S. medical technology sector competitive in a rapidly changing, global healthcare marketplace, we must ensure that the government, industry, and the medical community work as partners, not as adversaries. Medical technology today is advancing at the most rapid pace in history, and it warrants an equally advanced approval process. To ensure continued U.S. leadership, we must reinvent the approval process to serve the needs of patients and innovators alike.

<H2>Getting to know your customer<BR>
as an Organization</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by Lynn Oppenheim, Ph.D. &<BR>
Marjorie Kauffman Sherr, M.A.</I>
</H4>

<HR>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>As marketing shifts from the individual physician to the large managed care organization, pharmaceutical companies will have to redesign their research approach. This starts with identifying inter–and–intra–organizational relationships, key issues, and the right respondents. Costs, both in dollars and employees committed, are markedly higher, so more attention to internal resources must be made, as well as exploiting as much primary and incremental information from the data as possible. Continued research is both an incentive to your company and a commitment to action to your customer.</I>
<P>
Pharmaceutical companies are confronting a new kind of market research challenge as they enter the world of managed care. The extensive data bases and sophisticated marketing tools developed over the years for their traditional customer, the individual physician, are no longer adequate. The stakes, simply, have become higher.
<P>
It is both more difficult and more important for pharmaceutical companies to understand the needs of their organizational customers compared to understanding the needs of their individual physician customers. It is more difficult because organizations as customers have many more touch points than do individuals your company must learn about many different players in the customer organization and the nature of their interaction. It is more important because with fewer, but larger, customers, each one matters more.
<P>
Take, for example, the dollar-value of in-person marketing efforts to a single physician and compare it to the dollar-value associated with marketing efforts to a single, large managed care organization (MCO). In-person physician marketing efforts will oftentimes consist of a field sales representative who calls on many different doctors in a particular territory. In contrast, marketing efforts to an MCO may consist of time from a national account manager, a regional account manager, two local account managers, and an account coordinator.
<P>
If the dollar-value associated with promoting to physicians is, for example, $500 per physician targeted, then, in comparison, the dollar-value associated with marketing to a large organization might be $500,000 per organization targeted. In addition, as the focus shifts from marketing to the individual to the group, associated costs grow markedly. For example, our studies have shown that, two years ago, the typical pharmaceutical company had a national account force of 20-30 members. Today, that number ranges from 40 to 50.
<P>
The pharmaceutical marketing executive can use systematic organization-to-organization research to address the following questions:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>How well does my company deal with the needs of our managed care organization customers?
<LI>What needs are emerging?
<LI>What can my company do to improve the strength of my partner the MCO in the market?
</UL>

<H3>The design process</H3>
Identify customers and influences. The first step is to determine who in the customer organization is a purchase decision-maker, and who influences the decision to purchase a product. For complicated products, with significant costs to the customer organization, it's rarely one person who makes a decision without input from others.
<P>
Identify who touches the customer. Organization-to-organization relationships are complicated. There are many people within pharmaceutical companies who have customer contact, from executives to sales people for different product lines to customer service representatives to the receptionist who transfers calls. In the managed care world of team selling, an even more complicated sales process/relationship exists. Pharmaceutical companies have executive, business, clinical, marketing, and technological contacts with MCOs. A mapping for any pharmaceutical company to one of its larger customers can get quite complicated (see <A HREF="orgfig1.jpg">Figure 1</A>).
<P>
Identify key issues. The task of your researchers is to use the wealth of internal knowledge that already exists in-house (sales force knowledge, marketing data, etc.) To identify the issues most important to your customers. In addition to using internal knowledge, you can also use publicly available information from open and private research sources about HMOs. Below (see <A HREF="orgtab1.jpg">Table 1</A>) are examples of some of the important issues the IMS Mirror Study, surveying both pharmaceutical manufacturers and MCOs, found that could be addressed in a research protocol.
<P>
The task of your organization is to be prepared to take action on a number of these fronts. Which issues you ask about depend in part on what you believe is important to your customers and, in part, on what steps your organization is willing to take.
<P>
Identify the right respondents for each issue. Not all individuals within the customer organization can be informative on all issues. For example, in an MCO, a pharmacist may have a reduced pharmacy budget as an objective, making lower-cost products more desirable. In this situation, new product introductions may break the budget. The medical director, however, may wish to avoid an invasive procedure, making a new, sophisticated but expensive drug more desirable. From a financial perspective, the lowest cost treatment may be the goal, with a balance between pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical costs.
<P>
In response to these concerns, the sampling frame you develop should be varied to reflect important differences among respondent groups, with some questions relevant to all groups, and others to only a subset of potential respondents (see <A HREF="orgtab2.jpg">Table 2</A>).
<P>
Once you have the right design in theory, it is only a matter of identifying individuals within customer organizations who match the different cells in the design. This seems easy until you have to do it. Your resident data base may have been developed some time ago, and like many corporately held data bases, may not always get updated by those in the field, who are closest to the customer. You need to develop a list of respondents at different levels and with different roles in your client organizations. The list can then be made available for other efforts, and become a valuable resource within your company. Carefully analyzed, it can tell a lot about client organizations, even without asking questions directly of customers.
<P>

<H3>Conducting the research</H3>
Choosing the resources. For a productive exploration, you must determine whether or not you have adequate resources for conducting the necessary research (e.g., skilled marketing researchers, experienced telephone interviewers, the capacity for processing sometimes large amounts of data, etc.), whether or not the ability to penetrate all levels of customer organizations exists, and whether or not customers can and will speak candidly.
<P>
You may choose to have an outside consulting organization conduct the research, using interviewers who are educated in the issues of your company and its clients. Or, considering the increasingly cost-conscious environment in which most organizations operate, you may wish to hire outside help to train the requisite skills for ultimately conducting your own research in-house.
<P>
Listening to customers. Because the relationship between you and your customers can become a rich one of many years duration, both sides will have a stake in the relationship. Many customers will want to provide you with the kinds of information that will really help. They want you to succeed in learning about their needs, and may provide lots of stimulating ideas. However, not everything the customers will have to say will be positive. But take it as constructive criticism the kind that will enable you to make necessary changes. 
<P>
In carrying out this work, you must take literally the charge of listening to your respondents. It is not enough for them to want to share your organization must want to hear. This kind of intelligent listening will pay off in the kinds of dialogue that can take place, pushing hard on issues of relevance to your company. 
Working with the findings
<P>
Identifying needs for product/service improvement. Broad-based customer research can mobilize companies. In organizations which have many touch points with their customers, hearing these concerns across the different areas of customer organizations helps everyone come together on priorities, rather than thinking locally about the concerns of a subset of the customer. Using the results of organization-to-organization research, your company can act more decisively and with agreement about which improvements to products and services are more important. Rather than the more sporadic, and sometimes conflicting, messages from individuals, you will have access to a large and systematic sample of customer opinions. You can then use that information to compare the strength of customer concerns with each other and to set priorities.
<P>
Identifying areas of emerging need. The complexity of managing information requirements for an entire client organization requires you to be in touch with customers constantly about their current and anticipated needs. But, like many of us within our own companies, this day-to-day contact can too often focus on immediate concerns. Asking customers to envision services for the future, or enumerating the three most important changes you could make in your current operation, is a clear invitation to think beyond today.
<P>
Be aware that asking customers to blue sky about services is risky they may not be able to think creatively about these issues or, conversely, their thinking may become so off-the-wall that a response is difficult to formulate. However, questions like, what are your most important service needs that are not currently addressed? And when you think about your formulary decisions and pharmacy benefit issues three years from today, what kinds of products and services do you imagine would be needed? Are examples of the difficult types of questions you could ask respondents if your customers are both forward-thinking and invested in the relationship. They may be willing to provide concepts that are both challenging and grounded. From these, you will be able to identify strategic initiatives that would best meet clients emerging information needs.
<P>
Segmenting customers. From this research, you will learn more about who in your customer base really knows your company and who does not. Although individual respondent information must be kept strictly confidential, it is possible to compare respondents at different levels and in different roles. For example, you might find that managing directors, a key segment of your customer base, have very little knowledge of, or information from, you. Since this is an important segment, you could develop marketing and selling programs with this group that are appropriate to the concerns of the individuals in the group.
The good news, and the bad. Incorporate affirmation of your company's products, services and care values in your planning processes. It is too easy to ignore what is done right and cut the wrong corners. On the other hand, acknowledge that most companies don't meet all of their customers' needs as well as they would like. Act quickly in the light of negative findings. Once a company is asked, and relates, negative feelings, they anticipate improvement.
<P>
it's also important to note here that sometimes no news is good news. For example, once customers have their complaints acted upon and their needs met, the issue will fade from their screens. But this will be no time for complacency. Fulfilled needs create the opportunity for other issues to move up the list of customer concerns there is always something more that customers want.
<P>
Mining the database. The process of research often yields unexpected information and need for action. With each successive wave of this type of research, more and more output will be developed. The data base can be mined for topics of interest and an analysis of emerging issues can be organized into themes that become evident in the data. 
<P>
With a small customer base, this kind of multi-use of the data is very important. The universe of MCOs is small and continually changing. In each geographical area, there are a limited number of organizations with which to do business. Customers can get tired of being asked for information, particularly if the issues in the research overlap with those they've previously discussed. They want to see some return on their investment of time, so that time must be used carefully. This is quite different from conducting research with individual physicians although their time is expensive in the conduct of the research, one can always find an untapped set of respondents for additional studies not a luxury you have with a few large MCOs.
<P>

<H3>Your responsibilities</H3>
By committing to conduct ongoing research with your customers, perhaps annually, you are also committing to hold yourself accountable for responding to the needs of customers. One of the earliest decisions in the research process is to identify and ask customers about issues you are willing to address. The risks of asking and not acting are very high customers' opinions are likely to change for the worse if they are repeatedly asked for information and that information is never used. Going back to customers again and again means that you are committing to listen to the feedback on your actions. Knowing that you will once again hear from customers helps keep things moving.
<P>
Furthermore, conducting an annual survey makes visible your willingness to hear how things are working. Customers know that they not only have an opportunity to speak, but that they also have an opportunity to say whether or not they feel heard.
<P>
To keep customers interested in participating yearly, it is important to provide them with feedback regarding how their collective input is being used to influence decision-making. In our work together, we present the results of our research both orally and by letter, linking customer needs and concerns with action taken.
<P>
Clearly, companies need more than customer research as monitoring devices. Each improvement in products and services should have its on tracking system. But the ultimate monitor is the customer—the only one who can tell you whether or not activity resulted in action, whether effort was productive, and whether or not needs were better met than before.
<P>

<H3>Points to remember </H3>
There are four points to remember when conducting organizational research:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>A lot of up-front work is required to identify the key issues and the key touch-points in order to ensure that the research is perceived as a valuable experience for your customers.
<LI>Because of the many touch points inherent in organizational customers, multi-level and multi-functional interaction is required to accurately assess the big picture. The individuals conducting the research must be able to connect with all levels and functions within the customer organization.
<LI>Continuous monitoring means a performance obligation on the part of the research sponsor. Unless you are willing to take action on the concerns expressed by your customers, conducting research of this nature is likely to negatively influence customer opinion.
<LI>Integrate the findings among the many touch points within and across organizational customers.
</UL>

<H2>Four Heretical Opinions About the Future</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by M. Roy Schwarz, M.D.</I></H4>

<HR>

<H3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H3>
<I><B>Heretical opinion #1</B><BR>
Managed care is not necessarily the wave of the future.
<P>
<B>Heretical opinion #2</B><BR>
Healthcare reform will not save money.
<P>
<B>Heretical opinion #3</B><BR>
Medical care will not shift from specialization to primary care.
<P>
<B>Heretical opinion #4</B><BR>
We are at the dawn of the golden age of continuing medical education. 
<P>
<B>Conclusion:</B> Beware of conventional wisdom. What "everybody knows" may well turn out to be wrong, so don't make systemic changes until you are sure you know what the new system is going to be. </I>
<P>

As in every discipline, there are always things "everybody knows" that may turn out to be fallacies. Healthcare is no exception.
<P>
I recently participated in a conference on the relations between the medical profession and industry and, as I listened to the presentations and discussions, I identified four pieces of perceived wisdom that may well turn out to be not true and hence misleading. The problem is that many of the changes being made by healthcare marketers as well as by policy makers are predicated on the accuracy of these assumptions ... and if by chance they turn out to be wrong, the consequences will be dire indeed. 
<P>
My views are undoubtedly controversial. They are certainly contrary to some conventional wisdom and I lay no claim to omniscience. But I believe that it would be healthy for decision-makers in industry as well as in the medical profession to stop and reflect for a moment on whether there might not be some validity to these heretical opinions, and whether some course corrections—or at least some hedging—might not be in order.
<P>

<H3>CONVENTIONAL WISDOM #1<BR>
Managed care is the wave of the future</H3>
We all know about the enrollment increase in HMOs and the growth in the number of new HMOs and other forms of managed care. The philosophy is to cut the fat and control the patient. Indeed, the cost per worker to date is less than under indemnity plans based on fee-for-service. Take US Healthcare as an example. According to The Wall Street Journal, US Healthcare reduced the cost to subscribers from a 12-percent increase in 1993 to a 3-percent increase in 1994, and projects a zero percent increase in 1995.
<P>
Wonderful! How did they do it? They reduced length of hospital stays by 11 percent; they reduced payment to physicians by 12 to 23 percent; and they put in place incentive programs to encourage physicians to do such things as immunizing children, performing mammography for women over 40, and having open clinics at night when people can get to them.
<P>	
That's all highly laudable. But, in addition, they told doctors that if they reduced the number of referrals to specialists and the number of high-tech tests, they'd receive a bonus. In other words, they would profit by reducing the amount of care provided to patients. But unless such care is not indicated, that, in medical professional opinion, is unethical. Simultaneously, US Healthcare takes 30 cents of every premium dollar and puts it into administration, advertising, and dividends. And they paid their chief executive officer more than 20 million dollars in salary, stock options, and dividends.
<P>
By comparison, the overhead of Kaiser Permanente, a very prominent non-profit HMO, is 4.6 percent.continues on next page
<P>
What does this tell us? It tells me that, as we go into this increasingly cost-restricted environment, public scrutiny will focus on managed care organizations with financial histories, such as those of US Healthcare, like never before. People will want to know whether it's true that the reason managed care organizations are so cost-effective is that they take care primarily of healthy people. And whether it's true that the reason they get discounted rates from providers is that costs are shifted to other payers who are charged more than they should. And how it's possible to take so much out of a "service" industry.
<P>
I also believe that in the near future you will see very vigorous competition to managed care by physicians. After all, managed care is not new. One hundred years ago, we called it "company medicine." In 1892, the Bunker Hill Mining Company of Idaho took a dollar a month out of every employee's paycheck and built a hospital. When the miners realized it was costing the company only a few cents out of that dollar to run the hospital, they protested. In fact, they blew up the company's main smelter. It was the first violent protest against managed care that I'm aware of!
<P>
Then some entrepreneurial doctors came in and said: We can compete with the company health system. Over time they proved they could deliver higher quality care for less money, and the company system went out of business. 
<P>
My prediction is that the very same thing is going to happen again. Physicians will organize and go to the employers and say: We can cut out the middleman—the managed care organization—and provide your employees with better care for less. So to those who are placing all their marketing eggs in the managed care basket on the assumption that managed care is going to be the wave of the future, I would suggest that they keep a little bit of an open mind about the conventional wisdom regarding managed care.
<P>

<H3>CONVENTIONAL WISDOM #2<BR>
Healthcare reform can save money</H3>
The legal counsel of US Healthcare is one of many who have said that if you improve the quality of healthcare you will reduce its cost. In fact, that rationale is a good part of the push to transform the healthcare system. 
<P>
Except where there is enormous waste in the system, this can't possibly be true. In fact, this premise represents the greatest risk in the transformation of our existing system. Quality always costs more. This is true of clothing, houses, cars, art, entertainmentÑand healthcare. In healthcare, better outcomes of clinical care are achieved through a combination of high quality science, high quality medical education, and high quality provision of services. Clinical outcome can be no better than the weakest link in this chain. If you have poor quality science, it doesn't matter what the quality of education is, you're going to have poor quality outcomes. Or if you have good science but poor quality education, you will never get the science translated in a quality way to the patient's bedside.
<P>
The risk our healthcare system now faces is that we are being challenged to justify why we should invest in science and education, and at times it's very difficult to defend these costs in the face of economic constraints. But if we can't sustain our investments in quality, not only will patient care suffer but the pharmaceutical industry is doomed, because it cannot survive without high-quality science. Yes, healthcare can save money, but once the inefficiencies have been removed, economies will come at the expense of quality. 
<P>

<H3>CONVENTIONAL WISDOM #3<BR>
Medical care will shift from specialty to primary care</H3>
A great deal has been said about maldistribution of physician specialties: too many specialists, not enough primary care physicians, specialists cost more, and so on. Let's recall why specialization occurred in the first place. It occurred because science drove it. As the body of scientific knowledge expanded, physicians became uncomfortable about knowing everything they needed to know. Hence they began to specialize—narrowing their focus so they could be more expert in a limited area. Today, medicine's body of knowledge is expanding more rapidly than ever in the history of the world. Yet we have seen bills in Congress that said 55 percent of all residents should be in primary care and that we ought to reduce the number of specialists being trained. To think that the pressure for specialization is going to diminish because the federal government passes a statute that says we want a different mix of primary care and specialists may well be another fallacy. 
<P>
One of my colleagues, Dr. Michael Whitcomb, compared the number of physicians in Germany, France, Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. He asked: How many primary care doctors do each of these nations have per 100,000 population? What he found was that Great Britain, with a single-payer, primary care-oriented system, had the lowest number—54 per 100,000. France and Germany were the highest. Where was the United States? Right in the middle, with 74 per 100,000. 
<P>
Then Dr. Whitcomb asked some managed care organizations for their staffing ratios. The average ratio was 75 primary care physicians per 100,000 people served. In other words, exactly where the United States is at present. Yet we are told that we must train more primary care physicians to meet the needs of managed care. Do we really?
<P>
Indeed, we're beginning to get mixed signals from managed care organizations. At first these organizations were going to increase the number primary care doctors and reduce the number of specialists to save money and increase efficiency. Recently, we have received reports saying, "No, that's not what we're doing. We're increasing the number of specialists, especially in internal medicine, pediatrics, and OB/GYN." Why? Because it's more cost efficient to have patients go directly to the specialist. 
<P>
Clearly, what all this says is that we should be cautious about rushing into the massive production of primary care doctors until we know what the system is going to be and what roles different professionals are going to play. What I think it says to medical marketers is: don't base your future planning on a massive shift to primary care. Wait a while to see what shakes out in staffing models.
<P>
A related issue is the prediction that there will be an expanded role for non-physician providers, especially for advanced practice nurses. This raises the question: "Is there really a need?" A second question concerns the claim that these non-MDs can do 60 to 80 percent of what doctors do with less than half the training. If this assumption is found to be wrong, there will be a massive number of health professionals who won't have a job. There will also be a major loss of credibility on the part of the groups who make these claims.
<P>

<H3>CONVENTIONAL WISDOM #4<BR>
Continuing medical education is in trouble</H3>
Not only is this not true, but we are in fact in the "Dawn of the Golden Age of CME."	
<P>
If one looks at the continuum of medical education from the standpoint of where we can make the biggest impact, the most productive period may well be while the physician is in practice. That is where we need to put our emphasis if we want to change physician behavior. If you want to teach doctors about, say, the economics of healthcare, you must teach it not only at the undergraduate level but in residency training and during practice. The same goes for teaching physicians about quality, about changing healthcare systems, or about the new biology and genetics. We must teach these topics across the entire medical education continuum, but especially in CME. 
<P>
The reason CME will grow in importance is that it's driven by science, it's driven by the demand for quality assurance, it's driven by the demand that we demonstrate value for dollars, that we assure the public of competency of physicians, and that we contain costs.
<P>
Admittedly, this will require a sales job, especially in academic enterprises. But I've noticed that academic minds follow money. And so if we have money it's going to be easy to do. And that's where I see a continuing opportunity for collaboration between medicine and industry, with industry given due credit for its commitment to the continuing competency of physicians.
<P>

<H3>The Drug Industry should embrace service ethic</H3>
Industry has been tremendously generous and supportive of CME, and we have had a good partnership. However, this natural partnership may go beyond education. If science improves, both medicine and industry will improve. If science suffers, both will suffer. So common sense says that we should support each other. If industry goes to Congress and talks about the threat to the science base of their business, it's seen as self-interest. If the academic community talks about the threat to science, it's promotion of patient welfare. There is a natural place for collaboration here.
<P>
Medicine is supposed to put the welfare of the patient before the welfare of the physician. The destiny of medicine is inexorably linked to our dedication to this ideal. I believe that anyone in the business of providing any aspect of healthcare is expected by the public to be motivated at least in part by this same service ethic. Industry gets the benefit of sharing in the mantle of respect the public extends to physicians, but by the same token the public holds industry to similar standards. That means it's unacceptable for industry to think of itself as only a business. If you take dollars from the pool that society gives to provide healthcare, society will hold you to a higher standard, and your public image will directly reflect the degree to which the public perceives you as living up to that expectation.
<P>

<H3>Further reflections</H3>
America's physicians and America's healthcare industry face a common challenge: to adapt to the rapid changes in the way medicine is being practiced ... but to make sure that we adapt in ways that are constructive for us as well as for society. To do so, we need to be careful not to be swept along by the perceived wisdom. A little skepticism may be good for our collective health. There is too much at stake to accept the prevalent assumptions without critical examination. 
<P>	
I said before that science is the cornerstone of education, as it is of patient care. The issue before us is whether society will pay the bill for these cornerstones of quality. If we decrease the quantity and quality of science or of education, we will encounter stagnation and enter the dark ages. We will damn people who have as yet incurable diseases to suffer without hope of cure or prevention, for as science goes, so will go the healthcare industry.

The hidden agenda behind<BR>
FDA regulation of enduring materials</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by Alan R. Bennett & Mark E. Boulding</I></H4>

<HR>

<H3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H3>
<I>The FDA plans to apply stringent regulatory restrictions on enduring materials—written or other materials of a lasting nature such as books, tape and video recordings and computer software applying the same technical rules it uses regarding drug promotion. The authors argue that this step goes beyond  the agency's statutory authority, that it violates the concept of commercial free speech a constitutional freedom and it is bad public health policy besides. They submit the possibility that the move is part of a policy to pressure manufacturers to file SNDAs in support of off-label usage.</I>
<P>
Two years ago, providers of continuing medical education (CME) and their supporters were up in arms over the Food and Drug administration's regulation of scientific and medical exchanges funded by FDA-regulated companies. Today, the furor over FDA's actions has died down as those affected by the agency's actions have learned to live within the confines of FDA's Draft Policy Statement (DPS). Although its original position was toned down in the DPS, the agency was clearly the overall victor in its struggle over CME. The agency obtained significant power to regulate in an area where its legal authority is, at best, dubious.
<P>
There is some chance that a lawsuit raising constitutional challenges to the DPS will trim back some of FDA's excesses. The Washington Legal Foundation (WLF), which filed the lawsuit, has just survived difficult procedural challenges from FDA, and the merits of the case will likely be argued in the coming months. In the meantime, however, the number of CME providers has dropped as drug and device manufacturers, afraid of unpredictable FDA enforcement, have withdrawn their funding.
<P>
Flush with its success, FDA now plans to apply the same method it used with scientific and medical exchanges to a related area: enduring materials. This loosely-defined term encompasses written materials, such as CME program books or textbooks, or other materials of a lasting nature such as tape recordings, videos, or computer software. These enduring materials may grow out of a scientific or medical exchange, or they may be completely independent of one. The key difference between a scientific and medical exchanges and enduring materials is that the former are primarily oral exchanges of information taking place at specific times and places, while the latter are chiefly written and last for an indefinite period.
<P>
As with scientific and medical exchanges, there have been examples of industry abuse. However, a few extreme cases of aggressive advertising in the guise of educational enduring materials do not justify regulation of the entire area of enduring materials, the majority of which are genuine education or science.
<P>

<H3>The textbook incident</H3>
Despite this fact, early signs indicate that FDA will lead off with an extremely restrictive regulatory approach toward the entire area of enduring materials. For example, FDA has become increasingly intolerant of the distribution of medical textbooks, which in a sense is a subset of distribution of "enduring materials." One early incident (now part of the WLF lawsuit) involved FDA's refusal to allow the distribution of textbooks on oncology to physicians by a drug company. 
<P>
The books in question were widely used in medical schools around the country, and were prepared completely independently. FDA's objection was simply that the distribution of the books involved an FDA-regulated company, and that the books contained some mention of off-label uses for that company's products. Given the nature of oncology, the textbooks would not have been useful or even medically valid if they did not include the latest information on drug therapy, regardless of whether FDA had specifically approved the indication for the drug in question. The educational value of the books, and the fact that the information they contained was commonly used in medical schools, were not relevant to FDA's determination. Rather than judging the materials on a sliding scale of promotional intent versus educational value, FDA relied instead on the mechanistic application of its technical rules regarding drug promotion.
The effect of FDA's preliminary actions has already been felt by some members of the medical publishing industries, whose sales have fallen off sharply. In a 1994 meeting with publisher representatives on regulation of their materials, FDA dredged up an old letter from the 1970s that stated the agency was working on a draft policy. Setting aside the failure of FDA to finalize the draft in the last twenty years, the actual textbook policy set forth in the letter contains some reasonable suggestions concerning independent preparation and methods of distribution. It adds, however, that FDA may regulate any materials associated with a promotional campaign, which makes the policy virtually useless as guidance for drug companies and publishers. Given the nature of this draft policy, and FDA's recent activities with regard to medical textbooks, it seems likely that FDA will apply a similarly restrictive approach in developing a general policy on enduring materials.
<P>

<H3>Beyond agency authority</H3>
What is wrong with FDA's approach? First, we believe it's beyond the agency's statutory authority. Congress never intended, in passing the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), to grant FDA a mandate to regulate information as information alone. Absent a connection to the sale of a regulated product that is more than speculative, FDA has absolutely no authority over enduring materials. In fact, the law deliberately leaves the entire area of the practice of medicine beyond FDA's reach. To claim regulatory authority over enduring materials, FDA must claim that they are "advertising" or "labeling" for drug products.
<P>
Clearly, enduring materials, educational books, videos, tapes, and computer software are not "advertising" or "labeling" as the terms are commonly understood. The term "labeling," however, has a special meaning in food and drug law, and FDA relies chiefly on this meaning to justify its expansive regulation. In the years following the 1938 passage of the FD&C Act, several courts held that books and similar written materials can come within the statutory meaning of "labeling" in certain circumstances.
Scheme doesn't work
<P>
In these older cases, the materials in question were closely connected to the product, either textually or because of their physical proximity to the product when offered for sale. Often, the materials were custom-written, and only addressed the use of a single product. Even when they were independently prepared, they were used in direct connection with a scheme to sell the product. For instance, the written materials might be shipped separately from the related product, but arrive on the store shelf next to the product they discussed, or be shown to prospective buyers. The courts saw through these attempts to circumvent FDA regulation, and allowed these materials to be regulated as "labeling."
<P>
Enduring materials, however, present a completely different situation, one that ought to take them out of the statutory meaning of the term "labeling." In the older cases, the written materials were either created specifically to promote a particular product, or used directly in a scheme to promote and sell that product. In most cases, if they were not sitting on the shelf next to that product, no one would have paid any money for them. When the written materials did have independent commercial viability, the courts were reluctant to find that they were "labeling."
<P>
Contrast this with enduring materials, or with the textbooks from the example above: physicians are willing to spend money purchasing these materials because of the valuable information and education they contain. Furthermore, the physician purchases are independent of any purchase of drug product. No physician would have purchased the materials that were the subject of the earlier FDA cases on "labeling." Indeed, most of these materials were aimed at the gullible lay public, promising quack remedies based on honey or vinegar. These different facts would likely lead a present-day court to conclude that enduring materials are not "labeling" within the meaning of the FD&C Act unless they were, in fact, sham materials used as part of a deliberate scheme to circumvent the labeling provisions of the law.
<P>

<H3>Commercial speech protection</H3>
Another difference between these earlier cases and the present day is that in the interim, the United States Supreme Court acknowledged a right to commercial free speech. This difference leads us to the second reason FDA's approach to the regulation of enduring materials is a bad idea: We believe it is blatantly unconstitutional. In earlier cases on the regulation of books as labeling, the courts rarely considered the constitutional issues. Even if they had, they would likely have found the materials to be commercial speech because of their close connection to the sale of a product. At that time, the fact that materials were commercial speech meant that they were without constitutional protection.
<P>
Today, commercial speech is entitled to some First Amendment protection. To justify regulation of enduring materials, therefore, FDA would need to meet the test set out in the Supreme court's commercial speech cases. Basically, this test requires the government to demonstrate that the regulation advances a substantial government interest, and is not overly restrictive. If the example of the DPS is any guide, this is a test that FDA's proposed regulation is unlikely to meet where bona fide enduring materials are concerned. FDA must assert a substantial interest in the suppression of truthful information that is currently used to educate practicing physicians, and must argue that its regulation of all such materials is not overly restrictive, both very difficult positions to justify.
<P>

<H3>Similar case</H3>
The SupremSimilare Court recently heard arguments in a case on content labeling of alcoholic beverages that involved a similar issue of government suppression of truthful and useful information for obscure regulatory reasons. If, as expected, the case goes against the government, FDA may find it hard to sustain its position in several existing areas, much less forge ahead with regulation of a completely new territory.
The constitutional problems with FDA's approach go even further than commercial speech. It is likely that most enduring materials are not commercial speech at all. If so, then the First Amendment allows almost no government regulation based on content. Because FDA's focus on the concept of FDA-approved versus non-FDA approved information is explicitly content-based, it would not meet this requirement. FDA has tried to avoid this issue by arguing in various contexts that any manufacturer-funded speech is by definition commercial, but this mischaracterizes the legal definition of commercial speech.
<P>
For the purposes of First Amendment protections, commercial speech is speech that proposes a commercial transaction. While this meaning is broad enough to cover everything from phone solicitations to billboards, it is difficult to see how it could include enduring materials. The only way for FDA to overcome the prohibition on content-based regulation of speech would be to advance some extremely convincing reasons for regulating the content of enduring materials. These justifications would have to rise to the level of other justifications that allow regulation of the content of speech: fighting words or obscenity, for example. Unfortunately for the agency, the courts will almost certainly not view preventing physician access to enduring materials that are truthful, help in education, and in many cases are already available from multiple sources as justifying content-based regulation.
<P>
The absence of any powerful justifications brings us to the third problem with FDA's approach: It is bad public health policy. There is no good reason for FDA to prevent the distribution of enduring materials to physicians, or to prevent the FDA-regulated industry from being involved in the area of enduring materials. The point of enduring materials is to assist physicians and other health care providers in their work through education.
<P>
Of course, there may be some cases where the materials used are inaccurate. It is even possible that the materials may sometimes exaggerate the benefits of some treatments over others. FDA, however, is simply not responsible for the oversight of medical education in this country. That responsibility rests with the various accrediting bodies and state licensing authorities responsible for physician and health care provider education. Furthermore, limiting information about off-label use of drugs is inconsistent with FDA's own recognition of the need for off-label uses of drugs. FDA seems to be saying that it will allow physicians to prescribe off-label, but it will not allow them to receive any information about the off-label use from the entity most likely to know about that use.
<P>
Finally, as with the DPS's effect on the CME industry, FDA's contemplated restrictions in this new area threaten the economic well-being of the publishers of enduring materials. This kind of "chilling effect" would be bad for medical education even if, as a side effect, it stopped one or two irresponsible companies from manipulating enduring materials for promotional purposes.
<P>

<H3>Pushing for SNDAs?</H3>
Given all these problems, why is FDA moving forward with regulation? One possibility is that FDA has a hidden agenda underlying its efforts in both the scientific/ medical exchanges and enduring materials areas. A major agency initiative involves pushing manufacturers to file supplemental new drug applications (SNDAs) in support of the many off-label uses for which these drugs are already lawfully prescribed. The agency even announced its willingness to accept SNDAs based on literature, rather than clinical trials of safety and efficacy, to achieve its goals. One way for FDA to get manufacturers to cooperate with this initiative is to limit the information they disseminate about off-label uses, forcing them to obtain SNDA approval. If this is the agency's goal, however, it needs to approve SNDAs in a more timely and cost-effective manner, and to make good on its promise to approve literature-based applications.
<P>
The most critical lesson for those potentially affected by FDA's overreaching regulation can be gleaned from the history of the DPS. FDA now characterizes that document as an "agreement" with the regulatory industry. While a significant rear-guard action against the DPS is being fought in the courts by WLF, it would have been easier to fight the regulation at the beginning. To avoid another DPS situation, industry needs to keep up with the status of FDA's effort, and to be prepared to present a strong defense if the agency's policy on enduring materials is as restrictive as expected.

<H2>Is There an FDA in Your Future?</H2>

<H3>Designing the Perfect Drug Agency</H3>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>An MM&M Executive Round Table</I></H4>

<H3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H3>
<I>The Washington Legal Foundation runs full-page ads equating delays in drug approval with murder. Meanwhile, FDA Commissioner David Kessler asks Congress for time so that the agency can reform itself. The common denominator is the premise that there are problems that need fixing (see sidebar on <A HREF="exside1.html>FDA's Mission Statement</A>).
<P>
MM&M assembled a panel of highly informed analysts and critics who not only are in the best position to call the shots but who are likely to influence the aim. We asked them what reforms are necessary and what's likely to happen?  Here are some of their specific suggestions for speeding up product approval and removing communications roadblocks.
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Do Phase III studies after NDA approval instead of before.
<LI>Require filing only of data summaries, not of all data.
<LI>Let institutional review boards supervise Phase II.
<LI>Restore permission for seeding trials. 
<LI>Establish an effective appeals mechanism.
<LI>Strip FDA of jurisdiction over advertising.
<LI>Let outside consultants update labeling.
</UL>

Their forecast: not much will happen this year. In future years, maybe lots.</I>
<P>

<H3>Speeding Up the Flow of New Technology</H3>
<B>MM&M:</B> Let's start at zero. Supposing there were no FDA, how would you design the perfect drug review agency? You have all of two hours to do that.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> I think we should start by defining the agency's <A HREF="exside2.html">mission.</A> It should be not only "protecting" the public health but also "promoting" the public health. "Protect" has a negative connotation—catching crooks and exposing fraud. I'd like an agency that accepts the fact that they should do both those things, while FDA's attitude has been that the worst sin they can commit is to approve a drug that shouldn't be approved, while not approving a drug that deserves to be approved is a lesser sin, maybe not a sin at all. 
<P>
<B>Lenard:</B> The question you asked is exactly the question we are asking ourselves at the Progress and Freedom Foundation. If you were to design an FDA from scratch you probably wouldn't choose the system that we have now because it is set up to produce just the attitude Dr. Lasagna describes. We have a government monopoly on certification of new products and monopoly invariably leads to higher prices and restricted quantity. While we don't yet have the precise answers as to how you would structure a new FDA, clearly one of the things you have to do is to introduce competitive pressures into the drug approval process.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> FDA actually does have a mission statement and it does include health promotion as one of its goals. The problem with the mission statement is, one, nobody knows it exists [see "For Eyes Only. Yes, Virginia, there is a mission statement," below]; two, it's not legislatively binding; and three, FDA views promotion of public health in a totally different context than you and I might. They view "promotion" as getting it right, not necessarily doing it fast. I think an FDA mission statement should be prescribed by Congress, and it should define "promotion" as including industry's development.
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> That was one of the things FDA sought when I was there in 1978. We felt that it was very important to get Congress to sign on to that notion so that when a Congressional oversight hearing occurred after a drug disaster—and disasters are inevitable, no matter what kind of system you have—we could say that Congress had directed us to take such risks.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> We might take the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a model. They have a legislative mandate to promote the industries they're regulating. 
<P>
<B>Dickinson:</B> I wonder how important it is to have a mission statement promulgated by act of Congress. Just last week I attended a meeting of the FDA Grassroots Regulatory Partnership in Chicago, and the new deputy commissioner for policy, William Schultz, among others said that the promotion of public health is a definite goal of the agency, and that they want to educate the public about FDA-regulated products.
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> I think that response by the agency is the reason why we need a statute. By promoting the public health we don't mean public education. We mean making important drugs, devices, and other technologies promptly available. A consumer education program may be worthwhile, but certainly doesn't address the underlying problem: keeping vital technologies away from consumers who need them. 
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> I'm not knocking the FDA's actions in protecting the public health. I think the public wants that to be done. When Kessler came into office at the time of the generic scandals, I could see why he wanted to stress the cops and robbers approach, although I think he's overdone it. My point is that that isn't enough, that you really want to have good new drugs and good new devices made available in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is now the case.
<P>
<B>Kamp:</B> FDA is an agency run by doctors whose job it is to cure diseases. Is it an outrageous assumption that an agency that does not have marketing expertise should not be regulating the marketing of prescription drugs? The kind of errors the agency has made happen when you think of your mission primarily as fixing problems, as opposed to figuring out how best to communicate technology and innovation to physicians and the public. Either you have to make basic changes in the agency or put those functions someplace else.
<P>
<B>MM&M:</B> Addressing the question of approvals, how do you simplify that process? Do you change attitudes or systems?
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> Both. A regulator doesn't have to be adversarial. A regulator can be cooperative and helpful. A lot of innovation comes from physicians or chemists or biochemists who pursue an idea, sometimes in very small entrepreneurial companies. It takes so long to bring such products to market that they usually have to license their products to big companies. The question is, is it better to foster competition by allowing entrepreneurs to develop their own products, or to have a regulatory process so long and complicated that only a few big guys can afford product development. The FDA has many very able, experienced physicians and other scientists, but the process seems adversarial. 
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> We should try to achieve a collegial relationship between the regulators and the regulated, with early and continuing dialogue as the drug or device goes through the pipeline. In the best of all worlds, you would solve all the problems before NDA filing (see sidebar on <A HREF="exside3.html">User Fees</A>) Regulators should not lie down and be patsies for industry, but they ought to be helping the applicant do the right thing.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> There should be management incentives to encourage such cooperative interaction.
<P>
<B>Lenard:</B> There have been complaints about lengthening development times since the 1970s. So it doesn't seem to be a matter just of personalities or attitudes. It is more of a systemic problem.
<P>
<B>Dickinson:</B> At last week's FDA meeting there was general agreement that what has to change is the FDA's traditional culture, which rewards caution, inaction, and adversarialness. No FDA bureaucrat has ever been punished for not approving a drug. The rewards are all for inaction. But that's changing. FDA leadership realizes that the culture is outmoded and in need of a total overhaul. When a senior FDA manager speaks optimistically of the old dogs in the agency all retiring at about this time because it will permit a change in staff development, that's very encouraging. 
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> Remember that Congress usually asks FDA commissioners or their representatives: why did you let that drug on the market? Until the AIDS advocates got into the act, rarely if ever was FDA asked: why haven't you put this drug on the market? The AIDS folks, by being smart, articulate, and passionate, by being willing to be obnoxious, have gotten a lot of changes, and drugs for AIDS have been approved with a database that's trivial by comparison with what's usually required.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> It shows that you don't always have to have the gold standard—two placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials—to protect safety; that you can take chances. Granted that the risks in AIDS are the most serious, but still it shows that such things as parallel track research and accelerated approval can be done without risking the safety of Americans.
<P>
<B>Kamp:</B> AIDS is only one example. There are patient groups now for virtually all diseases, and they are going to push for FDA reform. It's the people who are sick and want to get well who will find a better way.
<P> 
<B>Lenard:</B> Patient groups are also increasingly upset about the FDA's policy on continuing medical education, which has deprived them of important industry financing of meetings and conferences.
<P>
<B>MM&M:</B> Do the changes you've suggested require Congressional action?
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> What worries me about a non-legislative approach is that we've had suggestions for reforms for decades but still the same complaints surface over and over again. 
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> I agree that clearly there's a need for statutory change. For instance, I don't think it's a good thing that organized groups can get drugs approved and groups that aren't organized don't. That's not the way we ought to be making decisions. A statute needs to recognize that this problem isn't confined just to the groups that are kicking or picketing. This is a problem for all kinds of drugs. Let me be specific. The third phase of clinical trials is undoubtedly the most time consuming. Yet what happens in Phase III has a big influence on what's said in the labeling but has very little influence on whether a drug gets approved or not. We essentially know that at the end of Phase II. Yet we spend three more years studying it to write the label, while patients who need the drug are waiting. To change that system requires a new legislative mandate.
<P>
<B>Lenard:</B> A tighter statute could also counteract all of the incentives to delay by giving the agency less leeway. Or we could change the structure even more fundamentally and take a look at some European models, where there's a lot more private sector participation in the review process. 
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> The reviewer doesn't need to see every piece of data on every application ... truckloads of data and volumes of computerized files every case study of every participant in every clinical trial. In Europe, the reviewers generally receive data summaries, with strict legal requirements of accuracy, and with the underlying data available if questions are raised. That would simplify the process considerably. You might also allow institutional review boards (IRBs) to assume more responsibility for Phase II research and thereby eliminate some of the bottlenecks at the front-end of the process. 
<P>
<B>Dickinson:</B> On the other hand, every time a drug had to be withdrawn from the US market for safety reasons it was because data had been withheld from the FDA. If you exclude products approved on the basis of fraudulent applications, the number of products that had to be withdrawn from the US market for safety reasons totaled about three in 15 years—a much lower rate of withdrawals than in Germany, France, and the U.K.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> The percentage of drugs that had to be withdrawn for safety reasons was four percent for Great Britain and three percent for the United States. That's not a lot of difference. Clearly, if you delay and delay a drug, you're going to have the advantage of observing things that occur in other countries, but you're also losing the benefits of having those drugs available. That's what's never quantified. Take clozapine, which is tremendously helpful for many schizophrenics. It was marketed abroad for 12 or 15 years before it was available here. Anyway, you can never know all the good or bad things a drug can do prior to marketing.
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> Even if you take twice as long as we do now to get drugs to market, you still have to rely on post-marketing surveillance to pick up infrequent side effects. In effect, we test our drugs on Europeans by waiting to see what happens there. Meantime we deny ourselves the benefits of those products.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> Industry used to do what was called pre-launch seeding trials to find out how the drug performed in actual practice. It probably wasn't done as well as it might have been but it did serve a useful purpose. The FDA stopped it. 
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> Let's keep in mind that FDA is not operating in a vacuum. Hearing about the European model reminds me of a situation in the mid-1980s. There was a drug that had been marketed in Europe for some 15 years, but after it was approved in the US in '82, Amerocam patients developed adverse reactions that had not shown up anywhere else. When we investigated, we found that in most of Europe there were only a few centers that were handling this advanced drug, while here it was available for every physician to use. I'm not opposing reform, but I do think we need to look at the context in which things happen. If we assume that the FDA is the only problem, the only variable, we lose sight of the other dynamics.
<P>
For instance, someone mentioned the reduction of industry-sponsored symposia and conferences. Well, it just so happens that since Clinton was inaugurated the drug industry has downsized over 10 percent. There are mergers and consolidations going on worldwide, leaving fewer potential sponsors. The same thing holds for new drug approvals. According to the Wall Street Journal, there are fewer products in the pipeline. So in designing the ideal agency, let's design one for the 1990s, not the 1970s; better yet, let's design one for the next century.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> Bill makes a good point. Nowadays, pricing authorities—including HMOs and hospital formulary committees—are more important than the approving authorities. They ask manufacturers why they should pay for their drugs...in what way they're better than what is already on the market. Are they cheaper, less toxic, more effective, more convenient? So, clearly in the years ahead manufacturers are going to make money only from real breakthrough drugs, regardless of FDA. 
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> Which doesn't mean we don't need a better FDA. One flaw we need to eliminate is what I call the "moving target." Too often, a reviewer's decisions are communicated to the company, the changes are made, but then the application is reviewed by someone else who has different ideas. Finally, the application goes to the head of the division, even to the director of the center, who may have still different ideas. There are too many layers and not enough finality.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> Another reform that's needed is an effective appeals mechanism such as they have in the UK. Drug companies have usually said, no matter how arrogant or ridiculous the demands, it's cheaper and quicker to do what the reviewer asks than to do battle because there's no one to appeal to. 
<P>
<B>MM&M:</B> Let's get back to what Howard [Beales] said, that Phase III studies have little or no bearing on product approval. Howard, would you do away with Phase III? Then two further questions: What do you think of Peter Hutt's suggestion that once a product has been approved either in the U.K. or the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, FDA be given 90 days to veto it or the product is automatically approved for use in the U.S.? And finally, what about external reviews of NDAs?
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> As for Phase III, I wouldn't do away with it but let drugs come to market once safety and efficacy have been established, then require Phase III studies post-marketing as a condition of approval. 
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> In other words, accelerated review followed by post-marketing surveillance for all drugs, not just AIDS drugs.
<P>
<B>Dickinson:</B> Regarding Peter's suggestion, as Bill pointed out earlier, the UK system and most European systems permit limiting distribution in very narrow and specific ways but the FDA doesn't have that option.
<P>
<B>Lenard:</B> That kind of reform should certainly be considered, though it might be a problem picking countries we consider pure enough.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> As for external review, we tried that in the Bush administration. Granted, it was tried half-heartedly on supplements only, but it showed some promise. The problem was finding someone with the requisite expertise who didn't have a conflict of interest as strictly defined by the FDA. Also it may have cost considerably more.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> That's not what I heard. I've heard that the reviews were really of quite good quality and cheaper.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> On supplements, yes.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> They only studied supplements. With regard to finding people, I know one academic reviewer who routinely reviews statistics for FDA because they don't have enough statisticians in-house. Why wouldn't that work with clinical data? Use somebody who's in business to do it and who knows that if they don't do a good job, promptly and with good quality, they will never be used again.
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> There are other models to get around the conflict of interest. What about certified public accountants? They are paid for by the company whose books they audit but they are legally accountable to the stockholders.
<P>

<H3>Letting the Communication Flow</H3>
<B>MM&M:</B> What's the latest on the FDA's draft policy statements on continuing medical education (CME) and enduring materials?
<P>
<B>Dickinson:</B> They are literally dead in the water. They are having great difficulty coming up with anything.
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> What's stopping them is the victory of the Washington Legal Foundation in having the courts accept their constitutional challenge [see "What is the Washington Legal Foundation?" MM&M, April 1995]. Before that, the agency was operating without any sense of legal accountability. They'd announce draft guidelines and say, you'd better be in compliance because these will be our policies. But if anyone challenged them, they'd say, we haven't even published formal notices, so nothing is final.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> Even before this year's proposed regulatory reform, rule-making had become such a burdensome process and FDA has such a backlog of regulations that haven't been published in final form that it resorted more and more to guidelines. As Bill says, the agency took that to an extreme and now the courts are properly pointing it back to its legal authority. 
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> Another issue is the matter of consistency. FDA has a policy that effectively gives guidance on how to promote unapproved devices prior to approval. You can put an ad in a journal saying you're looking for investigators to research, say, a new use of an MRI scan. But when it comes to talking to the same doctors about unapproved drugs you can't tell them anything.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> The agency has walked down a very slippery slope when it comes to advertising. It has expanded its jurisdiction beyond its real expertise by ruling that a label is anything that promotes a product, whether it's a textbook or a medical conference or a reprint. The fact is that FDA is very comfortable with the wording of warnings on labels but is very inexperienced about how products need to be advertised and promoted in the marketplace. 
<P>
<B>Kamp:</B> Which leads me to what may be an outrageous question: why should an agency that does not have marketing expertise be regulating the marketing of prescription drugs? 
<P>
<B>Lenard:</B> I agree with John's logic. On the other hand, the current FDA policy on promotion is a logical outgrowth of the approval process. 
<P>
<B>Kamp:</B> At the very least we have to stop the agency from taking its labeling jurisdiction and making it a whole lot more. When they start regulating the distribution of textbooks and continuing medical education, that's way beyond the scope of the statute. I think it's also beyond common sense. Here is an agency that's expert in pharmacology regulating the diffusion of innovation, which is not its expertise. That's why I think it's time for us to think seriously about moving the marketing jurisdiction out of FDA, maybe to the Federal Trade Commission.
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> What you're suggesting could totally defeat not only labeling but the entire review process. You can't have an agency saying, this is the product that's approved. It's this container [points to soft drink can] and it's for such and such a purpose, and then have people go out and say whatever they want to about it. At that point you might as well say we'll get rid of the review process altogether.
<P>
<B>Lenard:</B> But if we had a more rational review process where supplemental label changes could be approved more quickly, a lot of this label pressure would go away.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> Certainly FDA has expertise to deal with labeling that FTC does not. And certainly no company should be allowed to say that X drug that is approved for Alzheimer's can work on cancer. But once you've gotten past those fundamentals, it seems that FDA gets into murkier water in assuming that it's the chief policeman of our public health, which gives it the right to prescreen press releases. It assumes that its rules have to be tightly prescriptive or else physicians will be duped. There should be a freer dissemination of scientific information.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> We don't have any mechanism to keep physicians from being "duped" by an article in a medical journal. FDA doesn't interfere with that. But if the company wants to send a reprint of that same article, that's illegal. We ought to think about that paradox. The other problem is the out-datedness of labels. In the cancer field about half of the usage of drugs is for off-label indications, and sometimes that triggers capricious reimbursement policies. Dick Crout, when he was head of the Bureau of Drugs, said that labeling cannot be both authoritative and up-to-date. I submit that we ought to figure out a mechanism to make it up-to-date. I chaired a committee that recommended that we get a group of independent experts to say how the labeling should read. That still strikes me as a sensible approach.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> The process for amending labeling is so expensive and so slow and so burdensome that you can't blame companies for not going that route. A specific example. Dilantin was approved in the 30s for epilepsy, but thousands of studies have shown that it's also useful for cardiac arrhythmias, muscular disorders, burns, and maybe even addictions. But in order to get those indications on the label you need two "gold standard" studies of each with modern control techniques. 
<P>
Or take an OTC example—common aspirin. For nearly 15 years we've known that if you take a children's dose a day, if you're at high risk for a heart attack or stroke, it's going to reduce the incidence of disease by as much as 50 percent. All the guidelines suggest you do it. The Public Health Service tells you to do it. The only people who can't tell you to do it are the product's manufacturer because the revision of the product monograph has not been processed. Yet the agency did find the time to propose the negative: that a warning against long-term use be put on the consumer label! There has to be a streamlined process that encourages bringing the most recent information to physicians.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> And isn't it unconscionable that it takes as long to review a supplement as it does to review the original drug application, when all the toxicological and manufacturing problems have long been solved?
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> Longer.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> It's because supplements have such a low priority on the agency's list of things to do.
<P>
<B>Dickinson:</B> There's a provision in the statute that has virtually fallen into disuse. It was last used when Bill was with the agency. It's the provision for declaring drugs "generally recognized as safe and effective" (GRAS). If the agency were to set up an advisory committee that reviewed labeling on an ongoing basis along the lines of what Lou suggested, it could determine when there is enough published data on a new indication that it should be put it on the label. Let's lift this responsibility from the companies.
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> Kessler tried something like that. First he went out to stop off-label promotions. The response from industry and academia was, hey, you've stopped 80 percent of the use of cancer drugs. So he said he'd encourage supplements and to get the process running he asked people to send in names of drugs and their popular off-label uses. To my knowledge, as of May 1995, there has yet to be a supplement approved based on any of this information. The only change he made was to eliminate the requirement for clinical studies to establish pediatric dosage when you can use pharmacokinetic data instead. 
<P>
There is also, of course, an economic reason why labeling is not kept up-to-date. Once a drug is generically available and the new indication is not tied to a unique dosage form, whoever pays a nickel to assemble an application has just wasted five cents. And it isn't going cost a nickel, it's going to be hundreds of thousands or a million dollars, with zero competitive gain. 
<P>
<B>MM&M:</B> Let's take a look at direct-to-consumer advertising.
<P>
<B>Kamp:</B> The rules governing consumer advertising were developed for an era that is long past, and they make no sense to anyone who looks at them objectively. Even the FDA people who have to enforce them agree with that. There have been suggestions to the agency for at least the last four or five years that we start a dialogue, but I have yet to hear word one from an agency person saying: "Come on in and let's talk about it, let's develop a new policy that makes more sense."
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> Do you think anyone ever turns to the next page of a magazine to read the professional label?
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> Again, it's a point we need to see in context. OTC monographs, along with lots of other agency rule making, is being stopped not within the FDA but at Health and Human Services or the Office of Management and Budget. The monograph on analgesics was held up for about two years because economists at the department were troubled by the child-proof packaging requirements for aspirin. What would it do to people with arthritic hands? It was an issue they never reached closure on. This poor document was bumped back and forth between HHS and FDA because there was no mechanism to resolve it. When OMB gets involved, they can hold up monographs for three or four years. That's why the agency uses guidelines to make policy: they can't do it according to the legal process. 
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> One issue that held up a lot of monographs was the FDA's policy of exclusivity of language—that you couldn't use your own words to describe the indications. Antacids weren't for gas. 
But let me get back to labeling. I don't agree with the premise that the policy on off-label promotion is a necessary reflection of the approval process. It's perfectly rational to ask first, is this product good for anything? If so, then you can market it. Then you ask, what is this to be used for? Clearly you should not be able to make up whatever you want without regard to the facts, but if there is solid scientific basis for your claims, there's no reason other than purely jurisdictional protection why you shouldn't be able to promote that use. That information ought to be able to flow. 
<P>
<B>Lenard:</B> But if you had a sensible approval process, making a separate judgment about scientific claims wouldn't make any difference.
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> I think there is a crucial difference. Under the present system you need prior approval for your claims; under the suggested alternative, the accuracy of the claim is reviewed after the fact and manufacturers are held liable if they make false or unsubstantiated claims.
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> The present system substantially lowers risk. The decision to put a drug on the market is based on a risk/benefit assessment that depends on what the drug is going to be used for. Take oncology drugs; they're useful but they're also highly toxic. I would not want them given out for purposes that had nothing to do with cancer. To say, we'll get the manufacturer for false advertising after the drug has been misused misses the point of what the approval process is fundamentally about.  
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> There clearly are additional risks anytime you expose an additional population to the drug. But as Dr. Lasagna pointed out, that risk exists if the physician reads about an additional use in a journal article. In addition, you've got some pretty powerful incentives on the part of drug manufacturers to take great care in the kinds of uses they're promoting.
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> When a manufacturer starts making outrageous claims, it's not unheard of for competitors to take them to court.
<P>
<B>MM&M:</B> Mostly they run to the FDA. We've just about run out of time, so let me ask each of you to give us a quick prediction of what you think is going to happen. At the beginning of the year there was a general assumption that the FDA's powers would be vastly curtailed by the new Congress. Today, as of May 1, 1995, what is your assessment?
<P>
<B>Lasagna:</B> I think we're going to see some attempt at legislative reform of FDA because there's a widespread feeling on the part of Democrats and Republicans alike that things are not going well. Perhaps the most obvious problem is that the biotech industry is headed for disaster because it's running out of venture capital. I wouldn't dare to make a guess as to how numerous those legislative constraints will be, but I think there will be an attempt to shorten the approval process with regard to both new drugs and devices.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> It's always risky to predict anything in Washington—especially on tape. But if history is any guide, I think you're going to see a piece of House legislation that will be valuable more for the leverage it will exert on FDA than in achieving statutory reform. Then the reform drive is going to slow down as the "hot tea" of the House is cooled in the "saucer" of the Senate. If any legislation does make it through, and it could take two years, the bill most likely to pass is a repeal of the ban on exporting drugs and devices that aren't approved for use in the US. 
<P>
<B>Dickinson:</B> I agree completely with Marc. There may be other legislation which will affect the agency, but it will be in such areas as paperwork reduction and regulatory relief applicable to all government agencies, not just FDA. And just possibly Congress might undo some of its unfunded mandate legislation, relieving the agency of burdens Congress itself has imposed by assigning tasks to the FDA that it didn't provide funding for.
<P>
Finally, I predict the agency is going to surprise everybody by cleaning up its own house to a startling degree, and that will significantly reduce the pressure for legislative change.
<P>
<B>Kamp:</B> I agree with everything Jim said except that last statement. I doubt that the agency is going to reform itself. I'm not sure there's a real will to do so. As for this session of Congress, some small things may happen, but I wouldn't bank on that either. However, the lawsuit by the Washington Legal Foundation has alerted the agency that the first amendment applies to FDA, and that's a bell that can't unrung. 
<P>
<B>Lenard:</B> I generally agree with what's been said but I would point out that the terrain has shifted. There's much more bipartisan interest in reform, but the changes are not going to be very dramatic. Even if we get nothing this year, however, the debate over what to do about the FDA is going to continue.
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> Like Jim, I think the FDA is going to make remarkable changes internally. Kessler has already reengineered the agency twice—once when he arrived here in the Bush administration and revitalized an agency that was very definitely on the ropes, and again when he transferred from a Bush to a Clinton FDA. This man is as good as I've seen in this town in terms of following election returns. He knows he cannot stay the course he pursued under the guidance of Dingell, Waxman, and Ted Kennedy. 
<P>
My other point is that the biggest thing that is happening is not reform legislation but the budget. FDA's resources are going to be cut like every other resource in government, and the agency is going to have to make some decisions about what to jettison. I was there in the 1970s when they jettisoned cosmetic regulation. They simply said there's no money for regulating the safety of cosmetics and shut the program down. They're going to make the same sort of decision now, shutting down, for example, some of the chemistry review area for drugs. Finally, speaking of predictions, I've got to tell you that I worked on a bill in 1978 that embraced almost everything people are calling for today. It provided for treatment INDs, accelerated approval of breakthrough products, parallel track reviews—a zillion topics were addressed. That bill went a very short distance and died. Why? Because the drug industry said they weren't that unhappy with the old system. Suddenly the status quo didn't look that bad! 
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> The first rule of forecasting is to give them a number or a date, but never both. I think the pressure for change we're seeing now will build and that the agency's response will be as it has always been: to try and defend as much as possible. They'll say, what we need are administrative changes and we're busy doing everything we can to make this the perfect agency. And I don't think that will work. In terms of what's likely to happen in this Congress, I agree that it won't be anything dramatic—maybe exports, perhaps some aspect of off-label uses. But over the next four or five years—there's the date—there will be some significant legislation that will change the FDA as we know it. 
<P>
<B>MM&M:</B> Final comments?
<P>
<B>Kamp:</B> If we are to solve these problems, the public and its surrogates—the press and the Congress—will have to take a different view of the FDA. I think what we really need is a scandal, where the lack of an approval or a company's inability to talk about a secondary indication actually caused people to die. We need the thalidomide child of the 90s. Until then I'm not so sure that much will happen either inside or outside the agency.
<P>
<B>Dickinson:</B> After listening to this discussion, I remain more optimistic than some of my colleagues. I would urge all the readers of MM&M to obtain a copy of Reinventing Drug & Medical Device Regulation, which has just became available from the FDA's Office of Consumer Affairs at 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20657. It is a very detailed blueprint of what the White House and the FDA commissioner are committed to do to bring about FDA reform. [MM&M will report on this book in a future issue.—Editor]
<P>
<B>Beales:</B> The reason I remain skeptical is that this is the third vice president I've heard promising administrative reform.
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> People who are skeptical about internal FDA reform are often just disappointed about changes that went against the direction they wanted them to go. I think that in fact the FDA has changed course remarkably over the last 15 to 25 years. For instance, Kessler turned loose the cops. But when you give a man a badge and a gun, watch very carefully what he does with that gun, and Kessler didn't watch very closely what his cops were doing. I think that was a terrible mistake, but it was a change, a dramatic change.
<P>
<B>Scheineson:</B> It was the first thing Dr. Kessler did when he was confirmed. He said: "The watch dog is back in town and it has teeth." Unfortunately, he bolstered enforcement by turning it over to the districts and field offices. 
<P>
<B>Vodra:</B> One has to ask what the world would look like if we abolished the FDA. As Dr. Lasagna pointed out, the payers of drugs are asking for more data than the FDA: not only that the drug is efficacious but that it's more cost-effective. We also know that because of product liability the marketplace is demanding safety data to the nth degree. Meanwhile consolidation is reducing new product pipelines, and downsizing and cutbacks are shrinking the support of symposiums and seminars. I point all this out not because I oppose reform, but to alert those who ascribe all problems to the FDA that if all the changes they ask for were made—even if we abolished FDA—they are likely to be terribly disappointed when they wake up the next morning and discover that nothing is radically different.
<P>
<B>MM&M:</B> We greatly appreciate our panelists' thoughtful and challenging contributions. Thank you all.  (see <A HREF="exside4.html">sidebar</A> of FDA's Temple criticizes several suggestions of the panelists).

<H2>1995 Healthcare Agency Report</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>By William G. Castagnoli</I></H4>

<HR>

<H3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H3>
<I>As pharmaceutical companies reorient promotional programs from private practice to managed care, healthcare advertising agencies are rapidly preparing to provide a breadth of new services. Specialized hires, reorganizations, and integrating outside consultants are some of the ways agencies are evolving to survive in the changing environment of healthcare.</I>
<P>

<CENTER>
<H3>AGENCIES IN TRANSITION:<BR>
EXECUTIVES TALK ABOUT COPING WITH CHANGE</H3>
</CENTER>

We learned from Darwin that a species, in response to threatening changes in its environment, develops physical features and adaptive strategies which allow it to survive. With pharmaceutical marketing experiencing profound changes, the healthcare advertising agency can be viewed in Darwinian terms as a threatened species. The meteor, managed care, has landed. The inhabitants are beginning to cope with the new climate.
<P>
In the past few months, I've talked with 15 healthcare ad agencies and I can report that the species is taking on protective coloring, displaying changed behavior, and even sprouting new body parts. Although it is too early to tell which new characteristics will survive, it is not too early to appraise the logic of the new strategies and to note trends in the process that is underway.
<P>
But first a disclaimer: my sample was limited. I may have missed an organizational form or new service which will prove important. In fact, although 14 agencies talked freely, one politely declined to disclose what they were doing. Possibly, agencies held something back for competitive reasons. I doubt this was the case, since rather than being secretive, those I talked with tended to be expansive, putting everything they were doing on the table in order to be seen in tune with the times. My overall impression was one of admiration for the creativity and energy displayed and surprise at the pace of change. The agencies I visited are determined to adjust to the new managed care playing field and are re-thinking their services and reorganizing accordingly.
<P>
At a round table discussion on managed care held a year ago (Medical Marketing & Media, July 1994), Jack Fisher, then of Frank J. Corbett (now Corbett HealthConnect) reported that clients were challenging agencies with, "You don't know anything about managed care. You've never handled an hmo." Clearly, agencies saw that they were on the short end of a knowledge gap, which existed with clients as well, but companies, through sales activities, were gaining an expertise. Agencies, to be of service, needed to keep up. Equipping themselves to advise on managed care and to conduct programs, agencies have followed two courses and a hybrid of these alternatives. At issue is whether to hire an expert—to have a resource "in-house"—or to draw upon outside brain power as needed.
<P>
Agencies which have opted to place persons with managed care backgrounds on staff are Lally, McFarland & Pantello (lmp): Steve Herskovitz from the Voluntary Hospital Association; Medicus: Jon Doniger from Merck/Medco; and fcb Healthcare: Hank Kirsch from Syntex's managed care unit.
<P>

<H3>Going Outside</H3>
Opting for outside experts, for example, are McAdams which has entered into a joint venture with James T. (Tim) Thomas, R.Ph., who heads up a disease management consulting company; Corbett HealthConnect, which draws on a "managed care council" of mco executives (including representation from Cigna, Kaiser Permamente, and Humana) chaired by Edward F. X. Hughes, M.D., of Northwestern University; and Kallir Phillips Ross (KPR) which is in a relationship with gmr, a managed care consulting firm, which also services other Omnicom agencies.
<P>
A highly visible variant of the inside expert approach is the formation of a unit within the agency specializing in managed care. Such a step has obvious public relations and promotional value in signaling the agency's dedication to managed care services. Agencies have shown creative flair in naming these new units. Here is a sampling: McAdams: mc2adams; Girgenti, Hughes, Butler & McDowell (ghbm): Reform; lmp: Oracle; Gross Townsend Frank Hoffman (gtfh): Strategic Initiatives; Ferguson: CommonHealth usa (in partnership with hls); Klemtner: Managed Care Initiatives; and Corbett (which rather than establish a separate division, re-named and re-oriented the entire agency toward the new marketing scene): Corbett HealthConnect.
<P>
On the other hand, some agencies, while working on managed care programs, have preferred not to create specialized groups. As of early June, these include Torre Renta Lazur, Medicus, Becker, Lewis Gace Bozell, fcb Healthcare, Dugan/Farley, and kpr.
<P>
Given this difference in organization, it is not surprising that there are differences of opinion on the proper agency structure. Addressing the issue of a specialized unit within an agency, an ad executive told me, "We tried it three years ago. Over time, we realized we needed more than we could provide in-house so we went outside. In-house expertise seemed to lack credibility. Even though we had the managed care experience, clients still viewed us as agency people." Bob Irwin of Becker, however, argues for a strong agency connection. "I think it's better to have mco-knowledgeable people on staff who have continuity with the client, understand the product's strategic direction and the client culture ... people who are immediately available." Inside or outside? What about a combination approach? Steve Girgenti of ghbm and Gavin Scotti of Klemtner endorse this direction—an internal group drawing on outside consultants. Girgenti is skeptical of claims agencies make of competence in managed care based on adding mco heavyweights to staff. "Some of it is pure hype," he remarks.
<P>
The use of outside consultants was common to all agencies I talked with. Given the void in managed care marketing knowledge at agencies a few years back, it followed that the "consultant panel" route would be taken for practical advise on programs for clients and education for the agency. And, reflecting Girgenti's view, displaying mco connections or academic "names" has a competitive rationale. Jerry Avorn of Harvard heads up gtfh's list of "strategic alliances." fcb Healthcare points to Albert Vandura of Stanford. mc2adams stresses Tim Thomas. Links with Kaiser Permanente, Prucare, Humana, Diversified Pharmaceuticals, Oxford Healthcare, and Aetna are cited by agencies as brainpower resources.
<P>

<H3>In On The Ground Floor</H3>
An influence on the assembly of consultant panels, specialized mco units, and, in general, tooling up for managed care, has been the amount of managed care work the agency was doing before the industry swung in this direction. If you were lucky enough to have had a client or two conducting managed care programs in the late Ô80's or early Ô90s, or visionary enough to have pursued this kind of business, you have a running start on the trend. Ted Maurer of hls, which has formed a joint venture with Ferguson 2000, CommonHealth usa, says he was telling clients about the importance of this new market back when the message fell on deaf ears. "It was a lonely ride on the train," he remembers. "Clients felt they didn't have to deal with price pressure from managed care. They were going to have the high tech drugs that would be in demand. Well, they were wrong ... Everything today is some version of managed care."
<P>
hls built its expertise in managed care—producing, for example, the authoritative survey, The Managed Care Digest, for Marion Merrell Dow—and was well-positioned for the current scene with an experienced mco staff and connections in the field. hls, along with the Hastings Healthcare Group; Sturm, Rosenberg, Cafferate; and Emron are examples of specialized agencies and marketing companies which are now attracting clients based on their experience with managed care marketing before it came into its own. Torre Renta Lazur is representative of a healthcare agency which benefited from early mco assignments. With trl, the products were Tagamet, which influenced by genericization, began aggressive selling to mcos and pbms versus Zantac, and skb's line of products which the company also directed at the managed care market. There is no "official" managed care unit at trl, according to Joe Torre. "mco's are the market," he says. "All of our group works on mco programs."
<P>
The acquisition and organization of expertise on managed care is a major element in the adaptation of healthcare agencies to the new marketing environment. The direction an agency takes has a great deal to do with its previous experience in managed care, corporate affiliation, client mix, and operating philosophy. Regardless of these factors, which make every agency a special case, I believe the economics of the business will encourage the outside and outside/inside, hybrid structure, rather than the inside, specialized division. Agency staffing has been shrinking in the past few years as the costs of carrying employees has risen. Added overhead, in the form of a specialized service, is hard to maintain. It may be useful promotionally to dramatize an agency's investment in managed care by creating a mco unit, but if managed care is the wave of the future, the services it performs will likely be absorbed into the agency's everyday operations. Managed care units, hopefully, by their success, will put themselves out of business by becoming part of the essential fabric of the agency.
<P>

<H3>Doing the Work</H3>
Developing know-how in managed care is the first stage toward functioning in the new environment. Second, is doing the work. Agencies have not done enough mco programs, or chose to be closed-mouth on the subject, or had nothing new to report on how their operations have changed. I raised the subject of the need to regionalize programs to coincide with the local nature of managed care and the decentralization going on at Rx companies. Clay Warrington of Dugan/Farley told me that his company had been involved in a program that called for three different campaigns on a brand—West Coast, Midwest, and East Coast. Meetings were held with the three regional managers to satisfy the needs for these parts of the country which are in different phases of mco development. fcb Healthcare is preparing for the modification of programs to local preferences with a service it calls Key Customer Center at its San Francisco office. The flexibility and rapid turn-around time of a computer installation working with an "electronic highway" for immediate communications among agency, client branch, and home office will be used to tailor programs for specific markets.
<P>
In talking regionalization, I got the impression that the agencies felt they were equipped to handle the complexity and volume of work such programs could entail. Computer technology is central in dealing with the potential workload, but beyond this mechanical aspect, a number of agencies said they already understood what is involved in creating multiple versions of a basic campaign. The learning experience for them has been international advertising/promotion—"core" campaigns on which many of them have worked for years. "Core is the model," says Pat McTigue of Corbett. "We must be prepared for regional extension and adaptations of a U.S. marketing approach just the way we provided for national modification of a global campaign."
<P>
An agency's organization, staffing, and even philosophy, is determined by its client base. The axiom, "You're only as good as your clients," has added meaning in this new managed care environment. If agencies are in an uncertain transition right now, it is because their clients are in flux. Also, in the past, there was commonality in Rx marketing—to simplify: scientific programs, fieldforce coverage, announcement, and reminder activities in print and other media. Today, we have industry pursuing very different marketing strategies based on differing corporate strategies—again, to simplify: research, distribution, pricing, consumer promotion, marketing efficiency, and the futuristic vision of disease management, as well as combinations of these directions within a company.
<P>
Things have not settled down and, undoubtedly, we will not go back to the homogeneous system that existed for almost 40 years beginning with the pharmaceutical boom of the mid-1950's and extended until the political crisis on healthcare of 1993/94. The industry is likely to break down into segments defined by marketing approaches. Agencies may specialize in particular segments—disease management, for example, or, consider this, the private practice market which will continue in tandem with managed care. And, some will stress multiple segments and the continuity between markets.
<P>

<H3>The BIG Picture Gets BIGGER</H3>
Regardless of the outcome, the shake up at companies may have a positive effect on agencies. It may mean more business for them and a renewed raison d'etat if they can provide the services needed. Ted Maurer of hls and CommonHealth usa, calls attention to the pharmaceutical marketing problems now confronting clients. "They face an audience segmented as never before and a range of new issues—formulary pull-through, outcome studies, disease management, the economies of their product, patient satisfaction, and quality of life concerns. You can't spread this over 13 suppliers. You need a holistic view and someone to help pull it all together. That help can come from us." McTigue of Corbett also sees the opportunity. "Marketing now has a vastly more diverse audience and needs comprehensive planning at an entirely higher level than in the past," he says.
<P>
Complicating the problem for product management is client downsizing. Anticipating a profit squeeze down the road, companies have been trimming personnel so that home office staffs are smaller with more to do. Girgenti notes the disruption this has caused at clients and sees a tendency to turn to agencies for more services and to use agencies to help headquarters maintain control over a more decentralized marketing operation. Lynn O'Conner Vos of gtfh also notes this consequence of downsizing and points out another factor favoring more work for agencies. "Managed care strategies," she says, "are too crucial, too sensitive, to share with multiple suppliers. Security is an issue."
<P>
Consolidation of business in fewer hands is a reprise of "The Whole Egg" approach popularized by Young & Rubicam in consumer advertising. Y&R and others have practiced it for years and it is alive and well today in the industry. A concentration approach was once common in Rx advertising as well. However, the rise of the product manager system at pharmaceutical companies and the advent of mega-brands led to a fragmentation of "company" accounts into product assignments with product management employing multiple agencies and a long list of specialized suppliers. Does the prospect of mind-boggling marketing programs for PMs signal more consolidation of business at agencies?
<P>
As the marketing components become more overlapping—clinical studies to formulary acceptance to outcomes research, for example—consolidation seems to make sense. The challenge agencies face is to provide these services. Agencies with multiple departments—public relations, professional education, sales training, dtc—and with corporate connections to such capacities as packaging, company identity, and direct marketing would appear to be properly positioned for clients looking for a range of services under one roof. O'Conner Vos feels, "The broader agencies will be the ones that survive." She also predicts greater agency consolidation paralleling industry consolidation.
<P>
Bigness often leads to complacency and then to vulnerability. That danger always accompanies success, but from what I saw, no agency of size is sitting back as managed care remakes pharmaceutical marketing. Everyone is preoccupied with how to catch the wave of change. Size and corporate resources also provides for investment in new ideas and experimentation.
<P>
fcb Healthcare, for example, is putting time and money into a new service called MindLink (more creative flare)—a hardware/software system designed to make the computer a "meeting ground" between agency and client. John Corcoran describes it as "an electronic account executive," and says, "It will speed up the agency-client process and minimize travel. With the company's medical and legal departments in the loop, it will take a lot of the back-and-forth out of clearing work."
<P>
Medicus has formed Com-Med Interactive, bringing in Wendy Borow from the ama tv operation as its head. The unit's mission, as explained by Nick Maiale of Medicus, is "to act as a facilitator on the information superhighway to customize the new electronic technology to client needs." Lewis Gace Bozell has set up the Advance Technology Group also aimed at interactive technology. Small agencies most likely will not be able to fund activities like these. Bigness does have its advantages.
<P>
The agency business, however, has always been an idea competition. Resources have counted, but new thinking has always been in demand. What is healthy right now for healthcare agencies is that managed care and the threat it poses to the status quo is stimulating recruitment of people from managed care providers into agencies, involvement with outside brainpower and a plethora of experimental ideas. Beyond the specialized companies like hls and Emron, which have been in managed care for some time, it is gratifying to see those who have extended themselves beginning to gain a new class of clients which will let them expand their experience in managed care marketing. Client assignments and project work of interest are: Aetna at gtfh, Stadtlanders (a pbm) at Medicus, patient recruitment for a Lilly clinical research study at Corbett, Columbia Presbyterian at trl, disease management programs for Prudential at mc2adams and for Boehringer Ingelheim at Dugan/ Farley, mco work for Bristol-Meyers Squibb at Becker and for Burroughs Wellcome's Zovirax at kpr, a pharmoeconomic study for Multimmune (a biotech company) at lmp/Oracle, and J&J Healthcare Systems at CommonHealth usa.
<P>

<H3>Toward the New Healthcare Ad Agency</H3>
New activities for existing clients and new kinds of mco clients mean greater diversity of personnel and the development of different promotional skills. The agencies I talked with appear to be evolving beyond what they were in the early '90s. Consider these new areas in which agencies are now prepared to work—disease management, clinical research, patient recruitment, outcome studies, chemotherapy economics, patient data collection, and clinical mapping. Certainly, agencies have been involved in these activities in the past, but what is significant is that so many agencies are now moving into these areas with personnel and organizational structure. As client needs broaden, and the concentration of business becomes more attractive, agencies will provide more "consultant" services. "Some of our biggest competitors are consultant firms," says Lynn O'Conner Vos of gtfh.
<P>
What about copy and layout—the compelling headline and the striking graphic which were the hallmark of healthcare agencies? A number of the agencies I talked with stressed communication skills and branding/positioning expertise as the agency's basic mission. The action right now, however, appears to be in marketing services for managed care. Agencies need a range of mco abilities and experience to land creative assignments.
<P>
The healthcare ad agency came into being in the 1950s as a specialized variant of the industrial ad agency. It developed in response to the sales environment of the burgeoning pharmaceutical industry with departmental structure and operational features that set it apart from other agencies—for example, preoccupation with new product introductions, medical staffing, and emphasis on frequency rather than reach in media buying. Now, with a change in the pharmaceutical marketing landscape, the evolution continues. Darwin would be amazed by today's high-tech science, but he would have no trouble understanding what is happening to the healthcare advertising agency.

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>Women in the pharmaceutical industry reflect the difficulty and slow gains made by executive women in general. The one area of overwhelming success, however, is in the advertising segment, where women are a dominant factor. But change is coming as women are taken more seriously and are admitted into the unwritten corporate mentor system.</I>
<P>
Each year the Healthcare Businesswomen's Association (hba) selects a "<A HREF="d:/cpsnet/gray3.jpg">Woman of the Year</A>." It's quite an impressive list. Anyone looking at it would be tempted to think: the women in the healthcare industry have really made it. But have they? Are these hba winners outstanding because they represent the strides made by women or, quite the contrary, because they are the notable exception?
<P>
If we are to be responsible members of society, this is a question that concerns not only our industry, but corporate America at large. We continue to receive mixed signals regarding the progress of women in the workplace. The total percentage of woman in the labor force has barely budged—from 43 percent in 1981 to 46 percent ten years later, the latest year for which such figures are available. Women are still most heavily concentrated in traditionally "female" occupations such as nursing and secretarial job.
<P>
Yet, they have made impressive inroads in a few historically male-dominated occupations such as engineering, public office, and the law. (See "<A HREF="gray1.jpg">Women at Work</A>") And impressive gains have been made in middle echelon management positions. There, women's representation rose from 27 percent to 41 percent in that same ten-year period. Ah, but then comes the "glass ceiling": the percentage of women among senior executives went from an infinitesimal one percent to a still insignificant three percent.
<P>
Unfortunately, no comparable data are available specifically on the healthcare industry, but there is no reason to believe that this business is motivated any less or any more by social, ethical, or commercial considerations. In other words, it's tough out there and getting tougher, whether you are a man or a woman, whether you are selling pharmaceuticals or playground equipment or pickled beets. Charlotte Sibley, director of segment selling at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., says, "I think women have made great strides, but I also think that today, as the industry changes, it's harder for anyone—man or woman—to succeed in the pharmaceutical and related industries."
<P>

<H3>Things vary</H3>
Sibley—who is also a member of Medical Marketing & Media's editorial board—naturally focused on career opportunities on the production side of our industry. Things are not uniform throughout the business. Joyce Valk-Raczko, senior vice president and management group supervisor at Lyons, Lavey, Nickel, Swift, a leading medical agency, has a different take. The advertising segments of the healthcare industry is a knockout success for women seeking executive positions (see "<A HREF="gray2.jpg">Production v. Promotion</A>"). In fact, says Valk-Raczko, there may even be more women working in healthcare advertising agencies than men. "The reasons for women's success in healthcare advertising," says Valk-Raczko, "may be due, in part, to the fact that the skills and qualities needed in advertising, such as being understanding, having good listening skills and being very attentive to detail, are strengths that are traditionally associated with women."
<P>

<H3>Yes, it's harder—but it's changing</H3>
Women have been in the industry for over 20 years now, and they have worked side by side with men, so there's much more gender comfort in the workplace. As the industry goes through rapid change there is an increasing focus on performance, whereas in the early days there was more subjectiveness in the workplace.
<P>
Joan Keith, vice president of Strategic Business Planning, Cardiovasculars, at Bristol-Myers Squibb says that things are improving from the old days. "Not because of any innate prejudice in the workplace, but because of the Ôlike me' factor. At a certain level, every candidate for a position has to be exceptionally competent, because the system weeds out people who don't do the job well. And anytime you have a number of highly competent people vying for a job, an additional factor in filling the position is whether the person doing the hiring is comfortable with you."
<P>
Carol Webb, president of Ortho Biotech, Inc., is one of a small minority of women who captain a company in the pharmaceutical industry. "Yes," she said, "it has been harder, but it's changing. Everyone is becoming more comfortable with women in leadership positions, and characteristics that traditionally have been defined as inherently female, such as caring, are now seen as strengths."
<P>

<H3>Aspects of leadership</H3>
In order for women in any field to succeed, they have to take charge of their career. Sibley suggests that women should assess their strengths, develop the skills and qualifications that will enable them to compete for the position they choose, do the job successfully, and build credibility within their company by making decisions, taking risks, and sharing information.
<P>
Webb adds that women want to be judged on their merit, not their gender, and to be recognized for their attributes as career professionals—and as professional women. "One of the reasons I have succeeded is that I have been able to establish credibility. I have never made gender an issue." 
<P>
Confidence is another aspect of leadership. "If over the years you are repeatedly moved forward, you become more confident, and your leadership emerges," says Webb. "A very shy person will have a hard time being a strong leader. Having the opportunity to be placed in a position where I could be a leader was critical to my success. Until you are put in the position where you can use those skills, you can't develop them. Fortunately, I've always been put into situations where people have allowed me to take the ball and run with it, which in turn enabled me to become more self-secure. I'm a risk taker—and you have to be in order to progress." Bristol's Keith also admits she's a risk taker and is flexible about accepting challenges. In her opinion, "Getting bored is a bigger risk to me than making mistakes."  
<P>

<H3>Mentors help</H3>
Call it hitching your wagon to a star, the old boy network, or just making the right connections, men have always had mentors to give them a boost up success' ladder. Now women are benefiting from the help mentors offer. Webb attributes part of her success to having mentors who brought her forward. "You can get lost otherwise. Anyone can do an excellent job and get lost in the shuffle if no one recognizes the good work being done. It's really no different for men or women. The problem for women has been that men had to feel more comfortable with women in their work roles, before they could serve as their mentors," she points out. "Given an opportunity, a lot of people blossom and become great leaders, but sometimes they are never given the opportunity." 
<P>
Gary Parlin, Company Group Chairman at Johnson & Johnson, and Dennis Longstreet, chairman of Johnson & Johnson Healthcare Systems, whom Webb succeeded as President of Ortho Biotech, helped her to move forward. They, and the company as a whole, devoted significant time to helping her develop into an effective manager and leader. "I owe a great deal to that corporate commitment," says Webb. 
<P>
Currently, managers at Ortho Biotech are going through an assessment center to help them determine their strengths and the areas that need development. Aggressive plans will then be formulated to help these people hone their skills. 
<P>
"Some people can develop the skills on their own," says Webb, "and some need to be developed. I don't think it matters in the end how the process occurs, but it has to happen somehow. Dennis and Gary gave me a lot of exposure, a lot of authority, and helped me by offering feedback. You have to be open to feedback, though, and some people aren't. They can't acknowledge that they aren't perfect. If you're not open to feedback, you are going to stay where you are."
<P>
The environment at Ortho Biotech has helped Webb and others to progress. The credo of J&J stresses the importance of people to the company and of meeting the needs of the employees. Their Women's Leadership Initiative is helping women today, even in a demanding climate during which business pressures threaten to squeeze such programs off the priority list.
<P>

<H3>Skills for the upward climb</H3>  
The Peter Principle states that sooner or later everyone rises to the level of their incompetence. The serious aspect of this supposed truism is that, as one's career flourishes, at some point it becomes necessary not only to do your own job well but to learn to supervise others. This has been particularly difficult for women. 
<P>
According to Keith, one of the most important management skills for women to master is a willingness to let go—to hire the best people, to train them, and then give them the freedom to do their job. "In a very fast moving environment, the old control models of management are just not viable," she says.
<P>
The idea that the best solutions are forced down from the top is obsolete, says Keith. You have to give people a sense of pride in what they do, train them, and give them the flexibility to take command. "You shouldn't be afraid to hire good people because they may outshine you," she says. People who have this fear have missed the point. Success is not a one-person show. I pride myself on the ability to connect ideas in new ways, but I don't have all of the answers. To me, the person who believes he or she should hire people who won't challenge them is establishing a program for failure—rather than a program for success. I don't succeed individually. I succeed only if my coworkers succeed and if my company succeeds." 
<P>
Webb says that the greatest obstacle she's faced as her career progress is herself. "If you allow issues to become too important or too gnawing, you defeat yourself. You've got to love what you're doing, and I do. A lot of men and women can be their own worst enemies if they are not willing to make the changes necessary to move forward. People have to realize that they have to take responsibility for their actions. Anyone can move forward in their career if they are willing to take risks, devote enough time to their development and find a company that fits their personality."
<P>
In the past, healthcare companies had very rigid career tracks that people followed to reach their goal. Now, more companies are focusing on letting people have the opportunity to learn by making parallel movements into different disciplines. "I think this trend is wonderful," says Keith, "because it's almost impossible to have a pure vision of where our industry is going to go and the lines between functions are blurring substantially. If you are a marketer, it's no longer enough to be a pure marketer. You also have to understand the cost basis of products and deal-making."
<P>
People should take advantage of these opportunities to make parallel moves to broaden their skill base, says Keith. "If you are in marketing, see if there's a chance for you to spend some time in finance or manufacturing. A broad skill base is going to be a tremendous asset in dealing with change. In a fast-changing industry, it's critically important to keep your options open. Then, as the industry evolves and branches into new areas, your flexibility will be a plus."
<P>
The emphasis on downsizing, the radical changes in the healthcare market, the search for new corporate missions that are endemic in today's healthcare environment make this the most exciting or frightening of times. Keith compares the upheavals we are experiencing to the uncertainties and challenges of war. "Wars make generals," she says. "Because of the rapid changes going on, tremendous opportunities for growth are opening up for those people who jump in and do it. Flexibility and acceptance of change are two keys to success. The industry is waiting for people who can approach ideas in nontraditional ways. As change occurs worldwide, there's a tremendous opportunity to learn from each of the markets and discover creative ideas in each."
<P>
Clearly, the pharmaceutical industry is being confronted on all sides by challenge without precedent. "It's a time that requires strong leadership," says Webb, "and it's a moment women should seize."

<TITLE>Medical Marketing & Media, MM&M, Product positioning isn't dead ... yet</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<CENTER>
<H2>Product positioning isn't dead ... yet</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by Arthur Goldberg</I></H4>

<HR>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>Product branding and positioning remains important in the managed care market, but only if marketers react pro-actively to untraditional opportunities. This means focusing on the customer rather than the product, supporting and educating the private physician, repositioning the product, and maintaining sufficient marketing resources.</I>
<P>
By now, every healthcare marketer has—or should have—wondered whether our assumptions about product branding and positioning (b&p) are still valid in the managed care environment. Branding and positioning is a shorthand way of defining a product's unique features so that it occupies a specific place against its competitors. The more attractive and distinctive the position, the more clearly the brand stands out in the marketplace.
<P>
Before the advent of managed care, a great deal of thought, concerted effort, and resources went into building a brand, staking out a position, and supporting it in either the physicians' or the consumers' mind, depending on the market.
<P>
Times have changed all that. With managed care enrollment approaching critical mass nationwide, managed care organizations (mcos) are controlling pricing, and generic substitutions are becoming the norm. In response, some marketers are merely reacting to the managed care environment rather than pro-actively seizing these new, untraditional opportunities. Some even still cling to the emphasis on product rather than focusing on the customer first. Even with the pace of managed care penetration accelerating, there is a two- to five-year window of opportunity left open to continue product marketing as we know it. Marketers should now be asking themselves the questions: How important is it to devote marketing resources to product branding and positioning? To gain position on the formulary, has not the emphasis shifted to deal-making and inventive value-added programs? Isn't such managed care marketing now more important than creating a position in the marketplace?
<P>
In the mco environment, a pharmaceutical product is judged on the basis of its indications and outcomes in disease management, balanced with its price. This product cost-benefit ratio varies with each mco, but it is always a factor to consider. mcos also look at the pharmaceutical company as a whole in terms of
<P>

<UL>
<LI>its current product line and service offerings,
<LI>its future pipeline, and
<LI>what else it brings to the table to manage health better.
</UL>

Yet, bottom line, mcos still seek "the deal," with a willingness to sacrifice a small feature for another product's better price.
<P>
Against this backdrop, it is easy for branding and positioning to get lost in the battle. On the surface, one can easily assume that b&p no longer matters. However, a closer look uncovers some powerful arguments for supporting b&p in marketing activities both in the private and managed care sectors. Further, to counter the mcos' point of view—where products are becoming standardized and interchangeable—the imperative for the marketer is to customize the offering and make its brand positioning unique.
<P>

<H3>Physician choice still matters</H3>
While physicians and patients in states where managed care penetration is high feel the influence of the formulary in prescribing decisions, a vast market still exists in private practice drug choices. Private practice physicians still have the prescribing prerogative in choosing one medication over another in the best interests of their patients. To some extent, they have the same choices within the managed care context, although it may be a more expensive choice for themselves and their patients. Regardless of the practice setting, physicians need to be supported in their choices. Although the private practice market is dwindling, it will always exist to some extent and brand image will still be important.
<P>
Further, and perhaps overlooked, is the necessity for educating the continuing stream of new physicians and, more importantly, new formulary decision-makers, through on-going programs in medical schools and traditional journal advertising in both medical and managed care publications, along with the other menu items of direct mail, symposiums, and sponsorships. Each year brings a fresh crop of people who must be exposed to the brand message.
<P>
Rather than abandoning traditional product branding and positioning, marketers should reposition their products in light of this new age of managed care. The internal organization of today's pharmaceutical manufacturers must be restructured to meet the demands for service of its new customers—the mcos. That means defining, in addition to the corporation's credo, each individual mco's mission, characteristics, marketing plan, demographic and geographic coverage, current and future markets, and perceived needs. Rather than simply selling pills to health care management, the focus now shifts from the product to the customer.
<P>

<H3>Know thy customer</H3>
Smart marketers know they must first learn their customers' method of formulary operations, what they are looking for and what they really want. Only then can the product be packaged to fit the mco's profile and increase the likelihood of the sale. That package might include pricing, cost-effectiveness data, patient-education materials, physician education programs, and pull-through programs among other requests.
<P>
What this means is that b&p's role for an existing product is clearly reformulated and diminished, but not eliminated. While branding presence raises the question of the outcomes dilemma—what is it really worth to continue?—the pharmaceutical company's continuing support of branding should be promoted to the mco as helpful to their providers' education. A strong professional product education program, mindful of the mco's particular parameters, can support the mco's interest in product outcomes efficiency by helping physicians choose the drug as "appropriate use." In this way, all parties' interests are well served, with the common interest in patient health as the unifying goal. But the responsibility falls to the pharmaceutical company's marketing and sales team to position the branded product and its supporting programs as key to the mco's interests.
<P>

<H3>The challenge for new products</H3>
While existing products have the opportunity to be repositioned in the managed care marketplace, new products have a different challenge. With a fresh drawing board, the focus must be first on the customer's needs and wants in developing strategic plans and communications for a new product.
<P>
New products make for an even stronger case for a b&p emphasis and for structuring their introduction. With many new drugs offering only incremental improvements and no new blockbusters in the offing, new products have to be readily identifiable as creating a valuable addition to the marketplace and the formulary. The whole constellation of ingredient formulation, drug delivery system, indications, clinical outcomes, cost-benefits, pricing, and professional-consumer support programs require astute packaging to build a discernible difference in the mind of the buyer and his agenda. The new product still needs a convincing image, which may consist of a favorable side-effects profile, better outcomes, efficacy, rapidity of action, ease of use, or other demonstrated difference.
<P>

<H3>The brand image is the company</H3>
Taking the lead by branding is a valuable asset and, as such, should be supported in the private practice and managed care sectors. Building a solid brand image (such as innovation) can become a reflection of the company itself (as innovative), opening the door to sales opportunities for the manufacturer's other pharmaceuticals in the managed care marketplace. In essence, product branding is the messenger for additional sales of other products.
<P>
If branding and positioning are to continue to be a vital element in marketing pharmaceuticals, then the question becomes "How do we allocate resources best to maximize effectiveness in managed care marketing?" Despite the expanded demand on resources that managed care marketing entails, devoting sufficient resources to b&p is a wise investment. How much is determined by measures of effectiveness: awareness and use studies. An existing product, barring new indications, requires maintenance to defend its position. For new products, the requirement lies in the answer as to how much it will take to achieve a desired level of awareness and use. Regardless of the dollar amount, part of the budget should be reserved for maintaining and enhancing the brand and its position.
<P>
Rather than being viewed as unnecessary, obsolete, or inconsequential in the near-chaotic scheme that is medical marketing today, product b&p still count and should be looked upon as yet another way to command attention and create a favorable climate for the product. To do less would not only undermine all else that is planned for the product, but would hurt the long-term objective of establishing the pharmaceutical company as a valuable contributor to the health management industry.

<H2>Splicing into the Genetic Market</H2>
</CENTER>


<H4><I>by Dan Angress</I></H4>


<HR>


<H3>Executive summary:</H3>
<I>The rapidly expanding genetic research industry promises to become a multi-billion market within a short period of time. There will be a shift of pharmaceutical R&D to related applications in therapeutics, but caution is necessary as unexplored areas of business, science, ethics, and religion temper the explosive opportunities ahead. Marketing of genetic therapies will require understanding of these complex issues.</I>
<P>
Forty-two year old Bob has just completed his annual physical. Along with the normal barrage of pushing, poking, and bloodletting, Bob fills out a questionnaire on his health record. Bob, as it turns out, has a family history of colon cancer. Although Bob shows no symptoms of the disease, his doctor knows that at least 15 percent of all colon cancer has a genetic predisposition, placing Bob in a higher risk category. He offers Bob a simple blood test that can reveal the gene mutations that predispose him to developing colon cancer. Bob and his family are also encouraged to place a sample of blood in a DNA bank so that as new genes are discovered, tests can be performed on the stored samples. This information can help Bob and his doctor set preventive changes in Bob's lifestyle that will reduce the chance that Bob will develop the disease. In addition, new gene therapy may eliminate the mutation altogether.
<P>
Science fiction? Not at all. It is science, but the only fictional element is Bob. This scenario represents one example of a clinical application of research going on today that has created an industry expected to mushroom in this decade and explode in the twenty-first century.
<P>
In 1994 alone, nearly $300 million was spent by the federal government and the investment community on genetic-related ventures. The reason is a powerful one—every gene that is identified becomes a potential revenue source. Consider just three numbers. First, that there are more than 100,000 genes in the human genome. Second, that more than 3,000 diseases are genetically based. And third, that research on more than 200 of them is already advanced enough to be targeted for gene therapy. They add up to an enormous market potential, with estimates ranging in the billions. And working hard to reap their share of the profits are not only a large and growing group of biotechnology firms, but virtually every major pharmaceutical company. Any way you analyze it, the marketing of genetics products will soon have a dramatic impact on the healthcare market. Understanding the issues and opportunities is the key to success.
<P>

<H3>Where we are now</H3>
The ability to diagnose genetic disease has developed rapidly over the past 20 years. The Human Genome Project of the National Institute of Health (NIH), with its ambitious goal of mapping and sequencing the entire genome by 2005, will bring a further explosion in our knowledge of the structure and function of human genes. Leading the technology push are more than 30 of the top genetic scientists in the world, including several Nobel prize winners. As proof of the government's commitment, Congress this year increased the budget for this project 22 percent. The promise of these scientific advances is the treatment, cure, and eventual prevention of genetic disorders. Today, we already have the capability to detect some genetically based diseases or increased susceptibility to disease (see <A HREF="genefig1.jpg">Table 1, Disease Conditions with Currently Available Genetic Test)</A>, but effective treatments and cures are still rare. The near future holds gene therapy treatments that include drugs uniquely formulated to the requirements of an individual's DNA, covering everything from diabetes and cancer to baldness and acne. The knowledge curve is growing exponentially, and with it tremendous opportunities for clinical applications.
<P>
Initially, industry growth will be fastest in companies concentrating on the pursuit of gene discovery, laboratory testing, and diagnostic product development. We will also see more pharmaceutical company R&D dollars shifted to related applications in therapeutics, involving gene therapy and disease intervention of predisposed conditions. After that, it won't take long for managed care companies to begin to see the cost benefits of triaging members with family histories of genetic disease into different treatment and disease prevention protocols. Genetic counselors and other specialists will be in high demand as new protocols are generated throughout the healthcare system. Peripheral industries such as insurance database management companies and various government bodies will also be affected.
<P>
Although the opportunities are great, caution is highly recommended from those who have already ventured into these waters. On the science side, unraveling the genetic code is simply the starting point. Next comes research on the gene and cell function followed by the effect of the environment on formation and reproduction of cells. Only then can a test be developed and released to the medical community outside a research protocol. Just as important are the ethical issues of genetic testing, and the general acceptance among physicians and patients. A recent Time/CNN poll found that a majority of those surveyed (58 percent) think that altering human genes is against the will of God. Asked whether they would take a genetic test that could tell them what diseases they were likely to suffer later in life, nearly as many people said they'd prefer to remain ignorant (49 percent) as said they would like to know (50 percent). Clearly, these attitudes will affect the increasing number of public-policy decisions related to genetic testing that will have to be made over the next five to ten years. Yet it is my conviction that ultimately little will stop the advance of science. That is not to minimize the problems that anyone entering this field will have to overcome (see <A HREF="geneside.html">Roadblocks and Pitfalls</A>). The importance of these societal issues is demonstrated by the fact that one entire branch of NIH's Human Genome Project deals with the ethical, legal, and social implications, and is supporting research that explores ways of ensuring that genetic information is used responsibly.
<P>

<H3>Three market segments</H3>
The market for genetics can be divided into three major sectors: gene discovery, genetic testing, and gene therapy.
<P>
Gene discovery companies are primarily involved in mapping (positional cloning) and sequencing of the genes responsible for a particular disease. This is basically an extension of the Human Genome Project, but with more of a focus on understanding gene function. To substantiate a gene's role in a disease, the utility must be established by tracing the gene's patterns of heredity through a sample of families with both healthy and afflicted members.
<P>
The financial success of these discovery companies is dependent on their ability to hold patent rights to the diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and then license these rights or form alliances with other companies such as large pharmaceutical manufacturers. Some of these companies are combining the advances made in computer technology and applying them to the gene discovery process. Applications are also being developed and licensed in body imaging products and devices, as well as more esoteric applications such as biosensor technologies (see <A HREF="genefig2.jpg">Table 2, Leading Gene Discovery Companies</A>).
<P>
Genetic testing companies are the service centers for many of the applications and include reference laboratories, cancer centers, and eventually managed care organizations. This sector will be the focal point of major change in health care delivery by shifting the emphasis from diagnosis and treatment to disease prediction and prevention. While many gene-based applications are being used today in the diagnosis and prognosis of diseases, it is the area of predisposition testing that will provide the shift to disease prediction.
<P>
To illustrate this point, the discovery of many disease-specific genes including several major cancer genes (breast and colon) has already created the need for new services, such as cancer risk counseling, DNA banking, and gene data management. In addition, laboratory automation improvements stemming from advances in microelectronics, physics, and information processing have encouraged another peripheral niche of companies hoping to significantly drive down the cost of genetic testing (see <A HREF="genefig3.jpg">Table 3</A> and <A HREF="genefig4.jpg">Table 4</A>).
<P>
A fundamental point for healthcare marketers to keep in mind is that knowledge has increased so rapidly that many physicians are unaware of the advances genetic testing has made in their respective specialties. In fact, little data is available to help physicians understand the role genetic testing can play in managing their patients. Therefore, education of these doctors will be critical to achieving acceptance. More specifically, the new technology will have to be integrated into healthcare marketing on a disease-by-disease basis. For example, a marketer of diabetes products will have to first understand and then convey to prescribers and patients the advances being made in genetic research related to diabetes-associated diseases.
<P>
Gene therapy companies are currently led by small biotech firms with financial ties or partnerships with larger pharmaceutical or diagnostic companies. Their goal is to develop therapeutic agents with specific desired properties that can be used to cure or treat genetically-based disorders. Genes encode the recipes for proteins which make up the hormones and enzymes upon which the body depends. Defective genes generate defective proteins; missing genes generate no proteins at all. When there is a surplus or deficit of a protein, disease sets in.
<P>
Gene therapy is basically a better drug delivery mechanism. It allows the necessary proteins to reach the appropriate sites without the problems associated with conventional drugs. Approximately 150 gene therapy procedures have been approved or are in clinical trials today. In cancer alone, there are over 30 experimental trials of gene therapy approved in the U.S. A handful of these experiments will result in valuable treatment applications and significantly affect the bottom line of those companies...as well as the well-being of millions of patients (see <A HREF="genefig5.jpg">Table 5, Leading Gene Therapy Companies, above right</A>).
<P>
The marketing of products stemming from genetic research will require more than traditional good marketing and sales skills. Also required will be a broad understanding of the complex scientific, ethical, and business issues relevant to these new products. This overview may serve as a useful introduction to this complex but fascinating—and potentially vastly profitable—new marketing segment. There will be not only advances but also shakeouts, setbacks, and fluctuating investor interest. The winners will be those who see the vision of the science and prepare for it in a well-planned approach.

<HR>

<I><H3>Executive summary:</H3>
In a period of declining personal sales activity, physician meetings and events are increasing. Monitoring M&E, as well as physicians' prescribing behavior before and after events, allows study of a company's marketing strategy and the success of that strategy.</I>
<P>
As resources grow scarce and money gets tight, pharmaceutical companies are seeking more cost-effective ways to educate, communicate with, and conduct market research with physicians. As a result, many companies are doing less personal selling, but offsetting the decline with physician meetings and events.
<P>
Many industry observers are aware of the change, but not all appreciate just how dramatic the shift has been. From 1992 to 1994, the number of sales representatives declined by 12 percent, and personal detailing was down 7 percent. But for the same time period, meetings and events increased by 31 percent (see <A HREF="secrett1.jpg">Table 1, The Shifting Balance, 1993-1994</A>).
<P>
The term "meetings and events" covers a wide range of activities. For statistical purposes, it can range from informal dinners with residents to large symposia or conferences attended by several hundred physicians. Within this range includes promotional dinner meetings, peer selling groups, continuing medical education (CME) symposia, third-party marketing events, teleconferences and videoconferences, and market research groups.
<P>

<H3>The big picture</H3>
Pharmaceutical companies spent an estimated $500 million on meetings in 1994. Videoconferences and <A HREF="secrets2.html">teleconferences</A> accounted for about 15 percent of meeting activity, nearly doubling from only 8 percent in 1993.
<P>
According to Scott-Levin's Physician Meeting and Event Audit (PMEA) (see <A HREF="secrets1.html">How the PMEA Works</A>), the industry held more than 86,000 events in 1994, and this upward trend has continued in 1995. For first-quarter 1994, about 20,000 events were held; for first-quarter 1995, the figure is 24,190, an increase of 20 percent.
<P>
Monitoring meetings and events allows companies not only to discover which events work best for which products or classes, but also to measure the impact of CME events on physician prescribing, to track competitive event activity throughout the life cycle of products, and to determine the value of meetings.
<P>
When comparing product classes for meeting/event activity (see <A HREF="secrett2.jpg">Table 2</A>), note that meeting priority is not necessarily the same as detailing priority. In the mix of details, sampling, and other traditional promotional activities, meetings and events are obviously being used to meet somewhat different stratgic objectives.
<P>

<H3>Case study: Antidepressants</H3>
As an example of how M&E analysis works, let's take the case of antidepressants. The huge success of Prozac, and the launch of new competitors, has made antidepressants one of today's most active and competitive markets. So it is no surprise that this category is the most active therapeutic class in terms of meetings and events.
<P>
While detailing activity for antidepressants did increase by 12 percent in 1994, meetings and events increased much more Ñby 35 percent over the previous year. Antidepressants accounted for 5,300 meetings and events in 1994, which were attended by over 55,000 physicians. <A HREF="secrett3.jpg">Table 3</A> shows how much was spent on meetings and events for specific products; <A HREF="secrett4.jpg">Table 4</A> shows the costs per primary care physician.
Zoloft not only led the class in antidepressant activity, but was the second most-active product in the industry, trailing Abbott's Hytrin. Despite its recent (April 1994) launch, Effexor placed second with 30 percent of the class's events.
<P>
Monitoring meetings and events sheds light on a company's marketing strategy. For example, more than half the details in this category targeted primary care physicians. Also, half the Effexor and Paxil meetings were directed at primary care doctors.
<P>
However, 60 percent of physicians who attended Prozac events in 1994 were psychiatrists, while only about one-third of attendees were primary care physicians. Interestingly, while most of Zoloft attendees were in primary care, eight percent were OB/GYNS.
<P>

<H3>Measuring meeting impact</H3>
Numbers can only tell part of the story. More important is the bottom-line impact of meetings and events. Do they increase new prescriptions and reinforce existing prescribing habits?
<P>
Effexor events had the highest percentage of nonprescribers attending (30 percent), and also the strongest influence on prescribing. More than 60 percent of the 18,400 physicians attending events said they planned to start or increase prescribing.
<P>
Of course, what physicians say they'll do and what they actually end up doing can be two different things. To get a clearer picture of the payoff on event spending, better measures than the physicians' words are needed.
<P>
Fortunately, it's possible to monitor actual prescribing, and thus analyze the "dollar impact" of events by comparing the prescribing of both attendees and a "control group" of non-attending physicians. By contrasting the prescribing pattern of these two groups three months before and several months after the given event, it is possible to chart the ups and downs of prescribing and the number of new Rx's. The dollar impact is calculated via the average wholesale price.
<P>
Again, the antidepressant market provides a good example. When Wyeth released Effexor in early 1994, the company used meetings and events to introduce the product to physicians. Analysis of PMEA data shows how effective they were. Every physician attending Effexor events in the third quarter of 1994 wrote nearly four more new Rxs for Effexor in the following months than those who did not attend. This translates into additional Effexor sales of $1.4 million for the quarter.
<P>
A large percentage of meetings and events, of course, are for new product launches. It will be interesting to see the impact of Luvox and Serzone in this product class when the data becomes available.


<H3>Who attends and why?</H3>
<P>
In 1994, we conducted a nine-month study of 2,500 physicians to find out why physicians come to meetings. These doctors were invited to a total of 22,000 meetings and events.
<P>
Not surprisingly, we found that honoraria are important to attract physicians to meetings. Far more physicians took up invitations to events where honoraria were offered than invitations without (44 percent versus 33 percent).
<P>
Some types of honoraria attract physicians more than others. Money works best Ñ not necessarily in the form of direct payments to physicians but also in the form of contributions to charities (see <A HREF="secrett5.jpg">Table 5, Who Will Attend Events?</A>).
<P>
While physicians often say continuing medical education credits are a major determinant of attendance, they actually have less of an impact than one might suspect. The main reason given for attending a meeting, cited by four-fifths of doctors, was interest in the topic. CME was mentioned by only 17 percent, and fewer than 10 percent declined invitations on the grounds that CME credits were not offered. In fact, just about as many physicians attended non-CME events as those which did offer credits (43 percent versus 42 percent).
<P>
This does not mean, however, that companies shouldn't bother with CME credits. While CME might not entice physicians to attend, it does lead to better reviews of meetings. Physicians say they generally find cme events to be more educational, objective, and useful than non-CME events (see <A HREF="secrets3.html">Meetings and Events: Who's doing what</A>).
<P>

<H3>An evaluation</H3>
Despite the growth in meetings, don't expect the solo sales rep to disappear. For certain products and certain situations, personal selling is still the best way to communicate, but budget constraints and staff cuts make it necessary to supplement it with other promotional techniques. Survey results show that metings and events are one of the techniques companies are increasingly turning to in order to get their messages across.
<P>
Fortunately, there is both quantitative and qualitative information to help them measure the effectiveness of their efforts.

<H2>Virtual  Reality Gives New Eyes to Physicians
</H2>
</CENTER>


<H4><I>by Milt Liebman</I></H4>


<HR>

<H3>Executive summary:</H3>
<I>Sophisticated interactive computer techniques are proving to be highly effective sales tools at professional meetings. As an adjunct to traditional sales aids, near- and virtual reality productions actively involve the physician in the sales process, providing a uniquely educational and rewarding experience observing the functions of the human body and the effects of drugs in a given condition.</I>
<P>
The exhibit floor of a major medical convention has often been likened to a professional amusement park. Now pharmaceutical companies have taken another page from the amusement parks' book of tricks. In the process, they are enhancing the quality of medical education, better demonstrating the effectiveness of their drugs and, not insignificantly, providing physicians with a uniquely rewarding experience.
<P>
The most sophisticated technique used at medical meeting technical exhibits to accomplish this marketing miracle is virtual reality (VR). Using 3-D computer animation and highly complex data banks, virtual reality can transport a physician out of the commonplace convention floor and into the human body to undertake an endoscopic procedure on a bloodless but otherwise responsive "patient." Other advanced techniques of animation, motion, and sound allow doctors to experience a Disney-like ride through the cardiovascular or female reproductive system or encounter, on the intracellular level, the action of a drug in preventing viral infection.
<P>

<H3>
The ten-minute angioplasty</H3>
Marion Merrill Dow will be exhibiting its highly realistic angioplasty simulation for the fourth time at a cardiovascular meeting, the American Heart Association session in Anaheim, Calif., this November. The exhibit will be updated, as will the company name through recent merger – Hoechst Marion Roussel. "The high-tech booth gets the traffic," says Cardizem Product Manager Paul Rittman, who had the idea for the exhibit. "That's how you measure success on the exhibit floor." An estimated 1500 cardiologists tried their hand doing an angioplasty on a digital patient at the first showing during last year's American College of Cardiology meeting. Repeat showings have produced similar physician response.
<P>
In the exhibit, physicians are given stereoscopic glasses to view the body image in three dimensions. First, the patient chart is shown, including the results of lab tests.
<P>
Then physicians see an angiogram on the screen visualizing a patient with a blockage in the coronary artery. They are provided with a special stylus that mimics an actual angioplasty balloon catheter. The catheter enters the body through the femoral artery, with the physician steering the wand toward the coronary artery – all while watching its progress through the angiogram on the screen. The computer provides a tactile response to the catheter which the physician feels when it is moved through the vessel. When the catheter is pushed too hard and the vessel could be ruptured, a warning light goes on.
<P>
During the course of the procedure, the patient suffers atrial fibrillation, a common operative event. Therapy with Marion's Cardizem Injectable, indicated for atrial fibrillation, is initiated and continued until the heart rate returns to normal. All of this takes place in real-time 3-D color. The tissue of the digital body is stretched or squeezed and responds to the catheter held by the physician the same way that real tissue would. When the site of the plaque in the coronary artery is reached safely, the balloon is inflated.
<P>
"Physicians were taught in ten minutes how to do an angioplasty," perhaps somewhat of an exaggeration by John Allen, vice president of NCI Advertising, division of Nelson Communications. "This is a teaching tool and the main idea is that, eventually, every physician will be trained with this device, not unlike the experience gained by pilots in a Link Trainer. The agency came up with the patients who were visualized, did the virtual reality script and story board, and worked with the computer animation firm High Techsplanations, Rockville, Md., to develop the program and exhibit in only four months.
<P>
High Techsplantations was able to move so quickly because it had developed a database it calls Teleos. The data base contains simulations or actual photos of human organs and tissue. X-ray photographs, CF scans, and MRI images are used. The tactile component allows the different resistance of different tissues to be felt and related to graphic images and movement. The software creates the lifelike images and realistic behavior models, programmed to the needs of the particular subject to be demonstrated in an interactive program. As a result, the computer can simulate minimally invasive laparoscopic procedures. 	
<P>
The cost of customizing software will vary, depending on the man hours necessary to create what is desired in the exhibit program, from perhaps $50,000 to $250,000, according to one estimate. Marion's Paul Rittman finds the cost reasonable when spread over two, three, or more meetings. "It probably hasn't cost us any more than other efforts to attract attendance," he said.
<P>
True virtual reality-human interaction when immersed in a graphical environment – requires use of a helmet with stereoscopic view and sound, enclosed to shut out the outside world. The fully interactive angioplasty exhibit comes close with the use of stereoscopic glasses. Whether partially or fully interactive, VR poses problems when employed as a meeting exhibit. While the reality factor is stunning, only one or two physicians can participate at the exhibit at the same time. And development costs were found by some companies to be very high for what they wished to portray.
<P>

<H3>Virtual virtual reality solves problems</H3>
An alternative being used frequently might be called sensual reality. The individual, interactive, tactile element is removed from the equation. Animation, sound, and other sensual elements are employed. Using this approach, Glaxo Wellcome has taken viewers on an exciting internal body ride. At the International Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy meeting last year in Orlando, Fla., an 8- by 10-foot theater within the exhibit space held 10 to 12 physicians who wore headphones and watched high-end, quality animation. The animation was developed and executed by Engineering Animation Inc., Chicago. As described by Lori M.Lashaway, director of 3-D biomedical visualization, artists worked from data to build a 3-D model within the computer. Textures of the different tissues involved were added with a 3-D "paint program." The motion of traveling through the body is made by defining a path through the computer model that you want a particle, a blood cell, to take. Then the computer drives the particle through the path. The animation was then put on a laser disc.
<P>
Medical Broadcasting Company, Conshohocken, Pa., then produced the program, adding sound, narration, and titles. "The effect of color 3-D on the screen with full stereo sound filled the sensual field, and the audience felt as if it were moving along with and within the screen images," said Kathleen Glossa of Medical Broadcasting. The body ride started in the mouth, went down the throat, and through the digestive system in a peristaltic roller coaster descent.
<P>
"You are entering the liver, keep an eye out for occlusion bodies," the Star Trek-style narrator warned. "Extreme turbulence! You're approaching the heart." And through the heart with valves in motion, red blood cells flowing by, on to inspection of the alveoli – "these tissues look pretty clear" – and then smooth sailing through tiny vessels in dermal tissue.
<P>
"Wait, up ahead, your target," the narrator says. "An active cutaneous herpes lesion," he explains, and the schematic illustrations in motion show the molecular mode of action of Zovirax in preventing replication of the herpes simplex virus.
<P>
The exhibit has been used at five medical meetings since 1994 and has played to rave reviews, says Sharon Sharro of Wellcome. Those attending the viewing were given a take-home copy of the 8-minute video – in all 25,000 were produced for distribution. Part of the animation was made into a computer "screen saver" which is now being given to physicians by sales representatives. The video also is used by the field force for "lunch and learn" sessions with physicians.
<P>
How much does interactive virtual reality cost? "How long is a piece of string?" Ms. Glossa responded. The cost can range from, say, $200,000 to a million dollars, depending on the length of the sequence, complexity, related equipment, and other factors of the program, Ms.Glossa estimated. She finds that the Disney-level animation without the interactive and tactile components "has high impact, at lower cost, with more lasting value."
<P>

<H3>Osteoblasts and osteoclasts in action</H3>
An impressive 3-D animated portrayal of osteoporosis in progress and in repair has yet to debut at U.S. medical conventions, through it has been widely seen in Europe. The computer-generated educational program was illustrated and produced by Engineering Animation on behalf of Merck & Company. It shows the action of osteoclasts depleting trabecular bone and osteoplasts laying down new bone. It was used as an educational presentation for physicians at exhibits and evening meetings, and for Merck personnel at launch meetings, for the highly-praised Fosamax.
<P>
An FDA advisory committee has recommended approval of Fosamax (See "Industry News," page 00.) When the drug is released in the U.S., it is likely that the presentation will be used as part of the ongoing, extensive educational program on osteoporosis being undertaken by Merck and may show up at meeting exhibits for the drug. Merck executives said they could not comment on company plans.-6-
Consistently high drawing power
<P>
Next month at the American Academy of Family Physicians annual meeting in Anaheim, Calif., Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories will be showing its program Journey Through the Brain. It is the sixth meeting at which this animated presentation in support of Effexor has been presented in an exhibit and the second one for generalists. Frank Corcoran, director of convention promotion, expects that attendance will be as high as ever.
<P>
The animated, enveloping presentation was exhibited first at the American Psychiatric Association meeting in Philadelphia in 1994 for the introduction of Effexor, a structurally novel antidepressant. It was very well received, Corcoran said. "We probably had 4000 doctors go through the exhibit in Philadelphia." The same exhibit was repeated at the APA meeting this year in Miami – and the same response was achieved, according to Corcoran.
<P>
Jerry Mars, head of Exhibitchek, a firm that evaluates the effectiveness of exhibits on the convention floor, said "even though the doctors are exposed to an exhibit more than once, they still talk about how great it is. The more educational the program, the more effective it is." On a scale of one to five, where five is wonderful, virtual reality programs tend to score 4.5, or consistently high in drawing power, Mars says.
"The program enables physicians to gain a better understanding of depressive behavior and the effect of pharmacologic intervention," according to Corcoran. "It shows how Effexor acts differently than other drugs. We differentiated our product compared to Prozac and others." The exhibit was produced by GFW Associates, Holmdel, N.J.
<P>

<H3>"One womb schoolhouse''</H3>
"You've just passed the cervix, ahead are the Fallopian tubes, and you're on your way to ovaries. Where are you? You're riding the Endoscopic Express and, if you're an obstetrician or gynecologist, you're lovin' it." That's the way that Exhibitor magazine described the Ortho Pharmaceutical exhibit at the 1987 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists meeting in Las Vegas, one of the first amusement park-sci tech marriages.
<P>
In this exhibit, as in the Effexor program and others, eight to ten physicians entered a pod, or capsule. In fact, Ortho's machine was an SB-2 amusement ride rented from the Doron Company, Binghamton, N.Y. The video on screen showed how a woman's reproductive system worked. "You went into the system as if you were driving through the woman," recalls AIDS Jordan, manager of conventions and exhibit programs. 
The capsule twisted side-to-side and nosed up and down, movements which were synchronized with the animated, stereo-sound film. "Inside the capsule with a locked door, you feel that you have been swallowed," Jordan said. At 1987 prices, the whole shooting match cost some $35,000 in addition to normal exhibit costs GWF Associates also designed a program used by Sandoz to promote DynaCirc a few years ago. It was a journey through the cardiovascular system that demonstrated cause and relief of hypertension. As Celeste Gorman, convention planner for Sandoz recalls, extra charges for renting the capsule came to perhaps $12,000 and producing and filming the animated video was in the $100,000 range. Reduced promotional budgets for DynaCirc curtailed the program.
<P>

<H3>The cutting edge: implants and instruments</H3>
How new surgical devices make and close incisions, how to implant new prosthesis in hip or knee, how implant materials are composed on the molecular level to retain strength and resist breakdown are all subjects for computer visualization. In one 3-D computer program by Engineering Animation, surgeons journeyed into the molecular structure of Hylamer, a plastic for total joint replacement developed by Dupuy Dupont Orthopaedics and displayed at the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting in Orlando. From the molecular viewpoint, surgeons could see how heat and pressure formed the tough new polymer that resists cracks and breakdown from oxidation. According to Engineering Animations' Lori Lashaway, the animation helped explain and sell the benefits of a highly technical product.
<P>

<H3>More science than meets the eye</H3>
Virtual reality is considered one of the newest of the medical sciences, with applications in how physicians are taught, and therapy is delivered, that boggle the mind. As expressed in the third meeting on "Medicine Meets Virtual Reality" held in January in San Diego, Calif., many aspects of testing, imaging, and therapy are entering a digital environment. According to Dr. Richard M. Satava of the federal Advanced Research Projects Agency and Walter Read Army Medical Center: "From one perspective, it could be said that there is no medicine, but rather information infrastructure with a medical flavor. And of the many disciplines arising from this new information era, virtual reality holds the greatest promise.
<P>
"The major pivotal point was in 1989 when the first laparoscopic gallbladder operation was performed," Satava pointed out. In laparoscopic surgery, the physician looks at an electronic video image and removes internal organs without seeing or touching them. In this perspective, the modern techniques of surgery on real patients are guided by virtual realities of visualization on a screen and guiding an instrument by touch and feel, rather than putting hands on the patient. InÊaddition to minimally invasive surgery, Satava sees virtual reality in the future offering, among other benefits, remote surgery, greatly improved medical and surgical training, visualization of massive medical databases, and innovative rehabilitation techniques involving virtual environments when patients cannot interact with the outside world.
<P>

<H3>Virtual anatomy on Internet</H3>
What may be a contribution to the massive data bank envisioned by Dr. Satava is being financed by Glaxo Wellcome. Glaxo Virtual Anatomy is a photo-realistic, interactive, 3-D computer graphic model of actual tissues from the human body. A cadaver "free of visible trauma, defects, or abnormalities" is sectioned, embedded in molds and frozen. Thus far, the thorax wasÊsectioned at 0.5 mm, photographed with images then digitized in the computers, completing phase one of a five-year program.
<P>
According to Butler Communications, project manager and co-developer, a three-dimensional model is developed from the anatomic structures, and surfaces are rendered into computer graphic models to enhance the realistic image. The models are stored in digital form on hard disk and other accessible media.
<P>
Whether the Glaxo program will continue, as an independent project, is now under consideration, for it may be converted to the "Visible Man" data currently available from the National Library of Medicine. Also, the Glaxo anatomy may be utilized by the U.S. Department of Defense to create a Virtual Soldier who can be purposefully injured in order to determine the most appropriate means for treating such wounds. Judging from comments at the San Diego meeting, the military is also interested in the possibility of equipping troops with "dog tags" containing computer chips so that the vital signs of a wounded serviceman could be transmitted to a medical center which would send appropriate medical personnel and equipment.
<P>
The Glaxo effort is educational, but thatÊdoes not rule out potential use of the computerized data in convention exhibits for product promotion. Until then, if you are interested, you can see the Glaxo thorax on Internet using this address: http:\\www.vis.colostate.edu\library\gra\gra.html.
<P>

<H3>The future: real and virtual</H3>
If this is the status of virtual reality today, what does the convention planner have to look forward to? A product with an adequate budget in any therapeutic category can benefit from high tech displays, and likely there will be more. A decrease in cost is likely as technology improves and becomes more easily available.
<P>
Ball-point pens, paste-up note pads, and smiling sales representatives will remain basic to the convention business. After all, the physician has to know the product name, the approved indications, the usual dosage. But, the novelty value of virtual reality is not likely to wear thin. New, innovative virtual reality programs will be designed on different subjects and will communicate better with physician audiences. At the same time, real life medical practice will increasingly rely on virtual reality for new therapeutic techniques.

<H2>Drug Firms Carve Up The Nation
</H2>
</CENTER>


<H4><I>by Mark Riotto and Tom Marcinko</I></H4>


<HR>


<H3>Executive summary:</H3>
<I>A variety of converging forces—managed care, local government, economic concerns—have prompted U.S. pharmaceutical companies to abandon the traditional monolithic marketing approach in favor of regionalization.</I>
<P>
The move has proven to be a mixed blessing as each company struggles with a range of conflicting and changing pressures.
<P>
The U.S. pharmaceutical market is no longer the monolith it once was. Today most drug companies view it as a handful of six to eight smaller markets—each demanding an individual strategy to capitalize on the unique forces operating within that area. 
<P>
These companies realize that a single marketing approach for the entire company means their products will sell strongly in some regions but do poorly in others, mainly because of the varying needs of managed care and other large customers. With every prescription up for grabs, drug makers can't, for example, afford to sacrifice the Northeast to win in the South.
<P>

<H3>Smaller is better </H3>
There has been a major shift in the pharmaceutical industry, as over the last two years company after company realigned itself into regional business units (RBUS) independently of each other (see <A HREF="drugtab.jpg">Companies with Regional Business Units</A>).
<P>
The RBU trend is driven largely by large managed care organizations, but there are other reasons commonly given for decentralized sales force structures:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>RBUS are a response to limited resources, downsizing, and re-engineering;
<LI>RBUS are leaner and meaner than top-heavy national organizations, more in touch with, and quicker to respond to, local concerns;
<LI>Though apparently stalled, national health reform efforts are widely conceded to have led to regionalization as an early response to the Clinton plan. The trend was speeded as states picked up the White House cue, making for a patchwork of local regulations and the need for a more adaptable and accessible sales force.
</UL>

The organizational framework for regionalization varies, but generally an RBU head controls all sales resources within a region, which usually consists of a few states. Each region also may be divided into smaller territories with their own director, who reports to the RBU head. Many of the HMOs are organized along state lines, which influences the way manufacturers view their markets, but many companies disregard political boundaries altogether (see <A HREF="drugs1.html">Who's Doing What</A>).
<P>

<H3>Balancing act</H3>
The challenge of regionalization has been to divide up responsibilities to create some balance between the field and the home office. Those companies that have made the shift acknowledge that some functions are best performed in the field, others from national headquarters.
<P>
DuPont Merck is an example of a smaller company that went the RBU route, organizing itself into four units in March 1994. Says Nicholas Teti, the company's president for North America: "We have been able to understand our customers much better in this environment than in a centralized environment. The balance between the two is much better than it ever was."
<P>
But, says Teti, regionalization is not a panacea. "We just can't do everything for everybody," he says. "We can't go after every market in the country; it's impossible."
<P>
Busy though it was with its purchase of Sphinx Pharmaceuticals and PCS, a pharmaceutical benefits manager, Eli Lilly found time to realign its sales force into geographic units. But Bill Ringo, VP of sales and marketing for Lilly, is not a fan of regionalization along state lines. "[In] the older template you could structure sales forces based on boundaries of the U.S.," says Ringo. "This no longer applies when you have an environment where managed care has different importance in different parts of the country."
<P>
Despite this, Ringo concedes the significance of local governments. "State legislation is going to play an ever-more-important role in how health care is delivered." Federal reforms or no, health care reform efforts still are major drivers of regionalization.
<P>
Companies reorganizing along RBU lines expect decentralized control over field and hospital forces to lead to better coordination of territory-level promotional efforts, as well as smoother co-promotion to hospital- and office-based physicians. 
<P>
"When you look at your market from a national perspective, you develop plans from a national perspective," says Teti of DuPont Merck. "You also do not take into account what I believe is critically important, which is the demographic makeup of our markets and our customers."
<P>
Nationalized schemes tend to treat California and Minnesota the same as Arkansas or Georgia. Teti believes RBUS encourage a form of planning that sees and appreciates differences. He adds that RBUS make it easier to recruit and keep talent that might otherwise be lost; high fliers can thrive without being forced to move to the East Coast. 
<P>

<H3>Enhancing "pull through"</H3>
By getting the company and sales force tighter with large buyers, firms hope to enhance "pull through." This concept starts when a company gets its product on an HMO's formulary. The reps' duty is then to detail enrolled physicians and remind them of the product's contract status and benefits. The ultimate goal, or pull through, is to have those physicians prescribe the drug instead of competing products on formulary. 
<P>
Teti of DuPont Merck says competing for a place on formularies isn't relevant to every company; his, for example, now has no multisource products. 
<P>
Lilly's Ringo points out that his company is obviously concerned about the managed care market; with PCS, Lilly is moving to provide support for optimal outcomes. Not all managed-care efforts can be linked to a region, he says. But regionalization is necessary "to understand a changing customer base, and that includes managed health care." For example, a company must be aware of what HMOs are doing to address practice guidelines. 
<P>
Another benefit of regionalization is that most pricing and contract decisions are made by those closest to the customers, such as national or regional account managers or regional heads. This helps clear communication between the field and headquarters and allows for speedier response to customer requests. 
<P>
Detailing priorities and marketing campaigns are set up on regional or even district levels, which best permit reps to focus on formulary status in their territory. Regionalization also lets companies use micromarketing tactics to focus on the higher prescribers and customers best able to move market share.
<P>

<H3>Profit and loss</H3> 
Perhaps most dramatically, some companies are even shifting profit-and-loss responsibilities to RBU heads. Marketers concede this structure could confound managers of smaller products because regional leaders will push the big moneymakers to keep the balance sheets in order. 
<P>
Potential motivational conflict between national account managers and RBU heads is another possible drawback. If an RBU cuts a deal with a regional HMO, the HMO's national office will likely want the same break for the entire country. The same could happen with national pharmacy chains. 
<P>
"You truly have to allow those folks [RBUS] to create the focus," says Teti. "The danger is the national group has the possibility of becoming threatened." A balance needs to be struck between national and regional interests, he says. 
<P>
Human nature poses a possible downside: The more helpful a manufacturer is to a customer, the more the customer wants. Keeping expectations realistic can help avert this modern version of Alice in Wonderland's Red Queen's race (where you have to run twice as fast just to stay in the same place). 
<P>
In addition, implementing a geographic force can upset the reporting hierarchy, particularly in managed care. For instance, national account managers who once reported to a director of managed care sales at headquarters may now answer to the RBU head; that could make for one unhappy executive at the home office. 
<P>
Another unexpected side effect of regionalization is that relationships between reps and managed care pharmacy directors often get broken up because of the shifting of sales staff. Pharmacy directors constantly see new people all the time. It may have taken years to build this relationship, and a friendly rep may be the only reason the company gets in the door. Losing those relationships may prove costly for manufacturers. 
<P>
A final concern is the problem of handling customers or accounts that cross geographic boundaries, such as the giant HMO Kaiser Permanente, whose operations straddle 17 states from California to Connecticut. The flexibility inherent in an RBU structure allows drug marketers to service such accounts on a case-by-case basis, but care must still be taken to balance regional independence with communication and direction from the home office.
<P>

<H3>Pressures take toll</H3>
With all of these conflicting pressures, it is not surprising that not every RBU venture succeeds. Some companies tried the process and failed, either through trying to implement decentralization too quickly or due to lack of qualified personnel. Even companies that tout the benefits of RBUS are constantly reviewing processes and results.
<P>
When Nicholas Teti of DuPont Merck needs a vision of the future, he sometimes looks backward to his experience as European company president. Ironically, he found a European sales organization that was too decentralized and needed some top-level coordination. Once again, Teti emphasizes the need for balance.
<P>
"The European market has had managed care for a long time," he adds. "It's called the government. They've been under that [burden] for years, and still the European pharmaceutical industry has managed to grow and even thrive under tremendous cost pressures. That's a signal that it can be done, even if there are stringent regulatory situations to deal with."
<P>
And if the past is any guide, that's cause for optimism in the U.S. pharmaceutical arena, no matter how companies are organized.

<H2>Interactive Sales Media Turn Up The WOW factor</H2>
</CENTER>

<HR>


<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>A growing number of pharmaceutical companies are using innovative technological approaches in medical promotion. Replacing the traditional staples in a sales rep's satchel are a new generation of interactive, multimedia tools which provide a compelling, flexible, and open-ended sales medium with the added asset of cost effectiveness.</I>
<P>
Cyber monkeys, cyber junkies, cyber jocks, cyber docs. The virtual reality of today's cyber age is, if you're not wired, you're not hired. The cyber force is with us, permeating every aspect of our lives, changing our perceptions, changing our expectations, changing every aspect of the way we conduct our lives and our business. (But you already know this. Unless, of course, you've been in cybernation.) But there are certain industries with which interactive communication makes a perfect fit, and the healthcare industry is one of these. Industries that are characterized by the need for lots of information to change hands as the purchase decision is being made are a natural for this type of promotion (see <A HREF="wowside.html">The Infallible Salesman</A>).
<P>
Electronically-based communication is a compelling, versatile, and practical way to deliver information-intensive material, while also providing the flexibility to respond to changing criteria, such as challenges raised by managed care. 
<P>
One of the prime advantages of electronic, interactive presentations is that they engage multiple senses and are particularly effective for a difficult audience such as doctors.
<P>
"Doctors like something that's new," says Priscilla Kozel, senior vice president and general manager of McCann Healthcare Inc. McCann has been involved in developing interactive multimedia communication for healthcare clients such as Marion Merrell Dow, Medical News Network and Abbott Laboratories. "The sales reps gain a new role by bringing in something that the doctors are interested in seeing and interacting with. It's a win-win situation."
<P>
A computerized sales presentation allows the rep to tailor the presentation to the specific needs of the physician, who can help guide the direction of the meeting. Using the computer, a rep can present several different tracks of interactivity, with each path providing a different aspect of the selling message and ultimately leading to package insert-type support information. "The beauty of going through a presentation on a computer is that you can start from any point and lead into a robust message similar to the one you would see in a detail aid, complete with beautiful artwork," says Kozel. "With computer presentations, there's a big `wow' factor, because it's new and intriguing."
<P>
Multimedia presentations are particularly effective in a highly technical sales environment—medical instrumentation, for example. "The technology can be shown in three dimensions on a computer screen while the benefits are explained," says Jeremy Kane, vice president, Aves, Inc., Grand Rapids, Mich., a developer of software and interactive, multimedia sales and training programs.
<P>
After the presentation, the rep can use the laptop computer's modem to bring up the specific product line that matches the customer's needs. Targeted sales literature can then be ordered on the spot, again by modem.
<P>
A program that has been developed by Aves uses a screen listing various client needs for a machine or instrument. The sales person walks the prospect through his or her various needs and, when all the information is collected, the laptop immediately brings up a listing of products that best fit. "We find these kinds of applications to be tremendously powerful in the selling environment,"  says Kane.
<P>
Aves, which lists Upjohn and Corning on its client roster, is also experimenting with interactive kiosks for conventions that will allow client-specific literature to be ordered on the spot. As the request is being made, the information is automatically downloaded to the appropriate sales rep or distributor for follow-up and sales fulfillment.
<P>

<H3>Interactivity without computers</H3>
A slightly different approach uses computer technology, but without the laptop. Instead, sales presentations are made using a CD-ROM format known as CD-I (Compact Disc-Interactive). Several pharmaceutical firms are providing their representatives with port- able CD-I players, which are as simple to operate as audio CD players, and provide a high-resolution viewing screen. The CD-I players can play full motion, full color video.
<P>
CD-I players are less versatile and flexible than computers, but they are also less expensive. "To display full motion video on a computer would cost somewhere between $6,000 and 9,000," says Luda Tovey, president of Oberon Productions, Ontario, Canada, developer of CD-I programs for sales promotion (see <A HREF="wowcase1.html">Case History 1 “A Real Life Challenge”)</A>, "while a self-contained portable CD-I player with full motion video capability, is around $1,500 to 2,000." Oberon, whose clients include GD Searle, Miles Laboratories, Schering AG, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, is also sold on stationary CD-I players which can be attached to a television monitor in a convention exhibit or hospital display. These are priced at $300-600.
<P>
"In the past," says Robin Lawrence, group product manager anti-infectives, Miles Canada, "we would have used a detail aid or a reprint. But right now this technology is novel and we expect the sales force to get more time with the physician because of the novelty. We've only been using the technology for a short time, but it has been extremely well received." As with anything new, says Lawrence, some reps are tentative because it takes novel skills which must be learned. "However, once the reps have some experience with it, they find that new opportunities arise" (see <A HREF="wowcase2.html">Case History 2 “Two for the Price of One”</A>).
<P>
Interactive CD-I programs also allow the representative to customize their presentations for targeted audiences. The overwhelming advantage of this technology is that it allows customers to learn at their own rate. They can ask the questions they want and get the answers when they want. "In one situation," explains Tovey, "the sales rep may go through one of the case studies and create a discussion around it. In another context, he or she may choose three minutes of the video because it targets an issue that interests that particular physician, or, the sales rep may be presenting to a pharmacist and will go directly to the cost-variable table and present the case study from a cost perspective. With CD-I technology, one program can address many different audiences. It is very versatile."
<P>
A program developed for Schering AG gives a unique twist to video conferencing. Interviews with world opinion leaders were videotaped and an interface was created which allows a viewer to choose from a series of questions and then pick the doctor or doctors whom they want to answer the question. This program simulates the experience of actually being there and having an opportunity to ask questions of world experts.
<P>

<H3>Such a bargain</H3>
"We bought these machines as a two-year investment during which time we expect to get a significant return," says Miles' Lawrence, "At the end of two years we'll reassess, but I think that this is just the dawn of a new era. I honestly believe that the good reps will get more interaction with the physician using this technology. They will get more quality time and I think they will get in to see people they don't normally get to see. Overall, it will improve communication with physicians and other customers. I'm a big proponent of interactive media for both education and promotion."
<P>
Sales reps can be trained on a CD-I in one session. The training is focused on becoming familiar with the information on the disc, rather than the technology. "We have consistently done one-day training sessions with the field force or in some cases trained the trainers," says Tovey. "No additional training has been required." 
<P>

<H3>Same buck, more bang</H3>
The cost of an interactive computer or CD-I program that replaces a variety of media pieces is considerably less than it costs a company to produce all the individual pieces being replaced. "Several of our clients," says Tovey, "have estimated that the costs of producing a four-color glossy sales aid was more than that of an interactive program. We can create programs that are more sophisticated than a video, for a relatively low cost" <A HREF="wowcase3.html">(see Case History #3: Pfizer Fine Tunes Sales Calls</A>).
<P>
The exact cost of a disc depends on the number of graphics, the amount of information, how much original video needs to be shot, plus the sophistication of the programming. To fill up a disc can cost anywhere between $100,000 to 200,000, and once discs are written, they are not rewritable. Updating and changing discs involve charges for creating new information and any programming costs associated with the changes. Discs then are mastered and replicated, at a cost of about $1.00 to 1.50 each.
<P>
But unless there is a basic change in the information to be conveyed, remastering may not be necessary for a long period of time. One of Oberon's clients, Searle, has been working with a single CD-I program for well over a year and they have found not only that they get more physician time with their interactive program, but that in some cases physicians even schedule second and third presentations because of the scope of the material on the disc.
<P>
Unlike a traditional visual aid, which has a fairly rapid wear-out factor, sales reps can repeatedly go back to the same physician with the same disc, and present material that is new to that doctor each time.
<P>

<H3>On-line promotion</H3>
Another form of interactive marketing takes us into the nether world of cyberspace. Physicians' Online is an example of an on-line information service that gives doctors access to various medical databases, while providing pharmaceutical companies a targeted outlet for product promotion. Core reference services include:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Medline
<LI>Aidsline
<LI>Physicians GenRx, which provides prescribing information on all fda-approved prescription drugs
<LI>Quick Medical Reference (qmr), a diagnostic tool profiling some 600 diseases
<LI>Prescribing Decision Support Module (pdsm), which presents information on specific drugs from pharmaceutical manufacturers, the fda, and independent third-party sources
<LI>Clinical Alerts, which supplies findings from clinical trials prior to their publication.
These services are offered free to doctors by sponsoring manufacturers, including Pfizer, Sandoz, Astra Merck, Glaxo, Eli Lilly, SmithKline Beecham, and Marion Merrell Dow.
</UL>

The pharmaceutical companies' product promotional messages scroll at the bottom of the computer screen and when doctors click on the message, they get more detailed information about that sponsors' products and services. Pharmaceutical sponsors of Physicians' Online get welcome kits that include a log on disc to be given to doctors by their reps. Over 50,000 physicians have signed up for the system.
<P>

<H3>Opening new doors</H3>
Computer technology is opening up new doors to medical sales reps and there is more to come. According to Tovey, "What the healthcare industry needs to do is to learn how to communicate in new ways that are meaningful and acceptable by the medical community. We are already seeing a positive response to our initial efforts, but it is too early to know the implications of these changes. This type of promotion is the wave of the future—how close or far away that future is remains to be seen."

<H2>Comes the Millenium</H2>
</center>

<H4><I>by Carl J. Seiden</I></H4>


<H3>Executive summary:</H3>
<i>In a departure from his regular assignment providing readers with a unique insider/outsider perspective as a research analyst for leading Wall Street brokerage house Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., we asked Carl Seiden to field some difficult questions from the members of mm&m's editorial advisory board. Questions focused on the long-range prospects for our industry. Seiden sees the turn of the century as a time when price increases will be pegged to inflation, mco discounting and competition from new companies take their toll on profit margins, merger mania will continue, biotech companies will evolve as licensing and development feeders to established companies, growth will be modest with a growing gap between winners and losers.</i>
<p>

<H3>Downsizing and restructuring—the long-range effects</H3>
If cost-cutting is to contribute to long-term growth and not just to this year's P&L, costs need to continue to be cut so that they grow more slowly than sales. But there's a limit as to how far and how long you can do that.
<p>
The reason the drug industry has so far been successful in cutting costs is that it started from a pretty high base, given the excesses of the 1980s and the early 90s, but there's a competitive risk in cutting too far, too deeply. The assumption is that, because of the managed care phenomenon, there will be a diminishing number of marketing points, enabling companies to cut back significantly on sales and marketing spending. The reality is that the market still requires—and will continue to require—promoting to large numbers of doctors; that means that companies' relative spending on marketing to physicians will continue to determine market share, putting companies that cut too quickly or too deeply at a competitive disadvantage.
<p>
A second issue is whether management has the stomach to continue to cut costs. It tends to be pain that forces cost cutting, but to keep doing it to provide a positive earnings impact in the absence of pain can be highly destructive of morale. The pattern in other industries has been for people to wait until disaster threatens before they make these difficult decisions. Our industry is not likely to act differently. 
<p>

<H3>More focused R&D</H3>
Truly differentiated products that address unmet medical needs will always be more readily embraced by the marketplace than so-called me-too products. But the criticism that the industry has historically invested too much in me-too research and can therefore become more efficient by refocusing its research efforts is only partly true. After all, it's very rare that a pharmaceutical company ever intentionally put R&D resources behind coming out with the fifth ace inhibitor or the eighth beta blocker. Typically, those investments came from a belief that either the company had a shot at being first or second, or that its product would have some meaningful differential characteristics. Unfortunately, you often can't fully determine whether you've got such a winner until you have completed the Phase iii clinical trials. 
<p>
It may be true, though, that sometimes companies had too low a threshold for cutting off development of what turned out to be copycat products and, clearly, if R&D dollars can be shifted to pursue unmet medical needs, that will have a positive impact on long-term growth.
<p>

<H3>Competitive pricing strategies</H3>
In the good old days, industry was able to increase profitability by raising prices some eight to ten percent a year. In 1994, price increases in the fee-for-service segment of the market declined to less than two percent. 
<p>

<H3>What now?</H3> 
Because the political environment has eased somewhat, companies will probably be able to raise list prices slightly more in 1995—maybe between three and four percent. Longer term, the fear of reigniting the wrath of Congress is likely to keep price increases to the level of inflation plus roughly one percent.
But price is only one variable. The other is discounting, and I believe that both the breadth and depth of discounts to managed care organizations will keep increasing, limiting net price increments to roughly zero to one percent (see <a href="millfig1.jpg">Figure 1</a>). 
<p>
Admittedly, there are also market forces that may reduce the discount pressure for a while—but not for long. What I see happening is that drug companies are getting smarter about their customers. When they first woke up to the risks of managed care, they flinched in the face of all the saber rattling on the part of managed care organizations who threatened to throw products off their formularies if they didn't receive discounts. In reality, many of these health maintenance organizations (hmos) and pharmacy benefits managers (pbms) turned out to have relatively little control over their physicians' prescribing habits, and now companies are being more intelligent about the discounts they offer. 
<p>
But then comes the next phase. The hmos and pbms that can't gain control over their doctors' prescribing patterns are not going to be competitive in their own marketplace. Ultimately, therefore, the only hmos and pbms that survive will be those that can enforce their formularies. 
<p>
The question then becomes: have pharmaceutical companies gotten any smarter about beating each other up for the sake of gaining market share? The problem is, this is capitalism and that's not the way things work. What happens is that in exchange for market share gains, Company A will give a bigger discount. That means Company B, on the losing end of that market share battle, offers a still bigger discount. What may be smart behavior on an account-by-account basis creates a really destructive competitive dynamic overall (see <a href="millfig2.jpg">Figure 2</a>).
<p>
Another potentially negative factor is the impact of new players in the market. Large chemical companies and major foreign drug companies are getting into the U.S. pharmaceutical business, and such companies often have lower expectations in terms of profit margins than what U.S. drug companies are used to. If it turns out that the newcomers' competitive behavior reflects those lower expectations, making them happy to accept lower prices, that will further contribute to driving margins down. 
<p>
<H3>
Disease management marketing</H3>
Whether industry can capitalize on the concept of disease management is an issue that has yet to be resolved. It is clear that conceptually disease management is a smarter way to deliver healthcare É that it makes both medical and economic sense to manage healthcare delivery as an integrated system rather than as disparate components, and to track patients long-term so as to prevent future complications. It's also clear that drug companies are using their knowledge, their relationships and their money to advance the disease management approach. But it's simply too early to tell to what degree disease management will in fact take off, and to what degree the pharmaceutical industry might benefit (for conflicting assessments, see <a href="millfig3.jpg">Figure 3</a>).
<p>

<H3>Generic divisions and bundling</H3>
The ability to bundle broad product lines and having a generic division so you can offer both prescription and generic products is a modest tool in doing business with managed care organizations—not huge, but something. It gives companies some extra flexibility in crafting their contracts. But—and I always seem to come up with a "but," don't I?—the advantage of bundling or one-stop shopping really makes sense only in industries where there is a significant cost associated with doing business with a multitude of vendors. That does not apply to the pharmaceutical industry, where purchasers have a highly efficient wholesaler system available to them.
<p>
Another factor is that generics are, almost by definition, commodities. The way one wins in the generics business is to be the low-cost provider. So if a brand-name company invests in setting up or acquiring or forming an alliance with a generic division, it had better be a low-cost provider. If it isn't, the concept that somehow higher priced generics can be bundled with branded products to create more value for a customer is something I simply don't understand.
<p>

<H3>Optimum size: bigger ...</H3>
Mergers are still all the rage, and many of the big companies continue to have sufficient cash flows to enable them to buy other manufacturers. The question is, will they buy other healthcare companies or go outside our industry?
<p>
These trends are cyclical. In the early 80s, companies said: let's get rid of agriculture, let's get rid of cosmetics and foods and concentrate on the pharmaceutical business. Increasingly, now, people see this as a high-risk business and look to diversification as a way to spread the risk. At the same time, many pharmaceutical companies want to define themselves as broad-based healthcare providers rather than just drug companies.
<P>
But that doesn't mean that we won't continue to see horizontal acquisitions (see <a href="millfig4.jpg">Figure 4</a>). Three factors that foster continued consolidation are the continuing high degree of fragmentation, the redundancy of the cost structures, and the inevitability of margin pressure. But soon after a horizontal merger, when the greater efficiencies have been achieved, the now larger company needs to ask itself whether it will really be better positioned if it gets still bigger. 
<p>
I don't think so. True enough, some elements of world-wide pharmaceutical marketing require critical mass, since companies do need global sales and marketing infrastructures to distribute their products globally. But many of the companies that are still pursuing mergers already have those skills, and once you get to that level, even greater size gives you no particular competitive advantage. Keep in mind, too, that some large companies are highly dependent on blockbuster drugs. Once they lose their patents, they'll be in bad shape. The bigger they come the harder they'll fall.
<p>

<H3>... or smaller?</H3> 
At the other end of the spectrum are the niche marketers like Dura, Forest, and Roberts. Will they continue to thrive as the big boys get bigger?
<p>
Some of them have done very well by buying and marketing products that the giants have either forgotten or find it unprofitable to promote. But what some of these niche marketers seem to be doing is taking the cash from those exercises and investing it in innovative drug research. That changes their basic corporate strategy. Now they have to be not only smart but lucky and be the first to come up with interesting new products. That's a far more risky approach and puts them essentially in the same category as the start-up biotechnology companies, with the significant advantage, of course, that these niche companies are making rather than simply burning money.
<p>
Speaking of biotech companies, it's unlikely that we are going to see many more Amgens that can catch the wave of a single great product to develop their own sales and marketing infrastructure. It's far more likely that in future such products will be licensed to or developed under some shared agreement with an established company. The result will be that the biotech field will become one additional pipeline feeding products to what we think of as traditional pharmaceutical companies. 
<p>
From an investment point of view, of course, niche companies have a big attraction. If a company the size of Pfizer or Merck introduces a new product, it needs to generate sales of 500 million to a billion dollars to have an impact on overall growth, while the hurdle for niche marketers is far lower. They don't need home runs; they can hit some singles and doubles to be very high-growth companies.
<p>
<H3>
Market globalization</H3>
The great bulk of prescription drugs are consumed by something less than 20 percent of the world's population. So everybody thinks: won't it be fantastic when people in less developed counties start consuming drugs? Sure. Just think of the population of China. The question is, when? I don't think it's going to happen within the next five years. There's a natural sequence of events that has to occur first—building roads and highways, establishing a basic social infrastructure, and practicing Western forms of medicine. Only then will globalization become an important driver of industry growth. 
<p>
<H3>
Shifting Medicare patients to HMOS</H3>
Another hope is that the growing trend of shifting Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries to hmos will increase prescription volume. 

Let's look at Medicaid first. Currently, of course, the governments gets a discount of roughly 15 percent—or more to match the company's best price—for Medicaid drug purchases. Medicaid drug benefits are, therefore, likely to remain with the states—unless the hmo can get an even better price. The overall impact on industry will, therefore, be neutral.
<p>
As for Medicare prescriptions, they are paid for either out of the patient's pocket or by supplementary insurance, in either case without any kind of mandated discount. Since Medicare Rxs represent about 35 percent of pharmaceutical sales, a shift in that market segment could have a significant effect. But let's analyze the data. At present, half of the people on Medicare already have pharmaceutical coverage. A small portion of that half are covered because they're eligible for Medicaid as well as Medicare, while roughly 80 percent are covered through retiree benefits. Many of these latter folks already are in pbms because their employers opted for it. Neither of these groups, obviously, will be significantly affected by a switch from the present system to hmos.
<p>
That leaves the other half of the Medicare population who pay for drugs out of their own pockets and hence pay list price. If they are moved into hmos—even if they're not given drug coverage—there's a risk that the hmo doctors will be so attuned to formularies that there will be a negative impact on the pharmaceutical industry. That leaves the final segment—those who don't fill their prescriptions because of cost and who will start doing so once someone else starts paying. Again, I think it's likely to be a wash. I doubt industry will benefit from shifting Medicare patients to hmos, and it might well get hurt.
<p>

<H3>Faster FDA approvals</H3>
The faster New Drug Application approvals triggered by the user fee system and an increasingly hostile Congress are unquestionably a piece of good news for the drug industry. What people tend to assume is that if you get to market your product one year earlier you have an extra year of profitability. If it means beating your competitor to the market that is undoubtedly a tremendous boon. Otherwise, we need to remember that under the terms of the Hatch-Waxman act, you get an extension of your patent to compensate for fda delays, so if you lose a year of sales up front, you gain a year at the end of the life cycle. The final score: a potential but not assured gain.
<p>

<H3>Positive factors</H3>
I don't want anyone to come away from this discussion thinking that I'm totally pessimistic. One of the hopeful factors is physician backlash. It is more and more apparent that physicians are the most powerful players in healthcare delivery. The reason they lost so much power when managed care first began to take off is that they were poorly organized. That's changing, and the result will be that healthcare delivery will become more rational, especially when it comes to the use of Rx drugs. Where there are clinically important differences between drugs, formularies designed primarily to save money will never take precedence over the doctors' choice. Physicians' training makes them uniquely qualified to decide which drug is most appropriate for a particular patient—and they know it.
<p>
The problem for the drug industry is that there are many therapeutic classes where doctors see little meaningful clinical differentiation. Historically, their preference for a particular drug was based on non-clinical issues, such as their relationship with a sales representative or what they got used to during their medical training, and those drugs will continue to be vulnerable.
<p>
That brings us back to a point I touched on before: that the industry's greatest source of hope for the future is its continued commitment to research and development (see <a href="millfig5.jpg">Figure 5</a>). If a drug is indeed a breakthrough, it will find its place in the market. If it initially adds to the drug budget of hmos or hospitals, acceptance may be slowed, but true breakthrough drugs are likely to save money overall: other therapies may no longer be needed, long-term complications can be avoided, hospital days can be cut, or cuts that are part of surgical procedures can be eliminated. Companies are well aware of these potentials, which is why they are rightly putting increasing emphasis on pharmacoeconomic studies.
<p>

<h3>An overview</h3>
There is one index that strikes a balance of all these pluses and minuses, and that is the valuation of pharmaceutical stock. That is how not only investors and analysts but also corporate management ultimately judge the worth of companies. Pharmaceutical stocks had a rough time of it in the past few years, and there's no question that the sell-off drove them too low. With a rally that started last August and continued through the first three or four months of this year, the market largely compensated for that (see <a href="millfig6.jpg">Figure 6</a>).
<p>
As for the longer term, while investors who got on board last August enjoyed quite a good ride, that ride is largely over. Healthcare stocks are currently valued on the assumption of something like a nine percent earnings growth going forward. That, the consensus says, is a little bit more than the industry is likely to achieve (see <a href="millfig7.jpg">Figure 7</a>).
<p>
On balance then, I predict that there will be growth ... but it will be modest overall, with a wider-than-ever gap between the winners and the losers. Of course, whether growth is strong or weak depends on your perspective. The pharmaceutical industry longs for the glory days of the previous decades. But the ceos of most other industries would gladly settle for a share of our disappointments.

<h3>Executive summary:</h3>
<i>A new study has revealed dissatisfaction with PBMs from a remarkably wide range of their consumers. Areas of friction include poor service and lack of reporting. Despite this, the realities of the changing healthcare industry has broadened the nature and functions of PBMs. It is still too early to assess the impact of the purchase of PBMs by large drug companies. </i>
<p>
In the constantly changing environment of American health care, management of the pharmacy benefit is coming under greater financial pressure and managerial scrutiny from a number of corners. Companies that use pharmacy benefit management companies (PBMs), either as service providers or drug-distribution outlets, are questioning the value of the arrangement:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Health maintenance organizations HMOs that use PBMs are unhappy with the service they receive, yet feel trapped by the rebate policies of PBMs and the pharmaceutical industry.
<li>Employer groups, while less interested in pharmaceuticals per se, are becoming increasingly demanding and sophisticated consumers of PBMs and other health care providers.
<li>Insurance companies, themselves experienced claims processors, are also unhappy with PBMs and are uncertain of the cost benefits of using outside providers.
<li>Pharmaceutical companies foresee the importance of PBMs diminishing as different pricing policies evolve, but their interest in PBMs lies in the claims-processing data they handle.
<li>PBMs realize they must change in order to survive and grow. And they will come under increasing pressure to do so from business partners, clients and new competitors.
</ul>

These are just some of the broader findings from Scott-Levin Associates' most recent strategic study, <i>PBMs: A Major Force?</i><u></u>
 
<h3>The PBM market</h3>
As the number of people paying cash or "out of pocket" for prescriptions continues to decline, the potential market for PBMs grows. Increasingly, employers are shifting from indemnity and fee-for-service health insurance plans to managed care coverage. And correspondingly, the third party sector—HMOs, preferred provider organizations PPOs, PBMs, insurers—has increased its share of the retail prescription market to 45%, according to Scott-Levin's Source Prescription Audit. This opens the door to greater PBM oPPOrtunity. But only to a point.
<p>
The number of HMOs using PBMs for anything, including mail order, has dropped in the past year nearly 10% to 70%. About half of the approximately 550 HMOs in the United States use a PBM for some form of formulary administration. But now just 30% of HMOs allow the PBM to control the formulary. The study also found that HMOs, particularly the larger ones, are regaining more authority to dictate changes to the formulary, even if the approved list is primarily that of the PBM, or administered by the PBM. And many HMOs reported that this is a move they would seriously consider in 1995.
<p>
In the last five years, PBMs have evolved to offer a wide variety of services. In the past, many were mere claims processors; today they have diversified and improved their systems to the point that they can sustain national on-line pharmacy networks. PBMs have carefully studied their clients' administrative needs to develop services ranging from rebate processing to drug utilization reports.
<p>
Among the other services PBMs now offer are prescriber intervention, drug utilization reviews, formulary planning, and prior authorization. Traditionally these duties were performed by the clinical staff at the managed care site; even today many jealously defend their turf from PBM encroachment. Services like these—welcomed by some, rejected by others—indicate the delineation of PBMs and their role in the American health care environment is far from complete.
<p>
PBM customers now extend past the traditional HMO or managed care organization to include looser or mixed insurance plans and PPOs. PBMs also offer pharmacy services directly to insurance companies and employer groups.
<p>
The number of patients PBMs claim as "covered" must be considered carefully. Not all "covered" lives are under formulary control. And when you consider that a majority of formularies in this country remain open at customer request, the claims become even more suspect. PBMs can make sure that restrictions are enforced, but therapeutic substitution is at the discretion of the HMO. "Brand-brand interchange or preferred brand substitution are strategies recommended by PBMs to their HMO customers to increase the HMO's [as well as the PBM's] rebate dollars," according to the Scott-Levin study.
<p>
But it is rebates and volume-purchasing prices from pharmaceutical manufacturers that have given these vendors their greatest audience and leverage. They are also the cause of the greatest amount of friction between HMO customer and PBM vendor, an irritant that was not present a few years ago when PBMs were viewed as allies of managed care organizations.

<ul>
<i>"I think anyone [PBM] owned by a pharmaceutical company is really at risk of losing clients. They have a mainframe mentality. Many are heavily in debt, and the conflicts of interest are the big things. We'll pick them apart as things stand now. Ultimately it will be up to the clients; they'll make or break all of us."
</ul></i>
<ul>
<i>"I've seen vertical integration before with hospitals ['70s], which wound up creating huge bureaucracies that didn't work and no one could manage. So they wound up selling off parts to keep from going broke. I see it happening again with PBMs and the pharmaceutical industry. [This] will help us. Merck-Medco clients were concerned that Medco would only be concerned with needs of Merck and not their clients. Clients were very worried about conflict of interest, and we were able to pick up quite a few. I understand Medco has continued to lose employer groups because of this. We really kick these guys in the rear when it comes to the client level!"</i><br>
—Comments from executives at PBMs not owned by pharmaceutical companies
</ul>

HMOs represent a major portion of the client base for PBMs, along with employer groups and insurance company plans. Nearly one-third of the pharmacy directors surveyed rated their PBM's service as poor or below satisfactory; one-third thought the work of their PBM was satisfactory; and the remaining third rated their PBM's work as good to excellent. However, this range of opinion can be deceiving. Generally smaller, less demanding, and less sophisticated HMOs granted higher satisfaction ratings.
<p>
The leading complaints about PBM service, even from the two-thirds of HMO customers who were at least "satisfied," revolved around disclosure of rebate levels. HMO directors thought PBMs only try to provide guidance on drug use when they can steer clients toward rebated products. Naturally HMOs feel used, since PBMs make money off their patients and physicians.
<p>
And since PBMs do not reveal the market-share drivers or rebate levels, HMOs can't give pharmacists or physicians independent direction on what drugs are truly more cost-effective. HMOs also claim they cannot confirm that PBMs are living up to their contracted financial commitments.
<p>

<ul>
<i>"The loss of control over pricing and rebates [is worrisome]. It's the accuracy of the rebate checks and the money you get. It's their say-so; you have no way to check if it's accurate. They say the pharmaceutical companies can't let them let you know the amount of the rebate. You have to take it on faith. It's based on the honor system. No other business in America involving millions of dollars is done on the honor system that I know of!"</i><br>
—An HMO pharmacy director
</ul>

<h3>Drug company rationale</h3>
In virtually all cases where pharmaceutical companies either acquired or entered a joint venture with a PBM, our study found that executives at those companies insisted the intention was not to ensure preferable formulary treatment for their products.
<p>
Instead, the pharmaceutical executives spoke of the need for their companies to participate in the broader scope of cost-effective, quality health care delivery. To those executives, this means going beyond the limited functions of developing and distributing drugs—the role of a supplier. It means making themselves part of a larger integrated health care system that can emphasize and reward disease prevention and control.
<p>

<ul>
<i>"We can no longer isolate ourselves and hide behind the discovery of new therapeutic agents. The same talents which historically produced new and better drugs can be used for disease prevention and control."</i>
</ul>
<ul>
<i> "PBMs are an unnecessary middleman and are doomed to extinction. ... After over 40 years, it is no longer business as usual. The combination of dramatic changes in our customer base, breakthrough developments in information technology and the influx of generic drugs has forced us to reevaluate." </i><br>
—Two senior pharmaceutical industry executives
</ul>

PBMs have used improved technology and data management as their raison d'être. They could prove very useful to their pharmaceutical partners in developing disease management programs and outcomes studies with pharmaceutical clinical information and real-world practice data. And in the short term, PBMs, with some practice, would be able to provide pharmaceutical manufacturers with information to more cost-effectively and intelligently market their drugs.
<p>
This would mean the manufacturer, through the services of its PBM, could eventually offer physicians, patients, and managed care organizations an optimally managed disease state package—one that features the manufacturer's products, of course. This, in effect, would "legitimize" any preferred formulary status for the company's pharmaceuticals. 
<p>
There are other approaches, however, that do not call for paying inflated prices for a PBM, many in the study said. Patient data and outcomes are the keys for pharmaceutical companies looking to have a greater role in disease management. A drug manufacturer might be better off buying the information from a variety of HMOs and large insurers on its own, especially since the HMOs do not appear likely to sell it to the PBMs. Nor do PBMs have access to medical/surgical information, diagnostic information and medical histories, data vital to any credible disease management program. Technology giants like AT&T, IBM, and Electronic Data Systems are already developing units to service and consult with the health care, industry with the aim of creating systems to capture and interpret so far elusive data from a variety of different sources.
<p>

<ul>
<i>"If you believe that whoever has the most information wins, you have to believe this is the next step. ... You don't need the PBM per se; you need the functions of a PBM. That's what's valuable to you. And if you can get that without spending the money on the PBM, you're ahead of the game."</i><br>
—A pharmaceutical executive
</ul>

Whether the purchase of the three leading PBMs turns out to be profitable for their pharmaceutical manufacturing parents remains to be seen. Clearly, Medco, the nation's mail-order leader, is a different PBM than PCS or DPS. PCS is moving ahead with wiring physician's offices directly to the pharmacy and the PBM. And DPS, with its strong HMO presence and hospital link, has just purchased a mail order arm.
<p>
While claims processing may be the main source of revenue for most PBMs, drug makers did not purchase them because of the earnings potential on this vulnerable service. No, PBMs will have to evolve to maintain their influence and retain clients and thereby their access to prescription data.
<p>
But even bigger questions for drug makers loom, such as, how to use the data effectively that PBMs possess. Or is the prescription information simply a tool to sharpen the capitation bidding process? As manufacturing companies, how do you make money with disease management? How do you price temporary, dynamic, and portable disease management consulting services? And what happens to the programs when new drugs come along? Are drug makers prepared to also become consulting firms as well as suppliers? Obviously, every company will have their own learning curve to climb in the next decade.

<h2>The Shameful State of<br>
Pharmaceutical Micromarketing</h2>
</center>

<h5><i>by Richard B. Vanderveer, Ph.D. & Wayne Klitsch</i></h5>
<hr>

<h3>Executive summary:</h3>
<I>After five years, micromarketing—database marketing—is still poorly used in the pharmaceutical industry.
As much as 95% of its value is lost. Micromarketing too often suffers from a lack of understanding, thought, and strategic direction. Emphasis should be shifted from the high-prescriber physician to the new "collective" customer, and management must get closer to the field reps.</I>
<p>
The concept of micromarketing has been in place in the pharmaceutical industry since 1991. It now appears, however, that the growth of micromarketing was stunted at the time of its birth. Typically, the average pharmaceutical company concentrates its marketing efforts on the highest prescribing doctors (see <a href="shame2.html">"Theory Versus reality"</a>), thus ignoring a wealth of information that can be profitably used in boosting sales. There is a great deal more value which can be derived from micromarketing, but we have to change fundamentally the way we use the data to get this added value.
<p>
Interestingly, pharmaceutical micromarketing has continued to concern itself exclusively with the doctor, even though everyone recognizes that the decision-making power of the physician is being reduced. Nor can we, as some have tried to do, fall back on the assumption that micromarketing is concerned mainly with the doctor and managed care, a sort of two customer, access vs. pull-through view of the world.
<p>
The first thing we need to do is get our noses out of the numbers, and realize that those numbers represent people, people with motivations, needs, and wants. There are strategies underlying the numbers. When we do that, we realize that it's about time we amend the definition of pharmaceutical micromarketing itself. There needs to be a redefinition of who the customer is. Quite simply, focusing micromarketing efforts solely on the physician is out of step with the healthcare reality of the 90's.
<p>

<h3>The "P" Network</h3>
In reality, the pharmaceutical marketer's customer today is a network, an interactive system which has as its components a number of different players in the overall decision-making process. In fact, to some extent, this new reality violates Webster's definition of a customer—"one who purchases goods and services." Some of these people are not, in fact, the actual purchasers of our product. Nevertheless, we must influence their decision-making.
<p>
Furthermore, the real challenge is not just the multitude of players. It's in the realization that all the players are busily trying to influence all the others. Marketing to these players is a complex process. Integration of our communications approaches to these players is the watchword, and one that requires all the tools available to us, including micromarketing.
<p>
We've called this collective customer the "P" Network, and it includes five components—the Provider, the Patient, the Pharmacy Benefit Manager (PBM), the Plan Sponsor, and the Pharmacist (see <a href="shamfig1.jpg">Figure 1</a>).
<p>
The Provider, who used to be known as the physician, is not necessarily just a physician any more. In the new world of managed care cost containment, he or she is increasingly likely to be a physician's assistant, an optometrist, or another non-M.D. Healthcare plans increasingly rely on the lowest-cost person who can provide the necessary service. This also means that the specialist may no longer drive the adoption of a new drug. The success or failure of a new calcium channel blocker may depend not on the cardiologist, but rather on the primary care physician gatekeeper. Clearly, these trends require a substantial rethinking of the pharmaceutical micromarketing communications process. Who gets targeted for communications, and what needs to get communicated, all are in need of substantial revision.
<p>
The Patient is increasingly a key player in healthcare. Everyone talks about patients losing freedom in the managed care environment, but, in truth, patients are gaining in power and importance. Whatever flexibility they may be losing in choice of particular physicians or treatments, they are gaining in choice of medical plans. The employee benefit committee which helps decide for a company whether a plan is in or out for the coming year is a formidable entity, as far as a health maintenance organization is concerned. The individual employee, who can usually choose among several different plans in which to participate, also is making an important decision in the healthcare marketplace. An increasingly sophisticated patient will be expected to do his/her part in determining outcomes, e.g., through healthier lifestyles and better compliance with drug regimens. Healthcare providers, including pharmaceutical companies, had better develop integrated programs to enhance therapeutic effectiveness.
<p>
Agreement is increasingly being heard that communications with patients will be an increasingly important element of pharmaceutical marketing in the future. Moreover, given the numbers of patients to be communicated with, micromarketing will be an essential tool to employ in helping us to target the right communication to the right patient at the right time.
<p>
Pharmacy Benefit Managers are now the conduits to a large block of patients. While some pharmaceutical companies have purchased PBMs, other are partnering with them and some are trying to outflank them. Any pharmaceutical company without a good PBM strategy stands to lose, and micromarketing again can help.
Increasingly, Plan Sponsors are asserting their power. "Those are my data, my patients. Those are my lives," you can almost hear them saying. He who pays the piper calls the tune. How can micromarketing help us to deal with Plan Sponsors? By helping us to gain a systematic understanding of the fundamentally different kinds of plans that exist in the marketplace, assisting us in databasing this information and thus allowing us to communicate optimally with their appropriate decision makers.
<p>
Pharmacists continue to fight for a voice in the healthcare discussion. Don't be misled by the fact that they have sometimes been ignored in the past. Their role may yet evolve into an important gatekeeping function, and little effort has been mounted to date in the area of micromarketing to pharmacies/pharmacists.
<p>

<h3>Taking Another Look</h3>
Keeping all these players straight and developing an organized way to deal with them requires understanding, thought, and a strategic approach to micromarketing—all of which, in the past, have been too often lacking.
<p>
The emphasis has too often been on getting the data; that is, simply getting more and more data and getting it quicker and quicker. Getting it to product management quicker, getting it to the agency quicker, and especially getting it to the sales representatives quicker. The element which has been missing is a clear idea of what are they going to with it when they get it?
<p>
They're not going to do much with it if they don't understand what the data are and, even more importantly, what they aren't.
<p>
Let's take a typical example. A pharmaceutical company runs a prescriber concentration table on anxiolytics and then picks a few physicians for personal interviews. One of those interviewed reports that he tends to prescribe lots of benzodiazepines but considers them interchangeable, and that he does not prescribe Valium.
<p>
When his self-described behavior is compared with his actual prescribing history (see <A HREF="shampres.jpg">Prescribing Matrix Figure</A>), Valium shows up as having significant market share in his prescribing data. What gives? Well, a likely possibility is that this physician's patients were put on Valium years ago. He's not writing the product for new patients, but patients are still getting renewals.
<p>
Another possibility is therapeutic exchange. Because of formulary guidelines, Valium is being dispensed at the pharmacy as a substitute for whatever the doctor is writing. Remember, we call them prescribing databases, but they are actually dispensing databases.
<p>
There might also be a "group practice effect" at work. This might be the prescribing profile of a young physician just entering a group practice. How do such doctors get their patients? They inherit them from their colleagues. If the patient was prescribed Valium three years ago by a senior physician in the practice, is this new doctor going to change it? Not likely. He'll just write the renewal over his signature, never having made an actual Valium prescribing decision in his life.
<p>
In other words, data do not necessarily equal attitudes, and with chronic medications, the product with the biggest market share is not necessarily the physician's current product of choice. Product managers and representatives alike need to understand this to avoid being mislead.
<p>

<h3>Understanding the data </h3>
Merely downloading data to sales representatives is not what micromarketing is all about. Everyone involved, from management on down, has to have an understanding of what the data mean, if they're going to make appropriate use of them.
<p>
After gaining understanding, the second step that has to be applied in micromarketing is that of thinking the data through. That is, thinking about the broad and long-term implications of the actions we take in regard to the data.
<p>
For example, folk wisdom says that to micromarket a new product, take it first to the top two quintiles of prescribers of products in the category. What could possibly be wrong with such a common-sense idea?
Well, consider the reality of the top quintile doctor. He/she is probably in a busy practice. Several studies have shown that doctors in such practices tend to be the more "promiscuous prescribers," spreading their prescribing across all the products in a given category. What's more, they tend to be the over-promoted doctors. A busy, over-promoted doctor is probably not going to notice or be particularly affected by one company's promotion among all the other noise with which he or she is bombarded. (We're assuming the product is not a breakthrough drug. That's a different story.) The physician will probably prescribe the new product, but will never favor it over the other products in the category, being more likely to spread the business than to pick a product of choice. Moreover, if we stop actively detailing this physician or sample supplies dry up, he or she will quickly shift prescribing to other products in the class. Another name for an early adopter is an early defector! 
<p>
In other words, if we concentrate our resources only on top prescribing physicians, we are in many cases spending our money on a very expensive franchise to maintain. Meanwhile, who are we leaving behind by focusing our promotion on physicians in the top quintiles?
<p>
We may be leaving behind physicians loyal to our company, who have been writing our products for years, and who, taking our company's product line as a whole, are thus very profitable physicians.
In addition, we would often be leaving behind younger doctors with growing practices. We can be certain that, when they have busy, high prescribing practices, they will remember that we ignored them way back when. Consumer database marketers have learned the concept of "Lifetime Value" of a customer, and we must too.
<p>
We may be leaving behind doctors in busy group practices, where the total practice volume is highly profitable. Also, what about the primary care physician who may be less productive than a specialist today but will be the gatekeeper of tomorrow?
<p>
The quintile data readily tells us who the high prescriber is, but it doesn't necessarily tell us who the cost-effective prescriber is for targeting. We actually have to think about that.
<p>

<h3>Strategy is crucial</h3>
Understanding and thought, then, are key factors. However, if there's a single most important factor in successful micromarketing, it's having a sound strategic approach to the application of the data.
A laptop electronic territory management system was recently developed which enables a sales representative to classify the physicians in his or her territory on 36 different dimensions and, on each dimension, array them from high to low. 
<p>
Technologically, it's very gee-whiz. But, why would a pharmaceutical company use such a system? Do we really want a thousand different strategic analyses going on out in the field? Do we really want each individual representative coming up with what the important dimensions are, how they are to be combined, and how they will determine strategy? The answer is probably no.
<p>
At a practical level, there is also the very real question of whether we really expect sales representatives to spend each Sunday evening doing strategic analysis of their territories to plan for the coming week. The answer is, again, probably no.
<p>
In most pharmaceutical companies today, upper management has no idea what the troops are doing in terms of database marketing. There is often a discrepancy between what the folks in the paneled offices are strategizing and what those with their fingers on the terminals think they are trying to accomplish.
<p>

<h3>Answering questions</h3>
Before you can do optimal micromarketing, you need to get your management's answers to two key questions: 1) What is our strategy?; and 2) How can information help?
<p>
Are we into disease management or are we selling product features and benefits? Are we partnering with PBMs or with integrated health systems? What kinds of data will support our strategic objectives, and in what forms? These strategic visions then have to be transferred systematically to all those in the organization making use of the data.
<p>
Relatedly, we need to integrate all of the different company functions having to do in some way with marketing and sales information, and get them all moving toward the same strategic objectives (see <a href="shamfig2.jpg">Figure 2</a>). This is a tall order, affecting such functions as decision support, sales training, sales force automation, data warehousing, and marketing research. Ironically, while many pharmaceutical companies have been "reengineered," i.e., retooled to focus on integrated "processes" rather than "functional silos," most have failed to smoothly integrate into a unified process the way in which marketing and sales data are employed.
<p>
To begin with, we need to make sure we have the "right" database. Currently, we are still only getting about 5% of the value of our data. Most companies are purchasing data only for a few specific drug classes. They are getting only small snapshots of information, usually market share on products of interest, prescribing volume, and plan data. 
<p>
If a company only buys data relating to ace inhibitors, cholesterol reducers, and oral contraceptives, that company's understanding of a doctor is limited to that which can be obtained by viewing the physician through these three small windows. The doctor's overall approach to prescribing cannot possibly be understood from such meager information. How his or her behavior in all prescribing categories fits together is key to strategic micromarketing.
<p>
For example, one physician might have a small practice but loves ace inhibitors and so writes them with both fists. Another, with a busy practice might write a lot of ace inhibitors only because he's busy, in fact, under-utilizing them against his total prescribing potential. Two entirely different strategic situations, but with only a class-specific snapshot, we can't tell them apart.
<p>
Similarly, we can't tell a doctor whose practice is growing from one that is declining. We can't tell doctors who jump on new products across treatment areas from those who are more cautious. We can't tell the doctor whose prescribing is similar to others in his or her group practice from the physician who is more idiosyncratic, marching to his or her own drummer.
<p>
We can't communicate with the individual customer—we can't micromarket—if we don't know these things. We need to stop simply adding more and more specificity to our data, and start expending some energy toward getting the big picture.
<p>
Once the considerations enumerated above are well under control, the next step is to develop and implement a system which imparts the understanding, strategy and insights gained. Simply providing access to gigabytes of data doesn't get the micromarketing job done É we need to organize these massive amounts of data if they are to be useful rather than onerous. A system designed for this purpose has at its heart two key elements, i.e., an Opportunities Management System (oms) and a Marketing Encyclopedia System (mes) (see <a href="shamfig3.jpg">Figure 3</a>).
<p>

<h3>Organizing the world</h3>
An Opportunities Management System is sort of an organized world view, a series of models that help us to understand the role of each of the players—all the P's in the "P" Network—who have a hand in the purchase decision. The system Targets each customer or prospect for appropriate levels of promotion, Tailors the promotional objective to each target, and coordinates Tactical Implementation across decision makers, promotional media, and time. The system puts all the players into one database, shows their aggregations and affiliations, prioritizes them according to where the greatest opportunities are, and decides how to take advantage of those opportunities.
<p>
The Marketing Encyclopedia System focuses on how to improve our use of currently available technology for micromarketing purposes, with special emphasis on how to get more "bang for the buck" from representatives' laptop computers. Till now, we have been relying on "call reporting systems" that amount to no more than transaction reports logged on antiquated software. The so-called "electronic details" which have been implemented so far merely transfer to a laptop the standard ten-minute, eight-page sales presentation that doesn't work anymore even if delivered on a $9,000, full color, Pentium-chip-equipped computer. In general, these test programs have made use of none of the interactivity that is so exciting in this age of technology. Not surprisingly, physician receptivity is poor. No wonder one administrator of an "electronic detailing" system reports that it is used in only 10% of representative presentations. 
<p>
More generally, an mes is built around a "content database," into which are poured digitized "message modules," i.e., the elements of which your promotional messages and other communications are comprised. The mes, being driven by the communications objectives for a particular customer developed by the oms, produces from these modules genuinely customized messages for each recipient. Moreover, this message and supporting computer graphics can be modified "on the fly" by interactions driven by the representative or, if you so choose, by the customer himself or herself.
<p>
Finally, when we talk about "empowering the sales representative," we need to consider that representative's ability to feed information into the system. Representatives are collecting data every day. We need to give them the ability to feed this information back into our system on a routine basis, not just when we send them a request for a specific piece of "marketing research" information. If the strategic approach we are using is clearly communicated to them, they can be a much more valuable source of information than is currently the case. Remember, in the long run you can't gain a sustainable competitive advantage by relying solely on someone else's (e.g., ims's, Walsh's) data. Building on these essential foundations, however, insights from well-trained representatives can provide the competitive edge!
<p>
In summary, we need to apply more thought and understanding to the use of data; apply a strategic approach to the use of data; build the right database; organize a formal data management system with a strategic point of view; and train the representative to create interaction between the system and the customer.
Only then we will be doing true micromarketing.

<h2>The Radicalizing of British Media Buying</h2>
</center>

<h5><i>by Michael Paling & Susan Wrigley</i></h5>
Executive summary:
<i>Essentially all of the pharmaceutical media in the U.K. is now funneled from a few buy points. This has had adramatic effect in the way media is planned, bought, and marketed. Many journals have folded, rates and commissions have fallen, and the healthcare media independent has become all-important and all-powerful. But a backlash has seen the rise of the independent with strategic and creative capability.</i>
<p>
During the last decade there has been a radical change in the media planning and buying process in the U.K. pharmaceutical industry and a concentration of the number of buying points. It has become rare for media to be bought by full-service healthcare advertising agencies or directly by the pharmaceutical client. 
There are now relatively few healthcare media buyers in the U.K. and in 1994, 98 percent of the total pharmaceutical media in the U.K. (£40m) was bought from just 12 buying points—six of these being media independents specializing in the healthcare market. (A media independent provides only media planning and buying services and is not part of a full-service advertising agency. However, there are some advertising groups which own media independents. Examples include Saatchi and Zenith or Grey Advertising and Mediacom.) The remainder comprises four full-service healthcare agencies and two client companies (SmithKline Beecham and the Glaxo Group).
<p>
There is a lesson here for American healthcare marketers and agencies. The first media buying service, called Compas, was launched in the United States only a few years ago. Before that, all space was bought either by agencies (the lion's share), or by advertisers direct. In the U.K., dealing off the rate card is an inevitable consequence of the rise of media independents—intermediaries in other words. This is because there are so few media independents involved who are in control of disproportionately large shares of the total business. In addition, the majority of the independents have no other "Universal Selling Proposition" than to claim they can buy at the lowest rates. 
<p>
In the early 1980s, practically all full-service agencies bought media with a number of clients buying media direct. There was just one media independent. The growth in the number of media independents over the last decade has had a dramatic effect on the way media is planned and bought, and in the way it is marketed and sold by the healthcare publishers. Although media in the U.K. pharmaceutical industry has always been a serious business in terms of advertising revenue for the publishers, and viewed by clients and agencies as a valuable and effective part of the promotional mix, the planning and buying process is now dealt with far more scientifically and has become very competitive. Both for buyers and publishers.
<p>

<h3>The Healthcare Publishers</h3>
Unlike the media independents, the medical press has had its casualties over the last fifteen years. There have been fourteen new journal launches—only seven have survived—and at least a further six established journals ceased publishing. This is due to the increasing competitive nature of the business, government restrictions in pharmaceutical promotion, and a downward pressure in rates from buyers—particularly the media independents.
<p>
With the exception of institutional and academic journals, all U.K. journals are distributed on a controlled circulation basis and are issued free to doctors (see figure <A HREF="britfig1.jpg>One</A>, <A HREF="britfig2.jpg>Two</A>, <A HREF="britfig3.jpg>Three</A> and <A HREF="britfig4.jpg>Four</A>. There are 20 readership audited journals serving general practitioners and 28 readership audited journals serving hospital doctors. Additionally, there are over 300 specialist/academic subscription journals—many with overseas circulation. As the mainline journals are sent free to doctors, the publishers rely solely on advertising for their revenue.
<P>
Publishers are having to compete harder as media budgets are concentrated among a few buying points. Larger publishers, with a relatively large number of journals in their portfolios, tend to deal across their titles—i.e., if space is taken in one of their more successful title(s), greatly discounted rates will be offered in the less successful title(s).
<p>
This is possibly a false economy, as the reduced revenue does not provide sufficient investment in quality editorial and design. However, it does make a difficult situation for the smaller publishers to compete and has resulted in some closures. A further argument is that it is not necessarily the best use of a client's media budget to prop-up failing journals in these larger publisher's portfolios.
<p>
Government restrictions on pharmaceutical promotional budgets, and the blacklisting of certain drugs (e.g. removing laxatives, cough, and cold remedies, etc. off prescription) had a dramatic effect in the early 1980s and again in 1993 on advertising. Many journals closed in the early 1980s.
<p>
More profoundly, they have felt the squeeze on space rates by the media independents who are not only responsible for large shares of the total market but are competing with each other and constantly pressurizing for quantifiable cost-effective space. Advertising rates negotiated by independents over the last decade have resulted in current advertising rates remaining very similar to those paid in the early 80s. Clients are benefiting from the reduced rates, but the media business is less lucrative for the publisher.
Emergence of the Media Independent 
<p>
How did the U.K. pharmaceutical media scene allow the healthcare media independent to establish itself in the market place? Simply, it would appear that full-service advertising agencies, with the exception of a few, seem to have laid back and let the media independents take over the media planning and buying function—thus depriving them of approximately £25m worth of media turnover. It started when the Joint Industry Committee for Medical Advertisers Readership Surveys (JICMARS) was launched in the late 1970s, creating a more sophisticated approach to the media planning and buying process. Investment was not only needed to subscribe to the survey, but also in computer software and hardware to conduct schedule analyses. Media Monitoring Services, a pharmaceutical advertising tracking service, was launched at a similar time and, in the mid-1980s was available for computer analyses and seen as another necessary investment.
<p>
It then became apparent to the full-service agencies that, unless there was a substantial level of media coming into the agency, it was not worth the investment in subscriptions, hardware and software, as well as the employment of the media manager to deal with the increasing sophistication. The days of the agency account manager handling media planning and buying as a part of their other agency responsibilities were coming to a close. 
<p>
It rapidly became apparent to a number of media buyers, and account managers with media experience, that if they set-up as a specialist media independent and handled enough business they could afford the investment in readership and advertising tracking surveys. They were also able to offer a more sophisticated media service than the full-service agencies. What's more, they could charge less than the full-service agencies for their service.
<p>
It used to be the norm for agencies to subtract the 10 percent media commission and add 17.65 percent to media budgets to cover design and account handling and/or to offset some of the agency's fees to the client. The media independent, however, did not demand the same level of commissions/fees for their services so it became recognized for the independents to return a percentage of the commissions to the client. Depending on the size of the client's media spend, a media independent's remuneration can be anything from the full 10 percent commission to as low as 1 percent commission. The low level of commissions charged by the media independents, plus their buying muscle to negotiate lower advertising rates, made it too competitive for most full-service agencies to provide media planning and buying as part of their service.
<p>
Another reason for media independents gaining a foothold in the market, was the trend in the mid-80s to go a la carte for services, and the younger and more innovative product manager was attracted to using a media independent.
<p>

<H3>The Current Buying Market</H3>
The first healthcare media independent entered the market in the early 1980s and over the last 10 years a further 6 have entered the market and have all continued to expand. During 1994 they bought approximately 63 percent (£25+m) of the total pharmaceutical space. There are four large full-service agencies with established media departments and between them were responsible for approximately 20 percent (£8m) of the total pharmaceutical space in 1994. Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham bought direct from the publishers and between them were responsible for approximately 15 percent (£6m) of the space. The remaining 2 percent of space was bought by a handful of smaller full-service agencies. Zenith (a division of Saatchi and Saatchi), the largest consumer media independent in the U.K., acquired all of 3M's media requirements during 1994 including the pharmaceutical division. However, consumer media independents on the whole have been unsuccessful at breaking into the pharmaceutical industry.
<p>
The healthcare media independents in the U.K. appear more aggressive in acquiring media clients than media departments within the full-service healthcare agencies—none of whom have won a media account on a stand alone basis. While clients find it unacceptable for full-service agencies to handle conflicting accounts, this however, does not seem to be a problem for the media independents—in fact, most independents handle more than one conflicting product campaign.
<p>
As there are so few buying points, publishers service the buyers with caution, to upset or offend any one of these buyers could have a devastating effect on their market share. Particularly when the two largest independents handle approximately £15m between them. There are times in the U.K. where one media independent can be responsible for around 30 percent to 40 percent of advertising space in one of the leading weekly general practitioner newspapers; practically all of this independent's space being in the first half. Therefore, any other buyer advertising in this newspaper finding it difficult to secure early positions. Predictably, this has resulted in a backlash, whereby the majority of media buyers have shied away from using the publication with the result that the newspaper has lost considerable business over the last twelve months. It follows that publisher tread a fine line—offering good deals to their largest buyer(s) to gain maximum market share of the buyer's business whilst not alienating any of the other buyers.
<p>
What are the benefits for the pharmaceutical client in using a media independent as opposed to a full-service agency? The answer must be that, if the client views media solely as a commodity and is satisfied with a bucket shop buying approach to media, the benefits are competitive rates and a high proportion of prime and early positions in the press.
<p>
However, in theory, if a client is looking for strategic media planning and creative use of space they should be using their full-service agency to fulfill the media function (not necessarily in practice though, it depends on the agency media planner).
<p>
Planners and buyers have the upper hand in today's climate. On face value, their clients are the ones who benefit from the combined and concentrated buying clout. But are the clients really benefiting? The majority of the media independents have become no more than bucket shops. Although space broking is not allowed in the U.K., this is in effect what is happening. Space is negotiated for a twelve-month period and discounted for volume. This is then divided between each of the clients and their campaigns without regard for the individual product's marketing and advertising objectives.
<p>
Some pharmaceutical companies are now realizing that although they are benefiting from the combined buying clout of their media buyer they are losing out on creative use a space, added-value ideas or media schedules to meet their individual marketing and advertising need. Few planners actually plan and become involved with strategies. There is a financial issue too- large advertisers may ask why their media buyer's smaller advertisers should benefit from the large volume discounts to which they have contributed to most.
In response to those clients requiring a more strategic approach to their media planning and with individual creative thought to their advertising needs, a new breed of media independent has recently entered the market. Media communications companies such as Wrigley Foster Media Direct, place emphasis on strategic planning and producing media schedules to meet individual product campaigns needs, they also specialize in direct marketing planning and buying and database marketing and management thus providing an integrated approach to media.
<p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
Are the independents going to continue to dominate the media planning and buying scene in the U.K.? Probably, but not in their current format. Clients have grown accustomed to the advantages of using a strong media independent to keep rates down, gain early positions and be charged a reduced commission. However, some clients are starting to view media as more than a commodity and are becoming aware of other creative and value-added benefits of press advertising, such as co-promotions, relevant editorial, sponsored supplements etc. Some publishers have responded to this climate and are developing contacts with client product managers and drawing their attention to the unique benefits of their publication against the cost-per-thousand (CPT)—which is the only benefit most independents use to justify using a publication to a client.
<p>
Certainly the days are long gone when space was bought, in most cases, subjectively. Either, through a good relationship with the advertising manager, or because the ad manager was an effective salesman regardless of the quality of the publication. Advertising in the press had to develop a measurable, cost-effective and professional approach. However, there is room for creative selling and buying the media and, perhaps, white space in the press will become less of a commodity in the next few years than it is today in the U.K. pharmaceutical industry.

<h2>Good Marketing Practice = Good Medical Practice</h2>
</center>

<h5><i>by Warren R. Ross</i></h5>

<h3><i>A Conversation With Ron Keeney, M.D.,<br>
founder and president of the<br>
American Academy of Pharmaceutical Physicians</i>
</h3>

<hr>

<h3>Executive summary:</h3>
<i>A closer relationship between marketing and medical departments provides several benefits including quick product launch times and FDA approvals. A root cause of friction between the two is a lack of specialized training, and a main goal of the aapp is to develop an educational curriculum. The pharmaceutical physician has a newly important role in managed care as a "moral quality control" protecting patients, as a link between medicine and marketing, and as a counterpoise among conflicting the viewpoints of consumer, manufacturer, and government.</i>
<p>
The recently organized American Academy of Pharmaceutical Physicians (AAPP) has among its major goals two objectives that are also dear to the hearts of medical marketing executives:
<p>

<ol>
<li>To improve the quality of pharmaceutical and other healthcare product promotion, and
<li>To speed the approval of new drug applications.
</ol>

To find out more about this overlap of aspirations, Medical Marketing & Media interviewed the Academy's founding and current president, Ronald E. Keeney, M.D.
<p>
Every physician specialty has long had its own, independent professional organization. The one glaring exception has been that of doctors associated with industry—the pharmaceutical physicians. True, there was a medical section sponsored by what was then the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (today's Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA), but it was limited to doctors working for association members.
<p>
Anyway, it wasn't independent, and so it lacked the stature and recognition accorded to other professional societies.
<p>
To correct that situation, some 100 industry physicians got together in November of 1993 to launch the American Academy of Pharmaceutical Physicians. As Dr. Keeney put it, the relationship between the new academy and PMA would be "collegiate but independent"—with the stress on independent.
<p>
But that does not mean that aapp will neglect the collegiate aspect, Dr. Keeney explains. "We have a common goal in the support of a strong pharmaceutical industry as provider of innovative medicines that offer excellent value to the patient in terms of efficacy, safety, and cost." Which is why the Academy will lay great stress on training pharmaceutical physicians as to how they can help to improve promotional programs and avoid delays in obtaining FDA approval of new drug applications (NDAs).
<p>
Though only 52, Dr. Keeney recently took early retirement from Glaxo in order to devote himself full-time to the achievement of the Academy's goals. In more than 10 years at Glaxo, he served at various times as director of clinical development and vice president for medical affairs. Before that, he spent eight years at the pre-merger Burroughs Wellcome, so he knows at first hand the problems that can derail promotional excellence and prompt NDA approvals.
<p>

<h3>Avoiding conflicts</h3>
About the relationship between marketing and medical departments he says: "It is ridiculous for medical and marketing people not to talk to each other during the development of a new campaign. When final copy and art are submitted for approval only when all the work's been done and deadlines are tight, the result all too often is that medical and marketing people fight about it for four or five months, holding up the launch of the campaign and creating needless strife."
<p>
Instead, he believes, there has to be dialogue along the way, practically from day one, so that the medical department is an active participant in the development of promotion programs. Not only will that prevent time-wasting and expensive disagreements when it comes time to sign off on the campaign, but doctors—based on their expertise and their feel for how their colleagues in clinical practice talk and think—can often make positive contributions that might not occur to them when faced with a finished promotional program. "The objective for both parties," Dr. Keeney points out, "is to get the best possible information to the prescriber or other decision-maker. After all, it is the quality of the information that largely determines the quality of pharmaceutical care."
<p>
Dr. Keeney is quick to admit that some friction when two disciplines rub up against each other is unavoidable, and that even with the best will in the world pharmaceutical physicians often don't know enough about the techniques and objectives of promotion to be able to help their marketing partners.
<p>

<h3>Catching up with training</h3>
The root cause of such communications breakdowns is often the lack of proper preparation for the pharmaceutical specialty. Surgeons, internists, pediatricians and family physicians all have their prescribed courses of specialty training—leading up to a qualifying examination—before they are certified in their specialties. Pharmaceutical doctors, however, are almost always recruited from other specialties and assigned their corporate responsibilities with little attempt to teach them how to do their jobs (see <a href="convers2.html">"Definition"</a>).
<p>

AAPP wants to correct this situation.
<p>
"It is one of our main goals," they announced at the outset, "to develop an educational curriculum... Traditional medical training must be supplemented by training in negotiation skills, group dynamics, and effective use of information as the decision-driving authority."
Hence, development of a training curriculum became one of aapp's highest priorities, and Dr. Keeney reports that a pilot program has already been developed in conjunction with Howard University. Also, arrangements have been made with four universities to develop pharmaceutical medicine units within the academic setting, so that medical students and residents will be exposed to this discipline as part of their rotation, just as they are exposed to other medical specialties. Finally, the Academy is developing a postgraduate program that currently employed pharmaceutical physicians can participate in on a part-time basis.
<p>
Better training, Dr. Keeney is convinced, is also the key to speeding up the approval of new drug applications. Unlike the critics who put all the blame for delays in NDA reviews on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), he acknowledges that while FDA procrastination, especially on supplemental NDAs, has at times been inexcusable, the fault often lies with the quality (or lack of it) of the applications.
<p>
"The reason for long delays is often that the applications are based on shaky data, or that, even if the data are good, they are poorly presented. If we can help our members help their companies to make sure that they submit good packages, it will speed the process considerably," he says.
<p>

<h3>A picture of the Academy</h3>
This emphasis on better training and education should cheer not only corporate marketers but also their ceos. But it is by no means the only reason why the founding members of aapp felt such an organization was needed.
<p> 	
Academy membership—which now stands at 400—is open to all physicians who spend more than half of their time working in or with the pharmaceutical industry or such related fields as contract clinical research companies, managed care organizations, or regulatory agencies. A survey conducted by Dr. Susanna Dennis of Roche showed that the average number of physicians in pharmaceutical companies is 102.5, with a high of 250 and a low of one. (The survey was conducted in 1993; 239 doctors replied, of whom 211 worked in the U.S.) Their responsibility includes primarily management, clinical and pre-clinical research, and regulatory affairs, as well as marketing, medical education, and medical communication/information. This range of perspectives and responsibilities, Dr. Keeney points out, means that pharmaceutical physicians not only share all the challenges being faced by the healthcare industry, but also "face huge opportunities, since we offer the industry the scientific and moral leadership it needs more than ever."
<p>
Dr. Keeney made a similar point in his presidential launch message. The founding of the Academy, he told his colleagues, served as recognition "that ours is a valid medical specialty," and constituted "enfranchisement among professional peer societies, despite biases that have not always accorded us equal professional status within the community of medicine." He added that pharmaceutical physicians practice a unique body of medical expertise and that no other medical specialty "practices the range of skills or affects the multiples of patients that we do. What we do and the decisions we influence, impact patients around the world in the tens and hundreds of millions."
<p>

<h3>A dual responsibility</h3>
In the days when patient care involved primarily the doctor and the patient, pharmaceutical physicians may have been viewed as differing from other specialties because their responsibilities had two dimensions: medical and organizational. Now that so many practitioners have a simultaneous obligation to their patients and to the bottom line of managed care organizations, such a balancing of obligations is hardly unique.
"The public expects pharmaceutical physicians to be their moral quality control in an industry which impacts their health so profoundly, but whose efforts on their behalf must also be bottom-line sensitive. They expect us to protect their interests during scientific, medical, and commercial deliberations that affect the impact of prescription drugs on health care."
<p>
If industry doctors fail in this obligation, he warns, it will lead to more restrictive regulation not only of their practices, but hurt the industry as a whole through increased demands for price control and other onerous regulation. Concern for such consequences was another reason the Academy's founders felt the need for such an organization: it provides countervailing pressure in the constant struggle to maintain the right balance between organizational and professional loyalty.
<p>
Dr. Keeney doesn't fudge the fact that "there is a natural tension between the commercial promotion of pharmaceuticals and the practice of pharmaceutical medicine. This tension is at the very core of pharmaceutical medicine. It may be held that the industry's only objective is the maximal sale of its drugs, or it may be held that each company is an ethical practitioner of pharmaceutical medicine."
And who is right?
<p>
"Reality resides somewhere in between these two extremes," he says, adding that the mission of pharmaceutical physicians is "larger than the corporations for which we work and, indeed, larger than the politics of the day. To survive and contribute in such a dynamic and sometimes hostile environment as we face today, we must maintain our focus on the big picture—the needs of our patients and our responsibility to advocate on their behalf. If we do our jobs well, our commercial colleagues will have no difficulty selling the drugs which we and our research and development colleagues present to them," thus generating the profits that keep the entire enterprise—including the development of still better drugs—going.
<p>
Dr. George Goldstein, who then headed PMA's medical section and strongly supported the founding of the Academy, also sees a key link between pharmaceutical medicine and marketing. A former vice president for medical and regulatory affairs at Sterling Drug and now president of Pharmaceutical Discovery Corporation, he admonished his colleagues in an Academy newsletter to "seek greater involvement not only in research, postmarketing surveillance, packaging, regulatory matters, advertising and promotion—the myriad tasks requiring the understanding of disease and patients that only a broad medical education provides—but in the business disciplines as well. The respect of your marketing/sales colleagues for your overall concern with the business and medical ethics must be earned daily." Calling his fellow-members "the medical conscience to our companies," he warned that their lack of involvement would lead not only to more bad press but have an "incalculable" effect on the entire industry.
<p>
Dr. Keeney has devised a motto to sum up this view of the relationship between pharmaceutical physicians and their marketing colleagues: good marketing practice equals good medical practice. Echoing Dr. Goldstein, he says, "We are sometimes referred to as the moral anchor of our industry. As the Ôwhitecoats,' we are relied upon for candor and balance regarding our companies' products. As physicians, we have a social contract with the public to assure that the drugs we develop and promote are the best they can be." The new academy, he feels, can help "convince the public that we are not the enemy," that instead "pharmaceuticals are the most cost-effective component of illness prevention and intervention."
<p>

<h3>The final credentials</h3>
The culmination of the Academy's efforts to upgrade both the qualifications and the prestige of its members will be the establishment of a certification process akin to that of other such professional accrediting bodies. Such certification already exists in the United Kingdom, and according to Dr. Keeney, the Academy is looking closely at the British precedent as a possible model for the U.S.A.
<p>
But even if all of the Academy's ambitious objectives are achieved, pharmaceutical medicine can flourish only within a healthy and profitable healthcare industry—which in turn depends on a rational and effective healthcare environment.
<p>
When asked about this larger perspective, Dr. Keeney doesn't mince words. When he was in medical school in the 1960s, he says, the notion that the value of human life could be quantified was unthinkable. "How things have changed!" he adds, listing some of the questions that now need to be answered during the drug development process:
<p>

<ul>
<li>Does the new drug reduce global healthcare costs?
<li>Does it displace other, more costly interventions, such as surgery?
<li>Is the disease self-limiting and therefore should be tolerated without treatment?
<li>Does the individual who would benefit have enough productive life left to make the cost of care worthwhile?
<li>Should a patient receive costly hospital care if there is no cure for the illness?
</ul>

All these questions, Dr. Keeney points out, would have been considered unethical 20 or even 10 years ago, yet today they are the subject of both public debate and daily business discussions.
Nor are things getting any better. "Money for medical research is drying up; medical practitioners are prevented from freely caring for their patients by mountains of paperwork and fiscal limitations; academically based clinical researchers find that grant dollars are drying up; and regulatory-based pharmaceutical physicians are losing valuable review time to "political inquisitions and predatory press coverage." The consequence is that pharmaceutical physicians, like all other specialists, are being inhibited in trying to provide optimal medical care.
<p>
Looking to the future, Dr. Keeney sees pharmaceutical medicine as facing a dilemma. On the one hand, computer molecular modeling, molecular biology and genetic engineering provide the tools for unprecedented progress in the discovery and development of valuable new drugs. On the other, external forces are threatening to stifle this technological potential. Among the negative forces he cites are corporate mergers and acquisitions, the changing marketplace in which the individual prescriber is no longer the main decision maker, as well as the new criteria he cites by which drug discoveries have to be judged.
<p>
These trends remind him of a bizarre situation he encountered some years ago when he wanted to have Zovirax (Wellcome's acyclovir) evaluated behind the Iron Curtain.
<p>
"In the absence of government-approved treatments," he recalls, "people with potentially lethal herpesvirus infection were not eligible for admission to the state-run hospitals. And since there were no patients with the disease in the hospitals, the studies couldn't be done... which meant the drugs could never make it to the state-sanctioned formularies... which meant the patients could never be admitted." Supposedly rational regulations had created a lethal loop from which these patients never could escape. "In today's public policy arena, we hear chillingly similar debates," he warns.
<p>
As an example of this frightening trend he cites assertions that the development of me-too drugs can no longer be justified, and therefore should be denied reimbursement by third-party payers. This argument, he points our, "flies in the face of conventional medical wisdom, which teaches that the wide range of human variability often necessitates the empiric use of several members of a drug class before one is found to be effective in an individual patient. Similar conventional medical principles are being challenged daily by non-medical experts' (lawyers, legislators, formulary managers, insurance executives, and healthcare management consultants, to name a few) who in effect are practicing medicine without the benefit of a license or medical training."
<p>
If the Academy's efforts succeed, pharmaceutical marketers will have found a strong, new ally, and the entire healthcare enterprise will benefit. For, as Dr. Keeney points out: "The core purpose of pharmaceutical medicine remains unchanged—to discover, develop, and make available to all who need them medicines to relieve human suffering, prolong quality life, cure and prevent life-threatening illnesses, and ease the debilitations of advancing age."
<p>
Which serves as a refreshing counterpoise to the many clamorous voices that seem to care only about cutting cost, rationing care, limiting choice, and regulating the practice of medicine.

<title>Medical Marketing & Media, MM&M, 1995 Midyear Advertising Review</title>
<head>

<h2>1995 Midyear Advertising Review</h2>
</center>

<h3>Medical/surgical spending continues to slide</h3>
How you view the results of HCI's Medical Promotion Audit (mpa) for the first half of the year depends on how you describe that partially filled glass of water. Spending in the medical/surgical journals they track continues its decline, albeit at a slower rate than previously. For the first half of 1995, advertising outlays fell 5.7 percent to $162 million. This is significantly less than the 13.8 percent decline for 1994, but represents a decline of one-third compared with spending in the first half of 1992. There were roughly 46,000 pages of advertising run in the first half of 1996, 8.2 percent fewer than the first six months of 1994 and 27.2 percent less than the first half of 1992.
<p>
The tables that follow list the 25 most-advertised products (<a href="adrev1.html">Table 1</a>), the 25 largest advertisers (<a href="adrevt2.html">Table 2</a>), and top 25 product categories (<a href="adrevt3.html">Table 3</a>). Comparative data for 1994 and 1993 are included in each table.
<p>
The most disappointing aspect of the first six months of 1995 was new product activity. Rather lack of same. There were only nine new products with spending over $1 million for a total of $15.6 million and an average of $1.7 million each. This includes Famvir which was launched in May of 1994 and had modest spending in the first half of 1994. This figure is well below the 31 products (not including Famvir) which were first advertised in the first half of 1994, with total spending of $31.5 million and an average of $2.4 million. There were only five new products in the top 25 through midyear, and two in the top ten, Famvir in fifth position with $2.6 million in advertising, and Flonase in seventh with $2.4 million. In 1994, six new products made the top-ten list.
<p>
While advertising for new products was nothing short of bleak, the "good news" is that spending for established products stabilized. Support for the 13 products introduced during the first half of 1994 with budgets over $1 million only declined 28.6 percent, compared with a drop of 50% from 1993 to 1994 for new products with million dollar budgets. Of these 13 products, three are among the top ten for the first half of 1995, including Adalat CC in second, and Serevent in fourth position. Another six were outside the top ten, but remained in the top 25 list. 
<p>
Cardizem CCD maintained its first-place ranking with a 23.3 percent increase. Voltaren rose from 130th to 8th place with a 922-percent increase. Prilosec climbed 32 positions to 12th with a 120.7-percent boost in ad budgets, and Zovi moved to 15th from 42nd with a 54 percent spending increase. 
<p>
On the down side, 11 products dropped out of the top 25. Calan SR, Capoten, and Toradol stopped advertising altogether. Imdur cut back by 93 percent to drop from third to 124th, Zosyn slashed 82 percent to fall from seventh to 76th, and Oruvail cut 70 percent from its ad budgets and dropped from 13th to 68th. Zestril cut spending by 31 percent and dropped to 31st, while Daypro dropped to 28th with a 21 percent cut. The last two products, Biaxin and Difulcan, split their budgets between campaigns. Biaxin increased total spending by 1 percent, splitting a budget that would rank 20th, if combined, between campaigns for Biaxin and Biaxin Suspension. Difulcan® reduced total spending by six percent, and split this amount between its traditional anti-fungal claim and the new vaginal anti-fungal program.
<p>
Despite massive adjustments in spending budgets, rankings of pharmaceutical companies (Table 2) remained fairly stable. Wyeth-Ayerst remained in first place with 5.94 percent of total expenditures despite cutting spending by 17.3 percent. Of this year's top 25 companies, 20 repeated from 1994. Newcomers to the list were Bristol-Myers (11th) with an increase in advertising outlays of 229.45 percent in support of the launches of Glucophage®, Monopril®, and Serzone®; Burroughs Wellcome (15th) with spending up 64.41 percent behind campaigns for Lamictal®, Wellbutrin®, and Zovirax®; Ciba-Geigy (19th) with spending up 578.83 percent due to Voltaren®; Forest (24th) with budgets up 16.14 percent due largely to Lorcet® 10; and McNeil Consumer Products (25th), up one place despite a 10.69 percent cut in ad expenditures.
<p>
Top-25 companies which rose in the midyear 1995 rankings were Pfizer (fifth) up 61.26 percent due to the launch of Glucotrol XL and continued support for Norvasc; Allen and Hanbury's (sixth) up 67.4 percent due to the introduction of Flonase; and Astra-Merck (ninth) with increased advertising for Plendil and Prilosec.
<p>
The companies that dropped out of the to 25 were Key (from 14th to 70th) with a 91.71 percent decline due to reduced programs for Imdur; Squibb (15th to 48th) with cuts for Capoten and Pravachol; Glaxo (23rd to 46th) due to cessation of advertising for Zantac; Cerenex (22nd to 42nd) with cuts in spending for Imitrex and Zofran; and Parke-Davis (12th to 37th) which stopped advertising for Accupril. Lederle slid from second to tenth with a 44.11 percent cut, largely due to reduced support for Ziac, and Searle dropped from eighth to 14th due to a 42.21 percent reduction in ad levels, in part a result of ending support for Calan SR.
<p>
Among the most-advertised drug types (Table 3), the top four remained unchanged: Calcium Blocking Agents, Antiarthritics, Antidepressants, and Antispasmodics. One newly-designated class, Estrogen/Progestogen Oral, entered the rankings in 20th spot. Four other groups moved into the top 25: Inhaled Steroids Nasal (9th), Diabetes Oral (12th), Antihistamines Caps & Tabs (16th), and Estrogens Oral (22nd). Five product groups dropped out of the top 25 at midyear: Fungicides Systemic (16th to 28th), Nitrites/Nitrates (8th to 31st), Anti-Migraine (23rd to 63rd), Diuretics Non-Injectable/Other (19th to 95th), and Synthetic Non-Narcotic analgesics, which had no advertising in 1995.

<title>Extending the Product Life-Cycle</title>
</HEADER>
<BODY>
<center><h1>Extending the Product Life-Cycle</h1>

<H5><I>by Sander A. Flaum</I></H5></center>
<hr size=4>
<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<P>
<I>Despite their efficacy and cost-effectiveness, older drugs
can be, and are often, overshadowed by new medications. Strategies for extending their lifecycle (and return) include new delivery systems, disease management, ethnic- and gender-based marketing, pricing adjustments, new indications,
and going over-the-counter.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
Today’s pharmaceutical marketplace is testing every member of every team involved in bringing the best therapeutic products to patients. While we all like to think that our industry is unique, it doesn’t exist in a vacuum. And the times we’re facing aren’t quite as unusual as we think. 
<P>
Take a moment to remember a now-extinct American institution known as the Bell System. Back in, say, the 1950s, if you leased a phone from Ma Bell (and everybody did because there was no choice), you had the same three choices of color that you had with the Ford Model A: black, black, or black.
<P>
Until the government broke up the old Bell System, there was no serious competition in the phone industry. So, there was precious little incentive to make phones that excited customers.
<P>
But give AT&T credit, those phones were tough: the average lifecycle of an old Bell telephone was something like 40 years. Then, in 1984, the Department of Justice broke up the monopoly and suddenly there was all kinds of competition.
<P>
The legendary lifecycle of AT&T phones was now a liability instead of the basis for bragging rights. No phone company, ever again, would have 40 years to recoup its investment in a product, because no product would last that long in a competitive market. Eventually, Ma Bell capitulated, junked the old reliable phones, and joined the competition in selling —  no pun intended —  bells and whistles. 
<P>
<H4>The danger in age</H4>
<P>
In similar circumstances today, most pharmaceutical companies must look for other solutions. We have products on the market that are the pharmaceutical equivalent of Ma Bell’s big, durable, black phones. These drugs work very efficiently. They’re both affordable for consumers and profitable for manufacturers. But the danger is that these venerable drugs will either be overshadowed in the market by somewhat more efficacious newer drugs, even though the newer ones are more expensive, or else they will attract so many Òme-tooÓ versions that they become commoditized. Either way, their lifecycle in the marketplace is foreshortened, and the manufacturer’s return on equity takes a beating in the process.
<P>
So, one of the biggest concerns in the pharmaceutical industry today is how to extend the lifecycle of products that are still effective, but not as glamorous as they once were. For the sake of perspective, though, let’s remember that this isn’t a new concern in pharmaceuticals. 
<P>
As a new product manager in 1972, I remember agonizing over ways to extend Aristocort’s product life. Back then, Aristocort was Lederle’s premier product in the dermatological area and had sales of about $8 million a year. The patent was to run out in two years, and our patent attorneys had worked for the last year or so trying to figure out, without luck, a new process patent . 
<P>
Our mission was to figure out what we could do to preempt intrusion by those upstart generic companies. We had dreamed up all kinds of dosage forms and new strength options. We decided to introduce an ointment form of Aristocort, and Aristocort gel for the hairy parts. Finally, we instituted a 0.25 dosage form.
<P>
<H4>Innovation the key</H4>
<P>
But the big idea to extend Aristocort’s lifecycle was Aristocort A. “A” was for the new base, which we called Aquatain. We hoped this would give Aristocort at least another 5 years of life and prosperity along with it. What an idea! 
<P>
Well, Aristocort A did succeed while old Aristocort went generic, and many imitators came on the market with their house brands of triamcinolone. We fell madly in love with our new Aquatain base, which we began to promote as the moisturizer of the ’70s. Aristocort A was a big commercial hit and we recommended that Lederle start an over-the-counter division around Aquatain. But the company just wasn’t ready to go that far.
<P>
We didn’t view the new Aquatain base as a new concept in delivery systems. But, in retrospect, it in fact was one of the early new delivery systems that have become so popular today as a key mechanism to extend the product lifecycle. And for that the industry can credit Elan Pharmaceuticals and Alza. They’ve been a great boon to the entire pharmaceutical industry with their innovative delivery systems that extend product life. 
<P>
Be it Procardia XL or other re-engineered products, one of the important ways that we’ve been successful in extending product lifecycle has been through the use of unique extended-release technology. Procardia XL has been an enormous success for Pfizer and has pushed the lifecycle of Procardia remarkably — and profitably. There are more re-engineered innovations on the way, particularly in the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) area, from Elan, which will provide patients and their doctors with new therapeutic benefits derived from older drugs. 
<P>
But, what do we do for an encore? The times are incredibly complex and change is happening faster than ever before. The rapid changes we see today are not only commercial, but political and cultural as well. Ethnic marketing is big and will be much bigger by the end of the nineties. Also, marketers have discovered that men and women respond to a different language. Marketing to the genders now is almost a new profession, and we are looking at new ways to market to gays, the elderly, Hispanics, African-Americans, sub-continentals, Native Americans —  and not simply Asians anymore, but Chinese, Filipinos, Japanese, Koreans, and Vietnamese.
<P>
<H4>Understanding change</H4>
<P>
Understanding change isn’t an insurmountable task. It is understanding to whom we will be marketing tomorrow, which products, and in what form. Few would consider marketing undifferentiated products today: we immediately look for a niche, a segment.
<P>
Take the case of Sandoz and Lescol. Strategically, they determined that it would be too expensive and too inefficient to go head to head with Mevacor or Pravachol, so they decided to become the “managed care cholesterol-lowering agent.” By pricing it at a substantial discount, they now have more than a 16 percent Rx share. Sandoz’ growth objective for 18 months has been achieved, though Lescol will have to sell a lot more units to maintain share. And it could well keep growing until Merck or Bristol-Myers Squibb decide to reduce their profit margins on their respective brands or to obtain new, unique indications. 
<P>
But managed care isn’t as predictable as we would like. We can use Zantac as another example. Many analysts believed that managed care organizations (MCOs) would demand the aggressive switching of patients from Zantac to a generic formulation of Tagamet when it became available last year. But the opposite happened. According to data from IMS America, prescriptions for Zantac have instead increased, though Glaxo was forced to increase discounts to the managed care market (see <I>MEDICAL MARKETING & MEDIA,</I> April 1995).
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry is now becoming more aggressive and realistic in its pricing strategies with regard to MCOs. Companies are quickly changing, from blindly slashing prices in order to gain universal formulary acceptance, to courting only the larger, more profitable health plans (for the pharmaceutical companies) with deep discounts across the board.
<P>
What’s the point here? Clearly, managed care and pricing strategies are a new way to extend a product’s lifecycle or, more importantly, another way for a company to give life to a successful commodity product.
<P>
Certainly we are going to see a lot of “price strategies” from pharmaceutical companies with undifferentiated products. It’s a strategy we in the pharmaceutical industry have hardly used heretofore. But we will now. We must.
<P>
<H4>Another marketing tool</H4>
<P>
Today we’re also beginning to see the increasing use of disease management programs to broaden a product’s lifecycle in a managed care setting. Disease management to many is a marketing tool strong enough to pull products through a health maintenance organization (HMO). Many companies are finding that this kind of collaboration is good business, particularly in situations where an expensive course of therapy (such as hypertension, diabetes, oncology and other costly disease states) is involved. 
<P>
Pharmaceutical companies are being criticized by some HMOs because their respective products are part of the algorithm of a total disease management program, saying that smacks of outright commercialism. But whether a company should have its own disease management division to sell non-product oriented programs, or just sell the traditional way by wrapping disease programs around branded products, planning the extension of a product’s lifecycle by making a product part of a disease management algorithm, makes eminent marketing and commercial sense. 
<P>
While great minds are busy planning such extensions, sometimes the best results come from a combination of luck and effective lobbying. The greatest boost to product lifecycle extension recently has come from the most unlikely source: global politics, in the form of the GATT Agreement (see <I>MEDICAL MARKETING & MEDIA, </I>May 1995). 
<P>
A Glaxo spokesperson was recently quoted as saying that GATT extends many of its patents, Zantac among them. More important, Glaxo argues, the extended patent term gives them extra months  —even years—  of protection from competing generics. While the case relies on complicated legal arguments, it boils down to whether the provisions in GATT supersede a 1984 law that prevents the Food and Drug Administration from approving generics until the patent on a name brand expires. 
<P>
If the industry’s arguments prevail, more than 100 brand name products will win an average of 12 months each of extra patent protection. A new study from the University of Minnesota estimates that the extra protection could give the drug makers a windfall of $6 billion over the next 20 years. This is not a tool that we planned on, but it’s certainly a serendipitous one not found in “Product Lifecycle Planning 101.”
<P>
<H4>Always creativity</H4>
<P>
Finally, let’s consider the ingredient most believe is behind many great business decisions: creativity. For it’s really creative marketing that saves the day and finds the way of extending a product’s lifecycle. Creative marketers will always find breakthrough packaging and innovative new delivery systems. The Alzas of the world will sprout shoots, and they, in turn, will find other interesting and creative ways to deliver and/or alter a product look. Remember, in classic marketing terms, a new form, a new delivery system, new indications, and unique packaging are all new products. 
<P>
Rh™ne-Poulenc Rorer’s Dilacor XR is a great example of a product with a lifecycle that has been extended by a new formulation and again by a new indication. The brand used a unique formulation technology to create a patent-protected brand of diltiazem. It was developed and priced for the treatment of hypertension, as compared to Cardizem, which was mainly used for the treatment of angina. The strategic marketing of Dilacor XR enabled it to capture a substantial share of the diltiazem hypertension market, which it still holds today.
<P>
The product also benefitted from a new indication. Later in the product’s lifecycle, Dilacor XR received approval for the treatment of angina. This added three more years of patent protection and gave RPR an opportunity to penetrate the diltiazem angina market. These two creative marketing strategies have not only helped extend the lifecycle of Dilacor XR, but have also increased the product’s market share as well. 
<P>
Pfizer used new packaging to help increase market share for its antibiotic Zithromax. Pfizer developed the Z-Pack, a full course of therapy in a pre-packaged box, to eliminate physicians giving out samples for full courses of therapy and to ease the writing of prescriptions by physicians. The repackaging helped jump-start sales and should prove to increase the product’s lifecycle.
<P>
The need for the most creative marketing, though, arises when you have a product that has not been reformulated, relabeled or repackaged. Tenormin’s Wellspring Program, a total hypertensive patient management program, comes to mind as an excellent example of this. What was then ICI Pharmaceuticals was able to capture the imagination of doctors and patients alike by offering this broad-scale program. Lotensin’s price guarantee is another example of such life-extending productivity.
<P>
Another obvious strategy for slowing a product’s aging process is to switch ] products to over-the-counter (OTC) as their patents reach expiration. All three major H2 inhibitors have gone this route. Pepcid is now OTC with initial claims for heartburn and acid indigestion. Tagamet is in hot pursuit, and Zantac is on the way. 
<P>
Next, get set for the rush to OTC for the cholesterol-lowering and anti-smoking products, with many more from the current crop of prescription NSAIDS following close behind.
Creative marketing can and will extend the shelf-life, and the financial vitality, of many pharmaceuticals. This trend is just beginning. Planning ahead in unique and creative ways surely will pay off in the development of the next lifecycle extension strategy.
<P>
In these tough times, it’s not a matter of whether we want to extend product lifecycles or not. We have to. And we will. The pharmaceutical industry has the research, marketing and organizational talent, the technology and the creativity to get the job done.

<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<I>Syndicated market assessment studies can be valuable to product management if chosen with care. Look not only for useful information, but for analyses that can contribute strategic insight and direction for product planning, and sufficient detail to be useful at a tactical level. You can also tailor studies to your needs by working with the research company during the final design stage.
</I><P>
<hr size=4>
Product managers typically rely on market researchers to provide them with information to support their brands. But in an increasingly complex healthcare market where multiple sectors impose their perspectives on brand selection and use — whether it be the managed care or other payer who wants to restrict the physician's prescribing of your brand, the pharmacist who suggests generic substitution, or patients who ask why they should pay more for your product — information in itself is not enough. Indeed, the product manager in today's environment may feel overburdened with too much information coming from too many directions.
<P>
What you need is information and analysis presented in such a way as to provide a useful level of summarization and detail for different audiences within your company (e.g., the market research analyst, the product manager, and the company executive). Useful is defined as accessible and easy to use. If these elements are present, then a syndicated market assessment can contribute value to your business planning process, providing not just information but the kind of actionable knowledge and analysis from which strategic and tactical implications can be drawn.
<P>
<H4>Providing value</H4>
<P>
Custom research is, of course, the most certain way to generate such actionable data. But it can run into money. A good reason for turning, instead, to syndicated marketing research is that it costs less. By selling a study to multiple clients via syndication, marketing research companies can spread the cost of data collection and data processing, as well as costs associated with analysis, over a larger client base, making the costs for each individual client considerably lower than a customized study of similar scope.
Of course, cost savings are only valuable if the information you are purchasing is useful. A syndicated study must provide reliable information that is relevant to your business planning process. In developing a business plan, the marketer today is more customer focused than ever before, and the marketing plans themselves are more action oriented. As <a href="Squeeze1.html">Figure 1</a> shows, a typical business plan falls into several parts:
<UL><LI>A "Market Overview" that quantifies the current market size and share of the company's key brands in addition to assessing the market situation within which brands are competing;
<LI>An assessment of "Opportunities and Problems" that identifies success factors for your brands and their competitive position — key issues that, if left unaddressed, will affect performance of the brand and opportunities that, if taken advantage of, could possibly affect the brand's results;
<LI>A determination of "Strategy and Tactics" that involves, first, defining strategy and tactics and then evaluating/testing them;
<LI>Development of a specific Financial Plan that includes estimating sales and costs, and the contribution to business.</UL>
<P>
If a syndicated market assessment study is to contribute value to not only the <I>Market Overview </I>portion of a business plan but also to defining <I>Opportunities and Problems </I>and <I>Strategies and Tactics,</I> it must include the "right" information as a starting point.
<P>
<H4>The right ingredients</H4>
<P>
First, it must be <B>forward-looking </B>to provide direction for the future — not just about the current market status of brands (as, for example, an audit might measure market share), but also offer insights into market trends. This can be done by tracking market usage patterns over time via a consistent set of basic questions from year to year, and by measuring anticipated future behavior, e.g., physicians' prescribing intentions or expected managed care formulary restrictions. The product manager can't change the past, but can affect the future if he or she knows trends over time and the forward direction of the market.
<P>
Second, useful data must provide <B>diagnostic </B>tools that include the <I>whys, </I>not just the <I>whats. </I>It is not enough to know what might happen for a particular therapeutic class or disease state. The value of diagnostic information — such as the reasons that support a brand's dominant market position or why other brands are likely to increase in use in the future — is that it points to action. It is not enough for the product manager to know that his/her brand share is slipping. To take the right corrective action, one must know why.
<P>
Third, the data must be <B>comprehensive </B>in providing all the needed information. If there are gaps in the information needed to make a strategic judgment or a tactical decision, then the information is also less valuable. For a given customer segment, the data should include, among other things, the opinions and perceptions of brand image, as well as their current and anticipated future behavior — and the reasons why.
<P>
Fourth, the data must be <B>current, </B>taking into account both current market forces and issues that will have bearing on the future. Every experienced brand manager knows the hazards of failing to consider a new element or factor in the marketplace.
<P>
Finally, to the extent possible, the study should include the information to be integrated and analyzed from a single sample. One result of using diverse information sources is the problem of comparability across diverse samples. The "right data," as much as possible, provides all the meaningful elements necessary for a strategic analysis within a common base, i.e., one sample of respondents.
<P>
<H4>Contributing to analysis</H4>
<P>
What is required next is an integration of the data. Analysis requires the know-how, experience, and skill to integrate, distill, and present the findings in such a way that the user can easily understand its implications and, as a result, determine proper action. <a href="Squeeze2.html">Figure 2</a> (which describes the Therapeutic Class and Disease Management Studies) shows typical areas of inquiry for a physician/provider syndicated market assessment in the left-hand column, and in the right-hand column some ways that this general information can be used by a product manager to assess opportunities for the brand. As <a href="Squeeze2.html">Figure 2</a> shows, typical areas of inquiry for a syndicated market assessment study include a market overview of current issues, and consideration of current disease management approaches, current brand positions, and future trends in brand use. It also typically includes extensive data on perceptions of brands in terms of their product attributes of greatest importance to the market, patient usage data, and managed care influence on physician prescribing.
<P>
This information can be helpful in assessing your competitive position now and in the future, your brand's image, its strengths and weaknesses, and your best product positioning claims. It can also help you identify potential patient niches, the impact of managed care practices and policies on your brand, and the implications for your pricing strategy.
<P>
Let us be even more specific about the way these general competitive assessments can be useful for a product manager. A recently completed syndicated physician/ provider market assessment in the cardiovascular area provided information on the brands for which physicians expect to increase use in the next six months, together with the brands physicians expect to replace, and the reasons why. The following is an illustration of the type of findings you could expect.
<P>
<B>Expected change in use:</B>
<UL><LI>Brand X (a competitor) will be used more in the next six months based on its perceived efficacy, and to some extent may replace your brand (see <a href="Squeeze3.html">Figure 3</a>).
<LI>Brand Y, on the other hand, is also expected to be used more by physicians and may be a potential replacement for your brand, to an even greater extent.
<LI>The reasons behind expected increase use of Brand Y are its low cost and managed care's preference for it (see <a href="Squeeze4.html">Figure 4</a>).
Product perceptions:
<LI>Perceptual information on the image of your brand shows that on several key efficacy dimensions, such as 24-hour coverage, your brand is perceived to be superior to the low-cost Brand Y (see <a href="Squeeze5.html">Figure 5</a>), in spite of the fact that Y is perceived to be more economical for the patient (see <a href="Squeeze6.html">Figure 6</a>).
<LI>Such efficacy elements can perhaps be used as potential product positioning elements to show a clinical superiority of your brand over the lower-cost competitor.
<LI>With respect to the competitive threat from Brand X, we see from image data that it is seen as equally effective as your brand (see <a href="Squeeze5.html">Figure 5</a>).</UL>
<P>
<B>Other market issues:</B>
<P>
<UL><LI>Managed care preferences, however, as reported by physicians, indicate that Brand X is disliked by managed care because of its high price and that its use is being discouraged or restricted (see <a href="Squeeze4.html">Figure 4</a>), a trend that you believe is likely to increase over time.
<LI>In addition, information on usage of brands for specific patient types reveals that you have a strong position for patients with concomitant heart failure, which the efficacious Brand X does not.</UL>
<P>
The product manager now has a clearer picture not only of the potential competitive threat, but of the reasons behind it, and thus can plan accordingly.
<P>
<B>Summing up</B>
<P>
Useful data and analysis generated by syndicated studies can contribute, at a minimum, to the broad overview part of the business plan. In addition, such surveys can serve multiple clients within a pharmaceutical company — from the market research analyst who wants more analytic detail to the product manager who wants more synthesis and integration in order to make informed decisions about his or her brand, to the top executive who wants to know the bottom-line implications for the company's products.
<P>
The product manager, in particular, needs strategic information synthesized and summarized, with the appropriate amount of facts and detail to back up the conclusions in order for it to be immediately applicable and useful in defining problems and opportunities in the plan and pointing to strategic and tactical options.
<P>
A syndicated market assessment study can help fulfill all these needs.
<P>
Finally, a suggestion. In today's complex and interrelated healthcare market, where consideration of disease management is becoming ubiquitous, the informed product manager must have the kind of information we have described not only about physician/providers, but also about consumer/patients and managed care /payers. Not only must he or she know about each of these market sectors, but also about their impact on each other (see <a href="Squeeze7.html">Figure 7</a>). More and more, the researcher must understand these multidirectional influences if he or she is to provide a full picture of the marketplace from which the product manager's strategies and tactics can be drawn and a unified marketing approach (which may include disease management) can be achieved. <a href="Squeeze8.html">Figure 8</a> provides examples of several issues addressed in recent studies in these areas with a few indications of how they can be used meaningfully in business planning.
<P>
In order to establish whether or not a syndicated market assessment study will be helpful, the product manager should ask eight questions:
<P>
<OL><LI>Is the study a current and comprehensive representation of the market and its drivers?
<LI>Does the study include information on the brand positions among all the major players in the market? Can future trends in product use help you to understand your competitive situation and what you might do?
<LI>Does the study provide reasons and diagnostic tools, i.e., not just what, but why and how?
<LI>Does the study provide detailed measurements that can be used tactically, e.g., detailed brand image data, or patient usage data?
<LI>Is there consistency in the basic questions from year to year to allow tracking your brand's status over time?
<LI>Does the study demonstrate an understanding of the complexities of the marketplace and yet provide key marketing findings and implications in a concise and easy-to-grasp manner?
<LI>Is the study part of a comprehensive research program that takes into account the impact of multiple customer segments within the marketplace?
<LI>Can the study be used as a cost-effective vehicle on which to piggyback custom/proprietary questions — a source of intelligent (custom) questions?</OL>
<P>
When the answer to these questions is "yes," we believe the syndicated study is indeed a value for the money. We are not arguing that syndicated studies alone provide every piece of information a product manager would need (see <a href="Squeeze9.html">When a Syndicated Study is More Than a Syndicated Study</a>), but that they can be used in conjunction with other types of information, such as audits and custom research, to contribute to the brand assessment and planning process in a cost-effective manner.

<P>
When it comes to buying a syndicated study, what you see is not necessarily all you get. It could be a lot more, according to Angela Bylancik, product director, dermatology, Roche Laboratories. Companies that do syndicated studies — that is, research projects that are not tailored for one specific client — welcome input from prospective clients. In fact, 90 percent of clients ask for questions to be added. (You also can add proprietary questions or even customize an entire syndicated study to meet your needs, although this usually entails an extra fee.) Research companies are open to this because additional questions from professionals in the field give additional depth to the research — nobody can think of every type of question that could provide valuable insight. So everybody wins.
<P>
If you are going to a research house for the first time, or want an already completed study, Bylancik suggests you ask to see the table of contents and a list of all the graphs, charts, and tables for the study you are interested in. Ask how the data are organized and likely to be displayed. See what's been done in the past.
<P>
You are also free to ask for an outline of the sample design used for physician, patient, or managed care-based studies, and for a list of the sampled group of physicians. From this, you can tell whether the configuration will meet your information needs.

<h2>The Specialty Markets: Signs of a Turnaround</h2></center>

<hr size=4>
<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<P>
<I>Has the decline in advertising bottomed out? Figures from audits of eight specialty markets seem to reflect a turnaround in most, with double-digit increases in two and strong gains in two more. Here are the latest figures from HCI’s Medical Promotion Audit.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
In our September issue we reported HCI’s figures for advertising in medical/surgical publications. While ad pages and spending continued to decline, the rate of decline is not as great as for 1994. In examining midyear figures for the eight specialty markets that HCI covers, the glimmer of a turnaround in advertising is also present. When we reported midyear 1994 figures, ad spending in most of these markets was down. The midyear 1995 figures reported in this issue reflect increases in five of the eight markets, with the decline in one of the three that shrank being less than 0.5 percent.
<P>
While spending figures can be distorted by the addition and deletion of journals reported within the individual market, even when data are limited to spending in the journals covered in both years, the trend seems to be upward. Spending in hospital management journals continued to increase at a double-digit rate, followed closely by dental journals. Laboratory journals reversed the declines of 1994, with revenues up over seven percent, while optometry advertising continued its pattern of growth. Ophthalmology journals also reversed 1994’s shrinkage with a modest 1.5-percent increase. While spending in nursing journals was flat, reflecting a continuing decline in recruitment advertising, product advertising grew. The exceptions to the positive trend were in pharmacy and radiology journals, both of which suffered double-digit declines.
<P>
The pages that follow present brief summaries of each market for the first six months of 1995, including the 12 largest advertisers and most heavily promoted products, plus the titles currently audited by HCI. Each table provides the 1995, 1994, and 1995 ranks, shares of spending, and percent changes for the companies and products listed.
<P>
<a href="HCI_DM.html"><H4>Dental</a> product advertising climbs</H4>
<P>
Spending in dental journals rose 10.22 percent, or 7.96 percent if only those publications coded both years are considered.
<P>
Dentsply International strengthened its hold on the number one spot with a 22.64 percent increase. It accounted for 7.62 percent of all spending, close to three times that of Den-Mat Corp., the number two company with a 2.55 percent share. Ten of the top 12 companies increased spending, most with increases of over 30 percent. The two companies who cut back on advertising did so by only five percent.
<P>
The largest increases in advertising were registered by Henry Schein (132.61 percent) up from eighth to seventh, Ultradent Products (67.61 percent ) from ninth to third, Glidewell Laboratories (57.31 percent) from 20th to 11th, and Bisco Dental Products (53.76 percent) from 12th to sixth. Also entering the top 12 were Colgate Oral Pharmaceutical, up eight positions to ninth (50.93 percent), and Kern Eye Institute (68.39 percent) moving up from 18th to 12th.
<P>
Crest Gum Care Toothpaste replaced its sister brand Crest Tarter Control as the most heavily advertised product, accounting for 1.73 percent of all spending for the first half of 1995. The top 12 products change frequently. In fact there is only one that has been in the top 12 for three years, Listerine. It is currently fifth, having dropped from third. It is also the only product in the top 12 to cut spending (-10.89 percent). Otherwise of the top 12, six are new products (Crest Gum Control, Colgate Total, Lodine 400, Prime & Bond, Advanc/Cem, and CAVI/FSD). Five rose up the ranks: Vicodines (74.97 percent) to second, Lorcet 10 (86.75 percent) to third, Rembrandt/G (726.79 percent) to fourth, All-Bond2 (201.14 percent) to ninth, and Association Seminars which rebounded to 12th with a 44.34 percent boost in ad spending. 
<P>
All the products in the first-half 1994 top-12 cut spending, and, as mentioned above, only Listerine stayed in the ranking. Brassler F nearly made it, falling from eighth to 13th (-1.38 percent). Two (Crest Tartar Control and Toradol) dropped below number 200 in the rankings. Of the other eight, one (Lynx F) ranked 18th; four were between 30 and 50 (Plax 30th, G.U.M. 41st, Nite White 39th, and Mentadent Banking Soda Toothpaste 46th); two 50 to 100 (Oral-B/ADV 75th and Statim 97th); the last, Ultracam was 148th.
<P>
<a href="HCI_HMM.html"><H4>Hospital Management</a> advertising climbs</H4>
<P>
Advertising in Hospital Management journals rose 10.8 percent during the first half of 1995.
<P>
This is a volatile market. Only three companies in the top 12 for the first half of 1994 remained in the top 12 in 1995. Kodak held onto its number one rank despite a 19.09 percent drop in spending. The other two were Siemens Medical Systems (54.49 percent) rising from 10th to third, and Browning Ferris Industries (37.15 percent) slipping from eighth to 11th). Interestingly enough, Kodak was the only company in the top 12 to reduce spending. Comp Health rose from 715th to sixth with the biggest spending increase (6,851.52 percent) in support of its staffing services, followed by Owen Healthcare (387.04 percent) and Landis & GYR Powers (366.74 percent). DuPont rose to second with a 186.3 percent increase. Two companies advertised for the first time, Aramark Services (eighth) and Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceuticals Division (ninth). Equifax, after stopping its advertising support for the first half of 1994, returned and ranked seventh at midyear 1995.
<P>
Of the top 12 products for the first half of 1994, only two, Siemens Medical Systems and Browning-Ferris Industries, increased spending. The rest cut it. Four of 1994’s top dozen failed to make that list this year: Service Master Healthcare Management Services (-73.30 percent) skidded to 91st, Horizon Mental Health Management (-41.89 percent) dropped to 46th, HBO & Company (-34.01 percent) fell to 26th, and 3M Health (-25.96 percent) just missed at 13th. Five others from 1994’s top 12 fell below the 200th rank: Hillenbrand Industries, Spectrum Emergency Care, Zeneca Group, Charter Medical Corp., and Digital Equipment Corp.
<P>
The highest ranked product was Coastal Physicians Recruitment with 1.12 percent of total spending. Holding the same share, but slightly lower dollars was Landis & GYR Powers Services, which increased advertising 366.76 percent. The largest increase was for Comp Health Staffing (6,851.52 percent) which vaulted it from 930th to third. This was followed by Portfolio Annuity (1,861.68 percent), Landis & GYR Powers (366.76 percent), Genius Thermometers (208.61 percent), and Kodak Imaging Solutions (195.76 percent).
<P>
There were two new products, Aramark Services (fifth) and Milliman & Robertson Service (seventh). Another two started advertising again after stopping all efforts during the first half of 1994, Equifax Accounts Services at fourth and Aegis Sonography Management Systems in 11th place. Five products moved up the ranks to enter the top 12.
<P>
Three products remained in the top 12 from the first half 1994. All of them recorded spending increases: Coastal Physicians (47.25 percent) to first, Browning-Ferris Industries (20.67 percent) to sixth, and Emcare Staffing (18.06 percent) to 11th. The rest all suffered declines. Four stopped advertising and one fell below the 200 mark. Of the others the highest was Source Data System (-43.82 percent) which fell to 45th from 10th. This represents a major turnover in the top products.
<P>
<a href="HCI_LAB.html"><H4>Laboratory</a> spending on the rise</H4>
<P>
Laboratory journal advertising rose 7.14 percent for the first half 1995, reversing the 9.66 percent decline a year ago. If the journals no longer coded are not considered the spending level is unchanged.
<P>
Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics strengthened its hold on first place with a 14.48 percent increase, raising its share of spending to 6.55 percent. Syva, lead by SYVA/DAT the new number-one product, jumped from 60th to second with 1305.25 percent increase. Syva was one of the two companies to break into the top 12 for the first half of 1995, the other was Sysmex which started advertising July 1994 and ranked 10th. The other 10 companies were all in the top 12 a year ago. Of these, six increased spending and four cut it.
<P>
The largest increase was for Olympus (49.19 percent) which raised it one place to fourth. Dupont Pharma (21.01 percent) held at third and Behring Diagnostics (31.87 percent) rose from seventh to fifth.
<P>
The two companies that dropped out of the top 12 were Ciba-Corning (12th to 14th) and Biomerieux Vitek (11th to 30th). Ciba-Corning is continuing to reduce its laboratory advertising, this time by -17.59 percent, after a 61.86 percent cut last year. For the first half of 1993, it ranked first. The other cutbacks of note were Bayer Diagnostic (-39.60 percent) which dropped from second to seventh, and Sigma Diagnostics (-32.27 percent) which fell five places to ninth.
<P>
This technology-based market saw rapid change in the products advertised. Six of the top 12 did not advertise during the first half of 1994 and none of the top 12 advertised in the first half of 1993. Only one product remains from the top 12 of the first half of 1994, Cardiac T Assay, which ranked seventh. Six did not advertise or were ranked below 200 during the first half of 1995 (Inova, LDL Test/SI, Tandem PSA, ACSI 180, Clin/Atlas, Stks/Maxm). The top ranked product was the recently introduced Syva “Drugs of Abuse” tests with 2.60 percent of total advertising. The other new products were Xldimem (third), Quanelisa (fourth), Acastar (eighth), Emit 2000 (ninth), Ekta 950irc (10th) and Pace2C (11th). Four products had large increases in advertising support: Au800 (559.97 percent) to second, Opusmagnum (109.59 percent) to fifth, Technimmui (426.71 percent) to sixth, and Syva Lab Products (168.30 percent) to 12th.
<P>
On the down side were the six products mentioned above which either stopped advertising or fell below the top 200. In addition five of the first half of 1994’s top 12 had significant cuts in support. They were: ACA (-88.37 percent) from 12th to 186th, Cxpress (-70.38 percent) third to 52nd, Dimen AA (-63.13 percent) fourth to 43rd, B-Max (-54.00 percent) second to 18th), and Axsym (-44.63 percent) seventh to 24th.
<P>
<a href="HCI_NUR.html"><H4>Nursing</a> advertising firms up</H4>
<P>
Advertising dollars in nursing journals steadied during the first half of 1995 after several years of hefty declines. Total spending dropped only 0.34 percent. If only journals coded both years are considered the fall is still only 0.61 percent.
<P>
There was no change in the top three companies. Recruiting, local and national, dominate advertising in nursing journals, accounting for 34.93 percent of dollars. This is slightly greater than the figure for the first half of 1994 (34.35 percent), but significantly below the first half of 1993 (42.36 percent). Local recruiting showed a modest increase (3.88 percent); a year ago it fell -30.78 percent. National recruiting continues its decline (-11.69 percent).
<P>
Total non-recruitment ad spending dropped slightly, 1.12 percent. There was one new company, ICU Medical (fourth) which launched the Clave Needleless Connector. Becton Dickinson jumped to sixth from 51st (356.65 percent) with strong support for its Safety-Lok Vacutainer, and Ohmeda rose from 59th to 10th (261.04 percent). Sherwood Medical increased support for the Genius Thermometer and rose to 7th (41.85 percent). Nine of the first-half 1994 top-l2 products had their advertising budgets reduced. Four dropped out of the top 12, Convatec to 16th with a 55.95 percent cut in spending, Roerig to 19th, with a 31.57 percent reduction, American Nurses Association to 71st with outlays slashed 76.89 percent, and Hillenbrand Industry to below 200 after eliminating 97 percent of last year’s budgets. The other significant cuts were Wyeth-Ayerst which dropped three positions to ninth with ad budgets down -32.69 percent, and 3M Health off two spots to 12th with a 21.65 percent cut in advertising.
<P>
Looking at products, Nurses Liability Insurance maintained its number one ranking. Cross-Country Healthcare rose to second with a 37.38 percent boost in spending, and Travelcorps to third with a 54.48 percent increase. Clave Needleless Connector, a new introduction, came in at sixth. The other significant jumps were for Genius Thermometers (59.43 percent) up from 14th to 10th, and Safety-Lok (833.75 percent) from 204th to 12th.
<P>
Three products dropped out of the top 12: Air Force, from 11th to 13th (down 1.03 percent), MRA Staff from eighth to 16th (down 29.06 percent), and MBNA from 12th to 31st (down 51.48 percent). Within the top 12 the largest decreases were AMN which fell from third to ninth with a 33.21 percent spending cut, and Army, which dropped from second to fifth with a 12.10 percent reduction in advertising.
<P>
<a href="HCI_OPH.html"><H4>Ophthalmology</a> advertising edges up</H4>
<P>
Advertising in Ophthalmology journals rose slightly (1.53 percent) after last year’s sharp decline. If only the journals coded both periods are considered, spending was off 2.68 percent.
<P>
Storz Ophthalmics increased its advertising 24.06 percent and moved into first place with 10.47 percent of total dollars spent. The increase is due largely to Occivite Extra Vitamins. Two companies moving into the top 12 were Merck in sixth and Chiron Vision in eighth positions. The other newcomers were Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceutical Products (599.04 percent) to ninth, and Coherent Medical Products (93.00 percent) in 10th. Two companies moved up within the top-12 rankings, Allergan Medical Products from sixth to fifth (8.94 percent) and Alcon Surgical from fourth to third despite a 9.21 percent cut in support. The other companies held position or declined. The most notable decline was Allergan Pharmaceuticals which cut spending 45.80 percent and dropped from first to fourth, largely due to cuts in Ocuflox promotion. Interestingly enough, Ciba-Vision cut spending 35.37 percent, but maintained seventh position. A reduced ad budget for Livostin Ophthalmic Solution was the reason for the cut. In fact, eight of the top 12 products from the first half of 1994 cut spending, and four dropped out of the top 12. The biggest decline was Pharmacia Intermedics Ophthalmic (-81.51 percent) to drop from eighth to 22nd, followed by Iolab (-69.33 percent) which fell from fifth to 13th. The other companies that fell below 12th place were: Volk Optical (-16.42 percent) from 10th to 15th, and Summit Technology, which skidded from 12th to 16th despite a 16.52 percent increase in advertising. The top nine products accounted for more of the total in 1995 (61.23 percent) than the in 1994 (50.83 percent). The “tail” in the first half of 1995 was stronger having to make up the difference. This is seen in Summit Technologies’ drop in rank despite an increase in spending.
<P>
In the first half of 1995, a new product, Timoptic F from Merck, took honors as the most heavily supported product. There were three other new products in the top 12: Smincis Lenses in eighth, Ocuvit Extra in ninth, and TrusOpt in 11th. Of the five products that moved up the ranks, three made the top 12 for the first time: Amo Vitrax (86.71 percent) up from 26th to seventh, Diarox F (485.38 percent) from 79th to 10th, and Microseal (29.93 percent) from 21st to 12th. The other significant increase in support was for Ciloxan (53.35 percent) which moved from 10th to third.
<P>
On the negative side, last year’s number one product, Ocuflox, cut spending 55.96 percent and fell to fourth. All of the top 12 from midyear 1994, except Ciloxan, reduced advertising. Three (Exzvue, Livostin, and Viscoat) dropped to below 200th. Another four fell out of the top 12, Ocuvite (to 36th), CM Lenses (to 174th), Volten Oph (to 35th) and Healon (32nd). The other declines were Ocuflox (-55.98 percent) dropping from first to fourth, and Alomide (-37.81 percent) which slipped from fourth to sixth.
<P>
<a href="HCI_OPT.html"><H4>Optometry</a> spending rises</H4> 
<P>
Spending in optometry journals rose 6.15 percent during the first half of 1995. If only the journals coded for both years are considered, the increase is a healthy 10.87 percent.
The optometry market is always interesting because selling frames is a fashion business and fashion means change. Thus, we often see new lines of frames come and go. In addition, we are in a period of change in how lenses are marketed (i.e., direct mail) and technology changes. Despite all of this, the list of top 12 companies is remarkably stable. Of midyear 1995’s top 12, eight repeated from 1994, and six from 1993. Despite both having reduced advertising support, Sola Optical (-8.14 percent) remains number one and Marchon Eyewear (-20.07 percent) second. In fact, of the eight companies that stayed in the top 12, six reduced spending. The two that didn’t were Hart Specialties (3.58 percent) dropping from ninth to seventh, and Kenmark Optical (11.85 percent) remaining in 12th. The increase in spending took place outside the top 12.
<P>
This year there is one new company in the top 12, sixth-place Aristar which started advertising in July 1994. The three companies that moved up the ranks are: Rodenstock (319.43 percent) 40th to third, Charmant (162.38 percent) 41st to 10th, and Polymer Technology (429.54 percent) 90th to 11th.
<P>
Spect Lite Single Vision High Index Lenses completed its rise to first place with a 210.60 percent increase, having been 132nd in 1993. It displaced the perennial number one, Varilux, which cut spending 34.78 percent and fell to second. Third place went to Hart Specialty Frames (14.90 percent), last year’s number four product. Of the next seven places, six are new products: Biomedic 55 (fourth), Transitlens (fifth), Esprite Eye Frames (sixth), Zeis Vision (eighth), Harley Davidson Frames (ninth), and Complete (10th). Ken Mark Frames held onto seventh place with a 1.69 percent increase. Sunsoft jumped from 75th to 11th (145.20 percent), and XL/Viplens rose from 19th to 12th (16.28 percent). Only three products in the 1995’s top 12 were in the midyear 1994 list, and two in this group in 1993.
<P>
Five of last year’s top 12 products (Hydron Biom, Kodak Lenses, Comfort Lenses, Excal Gold, and Ocuvite) stopped advertising or were ranked below 200. Five more had significant cuts and dropped out of the top 12: XL/VIP Gold (-55.44 percent) to 22nd, Renu MPS(-52.48 percent) to 27th, Klein Eye (-40.57 percent) to 18th, and Opti-One (-25.82 percent) to 28th. Varilux, the fifth, (-34.78 percent) fell from first to second.
<P>
<a href="HCI_PHAR.html"><H4>Pharmacy</a> advertising falls sharply </H4>
<P>
Advertising in pharmacy journals declined 16.86 percent during the first half of 1995. If the three new journals added to the audit of this market for 1995 are not counted, it was down 20.33 percent.
<P>
Pfizer, with solid support for Diflucan tablets and Norvasc, increased spending 52.67 percent to become the top-ranked company. Close behind were Burroughs-Wellcome (5.29 percent) up to second, SmithKline Beecham (-21.41 percent) in third, and Marion Merrell Dow (-21.33 percent) in fourth position. These four were all within 1/10th of a spending share point. Within the top 12, two companies had larger increases than Pfizer, sixth-place Kodak (130.40 percent) and number 12 Lifescan (68.88 percent). In this market the companies to watch are Bristol-Myers Squibb which has risen from 189th in the first half 1993 to 15th, and Syntex which has jumped from 236th to 17th. 
<P>
Looking at the top 12 for the first half 1994, all except Burroughs-Wellcome had declines in spending. Five had cuts over 50 percent; Pratt (-73.05 percent), Schein Pharmaceutical (-71.82 percent), Wyeth-Ayerst (-70.77 percent), Lederle Standard Product (-67.41 percent), and Amgen Diagnostic (-56.00 percent). Wyeth-Ayerst, which had been number one in both the first half of 1993 and 1994, made cuts across the board, not only to one or two products. The volatility of the market is seen in the fact that of the top 12 products for the first half 1995, eight were in the top 12 at midyear in 1994, and five for the first half 1993. Only four were in the top 12 all three years.
<P>
Lifescan Family rose from 474th to the most heavily advertised product with a 2,144.07 percent increase in advertising expenditures. This tremendous climb was almost matched by Famvir which started spending in June 1994. Famvir recorded a 1,028.41 percent increase to rise from 436th to 11th. The only new product in the top dozen was Flonase, ranked 12th. However, 20 of the top 50 products had not advertised before. Four other top-12 products had increases of 100 percent or more, 10th-place American Greeting Cards (264.98 percent), ninth-place Verelan (126.81 percent), sixth-place Lescol (119.25 percent), and seventh-place Cardizem CD (99.83 percent). Verelan was the only top 12 product also in the first half 1993 top 12. However, it fell out of this group in 1994, so no product was ranked in the top 12 all three years.
<P>
Four products remain in the top 12 from the first half of 1994: Adalat CC second, Mylan F third, Zovi fourth and Risperdal eighth. Mylan F was the only product to increase spending (14.59 percent) in the top 12, and rise in rank (12th to third). Five products dropped out of the top 12: Serevent (-40.78 percent) to 15th, Zosyn
(-63.30 percent) to 37th, Procardia XL (-73.05 percent) to 62nd, Propulsid (-78.58 percent) to 105th and Zofran (87.44 percent) to 197th. Esi-Pharm and Ativan Int. ceased advertising.
<P>
<a href="HCI_RAD.html"><H4>Radiology</a> advertising down sharply</H4>
<P>
Spending in radiology journals declined 14 percent. For journals audited both years, the fall-off was 13 percent.
<P>
Siemens remained the heaviest spender in the radiology market with advertising dollars virtually identical to the first half of 1994 (0.15 percent). Bracco Imaging jumped to second from 132nd, with an increase of 3,883.40 percent; it was fourth for the first half of 1993. Pro Hance and company ads received most of the dollars. The other significant increases were for Dupont Pharma (98.20 percent), which rose from 24th to ninth, and Acuson whose 219.60 percent increase pushed it up to seventh from 31st. Apart from Philips Medical (6.72 percent), all of the 1994’s top 12 cut spending. Berlex Imaging stopped advertising. It had been second in 1993. Nycomed (first in 1993) fell from second to fourth. The others that fell out of the top 12 were Agfa (-61.91 percent) dropping from eighth to 22nd, Hitachi
(-41.74 percent) falling from sixth to 13th, and Bennett (-28.38 percent) down seven positions from 12th to 19th. 
<P>
Once again, there was rapid turnover among the top 12 products. There were only two products (Lorad Family and Contourmam) that made it from the 1994’s midyear top 12 to this year’s list. Lorad Family rose from fourth to first (41.96 percent), and Contourmam fell from fifth to ninth (-28.38 percent).
<P>
Interestingly, three products (Pro Hance, Cardiolite and Contourman) were in both the first half 1993 and 1995 top 12 lists. There were only two new products, Konica Services (eighth) and Nycomed (11th). The big increases were for Siemens Family (787.56) which rose from 104th to third, SSD-2000 (73.44 percent) 106th to seventh, and Kodak Imaging (133.46 percent) 30th to fifth. With the exception of Lorad Family, all of the first half 1994 top 12 products cut spending. Magnevist, LR 3350, L1-10A, and Uni/Vanton did not advertise at all during the first six months of 1995. They were second, ninth, 10th, and 12th, respectively a year ago. The other big declines were Helioscas (-82.62 percent) from ninth to 77th, Hitachi F (-82.04 percent) from seventh to 63rd, Ultraject (-60.77 percent) from first to 14th, and Omnipaque (-46.07 percent) from third to 25th.

<IMG align=left vspace=12 hspace=3 SRC="Speakout.jpg"><center><h1>Back to the Basics in Marketing Research</h1>

<H5><I>by Lawrence Belford and MacDonald Smith</I></H5></center>

<hr size=4><H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<I>An increasing amount of sophistication and complex methodologies may be having a negative effect on the ability of modern market research to deliver clear and cogent answers to marketing questions. The emergence of micromarketing, coupled with an industry-wide reduction in research budgets, is forcing us to reevaluate the strengths of smaller-scale, to-the-point projects that are better planned and conducted.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
If there has been one true constant in our many years in market research, it has been the relentless pursuit of sophistication and complexity in our field. To a large degree, it has been driven in recent years by the need for more and more specific information about our traditional target audiences on the one hand, and emerging new customers on the other. The genesis of the drive for sophistication, though, occurred at a much earlier time.
<P>
The real questions are those of whether we have gone too far, whether we have reached the point that we are hindering rather than helping the decision-making process, and whether our current level of complexity and its resultant tomes of information are pushing us to the brink of representing negative value added in our respective organizations.
<P>
In short, perhaps it is time to slow the juggernaut of sophistication, to return to a time of clearly stated objectives met with clearly stated answers — to a time when our customers were not so buried in information overload that they missed the real message. Perhaps it is a time to return to basics.
<P>
<H4>How it all began</H4>
<P>
Through the 1960s and into the early 1970s, market research was done at simple levels bordering on the primitive by today's standards. Questions asked were answered essentially in three ways. The first was to look at IMS data, the second was to get surveys answered at conventions, and the third was to do mail surveys. That was about it. No targeting, no predictive modeling, little or no need for forecasting. Although a simple time, it was not overly satisfying in terms of providing market research with importance in the organization.
<P>
Then, in the 1970s, forces of change came into play. The competitive arena heated up considerably with a plethora of new product introductions and increases of magnitude in the size and specialization of field forces. We also began to see the rudimentary beginnings of audience segmentation. As a result, the demand for timely information increased, and market research began to take on a more significant role in many organizations.
<P>
It was in the 1980s, though, that market research probably took its largest step on the path to complex sophistication. About the middle of that decade, our industry awoke to the realization that sales and marketing were indeed different disciplines. With that realization came an intensity of focus on strategic planning and the development of voracious organizational appetites for information.
<P>
Suddenly, market research was “part of the team”  and called upon to help organizations “know their customers better.” Huge market research budgets came into vogue and, with them, the advent of large, complex quantitative studies such as conjoints, perceptual maps, psychographic studies and ROI analyses of all types. Implicit in all of this was the added complexity of a rapidly growing emphasis on audience segmentation. Associated with this, and adding its own weight to the evolutionary sophistication of market research, was a burgeoning interest in understanding consumers and how to motivate them to take actions favorable to a given company' s brands.
<P>
<H4>Where it took us</H4>
<P>
By the late 1980s and early 1990s, the geometric advances in the sophistication of market research had led to several developments. First, and most obvious, our clients and respective management teams were getting an abundant stream of information developed through a wide variety of methodologies. Second, and owing to our methodological armamentarium, a mystique surrounded market research, leaving our clients wondering exactly how we did what we did. We took pride in that mystique, feeling that it was a point of differentiation and an attribute that enhanced our position in our respective organizations. However, this mystique of complexity led to a third ironic development.
<P>
The irony was revealed in the early 1990s when members of senior management teams throughout the industry were questioned with respect to their perceptions of market research. While we were congratulating ourselves on our high level of maturity and our hard-won place in the sun, senior management saw us as apart from the organizations we serve — good technical suppliers of information but non-participants in the challenges and risks associated with lofty marketing objectives.
<P>
This contrast in perceptions clearly indicated that something had gone wrong. We had focused too hard and had gone too far in our drive for sophistication and recognition. It brought us too close to the point of negative value added.
<P>
Fortunately, two major developments started a reversal of this trend and put us on the road back to basics.
The first of these was the emergence of micromarketing, the art of pinpointing the individual physicians that represent the greatest potential for a given brand. Now, instead of doing massive studies with large samples of physicians, we are able to focus our research resources on a more finite but far more beneficial group of physicians.
<P>
The second development is that market research budgets have been significantly reduced in response to economic constraints posed by our current business environment. The impact of these two developments is succinctly expressed by Richard Vanderveer, Ph.D., president of V<font size=-3>2</font>, Inc.
<P>
“There is no doubt in my mind that primary marketing research in the pharmaceutical industry is going back to basics, that is, back to the reliance on much smaller scale projects that are well thought out and primarily investigative in nature.”  
<P>
<H4>Overcoming a hurdle</H4>
<P>
Although we have started on the road back to basics, there is a philosophical hurdle that must be overcome. We must be able to accept the fact that less is better. In our current rapidly-changing environment, the days of long-term studies and reams of data are over. What our clients need now is relatively quick, straight answers to straight questions. We no longer have the luxury of committing resources to laboriously designing studies that will produce ' statistical significance.'  If we are honest with ourselves, we will admit that much of the information provided by these studies is seldom used and that our clients have little interest in such issues.
<P>
We spend too little time understanding the interrelationships of the complicated business environment in which we operate. We spend too little time helping to map future direction.
<P>
It is not too late to change. No one has all of the answers, and therein lies a wide-open opportunity for market research. We can step in and help fill the void, but the degree to which we are successful will be governed by the degree to which we are willing to lay aside our pride of complexity and become purveyors of concisely delivered, hardhitting information — quick, straight answers to straight questions.
<P>
<H4>Getting better</H4>
<P>
Specifically, we have to fine-tune our skills with respect to qualitative research — conducting solid focus groups and one-on-one research. In line with that, we have to get significantly better at listening, keeping in mind that the vast majority of respondents have no difficulty in answering a question in a straightforward manner. This is not a big event in their lives. We do not have to get through 8 or 10 questions leading up to that final, all-important one. Frankly, we have to improve our skills in developing good, solid mail and telephone questionnaires. We have to get experienced moderators and interviewers who understand our business and the products we sell. This is one of the important keys to a successful research effort.
<P>
To do all this, though, we need to abandon the quest for ultimate design, clever questions, statistical significance, and over-analysis. We must get back to focusing on understanding our markets and what motivates our customers. The veterans in our field must take the lead in this shift in behavior. We must take the time to train and/or retrain our less experienced members in terms of understanding market dynamics, designing concise, to-the-point studies and delivering concise, readily understood results. In short, we must return to basics!

<h1>The Mail Still Delivers</h1>

<H5><I>by Monte Rosen</I></H5></center>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><hr size=4>
<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<P>
<I>Company cutbacks have put pressure on marketing executives
to maintain or even increase market share. At the same time, managed care has made doctors less accessible. Hence, direct mail is, more than ever, an important adjunct to a sales campaign. To be successful, a mailing piece must give the physician a reason to get involved.
Marketing executives should assign a specific mission for every mail program. Concentrate on selling, not response rate.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
Mergers and acquisitions have led to drastic shrinking of the sales forces of consolidated companies. For example, the new Glaxo Wellcome and the merged Hoechst and Merell Dow do not deploy as many reps as did the pre-merger companies between them. This means that product managers are hard-pressed to reach their target private practice physicians — the 20 percent who traditionally write 80 percent of all prescriptions — on a regular basis. So there’s a great need to reach these physicians with other media.
<P>
While mail is not the only medium that can fill this gap, it has the unique capability to target prime prospects. That means not only lists of high prescribers and early adopters, but as companies have become more sophisticated, they have been able to develop all kinds of special lists that single out doctors by category and product usage — both their own and their competitors’. That makes it possible for product managers to use direct mail to pinpoint the doctors who generate the bulk of their business, and to maintain the continuity that sales force attrition has made it difficult or impossible to achieve.
<P>
Also, direct mail offers tremendous flexibility. Naturally, the standard mailing piece is still effective, but you can also use mail to offer CD-ROM disks or computer programs. There is no other medium than direct mail that can incorporate
<BR>
Sound,
<BR>Lights,
<BR>Size,
<BR>Shape,
<BR>Colors,
<BR>Holograms,
<BR>Puzzles,
<BR>Slides,
<BR>Viewers,
<BR>X-Rays,
<BR>Venetian Blinds,
<BR>Magic Windows,
<BR>Wheels,
<BR>Magic Slates,
<BR>Talkers,
<BR>And More
<BR>to interest a person to open, read, and respond to your message. Mail can be made totally interactive and you don’t have to spend a fortune to make it work for you.
More important, it doesn’t matter whether you favor a clinical or borrowed-interest approach, flat or dimensional design. Effectively designed mail will get opened, read, and (if you wish) answered.
<P>
<H4>Fitting into managed care</H4>
<P>
The other current trend that points up the continued need for direct mail is the growth of managed care. Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have all kinds of rules and regulations about personal selling. Some keep sales reps from roaming the halls, others ban sales calls altogether. There are also restrictions on sampling. But mail can penetrate these hostile fortresses.
<P>
To the best of my knowledge, there are no restrictions limiting access by direct mail. Obviously, companies need to know the ground rules established by the major players in the managed care field. Where restrictions make personal selling difficult or impossible, but where you do have a product on formulary, direct mail can plug the hole. Even Kaiser Permanente, which is one of the strictest organizations — banning faxes, personal visits, and a list of other selling efforts — has not squelched access by mail. And not only doctors who practice out of their private offices, but even those located in Kaiser-owned facilities get their mail. It isn’t like the situation in many hospitals where mail is put in pigeonholes, and multiple copies of bulk mailings and magazines are just dumped on a table in the mailroom.
<P>
There are two other aspects of the value of mail in the age of managed care. One is that HMOs themselves can and do make extensive use of mail in recruiting both physicians and patients. The other is that, if you want to get your product on a formulary, you can support your direct selling efforts with mail to the members of the formulary or therapeutics committees as well as staff members who are key decision-makers.
<P>
<H4>Disease management strategy</H4>
<P>
A lot of companies that can’t get through the doors to see managed care physicians with traditional selling are trying to use disease management strategies as a way to get those doors open. One popular way to do that is to create patient aid materials such as brochures, wall charts, and lists of “ do’s and don’t’s” that physicians find useful. But for sales reps to be able to deliver such service pieces, they first have to get in to see the doctor. That offers the product manager a choice — he or she can mail a sample and offer the piece in quantity on request (also to be mailed), or send a teaser piece offering delivery of the materials by a sales representative.
<P>
Obviously, that’s a great door opener, but even so, you might prefer to fulfill the request by mail. For one thing, with today’s more stretched-out sales cycles — often as long as five to eight weeks — the doctor will receive the materials faster. Also, the product manager can make sure the doctors who made the request actually get what they asked for. So mail offers not only provide the opportunity for follow-up contacts, but also add an element of greater control.
<P>
<H4>Fundamentals remain</H4>
<P>
But while the strategic importance of mail may be changing, the fundamentals remain. Above all, everyone has an attention span. You need to catch the interest of the physician as quickly and as easily as possible, remembering that curiosity is the main motivation for mail readership and action.
<P>
Think about a mail piece you have just received that asks you to turn, pull, push, press, rip, or listen. Furthermore, if the teaser copy-line posed a thought-provoking question or made a dramatic statement, would you be really hard-pressed not to get involved? Throw in a dimensional mailer (one with a lump in it), and I defy anyone not to open it.
<P>
No wonder that studies have shown a definite increase in new Rxs when the study group received direct mail and the control group did not. Nonetheless, I receive complaints from product management that physicians don’t open their mail, or don’t take the time to read their mail, or that the response rate is too low.
<P>
My answer is simple: <I>Your mail campaign didn’t work!</I> It is not the physician’s fault that he or she does not open, read, or respond to your mail. You yourself do not respond to uninteresting, mistargeted mail. Why would the physician?
<P>
<B>Rule #1: You must give the physician a reason to get involved with your mail piece.</B> The similarity between a 20-year-old layperson and a 50-year-old physician receiving mail is that both of them need their curiosity piqued by the mail that you have sent them.
<P>
Do not think that your MD audience does not look forward to opening interesting mail or get involved. A particular product manager learned this the hard way. He sent his audience a tube mailer, approximately four inches wide by six inches long, closed with plastic end-caps. Inside was a cover note and paper pop-up unit that could hold pencils. More than 25 physicians took the time to write to the company complaining about the worthless content of the tube.
<P>
<H4>Justify the content</H4>
<P>
That leads to <B>Rule #2: Not only must the mailer be attention-getting, the contents must be interesting and useful. </B>Don’t send out a mailer just on the premise that it will be opened; it is vitally important that the contents justify the time the physician spends on the mailer.
<P>
My next bit of advice is to reinforce the mail (and the message) you have sent with the telephone. Have a service call your audience between mailings to find out if they received your mailing and if they filled in and returned the business reply card (BRC). Costs are not prohibitive if you limit the caller to one to two minutes per call.
<P>
Direct mail and the telephone work well together, especially when you offer the healthcare professional the opportunity to earn continuing medical education or continuing education credits, and allow the responder to dial in his or her answers. The telephone won’t replace your promotional mail message, but it will reinforce and activate the MD to take the action your mail program was designed to encourage.
<P>
<H4>Forget the numbers</H4>
<P>
In dealing with direct mail, most product managers are obsessed with the percentage of responses to expect. This, they believe, is the primary measure of success.
<P>
<I>Wrong.</I>
<P>
If you are only interested in an exceptionally high response rate, include a check — or the offer of a check — once the BRC is returned.
<P>
But you’re really not maximizing the selling feature of the BRC. The part of the mailer the MD will spend the most time on is the reply card, so include a sales pitch for your product/program on it.
<DL><LI>Reinforce your message using bulleted points or alphanumerics to enable the physician to quickly and easily get your sales message again.
<LI>Don’t ask for one-half or one minute of their time, state that it will only take 30 or 55 seconds to fill in the reply card.
<LI>Encourage the physician to respond by simply circling the right answer.
<LI>Ask questions with closed-ended options. You are asking for the MD’s response, not opinion. Examples of closed-ended options are asking for the name of this product and its correct dosage.
<LI>As an incentive to the doctor to return the BRC, offer a medically relevant premium affixed or pictured. (It amazes and pleases me that I still find some premiums on product managers’ desks five years after we sent the mailing.)</DL>
<P>
<H4>For what it’s worth</H4>
<P>
<B>Rule # 3 is: Assign a specific market mission to every mail program you initiate. </B>In addition to sample requests, you may want to gain other types of BRC results such as answers to specific market research questions or requests for a rep visit.
<P>
Speaking of market research, here is a suggestion as to how you can do your own. The next time you receive a promotional mailer, before you open it, ask yourself:
<DL><LI>Does this mailer pique my curiosity?
<LI>Do I want to find out what is inside?
<LI>Am I interested enough to take the time to read the brochure and respond to the BRC?</DL>
<P>
If you answer yes to all of these, then that piece of direct mail is doing its job. Put it in your idea file! This technique also works in reverse. Before your next mail campaign (while you are still in pre-production), show your sample mailer to some of your colleagues. Ask:
</DL><LI>Does this mailer pique their curiosity?
<LI>Do they want to take the time to read the message?
<LI>Would they respond to the BRC?</DL>
<P>
If it takes more than five to ten seconds for your colleagues to tell you what the message (or problem) is, what the solution (or product) is, and what action they should take (returning the BRC or calling a toll-free number), there is a serious problem with this mail piece. Also use a physician panel to gauge their interest, just as you did with your colleagues. You’ll know by their responses if your mail will do the job it was designed to do.
<P>
If not, there are direct mail professionals in advertising agencies and mailing houses who can help you to make sure your next mail campaign is a success.

<title>Framework for Marketing Strategy</title>

<h1>Building a New Framework for<BR>Marketing Strategy</h1>

<H5><I>by Frederick Nelson</I></H5></center><BR>
<BR><hr size=4>
<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<P>
<I> A framework for crafting marketing strategy and developing tactical initiatives in the managed care era consists of four elements: product redefinition, understanding and capitalizing upon the real needs of managed care and its customers, leveraging existing or creating proprietary assets, and recognizing that managed healthcare needs are not monolithic.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
The pharmaceutical industry’s past growth and success has been due primarily to the development of a diverse range of effective marketing and sales tools directed at the traditional “fee-for-service” physician.
<P>
However, the continued emergence of all forms of managed care represents a fundamental shift in the structure of the delivery of medicine and the customer that the pharmaceutical industry has known (see <a href="frame1.html">Figure 1</a>). New decision makers, decision-making structures, dynamics, and even beliefs and motivations are increasingly coming into play. As a result, the industry is carefully reviewing, and increasingly moving forward with, solutions in a number of important areas. Disease management, for example, is an important, but not the only, approach being aggressively explored.
<P>
When acted upon in an integrated fashion, a framework of four important elements (see <a href="frame2.html">Figure 2</a>) can provide the grounds for a winning approach for the development and deployment of new marketing strategies and initiatives.
<P>
The first element, <B>product redefinition, </B>seeks to alter the concept of product definition itself. Historically, competitors have defined product as a pill with efficacy and/or safety attributes. This concept was typically directed against a particular type of patient (e.g., mild hypertensive). While quite pertinent for traditional markets, the historical definition of product is too narrow for the reality of the growing managed care/competition markets. <I>Products defined more expansively as engendering group outcome are far more meaningful to the philosophy, business perspectives, and needs of the managed care marketplace. Furthermore, they are of great interest to the customer’s customer.</I>
<P>
<a href="frame3.html">Figure 3</a> illustrates how a competitor might redefine its product toward a group outcome, envisioning a comprehensive hypertension system complete with a warranty. The new product would determine and stress activities (e.g., patient compliance with pharmacotherapy, diet and exercise) central to lowering cost and obtaining clinically more favorable healthcare outcomes.
<P>
The second element, <B>understanding and capitalizing upon the real needs of managed care and their customers, </B>suggests that only through the deep understanding of the needs of managed care customers and their customers  (e.g., employers, payers and soon purchasing cooperatives) can competitors in the pharmaceutical industry find platforms for partnership which change the unfavorable dynamics of the current business relationship. These issues include but are not limited to:
<P>
<UL><LI>Understanding and defining product offering
<LI>Use of information systems to elicit real gains in improving outcome and reducing cost
<LI>Communication of healthcare value to employers
<LI>Strategic capture of employer, employee and physician
<LI>Reduced subscriber turnover
<LI>Defining and achieving a valuable role within managed competition.</UL>
<P>
One example considers the ongoing need that Independent Physician Association (IPA) model health maintenance organizations (HMOs) have for reaching and communicating with physicians. They simply do not have the strength and quality of access the pharmaceutical industry enjoys with its field forces. This asset can be used in partnership-like fashion with the IPA HMO, utilizing the pharmaceutical field force for an array of communication and information needs (see <a href="frame4.html">Figure 4</a>).
<P>
The third element, leveraging existing or creating proprietary assets, highlights the necessity of developing a unique and proprietary marketing approach which underlies the formulation of sustainable competitive advantage. Assets might include:
<P>
<UL><LI>Product line offering breadth and areas of therapeutic depth
<LI>Unique or highly effective access to a group of decision makers
<LI>Marketing, communication, and sales skills
<LI>Financial resources
<LI>National presence.</UL>
<P>
While no strategy can offer sustainability forever, a degree of sustainability is required to protect marketing investment and market share position.
<P>
The last element, the <B>recognition that managed healthcare needs are not monolithic,</B> points to the need for flexibility in the design of managed healthcare marketing strategy. Not only do needs differ intra-market segments (e.g., HMOs verses mail order) but also inter-market segments (from HMO to HMO). Without customization flexibility, initiatives generated to fulfill intended marketing strategy will only be adopted at a limited number of accounts.
<P>
The most difficult hurdle in achieving real managed care marketing success lies within the area of implementation. The managed care marketing challenge requires innovative solutions, and innovative solutions — just because of their novelty — often are difficult to implement. Marketing companies aren’t necessarily familiar with the technicalities (right organizational structure, the right marketing and sales personnel, appropriate training and sales strategies) of delivering new approaches. Customers may also not be completely ready to buy, even if a need is being met. Old relationships and the baggage they carry, job descriptions, and systems within the companies’ own organizations can get in the way.
<P>
Specifically within the new area of pharmaceutical marketing to managed care organizations, three issues are central:
<P>
<UL><LI>Gaining credibility in the eyes of the managed care customers,
<LI>Determining a tangible initiative starting point, and
<LI>Engendering the organizational commitment and expertise to carry out the novel marketing initiative.</UL>
<P>
A “telescoped” marketing initiative goes a long way toward mitigating such implementation problems. With a telescoped marketing initiative, the end objective is delineated in its full richness, yet intermediate steps are also articulated.
<P>
A simple business telescope for a pharmaceutical company wishing to participate in disease management is illustrated in <a href="frame5.html">Figure 5</a>).
<P>
Intermediate segments act as an implementation bridge closer to current marketing platforms which provide stepping stones to gain experience and shift
the organization toward the end goal.
<P>
This approach is easier to accomplish rather than moving to the end point in a single jump. Second, intermediate segments of the telescope provide more tangible marketing activities which prove easier for other components of the organization to envision and support, while also providing the long-term vision offered by the end segment of the telescope.
<P>
The telescope construct is also quite useful in terms of selling to customers. The distant segment can often provide a significant departure from “value-added” programs which are sometimes viewed as offering little real value by the managed care customer.
<P>
Second, a fully delineated and genuine effort can go a long way in terms of gaining credibility with customers who may be suspicious of “smoke and mirror” marketing efforts. The intermediate step also makes it easier to implement the first step, which permits the pharmaceutical company and the managed care partner to develop a gradually expanding win/win relationship.

<P><I>Members of the Globals International Board convened in London to select the Global and Grand Global Awards from the highest-scoring finalists. From left: Philip 
Yorke-Edgell of MPP Marketing (U.K.); John Ellis of Omnicom Healthcare Worldwide (U.K.); Chairman
Lester Barnett of FCB Healthcare (U.S.); Phil Cox of Lane, Earl & Cox Advertising (U.K.); Martin Sherwood of Sherwoods Strategic Advertising (South Africa);
Rocky MacMahon of Lewis Grace Bozell Europa (U.K.); Clayton Love of Publitek Integrated Communication (U.K.); Paul Paech of Sudler & Hennessey Europe (Italy); and Volker Leisten of Bayer AG (Germany).</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
In only its second year, The Global Awards competition for the best in healthcare communications worldwide is now firmly established as a benchmark for creative and marketing excellence by advertising agencies, designers, television and radio commercial producers, and advertisers in the healthcare industry around the … well, globe. 
<P>
Organized by The New York Festivals, the 1995 Global Awards received 936 entries from 279 companies in 26 countries, representing a 30-percent increase over 1994 entry levels. Submissions ranged from print, TV and radio advertising to both the consumer and the professional, packaging design, brochures and exhibits, long-form film/video, educational programs, and public service announcements.
Of the entries received, 225 finalists went forward for consideration and, from these, the Board of Judges selected 28 Global Award winners and 3 Grand Globals.
<P><H4>And the winner is …</H4>
<P>

<IMG align=left SRC="globalg1.gif">The Grand Global for Best Communication to the Healthcare Professional was awarded to Paling Ellis KPR of London for “Flying Feet,” a single ad for Canesten, a range of topical products for athlete’s foot by Bayer.
<P>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><IMG align=right SRC="globalg2.gif">The Grand Global for Best Communication to the Consumer was awarded to a TV commercial from 303, called “Running Bear” for the Hospital Benefit Fund of Perth, Western Australia. The heartwarming consumer TV commercial features an animated teddy bear bringing flowers to a small boy in hospital.
<P>
<BR><IMG align=left SRC="globalg3.gif">The third Grand Global, for Social Commitment, was awarded to Ranscombe & Co. Advertising of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, for “Free Hookup,” a print campaign for Infact encouraging breast feeding.  
<P>
<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>Of the 28 Global Awards, entries from the United States won a total of 8, closely followed by Australia with 6, the United Kingdom with 4, Canada with 4, and Sweden with 2. Argentina, Austria, Germany, and South Africa earned one each.
<P>
Companies with 2 Globals were CWFS of Australia for “Aurorix Cartoons,” a multimedia campaign to the professional, and “Tazac Food,” a single anti-ulcer agent ad to the professional; Hourglass Pictures in England for “G.P.’s Guide to Adalat LA,” a product film/video to the healthcare professional, and “World of Difference,” a healthcare professional education film/ video; and Lawrence & Mayo in the U.S. with “ASF Campaign,” a direct mail entry in consumer education, and “State of The Child,” a brochure in consumer education.
<P>
<H4>TV a difficult choice</H4>
<P>
The most difficult choice for the judges was choosing from the more than 100 entries received in TV commercials to the consumer. In the end, two Globals (to Clemenger Sydney for “Smile,” a spot for Sterling Pharmaceuticals; and Lintas Argentina for “Car/Umbrella/Leash,” a campaign for Bayer Argentina) and a Grand Global were awarded; but there were 39 other high-scoring finalists who will each receive a Global Finalist Certificate for their excellent work.
<P>
No Grand Global was awarded this year in Craftsmanship, but special mention should go to the two Global winners in this category: Ivo von Renner and Werkstudio in Vienna.
<P>
As last year, the long-form film/video categories were strongly supported, with a total of 53 entries in both professional and consumer categories. Four Globals were awarded by the judges, two in the category for Professional Education (Hourglass Pictures, and Associated Producers in Canada for “A Child’s Grief,” a video for professionals and families on how to help children cope with the loss of a loved one); one in Social Commitment/Consumer Education (Healthlink Communications, Inc. in Canada for “This Is A Video About … Herpes!” an MTV-style program produced for Warner-Welcome); and the fourth to Hourglass Pictures in Promotion to the Healthcare Professional.
<P>
Two Globals were awarded in the category introduced this year for Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs: to OSU Medical Center in the U.S. for “OMEN-TV: Advances in Cosmetic Plastic Surgery”; and Healthways Communications, Inc., also in the U.S., for “Obsessive Compulsive Disorder” for Eli Lilly.
<P>
<H4>Worldwide judging</H4>
<P>
Working closely with members of The Globals International Board, The New York Festivals set up the preliminary judging sessions at different locations around the world: Martin Sherwood of Sherwoods Strategic Advertising hosted the judging in Johannesburg, South Africa; Bernd Schmittgall of Schmittgall Werbeagentur in Stuttgart, Germany; Hans Aarden of Synergia in Toronto, Canada; and Kal Dreisziger of Healthcare Marketing Resources in Montreal, Canada. 
<P>
In the United States, Marion E. Gold of Marion Gold & Company in Scottsdale, Ariz., and Martin Ross of Dugan/ Farley Communications of Upper Saddle River, N.J., hosted sessions, and additional sessions for multimedia and long-form film/ video were held at the offices of The New York Festivals in New York City.
<P>
When the preliminary judging was completed, a final session to decide the Globals and Grand Globals was held at the offices of Omnicom Healthcare Worldwide in London, England, attended by Board Members or their designated representatives.
<P>
Chaired by Lester A. Barnett, executive vice president and executive creative director of FCH Healthcare, the judges were John Ellis, creative director of Omnicom Healthcare in London; Martin Sherwood; Rocky MacMahon of Lewis Gace Bozell Europe in London; Volker Leisten, head of marketing services for Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany; Phil Cox, creative director of Lane, Earl & Cox, Uxbridge, England; Trevor Chapman, creative director of Medicus ADA, London, England; Francis Bries, managing director of Challenger Medical, Brussels, Belgium; Robert Blanchard, creative director of KPR, Brussels, Belgium; Paul Paech, creative director of Sudler & Hennessey Europe, Milan, Italy; Clayton Love, copywriter for Barry Segundo of Publitek, London, England; Dr. Peter Schuler for Bernd Schmittgall of Schmittgall Werbeagentur; and Philip Yorke-Edgell, MPP Marketing, St. Albans, England.
<P>
Overall, the judges in The 1995 Global Awards were pleased with the range of entries that were received from around the world in both promotions to the healthcare professional and to the consumer. The only real complaint was about the heat in the final judging session for board members in London, held during the hottest British summer since records began.
<P>
Founded in 1957, The New York Festivals organizes annual international awards competitions in television and radio programming, non-broadcast educational and informational film and video, television, radio, and print advertising, interactive multimedia, marketing effectiveness, and healthcare communications.

<H5><I>by Warren R. Ross</I></H5></center>
<BR><BR><BR><hr size=4>
<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<I>Predicting the future that managed care will have
on the industry is fraught with danger. Early experience
has spotlighted weaknesses in the concept, which have resulted
in a variety of corrective and evolutionary changes and
the appearance of countervailing trends. Those connected
with healthcare marketing should not take any current
view of the future for granted.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
SmithKline Beecham chief executive officer Jan Leschly predicts that by the year 2000 there will be only five or at most 10 global pharmaceutical and healthcare management companies. Another industry leader predicts that by that year — there <I>is </I>something irresistable about the millenium — our industry will be marketing to fewer than 2,000 customers.
<P>
Others in our industry may question the numbers, but everyone, it seems, agrees on the premise: that the inexorable march of managed care will sweep all before it, forcing continued consolidation and all but wiping out other segments of the market. Having by and large failed to anticipate the full impact of managed care, healthcare marketers are now betting the farm on mergers, downsizing, regionalization, acquiring pharmaceutical benefit managers (pbms), and other defensive tactics. 
<P>
Could they — make that “we” — once again be wrong? 
Let me make a confession. A few years back, in my previous existence as an agency principal, I was having lunch with an exceptionally prescient client who, out of the blue, asked me: “What are you doing to get ready for managed care?”
<P>
I’m afraid I looked blank. Managed care was a California aberration — Kaiser Permanente and all that. And, oh yes, hip in New York. What was there to get ready for? Back at the office, I asked our research librarian for a literature search. She turned up nothing more. I should have had her look up the key words “Roof — collapse.”
<P>
Don’t think for a minute that <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I> minimizes the impact managed care organizations have already had and will continue to have. Each month, as a regular feature, we have run “Managed Care Perspectives” that have brought our readers news and analysis of MCO trends. Following, for example, we report on integrated delivery systems and managed care sales strategies. In future issues we will bring you a review of the impact of managed care on salesforce compensation and on the marketing of generics   and we will continue to stay on top of these developments as long as managed care continues to change the environment in which we do our jobs. But straight-line projections can be treacherous so it might be well to examine some countervailing trends.
<P>
A classic case history was our report on the experience in Tennessee <I>(Medical Marketing & Media,</I> February 1995), whose TennCare system had been touted as a model for the nation. Having enrolled all Medicaid patients and all the uninsured, TennCare contracted with 12 Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), which in turn signed up with a PBM that, in its turn, established a closed formulary. In other words, the world of tomorrow. 
<P>
What happened, instead, was a doctors’ rebellion, led by the state’s black physicians, who denounced what they perceived as second-class care for their patients. Then a Yankelovich survey sponsored by Pfizer showed that they were not alone: the majority of all physicians had complaints about the system. Many of them had been forced to switch prescriptions, and two-thirds of those so coerced reported that their patients had encountered serious problems as a result. Far from becoming a model for the other states, TennCare was soon perceived as an example of what not to do. As McKinsey and Co. pointed out: “If employer power derives from their control over money, physicians are the one indispensable element in healthcare, and as they come under pressure — and learn to use their power — they become more and more successful in fighting back.”
<P>
No wonder the venture capital community is investing in consolidated physician group practices because of what it has found to be the “compelling” economics. As physicians get organized and integrate their services with those of hospitals, HMOs, according to McKinsey, are likely to lose their distinctive advantage. In the ensuing power strugggle, I’d place my bets on the M.D.s. After all, you can provide healthcare without pharmacy and financial managers, but it’s tough to do without doctors.
<P>
<H4>Translating the jargon</H4>
<P>
Perhaps the problem is that we’ve become entrapped in our own jargon. If you talk long enough about healthcare providers, you begin to lose sight of the fact that you’re referring to physicians. And if you live in a world of covered lives, you may begin to overlook that those figures on the spreadsheet represent patients...people to be precise. Voters, to be even more specific. Voters who may exert unexpected levers of power.
Consider these straws in the wind.
<UL><LI>Ross Perot, who has been known to have a pretty good feel for the public pulse, told a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee: “If someone were to ask me what is my principal concern about HMOs, it’s the concentration of power; it’s the giant salaries.” Managed care, he went on, tends “to turn the doctor into just an employee,” and “ the day we do that, we will have really damaged health care.”
<LI>Horror stories about “drive-through deliveries” — discharge of maternity patients after 24 hours — have triggered legislative challenges in five states and on Capitol Hill. Maryland and New Jersey have already enacted bills that mandate minimum stays of 48 hours, and Senators Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) have introduced similar federal legislation. 
<LI>Increasingly, newspaper stories and editorial cartoons reflect growing dissatisfaction with managed care’s emphasis on minimizing costs.</UL>
<P>
What’s the point?
<P>
Certainly not that managed care will go away or even that it will stop growing. But rather than taking for granted that it will soon monopolize all of healthcare, we might do well to consider the alternatives for, as I have tried to show, there are countervailing trends. They may not all come into play, but just one or two will do to slow down the HMO juggernaut and leave room for market segments with other orientations. Take, for example, the possibility that physician-controlled networks will play an important role in the industry’s future. If so, what will be the fate of companies that have decimated their doctor-oriented salesforce? Or to agencies that have replaced specialists in physician motivation with experts in pharmacy administration?
<P>
<I>MM&M’s </I>suggestion — whether you work for a manufacturer, an agency, or a publisher, or if in any other way your future is hitched to the future of healthcare marketing — is simply this: hedge your bets. Follow developments carefully by reading our ongoing series on managed care perspectives. Keep tabs on what Ross Perot and other shrewd observers are saying. In other words, don’t put all your eggs in the managed care basket. Such caution will greatly reduce your risk of becoming a managed care basket case.

<H2>Healthcare providers are forming their own organizations to strengthen negotiating clout in dealing with MCOs.</H2>

<H5><I>by Suzanne Houck</I></H5></center>
<BR><hr size=4>
<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<I>Integrated healthcare — or delivery — networks are a union of various healthcare providers, often formed to improve negotiating strength. An understanding of their structure is necessary to develop market strategies, since their various phases demand different tactics — from focusing on technology to emphasizing price.</I>
<P><hr size=4>
<P>
It’s not clear whether it’s a case of “if you can’t lick ’em, join ’em,” or of “if you can’t join ’em, lick ’em.” In any case, the providers of healthcare — primarily doctors and hospitals — are fighting back against the growing power of the purchasers of healthcare — the health maintenance and other managed care organizations.
Their weapon of choice: Integrated Healthcare Networks (IHNs), also called Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs). Formed to strengthen their members’ clout in negotiating managed care contracts, such networks are seeing dramatic growth in ever more and broader geographic areas, and sometimes embrace even health plans.
<P>
The rapidly growing buying clout of IHNs is having a major influence on healthcare marketers. For many companies, continued success, even survival will hinge on innovative sales and marketing strategies, as well as product repositioning to meet the needs of these networks. A business as usual, traditional marketing strategy with IHNs is a recipe for disaster. 
<P>
To market successfully to integrated networks, it is first necessary to understand what defines them, why they are spreading so rapidly, how they are structured, and their strengths and needs.
IHNs consist of hospitals, physicians, other outpatient providers, and sometimes health insurance plans, that unite to provide healthcare for a broader geographic area. They’re often formed to strengthen members’ clout in negotiating managed care contracts. 
<P>
The majority of IHNs are vertically integrated to include different functional areas — i.e. physicians, hospitals, other outpatient services and sometimes an insurance plan. Kaiser Permanente Health Plan and Group Health of Puget Sound are two of the earliest vertically integrated IHNs.
Other IHNs are horizontally integrated, providing just physician or hospital care over a geographic area (see <a href="FB_Fig1.html">Figure 1</a>).
<P>
<H4>The driving forces</H4>
<P>
The formation of IHNs is being driven by two key factors. First is the rising power of cost-conscious purchasers of care, including managed care organizations and employers. These purchasers increasingly want to buy comprehensive care from as few provider entities as possible at competitive prices. Providers are pressured to form or join IHNs to get the clout they need to contract with purchasers of care. Vertically integrated IHNs can enter full risk contracting agreements in which they offer so-called “cradle to grave” care for capitated or fixed rates. 
<P>
The second major driving force is an overbuilt, fragmented healthcare system. We have 3.8 hospital beds for every 1,000 people in the U.S. Many managed care organizations use 1 to 1.5 hospital beds per 1,000 members. A national average of 4.5 physicians for every 1,000 Americans also contrasts with managed care utilization of 1.2 to 1.5 physicians per 1,000 enrollees. Hospital occupancy is at 47 percent of capacity. How long could the average U.S. company survive at that level of capacity? 
<P>
<H4>One-stop shopping</H4>
<P>
Vertically integrated IHNs that include health insurance plans can offer one-stop shopping to purchasers of healthcare. Moreover, combining provider and insurance functions into one organization improves an IHNs ability to compete against other providers for contracts with employers and managed care organizations (MCOs). In today’s overbuilt system, hospitals not opting to join networks and remaining as free-standing entities could lose big, becoming, at best, outside vendors of services to IDNs or, worse, ultimately locked out of a market that doesn’t need their services. As a result, providers are scrambling to form IDNs which they hope will increase efficiency, improve economic security, and simplify the process of marketing care.
<P>
Nationwide, SMG Marketing Group reports there are 429 IHNs. Approximately 25 percent of all hospitals currently have a network relationship; 51 percent of IHNs are vertically integrated, 41.2 percent are horizontally integrated. Although most IHNs have been formed by hospitals (72.7 percent), some have been formed either by physician (3.9) or by managed care organizations (3.7 percent). The largest percentage of IHNs, 40 percent, are in metropolitan areas of 1,000,000 to 2,999,999 people, while 6.3 percent are in non-metropolitan areas.
<P>
A May, 1994, <I>Hospitals and Health Networks </I>article reports that managed care market penetration of 20 to 25 percent is necessary to cause significant changes in the delivery systems of a given market. When managed care reaches these levels, you can expect to see rapid growth of IHNs.
<P>
<H4>Sample structures</H4>
<P>
The structure of IHNs varies from loose affiliations to a total merger of provider member assets. For hospitals, long used to functioning as independent entities, and for physicians, whose legendary independence occasionally has earned them the label “herds of cats,” the loss of autonomy and control that an asset merged IHN brings can be very threatening. Loosely affiliated IHNs however, may find it almost impossible to make the tough decisions required to achieve the needed economies of scale for cost-effective care. For example, how likely is Hospital A in a loosely affiliated IHN to terminate its small cardiac surgery program because Hospital B in the network provides the same services more efficiently and at far less cost? Not likely.
<P>
However, a merger of assets, such as the Allina system in Minneapolis, provides a much better structure for effective management and coordination throughout the IHN. Allina was formed by the merger of Medica and HealthSpan, two giants in the Minneapolis-St. Paul market. Medica was a large hmo with more than 580,000 members and 5,000 participating physicians. HealthSpan was a hospital system with 17 acute and long-term care facilities, 3,200 physicians, and a managed care organization with almost 300,000 members. 
<P>
Allina’s large asset merger of hospitals, physicians, and managed care organizations creates a provider/insurance powerhouse. Its management will be located at one site, not geographically dispersed among member institutions. Merged asset IHNs such as Allina, with centralized decision-making and control, can be much more flexible in quickly adapting and seizing opportunities in today’s changing market.
<P>
<H4>Purchasers pleased</H4>
<P>
Twin Cities employers that purchase healthcare seem pleased with the new system. Steve Wetzel, executive director of the Business Healthcare Action Group (BHCAG), a local business healthcare coalition whose members include 22 Minneapolis companies that buy healthcare for over 250,000 lives, told the press that “This merger is very consistent with the type of vertical integration we want to see as buyers.” (<I>Health System Leader, </I>June, 1994.) Obviously, you need to be big yourself to negotiate with such a giant.
<P>
A common refrain of physicians to hospital administrators as they join IHNs is, “I can’t make it on my own in these times of managed care.” In selling or merging their practices into IHNs, many physicians are willing to trade autonomy for greater economic security. IHNs also bring physician participants access to capital typically not available to small group practices and certainly not to solo practitioners. 
<P>
Effective integration of primary care physician practices is key to an IHN’s success. Primary care providers bring the geographic coverage needed to reach patients entering the system. They also refer patients to member hospitals. A higher proportion of primary care physicians (family practice, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics) to specialists also is important. An IHN top-heavy with specialists packs little clout with managed care organizations that often look to primary care doctors to serve as gatekeepers to control costs.
<P>
<H4>Risk and information</H4>
<P>
Because many networks include insurance plans or enter into risk contracts with managed care organizations, IHNs often assume more financial risk than non-IHN providers. Examples of IHNs that assume financial risk with capitation contracts include Sharp HealthCare in San Diego, Sutter Health in Northern California, bjc Health System in St. Louis, and The Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. Such IHNs have a compelling need to collect information regarding the cost, volume, and quality of care provided at their geographically dispersed facilities. If they base their contracts on incorrect assumptions, they jeopardize their survival. Many IHNs are therefore making major commitments to information systems to help manage risk, and enterprising marketers can use this need as the basis for mutually beneficial partnerships.
<P>
<H4>IHN market phases</H4>
<P>
As provider organizations progress through healthcare reform, they go through three phases (see <a href="FB_Fig2.html">Figure 2</a>). In the <B>Traditional Phase, </B>solo or small group practices and free-standing hospital profit centers prevail. Providers in this phase have little need for IHNs. Reimbursement is largely fee-for-service, with little revenue from managed care. Independent providers survive in geographic areas lacking large employers who are more likely to push for managed care. The number of states in the traditional phase is dwindling. Idaho, the Dakotas, and Wyoming are examples of the survivors.
<P>
As managed care becomes established in a market, it provides a strong stimulus for the formation of IHNs. Providers realize the need to more efficiently offer a broad array of healthcare services so as to be able to compete for managed care contracts in their geographic area. During this second or <B>Transitional Phase, </B>IDNs are often structured as loose affiliations, only gradually progressing to completely merged assets. The Transitional Phase is chaotic and unpleasant for providers and vendors alike. The mixture of managed care and fee-for-service revenues for IHNs in this phase produces mixed incentives regarding patient volume, length of stay and use of ancillary services. Many large cities with mushrooming managed care provider revenues are currently in this uncomfortable middle phase that looks like chaos to both the participants and to marketers trying to sell them.
<P>
During the <B>Financial Phase, </B>providers are more likely to form vertically integrated IHNs involving a complete merger of assets. During this phase, providers receive a high percentage of revenues from managed care and capitation. San Diego and Minneapolis are examples of markets in the Financial Phase. In this phase, providers see the writing on the wall regarding the dominance of managed care and are more willing to give up control for the protection of participating in asset merged IHNs.
<P>
<H4>Selling to IHNs</H4>
<P>
As IHNs evolve through these three phases, the healthcare marketer’s strategies must keep pace. Just promoting features and benefits won’t work in a consolidating system where efficiency is king. Successful sales and marketing must vary with each phase of IHN development (see <a href="FB_Fig3.html">Figure 3</a>). 
<P>
In the <B>Traditional Phase, </B>there are few IHNs and little managed care. Personal relationships with clinicians are vital. Successful selling also often means focusing on a product’s technological superiority. Price is much less important because providers can still pass most costs on to insurers or patients. The selling during this phase is unstable for many complex reasons. Major reasons include power shifting away from providers to purchasers, conflicting financial incentives between managed care and fee-for-service, and consolidation in the industry that creates uncertainty and instability.
<P>
During the <B>Transition Phase, </B>providers may fixate on lowest price at the expense of technology or even total cost. Stories abound about sales lost at the last minute because a competitor came in with a lower price. Selling during this phase is much more unstable, largely because turnover is high in provider organizations. For this reason, it’s imperative for marketers to develop more than one internal champion within a provider organization. Today’s internal champion may be tomorrow’s ex-employee. Top management, on both the buying and selling side, gets more involved, while the role of the individual sales rep or physician diminishes in importance. Sell cycles get longer and more complex, while the drive to be cost-effective increases outpatient visits and reduces the average length of hospital stays.
<P>
Many IHNs formed during the Transition Phase start as non-asset affiliations, but as time passes a growing number merge their assets. Many providers are currently in such a transition phase.
As this shift takes place, healthcare marketers must expand their sales efforts to more than one provider level. As sales become more complex and involve more departments, they must sell to each potential influencer in the sale, often positioning the benefits of the product or service one way for clinicians and quite a different way for middle managers and administrators. For instance, the message that “this drug has fewer side effects” may need to be recast as “improved clinical outcomes for this drug mean fewer hospital readmissions” in addressing the management and financial types.
<P>
In the <B>Financial Phase </B>of IHN development, consolidation results in fewer larger providers buying from fewer vendors. At this point, IHN structures are more likely to involve full asset mergers, bringing with them centralized decision-making. Providers making buying decisions are likely to be more sophisticated, evolving from a fixation on price to a focus on clinical outcomes and total cost. Marketers can now build a longer term big picture strategy for a given market in place of cut-throat “today’s lowest price” selling. 
<P>
<H4>Risk phase</H4>
<P>
During the financial phase, vendors run a greater risk of their products being viewed as commodities. Adding to the risk, marketers must often sell to one centralized department for an entire regional provider system. With the growth of capitation during the Financial Phase, providers increasingly view their services as cost centers instead of profit centers.
<P>
Capitation brings providers a flat rate of payment per month for each patient enrolled, so physicians and hospitals make more money if patients don’t come in for care. This makes prevention and wellness profitable for providers, and they’re now incentivized to move from a dependent to an independent patient model of care. Obviously, this leads to a profound shift in how to motivate them to prescribe your product. Services that help physicians in such a setting provide preventive care and reduce utilization have to replace the old pizza, pads, and pills approach to selling. An example is effective patient education programs which reduce office visits and the need for hospitalization, while improving outcomes and patient satisfaction.
<P>
Not all IHNs will survive. Some are transitional structures for their members. Some change names, melt into other entities and disappear before contracts are even signed. Hardly a week goes by that a slew of new IHN names doesn’t pop up across the country. How does a marketer know where to commit promotional and sales resources in this market? Key to qualifying an IHN is asking the right questions.

<P>
<H4>Getting answers</H4>
<P>
Marketers selling to integrated networks can get answers to these questions in a variety of ways. Simply asking internal champions in provider organizations, written questionnaires, indirect probing, reading trade publications, even local newspapers can yield valuable information. Effective internal company structures for sharing up-to-the-minute market information among departments by the use of laptop computers and E-Mail are vital to staying competitive.
<P>
Using historical marketing strategies with sophisticated IHNs is a recipe for disaster. Fewer vendors will be selling to fewer customers. To survive and succeed, healthcare companies must quickly reposition themselves around the changing needs of these customers. Just being the quality leader is not longer enough. This means repositioning both products and services to help customers reduce their costs and manage risk. That way, both buyers and sellers can increase market share and productivity. The future belongs to the fast and the brave.

<H2>Take heart, Rx marketers!<BR>
You are present at the birth
of a new marketing model</H2>

<H5><I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></H5></center>
<BR><hr size=4>
<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<I>New marketing approaches — both product- and company-related — are being introduced as the industry adjusts to a changed environment. Concentrated buying has led to the emergence of the elite salesperson and regional units with local knowledge and rapid response time. This has created problems of decentralization, compensation, and responsibility. MCOs look at drug company programs with resistance and skepticism, despite their becoming an accepted part of the sales mix.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
Marketing techniques used by the pharmaceutical industry — culminating in the plethora of sales and communication tactics employed in the early 1990’s — evolved over time, beginning with the promotional boom in the industry after World War II. Such standards as single-sponsored publications, educational symposia, telemarketing, disease-oriented journals for high Rxers, and direct-to-consumer advertising arrived on the scene as innovations in this 40-year span. As we enter the managed care era, new approaches are being introduced as the industry adapts to a changed marketing environment. To observe this trend, I’ve talked with managed care organizations (MCOs), consultants, market researchers, and the creators of programs for the MCO market, and can report on some of the approaches being used.
<P>
In contrast to the past, these sources described the MCO market as “loose,” “tactical,” “fluid,” and from Andy Ferrara of the consulting group Boston Healthcare, “heady.” I like the term “balkanized” because it describes a fractured landscape with geographic overtones, and it also conveys another idea — an area divided by zones where power is concentrated in a few hands. There are only 540 managed care entities in the U.S. which yields roughly 1,500 decision-makers on formulary and Rx buying decisions. For comparison, consider that hospital sales efforts by pharmaceutical companies, pre-managed care, dealt with 5,000 institutions. Complexity and concentration — what’s a poor product manager to do?
<P>
If generalizing for planning purposes about a complex situation was not difficult enough, another element must be noted and, unfortunately, it may be one of the few common denominators Rx marketers have to work with. Again, the “balkanized” image applies with that region’s historical fight for survival and its combative attitudes. The average director of pharmacy at an MCO is a much, much tougher “sell” than the prescribing M.D. Since the financial stakes have gone up with the size of the transaction, the sales encounter has changed from the informational “detail” to a contract negotiation. The MCO purchaser is primarily price-oriented. If the MCO is non-profit, the stance, as one agency executive put it, can be “poor me” — a carry-over from hospitals where so many institutions are in the red. If the MCO is for-profit, the buyer is out for the best buy he can get for the company — a far cry from the therapeutic view of M.D.s. My sources called MCO purchasers “hard-nosed” and “astute” and I found them skeptical of pharmaceutical company motives in offering extra services in a negotiation.
<P>
When I asked the six MCO executives I spoke with about the value of Rx company programs, they were largely disparaging. More than one suggested dropping the programs and lowering prices. This same mantra, of course, is played back from most people when asked how promotion affects them. Verbatims in advertising research with physicians always turn up this response and still, we know, promotion sells. The difference with the MCO purchasing executives, is that their resistance to promotion is seated in economic bedrock. Their jobs at MCOs and the standards by which they are judged are how much they can extract from the pharmaceutical company in the contractual process.
<P>
One last note on the MCO market. For most of the Rx industry, it’s a new market. Some companies — Glaxo and Marion Merrell Dow, in particular — began exploring this market in the late 1980’s. This investment is now paying off in the contacts they have established. As an MCO buyer in Houston said, “Look, it’s not about selling. It’s about relationships!” When I asked MCOs what was different in the sales pitches they were getting from Rx firms, I heard that the big change was that today all pharmaceutical companies were catering to MCOs — even the “big guys,” Merck, Lilly, BMS, and Pfizer — when prior to a few years ago, these Rx buyers were not high priority for most of the industry.
<P>
To summarize: The MCO field, for most pharmaceutical marketers, is an unfamiliar, complex, value-driven market in the hands of a relatively small group of savvy, “show-me” negotiators.
In the face of these formidable challenges, what are Rx marketers doing to sell MCOs? The programs I found can be seen as <B>product-related </B>or <B>company-related. </B>Not surprisingly, the most energy is in the product-related area.
<H4>Product-related programs</H4>
Marketers are offering MCOs a broad range of services and sales inducements linked to their products. Here, in brief, are the kinds of activities I turned up:
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Economic modeling</B> based on the published literature on the product and its competition to demonstrate the product’s cost-saving advantages to the MCO — quality of life, side effects, relapse rates, recovery time, etc. — combinations of studies to make a case for putting the brand on formulary.
<LI><B>Software packages</B> to assist the MCO in using the product and understanding its economics and its effect on the disease — utilization review, over- and under-Rxing, tracking lab tests, etc.
<LI><B>Clinical research</B> on the product in cooperation with the MCO — either new studies or retrospective analysis of the MCO medical records to answer therapeutic or patient management questions.
<LI><B>Screening programs</B> looking for high risk enrollees either at the work site of a payor/ employer, or within the MCO covered lives  diabetes, hypertension, asthma, depression, etc. The Rx company pays for the diagnostic testing and the informational campaign accompanying the project.
<LI><B>Pull-through</B> for products on formulary — probably the most common pharmaceutical company program to MCOs. As its name implies, it is aimed at a high utilization rate for the product by MCO prescribers to benefit the MCO, since it has contracted a favorable price on the brand, and to maximize sales for the company.</UL>
<P>
Pull-though campaigns employ conventional Rx promotional tactics to M.D.s, R.N.s, and R.Ph.s — letters, articles in MCO publications, product literature, reminder devices, therapeutic guidelines, and sales aids used by the company’s representatives. However, what is most important, these materials and the sales presentations are markedly different in style and emphasis from the usual promotional package. In the calls on physicians, information — not selling — is stressed. The product is subordinated to the MCO therapeutic pathway on the condition. The prominent logo (if there is one) is the MCO’s not the product’s. The central message is “appropriate use.” In fact, John Eichert of Hastings Health Group, a marketing and consulting company, told me some MCOs define “pull-through” as “appropriate use” — the cost-effective Rxing of the drug only for the indications okayed by the MCO. Part of the message often is the usage goal the MCO has set for the product.
<P>
Bruce Leeb, whose agency has done a number of these pull-through packages, says that the bigger the MCO — in effect, the size of the sale — the more control the MCO has over the content of the pull-through program. In general, though, the company and its product take a low profile, while the MCO educational and treatment objectives are center-stage.
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Disease management</B> (DM) can be seen as falling into the product-related category but, because of its ambitious scope, and because some dm programs are posed as cooperative projects in which company and MCO share in the savings from more efficient treatment methods, they deserve special attention. A further indication of their importance is that, for some companies, DM represents an entirely new departure in company outlook — moving from selling products to selling healthcare systems.</UL>
<P>
It is beyond the intent of this article to catalog the prototypical dm and its variants. Suffice to say that dm is viewed by many Rx marketers as a “must” activity in sales efforts to MCOs. An MCO executive in New York says he has been “bombarded” by dm offers, and John Eichert says that dm “is being thrown at everybody.” Market Measures Inc. (MMI), after surveying managed care in the first quarter of 1995, reported that 20 companies were presenting dm programs to MCOs in what it described as a growing and “crowded” field. In this burst of competitive activity, quality is often questionable. As Eichert puts it, “To use disease management as an access device to sell products to MCOs, rather than pursue genuine disease management programs, is to do a disservice to the idea.” The leaders in the field in early 1995, according to Richard Zucker of mmi, were Lilly’s Integrated Disease Management, Zeneca’s Stuart Disease Management, and Schering, “although others may be waiting in the wings to emerge.”
<P>
On the company-related side are a number of offerings which aim at ingratiating Rx firms to managed care organizations. These can be in the form of grants or services companies perform for MCOs to help them with the business or medical aspects of managed care.
<P>
Here are four activities which illustrate this direction:
<UL><LI><B>Systems analysis</B> of any sector of the MCO’s operation drawing upon the company’s business expertise, as well as consultants it can provide.
<LI><B>Helping the MCO in marketing programs</B> to gain enrollees or to build a corporate presence in the community — probably only with smaller MCOs, since the larger MCOs have been conducting campaigns for a number of years and have gained in-house experience in such promotions.
<LI><B>Assisting in gaining or holding contracts</B> from third-party payers. This activity could be product-related as well — for example, a joint effort with an MCO on a work site screening for hypertension as the centerpiece of an overall presentation of MCO services.
<LI><B>Aiding the non-profit MCO</B> in fundraising by providing campaign materials to solicit public and corporate donations.</UL>
<P>
Given the diversity of the MCO market, items from the listings above (or bundles of same) cannot be presented “off the shelf,” but must be adapted to the MCO’s needs. In fact, with MCOs being so aggressively courted by Rx firms, it is crucial, competitively, not to present a standard package, but to understand what is a pressing concern at an MCO and then offer a service to meet that need. This is easy to appreciate as a sales philosophy, but hard to execute. Knowing an MCO takes time and, remember, many companies are new to the field. Here is where “relationships” come into play. 
<P>
A number of consultants emphasized understanding the MCOs “competency” and structuring programs to fit. Mark Stinson of Potentia, an Omnicom unit, suggests that learning the MCO’s priorities is so important that it is worthwhile to get to this subject at the very first meeting by asking directly, “What do you need?”
<P>
<H4>“Mass customization”</H4>
<P>
Creating dozens of tailored packages for the field is a home office nightmare, and to deal with this workload, a basic foundation program is created — particularly with pull-through services in which a core campaign, similar to international promotions, becomes the model. What then occurs in approaching and servicing MCOs was described by one consultant as “mass customization” — an oxymoronic concept requiring creative ingenuity and remarkable turnaround time. This is no small task according to Ted Mauer of HLS, “You’ve got different audiences — physicians and medical staff, MCO administrators and business people and your own field reps — all requiring a nuanced message and you have to meld it together into a consistent package.”
<P>
A new factor in selling MCOs is the emergence of elite MCO sales representatives. As buying has become concentrated, logically, selling has matched its structure. The elite salesperson is a significant development for the Rx industry which, in the past, has had responsibility for sales spread over thousands of representatives (and often had difficulty in measuring their sales effectiveness) and which now will have millions of dollars in orders in the hands of a small group of MCO negotiators. Heightening the power of this new class of MCO specialist, will be the need of creating special programs to sell MCOs — programs based on knowledge of how a specific MCOs works and what it is looking for. To gain this understanding and sales success requires a local presence dedicated to a particular MCO (the way hospital reps function) and authority for the MCO-assigned sales person to control the company’s proposals. Companies are now organizing into regional units in recognition of this need for local knowledge and more rapid response time. One MCO buyer says she values company sales people who can “think outside the box.” 
<P>
There appears to be a shortage of people capable of taking on this kind of responsibility with the exception of staffs at companies which have been marketing to managed care for some time. The MCO executives questioned whether many of the salespersons calling on them were up to the job. Certainly, it isn’t an easy one if you and your company are new to the field. MCO selling can be a cruel business, very different from physician selling where friendly relationships and M.D. propensity to use a number of products in a disease category allowed brands to exist on fractional shares of a market. Under MCO formularies and preferred product listings, this kind of latitude is disappearing. There will be big winners in MCO marketing and, accordingly, more losers.
<P>
In this exacting environment, how is the decentralization of sales proceeding? There is understandable tension between product managers attempting the difficult job of branding a product and producing consistent marketing tools and the local salesperson needing tactical improvisation to make the sale. Then there is the question of compensation. With physician selling, sales executives succeed through organizational skills in mobilizing thousands of reps behind a product and its message. With the MCO market regionalized and sales dependent on local managers who can deliver within their geography, who is in control of the sales and deserving of appropriate reward? The old model will continue to operate for the private practice market, but a new system will evolve for managed care. Again, the balkanized parallel surfaces with local fiefdoms holding central authority at bay — even extracting ransom for the prize they hold hostage or threatening to switch alliances.
<P>
I spoke to six MCO executives — obviously not a representative sample, but a usable impression base. They were from major MCOs which may have prejudiced them against the acceptance of programs from Rx companies, since they may feel they are big enough to do things for themselves. All but one was not in a buying mood. That one saw merit in the professed goal of some companies to become “part of the provider system.” Wasn’t this so much sales talk, I asked. “Well, the ‘word’ proceeds the deed,” she said philosophically. “If they’re talking it, they’ll do it.” Here, at least, was a potential customer.
<P>
The other five were skeptical of the value of pharmaceutical programs for MCOs and heavily suspicious of commercial bias. One director of pharmacy at a giant hmo found the idea of company-sponsored disease management “insulting.” How could a drug manufacturer have the effrontery to think it could tell his organization how to manage a disease?
<P>
Another MCO executive challenged the premise of product-connected dm. Different patients needed different drugs, he explained. How could a company build a valid dm system on a limited product line? He felt pharmacy benefit management companies, with their broad formularies, were in a better position on disease management. As for splitting any savings realized by more efficient dm systems, a number of my contacts saw no logic in this arrangement. “After all,” one said, “we’re the ones assuming the risk. They are our patients.” Problems with payment and measurement also cropped up. Overall, these MCO executives were willing to listen to disease management pitches (apparently, they can’t avoid them), but they were not buying.
<P>
Richard Zucker of MMI pointed out a source of resistance to company-sponsored DM. Since MCOs are coming under review by the National Committee for Quality Assurance, he suggests that they may not want to appear beholden to Rx companies for aspects of their services. Additionally, he noted that in a competitive contest for an employer’s contract, an MCO that has developed its own disease management program, internally, appears more attractive than one dependent on a pharmaceutical company. “Independent competency looks better,” he says.
<P>
I asked the MCO executives about the outcome studies they were being shown by pharmaceutical companies in support of products. Their basic skepticism was again in evidence, but their comments reflected an appreciation that such studies were difficult to construct and that outcomes — particularly pharmacoeconomic — was a new discipline. They also noted the lack of standards in the field, and conceded that, with so many parameters for judging results, it is virtually impossible to produce a universally compelling study. The critic can always come up with another question, shifting focus from clinical improvement to economics (work days saved, drug costs, hospital stays, etc.) to quality-of-life and, finally, to the ultimate rejoinder, “Well, we do things differently here.”
<P>
Overall, as was noted earlier, this group was not conceding that Rx companies were selling them anything through the programs offered along with products. However, responses to questions on prices revealed that their anti-industry machismo was not as solid as they would like it to appear. I was told that competition has shifted from price to value-added services. They explained that companies were holding the line on prices claiming that reductions would upset their price structure vis-ˆ-vis Medicaid, triggering higher rebates to governmental payers. With this explanation on the table, companies are resisting price pressure. One executive revealed that an H2 manufacturer had abandoned a million-dollar contract with his MCO because it would not lower its price.
<P>
This does not mean that price is not a factor. It is simply not as crucial as it was a few years back. Price concessions are being made, but to MCOs that have demonstrated real control over product share.
<P>
<H4>A competition of ideas</H4>
<P>
With the prices de-emphasized, competition has moved to the extras. I heard that MCOs calculate the dollar value of the programs being offered in evaluating competitive bids. But it’s obvious an MCO is not going to accept a bid with an accompanying service package, regardless of dollar value, if the package isn’t needed. With prices level on parity products (ACEs, CCBs, H2s, antiarthritics, etc.), we are in an idea competition for the business.
<P>
The consultants and agencies I talked with agreed that competition has become “heady” with companies looking for new insights into MCO operations, psychology, and goals. For example, competition among disease management programs can take the form of enlisting an outstanding medical authority as a partner in a dm system — a leading clinic or “name” clinician. Star appeal can give one program an edge in the marketplace. Or, as Jon Doniger of Medicus points out, understanding an MCOs mindset can be a tie-breaker. He illustrates this by noting that an MCO can be medically positive on patient compliance programs, but financial negative on the idea of increased drug use. A company approaching such an MCO had better prepare a financial, as well as a medical rationale, for its compliance proposal. In another insightful area, John Eichert predicts that programs for MCOs are turning to how the MCO can achieve greater “patient self-management” — the ultimate in enrollee/MCO interaction leading to behavioral changes that decrease treatment costs. And, on the financial side, Harry Sweeney of Dorland Sweeney Jones says his agency has been developing programs to help MCOs obtain payment, previously denied, from third-party payers on procedures involving client products.
<P>
<H4>MCOs in command</H4>
<P>
Today, MCOs are clearly in command in their dealings with Rx companies, and they are cherry-picking the programs being offered. With the addition of more covered lives to MCO plans, and the continued consolidation going on in the field, their strength will increase. A rollback of their power could occur from an outpouring of patent-protected, breakthrough products from pharmaceutical research. Even now, “wedge products,” as one MCO executive called them — single-source drugs needed by MCOs — can serve as beachhead brands from which companies can sell without inducement programs. But, it is questionable whether the research pipeline will yield such breakthroughs in the near future.
<P>
Accordingly, program-selling to MCOs will undoubtedly be the order of the day. What the new model will consist of is uncertain because an escalation of ideas is still in progress as companies, consultants, and agencies learn more about MCOs and how to sell to them. However, if we can be guided by the past, we might conclude that, unsuspected by all of us, the groundwork has already been laid in these first years of the MCO era.
<P>
<H4>Lesson from the past</H4>
<P>
In the pharmaceutical industry renaissance of the mid-1950’s, the basic promotional patterns developed in sync with the industry’s expansion. The building blocks — sales calls, scientific literature, and sampling against a background of reminder media (journals and direct mail) fell quickly into place. New technology added color to the mixture, but the fundamentals were there from the beginning.
<P>
To draw a lesson from that time, we can conclude that what we see now in MCO marketing is what we will see more of in the future. For all the deficiencies of the present cadre of MCO sales representatives, the objections to disease management, criticisms of outcomes research, and resistance to product-related programs, these elements are likely to provide the structure for managed care marketing in the future.

<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<I>Although consumers are becoming more active participants in their healthcare decisions, making them receptive to direct-to-consumer advertising, and advertising does benefit certain product groups, customers are growing increasingly cynical and skeptical. To meet this challenge, more targeted advertising is called for, coupled with direct-to-patient promotion.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
<P>
The increase in direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising has been no less than revolutionary. In 1988, $25 million was spent on DTC ads. By last year, the figure had increased tenfold to $225-250 million. DTC expenditures increased by 65 percent in 1994 alone. 
<P>
As the consumer end of the seesaw goes up, the physician end is going down. Advertising in medical/surgical journals has declined steadily since 1992 (see “1994 Journal Ad Spending Review,” <I>Medical Marketing & Media, </I>March 1995), and in 1994 actually fell below 1991 levels. The dollar amount for advertising in medical/surgical journals was $323 million in 1994, about $100 million more than spent on DTC ads.
<P>
In the old marketing model, pharmaceutical companies created patient demand by influencing doctors to write prescriptions. In DTC promotion, companies listen to the patient, respond to their needs, and hope to increase sales by driving consumers to a doctor’s office and requesting their product. 
<P>
Most pharmaceutical companies now promote to the consumer. Major long-term players active in DTC advertising include Pfizer, Marion Merrell Dow, Upjohn, Merck, Ciba, and Glaxo-Welcome. Newcomers are Schering, Abbott, and Miles. Absentees so far include Roche, Lilly, Boehringer-Ingelheim, Zeneca, and Amgen. 
<P>
<H4>Promoting user loyalty</H4>
<P>
The goal of DTC promotion is to build awareness and market share, which includes enhancing compliance by fostering user loyalty. It is a technique which seems to work. Joy Scott, chief executive officer of Scott-Levin Associates, a pharmaceutical market research and consulting firm in Newtown, Pa., says, “Our 1995 survey of DTC ads show that they are having the impact sponsors hoped for. Patients are asking doctors about advertised drugs more often, and they are more likely to get the product they ask for.” 
<P>
In Scott-Levin’s survey, at least 10 percent of 3,000 consumers recognized 13 of the 17 drugs most heavily advertised to consumers. Similarly, consumer awareness of specific DTC campaigns has increased significantly, with 75 percent considering these campaigns to be beneficial.
<P>
Today, studies such as Scott-Levin’s show consumers are becoming more active as participants in their healthcare decisions, making them eager to learn more about drug side effects and interactions, disease signs and symptoms, proper use of products, and new drug research. One of the reasons consumers like DTC advertising is because they believe that it allows them to intelligently discuss treatment options with their doctor. 
<P>
When the NPD Group, a market research firm in Port Washington, N.Y., surveyed 175,000 consumer households, they found that 25 percent of consumers said they changed the way they took care of their medical condition after being exposed to DTC advertising (see <a href="Tar_Fig1.html">Figure 1</a>, above), with 20 percent claiming they called or visited (or were more likely to call or visit) their doctors. 
<P>
<H4>A growing cynicism</H4>
<P>
Strangely enough, despite their generally positive attitudes towards DTC advertising, more consumers are becoming cynical about the content of the information being presented, according to the Scott Levin study. The percentage of consumers who believe DTC advertising provides reliable information dropped from 69 percent in 1989 to 46 percent in 1995, and only 50 percent of today’s consumers believe that DTC advertising is an important educational tool, compared to 72 percent in 1989. Similarly, their confidence in the objectivity of DTC advertising has fallen from 44 percent in 1992 to 25 percent today. 
<P>
Perhaps not surprisingly, a key finding of the Scott-Levin study is that, when there are multiple products in a class making similar claims, consumer’s confusion and skepticism increase. This is compounded by the fact that the novelty of DTC advertising is starting to wear off.
<P>
In light of this erosion of trust, one has to question whether the investment in DTC advertising is worth it. Arthur McKee, coordinator of strategic studies at Scott-Levin, says that “Although they are more cynical, consumers are still accepting DTC advertising. They wish that companies would give them more information, but they’ll take whatever is being given to them. To put it simply, the level of information being presented to consumers has not increased proportionately with the level of responsibility consumers now have for their own healthcare. The level of information has remained stagnant, fostering cynicism. Of course, consumers are not aware of the strict FDA regulations on what advertisers can say in their advertisements.” 
<P>
While the FDA now allows more user-friendly language for the disclosure statement, Wayne Pines, president of health care at Washington, D.C. public relations firm apco Associates, points out in <I>Food and Drug Law Journal</I> (1994:49;589-592) that the FDA’s regulatory framework “does not acknowledge the increasingly central role that patients play in their own healthcare, the ability of people to make some therapeutic decisions for themselves, and the potential benefits of DTC advertising. What seems to be called for in this environment is a willingness on the part of the FDA to open up the subject to a true national debate, a discussion that will take into account all points of view.”
<P>
The Coalition for Healthcare Communication, in their July, 1995, position paper on FDA reform, calls for revising professional prescription drug advertising regulations to address DTC advertising in keeping with the realities of consumer media. “In the absence of specific DTC regulations,” says the report, “advertising on prescription products in lay media has been forced to conform to rules for ads in medical journals — particularly, the requirement that the ads carry ‘labeling.’ In magazines, newspapers, radio and television, this is impractical, may be counter-productive, and certainly is financially burdensome.”
<P>
<H4>Which products benefit most</H4>
<P>
Products most likely to benefit from DTC promotion include those for treating chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma, as well as acute therapies with maintenance follow-up, long treatment cycles, and seasonal use. In addition, DTC advertising benefits companies whose products are scheduled to lose patent protection, or whose competitor has just successfully switched a product to otc status (see <a href="Tar_Fig2.html">Figure 2</a>).
<P>
“Market-dominating drugs are prime candidates for DTC advertising,” adds William G. Castagnoli, vice chairman of Medicus Intercon and a contributing editor of <I>Medical Marketing & Media,</I> “Market domination is not forever, and DTC ads maximize sales while a product is the drug-of-choice. DTC ads can be used to expand the market. When the formulation of a drug has changed, and there is a change in dosage or delivery system, promotion can help revive sales,” he says.
<P>
Since only 1.38 billion of the 1.6 billion prescriptions written annually by physicians are actually filled, and 77 percent of eligible prescriptions are never refilled, DTC promotion can also be used to improve compliance. “The potential loss of revenue from noncompliance is staggering,” says Castagnoli. Market research firm Walsh America/pmsi estimates that $53 million is lost per month on Zantac nonrefills alone. The overall yearly loss of noncompliance to pharmaceutical companies in the U.S. is estimated at $100 billion.
<P>
<H4>… and how much</H4>
<P>
To quantify the effect of DTC advertising on sales, McKee asked doctors about their prescribing habits for specific drugs being advertised to the consumer. About 70 percent of dermatologists said that as a result of patient requests for Rogaine, their prescriptions increased over the last year. They attributed this increase to DTC advertising. 
<P>
The increase may also have influenced their opinion of DTC advertising. 
<P>
When physicians in the survey were asked if DTC ads were beneficial to consumers, 68 percent of dermatologists said they were, compared to 44 percent of physicians overall. “DTC ads for Rogaine increase the number of patients coming in to visit dermatologists — plain and simple,” says McKee. “On the other hand, an ad for a calcium channel blocker will probably not bring new patients into an internist’s or cardiologist’s office, because of the nature of hypertension and its diagnosis.” 
<P>
Building on their success — and answering public demand for more information — Upjohn took Rogaine advertising to a new level in June of this year when they rolled out the first program-length advertisement, or infomercial, approved by the FDA for a prescription product. “For Women Only: What To Do When Hair Gets Thinner” is being test-run nationally on seven cable television outlets and on local stations in Los Angeles, Detroit, Cleveland, and Rochester, N.Y. The infomercial also promotes an 800 number, so that callers can receive more information, and a list of local physicians experienced in diagnosing and treating hair loss. 
<P>
Steve Bradford, marketing manager for Rogaine, says that “The response we’ve gotten so far has been very positive. We’re very pleased with this form of communication and encouraged. In the areas of the country where we ran the infomercial, doctors told us that this format was a good way to get factual information out to the female hair loss patient and that it answered a lot of their questions before they came in for their appointment.” 
<P>
Upjohn broke new ground with this infomercial, but it took time to happen. “Initially, the FDA was a little discouraging,” explained Bradford. “They were concerned about disclosure, what we’d have to say, and the tone of the infomercial. We worked with the FDA for about a year-and-a-half to address their concerns. When a promotion is the first one of its type, it is always the hardest, but I’m pleased with the final product and I think the FDA is, too. We’ve paved the way for other managers who are thinking about this type of promotion.” 
<P>
As consumers become more proactive, doctors are becoming more tolerant of their new role. In Scott-Levin’s 1995 survey, a whopping 99 percent of 4000 physicians said they would consider prescribing, or will actually prescribe, a drug suggested by a patient, compared to 84 percent in 1989.
<P>
Some of this change in attitude may be explained easily — patients are asking for a specific drug more often. In 1989, only 21 percent of patients asked physicians about specific drugs. Now, 51 percent of patients do. Nonetheless, many physicians are still opposed to DTC advertising because they feel that patients can’t understand the information in full and are being misled. 
<P>
Another group that has reservations about DTC advertising is the managed care community, which poses a dilemma for pharmaceutical companies. Managed care administrators fear that DTC advertising brings patients in for extra visits and increases prescription costs. However, McKee believes that the industry can offer a good argument to change their minds. “If a DTC ad raises awareness of a condition a consumer previously wasn’t aware of, and they make an appointment to have it checked out, the condition may be caught earlier and bring down costs in the long run,” he says.
<P>
<H4>Next step</H4>
<P>
As the U.S. population becomes more diverse, consumer campaigns may also have to become more diverse. For example, Scott-Levin found that better-educated consumers (with bachelors’ degree or higher), and consumers older than 55, tend to have more negative feelings towards DTC advertising. 
<P>
Media preferences also vary. In general, consumers prefer to get their medical information through reading material, but less-educated consumers prefer television. “Better educated consumers don’t like the level of the material given to them in ads,” McKee adds, “and the older consumer isn’t comfortable with the idea of DTC advertising — it is new to them. Also, older consumers tend to have a strong relationship with their family physician and trust them.
<P>
“For these reasons, marketers should gear their advertising campaign towards a number of audiences. You have to look at educational levels, age, and other demographic variables which will affect the consumers response towards your campaign. There shouldn’t be a blanket campaign, which of course is difficult if you’re dealing with broadcast media. However, print campaigns can be geared towards different audience groups, then placed in magazines they read.” Incidentally, although consumers favor the convenience of newspapers and magazines, they are more motivated to read brochures left in the doctor’s office and find them more credible than material encountered outside the office. 
<P>
Another trend to watch is the growth of direct-to-patient (DTP) promotion. As consumers and patients seek more information, companies are introducing a kind of continuing medical education programs for patients. These dtp programs are more informative and stress disease management rather than specific products. As companies change their focus from selling drugs to providing healthcare solutions, they are helping to fill the void created by the healthcare providers who in general have been ineffective as patient educators. And since dtp programs are not viewed as just another advertising gimmick, they are helping to offset growing public cynicism. No wonder they are growing in number. 
<P>
Alzheimer’s FamilyCare is only one example of such a disease management program. FamilyCare consists of two separate systems offered by Parke-Davis to assist caregivers and families of patients being treated with Cognex. One of the telephone services provides general information on Alzheimer’s Disease and Cognex. Parke-Davis is currently running television advertisements for this program.
<P>
The second service provides 24-hour telephone support for caregivers of patients taking Cognex. Enrollment in this FamilyCare program is by physician referral. Families that enroll are assigned a personal nurse counselor, who provides ongoing advice on day-to-day care as well as educational material. A companion telephone service for the referring physician provides the doctor with treatment information, diagnostic aids, and access to Parke-Davis professionals. The nurse counselor remains in touch with the family and can discuss any possible Cognex side effects with the physician. By keeping in close contact, the nurses are helping to monitor the patient, thus helping to prevent complications and promoting compliance … a service to the patient, the family, and the doctor. 
<P>
Peg VanEss, Cognex Product Manager says that “FamilyCare has proven to help patients stay on therapy longer. After six months, twice as many Cognex patients who are enrolled in FamilyCare are still on Cognex, compared to those not experiencing the benefits of FamilyCare.”
<P>
<H4>Just the beginning</H4>
<P>
DTC promotion helps marketers achieve many objectives. It
<P>
<UL><LI>increases product awareness 
<LI>helps retain market share 
<LI>builds brand loyalty and stabilizes sales by reducing dropout rate.</UL>
<P>
In addition, DTC promotion 
<P>
<UL><LI>gives customers information that they didn’t have before 
<LI>helps patients avoid medications errors and spot side effects
<LI>enhances patient compliance. </UL>
<P>
Although DTC promotion has become commonplace and is losing its novelty, consumers still want more, especially if it provides useful information. In response, pharmaceutical companies are developing promotions that go beyond ads and offer service. Relationship marketing and disease management departments are springing up to develop programs. New innovative ways of marketing are emerging. DTC ads were just the beginning.

<I>New J&J Stent Campaign Aims at Maintaining Market Domination</I></H3>

<H5><I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></H5></center>
<BR><hr size=4>
<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<I><B>Launch Pad</B> is a new </I>Medical Marketing & Media <I>feature designed to provide insights into promotional campaigns when they first appear. Very often, the rationales for the strategic approaches or creative themes in new campaigns are not immediately evident and the question arises, “Why are they doing it that way?” Without knowledge of the product category, or the competitive problems facing the company/agency team, the campaign’s intent can be missed. <B>Launch Pad</B> will endeavor to supply some of the answers so that medical marketers can evaluate how well the campaign fulfills its strategic goals.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
<IMG align=left SRC="Launch1.gif">
We “launch” <B><I>Launch Pad</I></B> with a campaign for Johnson & Johnson’s coronary Stent — a medical device used in angioplasty. “Stent” is probably an unfamiliar term even for those involved with medical products. It has entered our vocabulary as more and more patients have undergone angioplasty. Webster informs that the device is named after its inventor, English dentist Charles R. Stent, who created it in 1901. It is defined as “a compound or mold made from the compound for holding a surgical graft in place.” 
<P>
Stents have become extremely important in angioplasty — the procedure in which a balloon catheter is snaked through the circulatory system to the heart where the balloon is inflated at points in the coronary vessels that have become occluded by atherosclerosis, causing angina and threatening ischemic attack. The balloon’s pressure on the vessel walls widens the passageway, reducing the narrowing or “stenosis.” However, “restenosis,” a return to the previous state, occurs in many cases with accompanying symptoms. Stents are placed after angioplasty at the spot in the vessel that needs to be dilated. They hold the vessel open and prevent restenosis.
<P>
The J&J stent is a slotted tube made of stainless steel, 10mm to 39mm long, which expands into a diamond-shaped lattice. Sounds like a surgical sideshow of only technical interest, doesn’t it? Well, angioplasty has become so common and restenosis such an ongoing problem that the worldwide stent sales are approaching $1 billion annually — a mammoth and growing market!
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="Launch2.gif"></center>
<P>
Here is how Glenn McColgan, vice president and executive creative director at Toltzis Communications, the agency for Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems, outlines the thinking behind the new promotional program:
<P>
<blockquote>“This campaign has been designed to solve an interesting medical marketing challenge. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty has become a practical option for the treatment of heart disease only in the last 20 years. Intravascular stent implantation (an enhancement to conventional angioplasty) has emerged only within the last eight years. Because it is still such a young medical frontier, competitors have begun implying that the extensive clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of Johnson & Johnson stents can be used to support ‘stenting’ in general or, in other words, all stents, thus creating the illusion of parity — the illusion that intravascular stents are created equal, that they are a ‘commodity’ differentiated merely by price.</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>“The new campaign highlights the many unique differences of the Johnson & Johnson stents. In the 8-page insert which kicks off the campaign, many of these differences are listed together in bullet-form. However, the spread ads that are to follow throughout the year will each focus on a single claim. Because these claims are truly important and meaningful to the target audience (interventional cardiologists and radiologists and vascular surgeons), they warrant individual emphasis.</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>“Currently, Johnson & Johnson Interventional Systems enjoys the lion’s share of the market. Their stents are immediately recognizable to leading interventionalists. Our intention is simply to remind the audience quickly and telegraphically of their superiority, thus preempting any possible confusion caused by insinuations of parity.”</blockquote>
<P>
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="Launch3.gif"></center>
<P>
The campaign’s theme — “Only One” — appears on the opening teaser page and on the next three spreads. In a refreshing reversal of the usual treatment of a central creative element, it is given minimalist emphasis the first three times and then explodes (albeit in silver tones) at the end of the insert. This produces a crescendo effect, with the copy theme becoming the final visual feature.
<P>
The ad is also unusual for a medical device in that it focuses on clinical results, rather than product attributes. The medical audience apparently knows all the details about the biocompatibility of the stent’s chemistry and all the subtleties of its design and construction. In any event, J&J and Toltzis have not been tempted to over-communicate — to fill up all the space on those eight pages. They have held to their strategy of a straightforward reminder message, stripped down to the essentials, dramatized by graphic symbolization of anatomy, under the “Only One” banner.
<P>
On the media side, Jeannie Swindle, manager of professional education and marketing services at J&J’s Interventional Systems, explains that the ad will appear only once in November 1995, to be followed by a pool of two-page spreads dealing with specific features. The goal with the eight-page insert, she says, “Is to summarize all the product’s advantages in one blockbuster unit, stressing that J&J, and only J&J, has been on the scene long enough to have proven its product’s efficiency in so many crucial areas.”
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="Launch4.gif"></center>
<P>

The eight-pager will appear in the following November 1995 issues: <I>Clinical Cardiology — Cardiology Demography, Journal of the American College of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology — Current Journal Review, American Journal of Cardiology, Circulation, New England Journal of Medicine — Cardiology Demography, Journal of Invasive Cardiology, Catheterization & Cardiovascular Diagnosis, Journal of Vascular Surgery, Journal of Endovascular Surgery, Radiographics, Diagnostic Imaging, Journal of Vascular & Interventional Radiology, Cardiovascular & Interventional Radiology, British Heart Journal,</I> and <I>Diagnostic Imaging</I> (European & Asian).
<P>
Glenn McColgan developed the creative concepts for the ad and wrote the copy. Art direction was in the hands of Carl Berkowitz, vice president, creative director of art; and account services was handled by Scott Greisler, vice president, director healthcare division at Toltzis Communications.

The beauty of these ads is not in the art, but in the power and simplicity of their communication. They scream without uttering a word. Onion eyes: we all have cried over this irritating yet edible(?) bulb. We’ve chlorinated our eyes to the point of bloodshot, strained those orbs in the glare of night driving, assaulted them (and our lungs) in tobacco afterburn, squinted at a blurry CRT, and let’s not forget good old itchy pollen and your peepers. These images transmit instantly the irritants that the eye can come in contact with daily. The solution is in the lower right hand corner — Optrex. Isn’t it refreshing how easy it was to get through the problem/solution scenario … unaided! 
<P>
And hey, where is our old faithful friend called clutter? You know, everything on a page — headline (with logo), graphic, subhead, bulleted points. Throw in a chart, fair balance, logo again, tag line, and references — did I forget anything?<BR><BR><BR>
<P>
I know, the real world rarely gives us the opportunity to take such creative liberties. But maybe these ads can inspire us, remind us that there can be creative executions that go beyond the obvious and predictable. The Coumadin atrial clot ad a few years back (the mostly white ad with a little red speck) was tremendous with its corralling minimalism.
<P>
We always talk about breaking through the noise: these do it. I’d love to see more. Wouldn’t it be interesting if one day everyone created ads this way, got sick and tired of the simplicity, and began
to preach the need for clutter so we can break through the silence?
<P>Never.

<CENTER>
<H2>1995 Career & Salary Survey<BR>
Fewer People are Looking to Move</H2>
</CENTER>




<HR>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
<I>The industry experienced mergers, downsizing, and generally turbulent times, but fewer of those responding to this year's survey plan to change jobs.</I>
<P>


The overall profile of those responding to this year’s Career and Salary Survey didn’t change much from 1994. Once again, 60 percent were male and 40 percent female, and the average age was up only slightly, from 40.4 to 41.1 years. The percentage employed by manufacturers was unchanged at 64 percent, while the figure for agencies dropped slightly from 25 to 22 percent.
<P>
The primary area of involvement for those responding, once again, was ethical pharmaceuticals. Sixty-four percent of our survey indicated that they dealt with these products. Medical products and equipment placed a distant second at 36 percent, followed by OTCs at 29 percent, and diagnostics at 24 percent. Last year we added managed care to our list and 18 percent of our survey indicated involvement in that field. This year the figure increased to 22 percent, reflecting the growing role of those responding, up sharply from 18 percent last year.
<P>
While 40 percent of our replies came from women, they are still disproportionately represented in many job categories. They continue to occupy most of the positions in media and production, and now fill the vast majority of agency account positions. While they have not had the same success on the manufacturer side, the numbers continue to move up steadily in several areas such as product manager, group product manager, and marketing VP.
<P>
Salaries reported this year averaged just over $85,000, up roughly $6,000 over last year. The range ran from $14,000 to $875,000 for one company president. As was the case in 1994, only a shade over 10 percent of those responding think that they’re paid more than their peers, while 47 percent think others take home a larger paycheck. As for the past several years, roughly three of four persons participating in our survey gets a bonus, with the average being just under $20,000. The amount of the bonus varies greatly with the type of position. For some it is a major part of the total compensation package, while for others it’s fairly minor.
<P>
Despite all the doom and gloom in our industry, fewer people say they will be looking for a new job. Last year almost 40 percent of our survey said they were actively in the job market. This year that figure has dropped to 37 percent, although one person noted “There’s nowhere to move.” Given that fewer people said they found their job satisfying this year, this may well be the case.
<P>
With the explosion of the Internet, we thought it would be interesting to find out whether our readers are already using it. Forty percent are, with America Online being the access method of choice for 59 percent of them. 
<P>
The following links  provide summary information for our respondents on age, salary, and experience, and a number of other factors, and provide detailed profiles of 38 job positions. In reviewing this year’s tables, at least one item is worthy of mention. One might well ask where the 51.8 percent of company presidents who feel they will be “advancing” will be advancing to. In looking at the replies, we found that most didn’t answer that question, and that while a couple said “CEO” or “Chairman,” many that did indicated they would be “advancing to retirement” or “swinging in a hammock.”

<H2>Managed Care & Generics . . . <BR>
. . . A Marriage  Made in Heaven?</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by Edward W. Thwaite</I></H4>

<HR>


<H3>Executive summary</H3>
<I>Specific suppliers' generic pharmaceuticals are not necessarily the natural fit for managed care organizations. While the market is there and growing, successfully selling generics will take marketing knowledge and vigilance as both generic and brand companies change to meet the challenges ahead.
</I>
<P>
Generic pharmaceutical products are capturing an increasing share of the overall pharmaceutical business. The purpose of generic pharmaceuticals is to provide lower cost pharmaceutical alternatives which will reduce the cost of healthcare. 
<P>
Managed healthcare is capturing a greater share of the U.S. healthcare market. The purpose of managed healthcare is to reduce the overall cost of healthcare. Therefore, managed care and generics are a marriage made in heaven. Right? The huge managed care market is a tremendous opportunity for specific generic companies to have their products used. Right?
<P>
The answer to both of these questions is a resounding maybe, sometimes, or no!
<P>

<H3>The numbers</H3>
Generic pharmaceuticals now represent approximately 12 percent of total pharmaceutical prescription dollar purchases, slightly over $6 billion in 1994. However, because of the significant pricing differential between them and their branded counterparts, this figure is misleading. The comparatively modest share of the pharmaceutical dollar market is overshadowed by its unit share, which is over 40 percent of all prescription units (see <A HREF="figure1.jpg">Figure 1</A>).
<P>
This level of generic use has been increasing continuously for the past decade, as may be noted from <A HREF="figure2.jpg">Figure 2</A> and is expected to grow considerably in the next decade.
<P>

<H3>Feeding this growth will be a number of important factors:</H3>
Patent/Exclusivity Expirations. Over the next 10 years, 150 major branded pharmaceutical products will face either patent or exclusivity expiration, introducing the possibility of generic competition. Current brand sales of these products exceed $20 billion and is expected to grow to over $30 billion by the time of patent/exclusivity expiration. More than half of the dollar volume and number of products are concentrated in three therapeutic classes: cardiovasculars, anti-infectives, and anti-ulcers. While the generic opportunity is not $30 billion in sales, this is the starting point for the volume which may be captured from generic introductions. The final market, however, will vary based upon the number of ANDA competitors, market share, and market price over time, among other factors.
<P>
Aging U.S. Population. The nation's population is becoming older. Generally, as individuals age they take more medications, and often generics are the mandated products for these individuals.
<P>
Healthcare Cost Containment Efforts. Throughout the economy there is a push to cut healthcare costs which has given rise to concepts such as step-therapy, disease management, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and managed healthcare. Based on these and other factors, it is projected that in the next decade the generic pharmaceutical business will grow to represent over two-thirds of all prescription unit volume and approximately 20 percent of the overall dollar market.
<P>

<H3>Pharmaceutical Dollar Sales and Managed Healthcare</H3>
It has been projected that managed care has involvement with approximately $30 billion of prescription industry dollar sales. But figures alone do not tell the whole story–the measurement of use of generics by MCOs is convoluted. The actual influence which managed care can exert over specific product use or selection depends upon the type of MCO. Those facilities which actually purchase and take possession of their drug, such as staff model HMOs, are easy to measure, but it is much more difficult when prescriptions are filled in the "open" retail market. Finally, the distinction must be made between "generics in general" as opposed to "specific" generic supplier's products.
<P>
Despite these difficulties, it is estimated that those managed care organizations which can exert a direct influence on which specific generic is utilized represent approximately 10-15 percent of total generic purchases, with the caveat that not all these MCOs exert that influence all of the time.
<P>
Another way to look at MCOs and their priorities is to gauge the importance of pharmaceuticals in controlling budgets, and the importance generics play in that goal.
<P>
Pharmaceutical expenditures represent, on a national basis, approximately 7 percent of healthcare costs; generics represent approximately 1 percent. Generics are all competitively priced. It does not matter if one generic is more costly than the other because the difference between the brand product and any generic alone will result in significant cost savings. For managed care facilities to exert efforts to have one generic supplier's product used as opposed to another may result in some minimal savings, but administrative procedures to make sure there is compliance can be massive. The net result may be only a minute savings in their overall budgets.
<P>

<H3>Specific generic unnecessary</H3>
For these reasons, most managed care programs do not try to control which specific generic product is used–just that a generic of a branded product is substituted. The exception to this rule are those MCOs which operate closed facilities, i.e., take direct possession of the drug or directly control the dispensing of the drug with a pharmacy on their premises. Obviously, they can have a direct influence on which generic product is purchased and/or stocked.
<P>
With the desire to control costs and exert dispensing control, it would be expected that HMO generic use would be much higher than the national average. This is not the case. HMO use (other than in selected staff group model HMOs) of generics roughly mirrors national percentages.
<P>
According to data from Managed Care Profiles, published by IMS America, 81 percent of group/network MCOs, and 70 percent of staff MCOs, have a mandatory substitution policy. Michael Dillon, director of pharmacy operations for Community Health Plan, which uses both in-house and retail pharmacies, was asked to hypothesize why. "One of the reasons is that brand companies are willing to come to closed MCOs and offer special long-term pricing on their products. Therefore, when those products face generic competition, the MCO is less likely to use a generic as they already have good pricing and a long-term arrangement."
<P>
The IMS America Retail Method of Payment Report also reports on pharmacy revenues based upon dispensing costs to patients (see <A HREF="figure3.jpg">Figure 3</A>). When analyzing the above, it should be kept in mind that generic purchases by pharmacies represent approximately 12 percent of total prescription dollars. However, according to this report, 29-36 percent of pharmacy dispensing revenues appear to be from generics. This means that pharmacies are making considerably greater mark-ups and profits on generics than brands, even for managed third-party patients.
<P>
Generic pricing can wind up being a fraction of a brand cost when numerous generic manufacturers have gained approval. Some MCOs are quite adept at purchasing product at an extremely low price or, in the open setting, reimbursing pharmacies at a Maximum Allowable Cost (MAC) price which has been set either by the government or by their own administrative personnel.
<P>
However, some MCOs still reimburse some or most generic products based upon an Average Wholesale Price (AWP). This procedure endears the MCO to retail pharmacies because of the added profit opportunity for each prescription dispensed. Even when MACs are established, many MCOs are slow getting them implemented, so generic substitution winds up being an added product incentive for pharmacies, and a much smaller savings for MCOs.
<P>

<H3>A brand opportunity</H3>
According to Michael Dillon, there is a pricing opportunity here for brand companies. "If brands come to an MCO early and can guarantee competitive pricing over time either with their brand product or a generic version of their product, it makes us interested in staying with them."
<P>
There are a number of different approaches which MCOs (and their PBMs) use to encourage the use of generic pharmaceuticals, both by patients and pharmacists. The most common are:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Co-pays, where the incentive to use a generic product provides the patient a substantial savings compared to use of the brand product.
<LI>Medication costs, where patients may be required to pay, for example, 50 percent of the actual drug costs resulting in a very significant difference between the brand and generic products.
<LI>MACs for pharmacy reimbursement by MCOs for generic prescriptions which are filled. "When MACs are set, it is virtually impossible for a pharmacy to dispense the brand product due to the huge pricing differential between the generic MAC and the brand product," says Michael Dillon.
<LI>Dispensing Fees for the pharmacist which are higher for generics, thus yielding greater profits.
<LI>Physician incentives  for complying with prescribing guidelines.
</UL>

"Other approaches which generic companies employ can help encourage usage of generics in general, and some specific products in particular," says Adam Levitt, pharmaceuticals director of market management, Schein Pharmaceutical, Inc. "These include: rebates, different dispensing fees, and mandatory generic use."
<P>

<H3>A recipe for managed care</H3>
In the past five years, the number of brand companies involved in the generic business has skyrocketed. Prior to 1990, there were only a handful of brand companies in the business. By 1995, the number had swelled to over 30. Their involvement, either through the purchase of a generic company, growing a subsidiary, or with a strategic alliance, has been for two primary reasons: Defensive–because of an upcoming brand patent expiration; and Offensive–viewed as a profitable business opportunity, particularly because of managed care and the concepts of "bundling" and "one-stop-shopping." (See <A HREF="marside2.html">"Bundling and One-Stop Shopping"</A>)
<P>
There is a general consensus among managed care executives that brand company involvement with generic pharmaceuticals mean:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>brand companies will have much greater control over the generic business;
<LI>brand involvement will result in stabilizing of pricing; and
<LI>generic forms of off patent products will appear earlier.
</UL>

Terry Cater, vice president of managed care for McKesson Corp., summed it up by saying, "Brand companies owning generic companies will likely result in overall generic pricing being "propped up." To balance this, the government and corporate operations which are paying the pharmaceutical costs will keep pressure on prices to come down."
<P>
How the managed care industry makes use of a specific company's generic products will depend on technology. Advances will be needed which will allow PBMs, their MCO clients, and other MCOs to better monitor, reward–and be rewarded–for not only generic substitution in general, but use of a specific generic supplier. It is inevitable. 
<P>
Picking up on this concept, W. Andrew Gunter, director of managed health care at Novopharm USA Inc., said that "A specific companies' generic products get utilized by the MCO members if the generic supplier contracts with the chain, or if the independent pharmacies purchase through a retail buying group which has a contract with specific generic suppliers. Duplicate–or more–stocking, both on the part of pharmacies, warehousing chains and wholesalers causes a problem because of the added inventory costs and administrative processes."
<P>
In the open market, when a managed care patient gets a prescription filled at a retail pharmacy, sophisticated monitoring of that activity will have a revolutionary change in the industry. According to Adam Levitt of Schein, as PBMs are attempting to reinvent themselves, "Electronic control of dispensing will create specific generic opportunities for PBMs from a rebate perspective. Specific companies' product use may become a reality as they move into greater prescription control." 
<P>
However, this prospective is moderated by Ed Croke, a senior industry executive headquartered in Jupiter, Florida. Mr. Croke says that "Managed care doesn't want to run a chain or retailers business, forcing them to pick what the MCO dictates. MCOs would prefer to work with chains as partners."
<P>
Donald C. Hoscheit of Hoscheit Consulting in St. Charles, Ill., says "MCO's typically don't care which generic is used. Retailers guard that right of generic selection and most MCO's are willing to let them make the choice. The goal of the MCO is to control the maximum billing cost for the generic regardless of the supplier of the product." Mr. Hoscheit has an interesting thought regarding the concept of one-stop-shopping. "The implementation of one-stop-shopping of branded and generic products by a company is unimportant to MCO's. They are much better off breaking out their requirements into individual suppliers and product needs, and shopping for the best products and prices."
<P>

<H3>Generic opportunities</H3>
There will be tremendous opportunities in the future for generic companies to have their products used to a greater extent by managed care. According to Doug Batezel, national product director, Multi-Source at Bergen Brunswig Corporation, "Wholesalers' generic-source programs are open to all customers and this is where the wholesalers have an opportunity. Managed care can tap into our preestablished line of cost-efficient generics. As third parties usually use wholesaler inventory, they will have the opportunity under these situations to have a ready made and available line of low priced generics." (See <A HREF="marside1.html">"Manufacturer's vs. Private Label"</A>)
<P>
The situation is now somewhat limited in terms of specific generic company opportunities. In closed settings, which according to one generic pharmaceutical industry executive estimates at 10-15 percent of the plans, they can deliver what they promise. In open facilities and settings, however, no one can guarantee specific delivery, compliance, or use of a generic drug.
<P>
According to Adam Levitt, the selling of generic pharmaceuticals for managed care use in the open dispensing retail market is pretty much a "business as usual" activity, i.e., what the wholesaler and warehousing chain stock is utilized. Most generic pharmaceuticals are finding their way into retail pharmacy through normal methods of distribution, and through the traditional decision-making modes.
<P>

<H3>Criteria for choice</H3>
Although most MCOs care only about having a generic used, some take actual control of the product and/or can directly influence which product is dispensed. These MCOs indicate that they are interested in the following criteria when deciding which products to recommend:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Quality (including Orange Book rating)
<LI>Competitive pricing
<LI>Promotional support
<LI>Broad product line
<LI>First generic available of an off-patent branded product
<LI>Rebates
<LI>Generic supplier reputation
<LI>Manufacturer's label vs. private label
</UL>

For executives involved in the generic business, the exact path of opportunity to MCOs is not clear, but all agree it is a long one. The head of a brand company's generic unit projection of the future is that "The distinction between brand and generic companies will disappear and pharmaceutical companies will be providing a broad line of brand and generic products which will revolve around disease states."
<P>
It is important to remain current on developments in this evolving segment of the market, to stay in contact with MCOs, and try different approaches to prepare for future opportunities. 
<P>
There are a number of actions which generic suppliers should take when dealing with managed care. These include:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Don't set objectives too high. It's a hard sell and even tougher to get compliance.
<LI>Stay in touch with MCOs.
<LI>Also deal with PBMs representing key MCOs.
<LI>Bid, but it only really counts when the MCO takes control of the drug.
<LI>Focus on your normal channels of distribution–wholesaler and chain still provide the bulk of generic pharmaceutical requirements for most MCOs.
<LI>Provide broadened value to your line including:
</UL>
<UL><UL>- more products and self-manufactured products<BR>
- important generic products services<BR>
- disease "reach"<BR>
- step therapy concepts and implementation approaches.</UL></UL>

<UL>
<LI> Consider that the future will include therapeutic substitution–a big generic opportunity.
<LI> Consider arrangements with MCOs including:</UL>
<UL><UL>- risk sharing<BR>
- rebates<BR>
- collaborative marketing. </UL></UL>
<UL>
<LI>And keep your eye on the big picture–where MCOs are going.

<H2>Paying the Modern Pharmaceutical Salesforce</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by Robert Atkins</I></H4>

<HR>

<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
The complexity of the modern sales process means that the traditional methods of compensation will no longer work. Payment must now take into consideration various kinds of sales compensation and incentives, bonus percentages, team awards, performance and competency measurements, and organizational placement.
<P>
Many pharmaceutical companies are relying on their salespeople to carry them into the 21st century, but they're not sure how to pay them for their efforts. The selling process has become so complex that the sales executive needs a much broader scope of skills, experiences, and competencies to be successful. The representative needs to partner with account managers, marketing people, the management team, and others in the district to bring the business in and build long-term, profitable relationships with customers. All this, and they're being held personally responsible for divisional, regional, even companywide financial results as well.
<P>
To reward this new breed of salespeople, organizations need to move beyond the traditional method of computing incentives based on sales attainment versus quota within a territory. Simply changing the dials a little bit rather than examining the incentive plan's place in the total compensation scheme will no longer work. Compensation must foster the new performance expectations for the role (what do you want me to do?); the performance measures that will be used (how much of it do you want me to do?); and the supporting rationale and motivation (why should I do it?). Management must define each of these elements within the context of the company's overall strategy.
<P>
Companies have to move to a higher level of strategic thinking and reexamine all the fundamental assumptions and principles in the compensation program. Mechanics like incentive formulas and performance criteria should be designed after the strategic framework is built, not before. As a strategic component, compensation programs (particularly incentives) need to look past the current year and focus on where the company wants to be three to five years down the road so that compensation will support that evolutionary process. When a change is made, management must be careful to adhere to it so as not to upset the delicate balance inherent in a well-functioning compensation scheme.
<P>
To be fair and properly motivating, compensation programs must be in sync, both vertically-up and down the organization, and horizontally-across different jobs. The sales representative's compensation program must relate to the district manager's compensation, which must be aligned with the regional manager's compensation program. Compensation programs should also be consistent for similar levels across business units since these jobs need to interrelate.
<P>
Finally, companies have to look beyond the compensation program itself to ensure that other systems and processes are in place to support it.
<P>
Compensation is one of the most powerful tools that can be used to reinforce change and drive behavior. However, roles and performance expectations, as well as other human resource systems such as career planning and recruiting, also must be properly integrated and supportive of changes and behaviors.
Type and level of rewards Sales compensation comes in many forms:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>base salary
<LI>incentive bonus
<LI>contests
<LI>awards and recognition
<LI>long-term incentives
<LI>benefits
</UL>

Historically, these components have been designed and administered through different departments with very little interconnection. It is now critical that we look to integrate all forms of compensation and ensure alignment so that there is consistent delivery and support for the strategy, direction and behaviors needed by the organization. We also need to recognize that for sales organizations, we can't incorporate everything into the annual incentive bonus plan.
<P>

<H3>Sales Incentives</H3>
Sales incentives are one of the most motivating, and sometimes effective, forms of compensation for a sales organization. Sales incentives can support but not create:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>business strategy
<LI>marketing initiatives
<LI>sales objectives
<LI>roles
<LI>re-deployment
<LI>revitalization
<LI>personal goals and expectations
</UL>

Again, it's critical that the sales incentives be designed to be in alignment with the business needs of the organization. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has had a high degree of autonomy within sales organizations in relation to the rest of the company. Currently, the trend is for the sales force to "rejoin the company" for a variety of important reasons. Among the implications are the need for greater realignment with regard to how the sales organization is compensated in relation to the rest of the company. 
<P>
We see a growing number of people in sales who have a component of their incentive plan based on company profitability. This may be determined by regional business unit, overall company or both. In some cases, this component is the same as the company incentive plan for all employees. This links the sales force directly to the company by having the same performance criteria for both sales and home office employees. It also serves to get everyone to think in terms of bottom-line profitability, as opposed to simply a top-line, growth-versus-target mentality.
<P>
With this approach, people in different roles in different departments who have to work together for the same ends are focused on the same goals and objectives and rewarded for the same desired behaviors. This is a significant break from the past, where individual departments could operate independently and autonomously. Success in the future will require much more of this kind of interdependency among roles.
Pay at risk
<P>
How much pay do you put at risk? We see companies moving in each direction on this question depending on their individual culture and philosophy. For the pharmaceutical sales representative, an average sales bonus target is about 20% of total compensation. That's very conservative for a sales position. At a time of such change and uncertainty in the marketplace, it is easy to argue for a higher degree of shared risk among employees throughout the company, particularly those who have high performance accountabilities. 
<P>
With the growing complexity of the marketplace and business environment, we frequently hear from sales executives that so many things are now "out of our control!" They argue that there should be less in bonus and more in base pay because it's too difficult to measure performance in this environment. However, incentives should be at least 15% of total compensation to be an effective motivator.
<P>
Putting more pay at risk enforces the pay-for-performance orientation. Under this scenario, the sales organization would take on a higher level of risk sharing and enter into more of a partnership relationship with the company. The point is "control" is no longer the critical factor but rather the competence to "influence" outcomes over a wide range of situations.
<P>
Also, at a time when performance is so critical, companies need to leverage incentive pay to provide much more differentiation for top performers. In the past, everyone got pretty much the same in both salary and bonuses. Companies are beginning to pay less for below target performance and significantly more for top performance. In some plans, top performers can now earn two to three times the target bonus. Since the stakes are higher per customer, the performance on the top end is worth more in outcomes to the organization. 
<P>

<H3>Rewarding teamwork</H3>
There are a variety of team relationships emerging in the pharmaceutical sales function, including customer-specific selling teams, district/area teams and regional business units. At Pfizer, Hank McCrorie, group vice president of sales, U.S. Pharmaceutical Group, says that the company has created a "team-based incentive to reward not just individual effort, but the team approach to selling in a managed care environment." The Upjohn Company is moving along similar lines. According to Dennis Lebsack, executive director for sales and marketing support services, "Individual incentives have been evolving toward team incentives." This change, he believes, "would have occurred without managed care, but has certainly been accelerated by the rapid growth of managed care." 
<P>
To the extent team performance and accomplishment are recognized and rewarded, it's essential that the reward level be the same for all team members. This is not to say a salesperson's competence at teamwork cannot be recognized on an individual level.
<P>
Team awards may be provided through the incentive plan for sales or business performance on the district, regional, or company level. In one case, a company expanded its district manager's field force by dividing reps into teams of five. Each has a team leader who is responsible for guiding the group toward meeting its performance targets. Upon meeting team goals, each member receives an incentive payment. Teamwork for special projects or ad hoc, situational collaborations (as in customer-selling teams) might be rewarded outside the incentive plan through separate team reward and recognition programs. 
<P>

<H3>Measuring performance</H3>
With more pay at risk, it's more critical than ever to develop appropriate performance measures. They must go beyond the traditional sales versus quota standard. However, companies must achieve a balance between simplicity and understanding on the one hand and effective coverage of desired behaviors and outcome on the other hand. Today, we are looking at incentive plans with three and four components of performance measurement involving individual sales, strategic business goals, team goals, and company goals.
<P>
Depending upon sales strategy, direction and individual role, performance measures for the sales organization could include: 
<P>

<UL>
<LI>individual sales results versus quota
<LI>individual business objectives
<LI>team objectives/results
<LI>customer-specific objectives
<LI>regional business unit results
<LI>company results
<LI>individual competencies
<LI>customer satisfaction
</UL>

Depending upon the characteristics of the company and its environment, and the nature of each individual role in the sales organization, each of these performance measures will represent a greater or lesser percentage of the overall incentive. For example, if the company professes to have customer focus as a strategic objective, then the performance measures should include customer satisfaction.
<P>
Individual performance is still important and you want to hold reps accountable for that. However, the new performance measures also must reflect key changes in the sales role. One important dimension of the new environment is the demand for individually oriented high-achievers to become team players.
<P>

<H3>Team performance</H3>
"Team" means different things in different companies. It might mean customer-account selling teams or collaboration within a regional business unit. The team, business unit, and company results tend to be measured on a team, rather than individual basis. For example, the rep is a member of the district team, and the team portion of the incentive might be based on district performance. 
<P>
Depending on company strategy and level of position, the weights of the team component of the incentive plan might vary. For example, individual performance might be a major part, 50% or more, of the incentive with team and other components such as profits determining the other half. In companies moving more quickly to teams, the individual performance component might be less of the incentive with the team portion the greater. Also, positions at higher levels in the organization would have more weight on business unit or company components.
<P>

<H3>Company performance</H3>
Today more organizations are beginning to say that company results should have an influence over everyone's bonus pay. However, within pharmaceutical companies in the past, the sales organization has been autonomous and incentive pay has had little to do with how well the company does. It reflected the performance of the sales organization only.
<P>
With companies moving toward a much more integrated or team-oriented strategy, the sales organization alone is not enough to create the results desired by the company. There has to be a partnership between sales and national accounts and other departments like marketing and legal. Selling is now a multi-functional activity that is driving the business and the sales organization. So salespeople should have some share of company results in their bonus program.
<P>
The first reaction of the sales rep tends to be: How can you hold me accountable for company performance or profitability if I can't control it? One answer is that the concept of control is fading. With the changes in the marketplace, the rep has little complete control over anything. 
<P>
The critical factor is no longer what the rep has control over. It is what the rep can influence. The sales organization certainly has influence over company profitability, a common measure of company performance. Make them accountable for profitability and salespeople will demand a voiceEin the production of marketing material and advertising, for instance. They will also seek to maximize the effectiveness of the "extras" they use in the sales process such as samples, luncheons, and special programs. Finally, they will think twice about bringing on a marginally profitable account just to meet a quota. In the future, we see growing accountability for company results.
<P>

<H3>Key competencies</H3>
Another performance dimension, how the job is done as opposed to results, is more important today due to the changes in roles. Companies are beginning to look seriously at competencies as measures of performance because they are trying to change behavior. For example, a person's ability to be an effective team player has to do with how the job is done rather than results.
<P>
Companies are identifying and using key competencies in many ways to ensure that reps clearly understand what the new role is, what the performance expectations are and what they are going to be held accountable for. Some organizations are employing competencies in performance development programs while others are also incorporating them into compensation programs. Sales managers can use these attributes as guideposts for developing the people who work for them.
<P>
In order for this to work, however, the behaviors for each competency have to be "scaled" so competencies can be measured accurately and consistently throughout the organization. This will allow the company to place a tangible value on competency levels in a job and in an individual. 
<P>
When competencies are applied to compensation, they are typically considered during the base salary performance review rather than in the incentive plan. However, companies are beginning to include some component of how the job is done in the incentive plan to give additional emphasis to drive the behavior change. In all cases, competency development should be approached from a career standpoint, not just as an annual goal. Competencies are to be developed and rewarded over time.
<P>
Some companies have already taken steps to meet this objective. For instance, Joe Sebra, vice president for human resources at Sandoz, reports that his company has switched from a 70/30 compensation system-70 percent base and 30 percent incentive-to an 80/20 ratio. This switch reflects, he says, "emerging uncertainties, of which managed care is most prominent." And at Upjohn, Dennis Lebsack says the emphasis has shifted from revenue as a sales measurement tool to profit. 
<P>
One company wanted to use competencies to drive the behavioral change needed to make its newly created business units work as planned. This company chose its incentive plan as the tool to bring this about. The company identified and scaled key competencies for the organization and for key jobs. Then, they designed a performance matrix that ties incentive rewards to the development of the key competencies. The company chose incentives over base pay because it wanted to send the loudest, most immediate message as possible. If you want to salesperson's attention, talk about their bonus.
<P>
With more performance measures, the incentive plan becomes more appropriate for communicating performance expectations and rewarding people who meet them. When there is more conformance between the incentive plan and the performance expectations, the organization can put more pay at risk.
<P>

<H3>Alignment within</H3>
The need for alignment comes up again across different roles in the organization, where people must work in various types of collaboration to achieve the necessary outcomes. For example, national account managers, district managers and professional representatives must work as a team. Consequently, the compensation program must be similarly aligned with respect to performance expectations, measures, and payouts to be consistent and effective.
<P>
Generally, the performance measures should be the same for different levels in the sales organization, but there may be different degrees of importance, or weight, given to them. For example, the company component should increase as you go up the ladder. You would expect the regional business heads to have greater accountability for regional and company performance than district managers or their reps.
<P>
What is the overall impact of these changes on the sales rep? Those reps who are flexible and able to adapt to the new role will succeed in the future. Whether reps will earn more or less is not a function of the change in performance expectations, it is more a function of the individual company's philosophy about pay for performance and the extent to which it is applied in two areas:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>How much incentive compared to base salary should there be in the total compensation mix? 
<LI>How much more will a top performer earn in relation to average performers?
</UL>

Incentives, as part of compensation, are expected to grow as the demand for performance increases. When we look at how much a top performer will earn versus the average performer, we expect a lot of change. Incentive plans are beginning to provide more differentiation in pay with more upside potential for higher levels of performance across the board. This includes individual, as well as team and company performance. Conversely, those who are underachieving will earn less. 
<P>
Today's wisdom suggests there is still a long way to go before the pace and scope of these changes begin to level off. A well-designed sales compensation program is vital to keeping up with the leaders and excelling in this increasingly demanding environment.

<H3>Executive summary:</H3>
<I>HMOs have been successful in reducing costs to employers, so there will be no backtracking on managed care. But realignment will take place as health care providers and patients demand more say in the decision-making process. HMOs will respond by consolidating, drug companies will sharpen their marketing to physicians and patients, physicians will form their own medical groups (see <A HREF="grbox2.html">International Convergence</A>).</I>
<P>
Comes the millennium, doctors will once again have a free hand in prescribing, clinical utility and marketing savvy will be the sole determinants of success and failure of Rx products, and manufacturers will be free to price as they wish.
<P>
That's the metaphorical millennium, of course, defined by the dictionary as "a hoped-for period of joy, serenity, prosperity, and justice." Comes the real turn of the century, the healthcare marketing environment will be not so different from what it is today—but neither will it be the same. That is the consensus of the highly knowledgeable experts MEDICAL MARKETING & MEDIA interviewed as the basis for this article, experts representing many facets of our business from manufacturing to publishing, from market research to creative media and securities analysis. Another common opinion: the pharmaceutical industry overreacted to the onslaught of managed care and now it is time for a course correction. In publisher Jim Dougherty's words: "Industry reaction went too far. Companies tried to compete primarily on price, only to find that that did not materially shift market share. Now the pendulum is swinging back."
<P>
To focus their opinions, we asked two overlapping questions: what do you predict will happen to our business during 1996 and by the end of the century as a result of managed care.
<P>

<H3>The decade of managed care</H3>
No one disputes the premise that managed care is the dominant factor in healthcare marketing today, or that, as Emron, Inc. CEO Myron Holubiak puts it, "we're not going to move back to unmanaged care." Larry Belford, an expert on market research, sums up the impact on industry by saying: "Companies have made a significant commitment to managed care and I see a long-term continuation of that commitment." He adds: "The world is going to continue to change, and no one can predict what the result will be. But we have the opportunity to make that change better for us."
<P>
The avalanche of change started inauspiciously, as avalanches do, with the passage of the Health Maintenanace Organization act in 1973, a federal loan and grant program meant to stimulate the formation of health maintenance organizations. It took 10 years to sign up the first 12.5 million HMO members, but by 1988 that number had grown to 32.7 million; by 1993 it was up to 45.2 million (see <A HREF="grfig1.jpg">Figure 1</A>), and topped 51 million in '94. Accompanying this quantitative growth, there was also a qualitative change: the emphasis of managed care shifted from health promotion and disease prevention to cost control.
<P>
According to industry analyst Kenneth Abramowitz, this objective has been met. His data show that HMOs are 30 percent cheaper for the employer buying health insurance—averaging $1,500 per member per year, as against $2,200 per person for traditional indemnity plans. And because employers are continually shopping for the best deal, there is intense competitive pressure. This pressure, Abramowitz says, works its way through the entire healthcare system as the managed care organizations "push the cost pressure onto someone who's smaller than they are"—which is to say onto doctors and hospitals, as well as manufacturers and other suppliers.
<P>
Analyzing this background from her inside-industry vantage point, pharmaceutical executive Charlotte Sibley concludes that the price pressure on prescription pharmaceuticals is not going to let up. "Managed care saves employers money," she points out, "and employers are becoming an ever bigger piece in healthcare." And no wonder. The Ford Motor Company, to cite a single example, reports that its healthcare costs rose from $552 million in 1980 to $1.5 billion in 1995.
<P>
Adding to the pressure on managed care organizations, according to Sibley, is their struggle to retain members, who also tend to shop around. "But you don't change when you're sick," Sibley explains. "You change when you're well. So over time, HMOs tend to get stuck with a lot of the sicker, hence more expensive patients" (also see <A HREF="grbox1.html">Pointers for Industry</A>).
<P>

<H3>Bigger may not be better, but— </H3>
Sibley sees the wave of mergers in all segments of healthcare, including the pharmaceutical industry, as a direct result of these intense pressures. In the managed care field, for example, "the Harvard Community Health Plan in Boston, with almost 600,000 members, merged with Pilgrim Health Care Plan, which was about half the size. They were looking for increased customer membership, greater physician membership—for greater market clout."
<P>
The same trend is taking place in the insurance business, Abramowitz says. "In the past year, HMOs have bought three of the top ten health insurance businesses from insurance companies," and two of the giants in the business—Cigna and Aetna—have consolidated by invading the managed care field. "It is no longer appropriate to view them as health insurance companies," he says. "They're managed care companies." And what do you do when your opponents get bigger? You look for allies yourself, which is why, he explains, the HMOs' ability to "transfer their pressure downstream to doctors and hospitals is being challenged by consolidation in those groups."
<P>
Belford sees a more hopeful angle in this trend to consolidation. He believes that as HMOs get bigger and more powerful they also get "better and smarter. I really believe that our managed care partners increasingly recognize that cost can't be the sole criterion. They embrace value-added programs, recognizing that there is a great deal industry can do to help them communicate with both their physicians and their members, and to develop wellness programs that provide patient education, promote compliance, and enlist not only family support but the support of appropriate community agencies such as school authorities. Patients will do better and physicians will love it. It looks to me like a win-win situation."
<P>
Dougherty concurs. "There is a great opportunity for industry and managed care organizations to work together in the area of continuing medical education," he believes. He cites as an example the recent PRIMED conference in New England, which was co-sponsered by eight MCOs and Medical Economics, with the support of pharmaceutical and device companies. Significantly, Dougherty adds, the conference dealt only 60 percent with clinical issues and 40 percent with healthcare management, and he predicts that "there will be more such partnerships in the future, including conferences on the expanding applications in medical informatics and information technology."
<P>

<H3>More stick than carrot</H3>
What everyone is waiting for now is the impact of the [recent/widely expected] Congressional revision of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, intended to shift large numbers of beneficiaries into managed care plans.
<P>
"That's going to provide a very good money stream for the HMOs," Raj Singh predicts. And the Formedic vice president says he doesn't think we will have to wait long for it to happen. "The Ôyoung elderly' entitled to Medicare—say, those 65 to about 72—who don't have big bills to pay will shift voluntarily. They will see it as a way to save money. Those somewhat older who are running up big bills won't do it voluntarily. They'll have to be pushed."
<P>
But he is convinced that pushed they will be.
<P>
"The whole point of the legislation is to save money. The Republican leadership keeps insisting that people will continue to be able to continue fee-for-service care, but they are likely to be faced with such huge surcharges that they won't be able to afford it." What's more, if, as expected, physicians' fees are drastically cut, there may be a shortage of doctors willing to treat Medicare patients. In any case, will the managed care savings be real? Singh has his doubts, pointing to the HMO experience in such states as Minnesota and Massachussetts, where "they seem to be having trouble achieving the savings they promised. And since I don't see fee-for-service coming back, the basic system will have to change."
<P>
The most likely change, Singh believes, is that there will be restrictions on Medicare patients' ability to see specialists. "That's the biggest stumbling block to keeping costs under control. So far, many HMOs have been willing to compromise on this issue in order to get people to join. With Medicare patients, however, they won't be so tolerant, so I see the development of two levels of treatment—one for the elderly and one for all others. HMOs will restrict service to the elderly. They've got to. And physicians will get very subtle but firm pressure to enforce this dual strategy. I see the general level of care for the elderly—including pharmaceutical care—going down. Congress may protest all it wants that quality of care won't be affected, but there is no other way to achieve the savings they project. They just ducked the issue by fixing things so that HMOs will be the bad guys. We may well see a political agenda war: seniors vs. taxpayers."
<P>

<H3>Doctors regain clout</H3>
Holubiak points to another legislative initiative as having a major impact on managed care: Congressional action that exempts medical groups from some of the financial requirements for traditional MCOs. "That means that such medical groups will form pretty quickly and create their own product lines. I expect that to be the most important development in the next six years. It's already happening under current legislation, especially west of the Mississippi; the new law will spur it even more." As, AMA publishing executive Bob Kennett adds, will the lifting of antitrust restrictions on physician groups.
<P>
Dougherty gives the American Medical Association credit for having done a good job in working with Congress to get these laws revised. "It makes it possible for physicians to compete in this managed care marketplace," he says, adding that doctors "are getting better organized to deal with MCOs, and they're less likely to give up control as they did initially." And that, in turn, once again "makes them a viable target for pharmaceutical promotion."
<P>
Whether they're called integrated healthcare delivery systems or integrated provider networks, what these doctor groups are finding out, Holubiak explains, is that they don't need the middleman called HMO. Once they contract to deliver care at some agreed-upon capitation fee, they're in control. "Of course, then they're also at risk, which is why they need to consolidate. In New Jersey, for example, there's a state-wide group developing. What makes this so significant for the pharmaceutical industry is that these doctor-run groups will have a completely different value system." At first they may not be as sophisticated in controlling costs as HMOs, "But once they recognize that every extra dollar spent on drugs—or on anything else—comes right out of their pocket, their kneejerk reaction is going to be pretty severe and they're going to take on the HMO view. But at least they will show more sophistication as to the importance of pharmaceutical care as a cost-effective component of healthcare."
<P>

<H3>How will the HMOs respond?</H3>
"They're certainly not going to disappear overnight," Holubiak replies, "but I think they are going to change their business practices to the point where the providers are more part of the decision-making process. Either way, the physician will be a lot more important. That's an immutable, unstoppable change."
And a good change, he thinks, as far as industry is concerned. "Cost benefit analysis and disease management will take on new meaning. The traditional HMO has a pharmacy department that has to live within a budget, so it's very difficult to introduce more expensive new products. With a more sophisticated audience, it should be easier to show that your product will have a positive impact on total healthcare costs in the long run." Echoing Sibley's comment, he points out that the data on managed care membership turnover are generated by younger, healthier patients; that sick patients tend to stay put—and run up costs. Doctors running health plans, he believes, will be easier to persuade to emphasize preventive care than the typical HMO manager.
<P>
Sibley, in addition to her corporate responsibilities, also sees the need for forming provider alliances from another perspective.
<P>
"I sit on the executive board of a hospital," she told MM&M, "and we often discuss the need for forward and backward integration. Our hospital has a long-term care facility, so we can provide not only acute care but also rehabilitation services and subacute care. If you don't have that kind of integration, you lose the patient."
<P>
A further step in integration (see Figure 2, <A HREF="grfig2.jpg">"The Evolution of the Healthcare Market</A>," one piece to be able to offer employers a complete managed care package—the insurance piece. Then you can replace the HMO. That may make life marginally easier for the industry," she predicts, "if—as I expect—the family practitioner comes back to be much more important. It's also going to force us to expand our horizons and pay more attention to prevention and wellness."
<P>
But the follow-up question—will clinical decision-making become more rational in a doctor-dominated system—she answers with a rhetorical question of her own: "Is medical practice rational now?" In fact, she speculates, if a patient with elevated cholesterol levels is treated with diet and exercise before a hypocholesterolemic agent is prescribed, a more rational system may not be a total boon for drug manufacturers—unless, as she hopes, we broaden our horizons to take a more comprehensive view of our mission.
<P>

<H3>He who pays the piper</H3>
While not disagreeing with these analyses, Dougherty warns us not to overlook another source of pressure toward physician empowerment.
<P>
"Take Minnesota as an example," he explains. "There we're going almost full circle. First, there were some 30 to 40 HMOs. The employers found that hard to deal with, so they formed a coalition which pushed that number down to nine for the state and only three in the Twin Cities. But then the employers perceived that there was less competition on the part of HMOs as a result of this consolidation regarding both price and service. So the employers went directly to the physician groups and said, ÔWe'd like to contract directly with you and cut out the HMO middleman.' It wasn't the doctors driving this movement. It was the employers."
<P>
The point stressed by Dougherty is that the employers are paying the piper, and that no matter what other trends are influencing managed care delivery, it's they who will have the last word. "Watch Minnesota," is the advice he offers.
<P>

<H3>Chicken Little was wrong</H3>
Industry's biggest fear when HMOs first proliferated was that they would establish closed formularies that would exclude all but two or maybe three products in any category.
<P>
It hasn't happened, and all our panel experts agree that it isn't about to. Contributing editor Milton Liebman cites IMS data that shows that of the 564 health maintenanace organizations today, only 104, or 18 percent, have closed formularies. Robert Kennett concurs, recalling that it was widely assumed that managed care would deprive doctors of control of their prescription pads. "The fact of the matter," he concedes, "is that it has happened—to some degree. Mostly what you have in the managed care setting are guidelines, but they're not so restrictive as to eliminate choice. The reason is that physicians became vocal and said, ÔIf you restrict our choices too much, that will have a negative impact on outcomes.'" To which Sibley adds: "The individual physician is still out there, and he's not going to go away."
<P>
Nevertheless, she points out, "If you're number three or four in the market, it certainly makes life more difficult." Singh agrees but predicts that HMOs will have a decreasing voice in controlling prescriptions. "They haven't shown a great propensity for enforcing formularies," he points out, and in any case, "Pharmaceutical companies have been fairly successful in neutralizing formularies by bundling their products. Physician resistance is also a factor, though it's a mixed bag. Some doctors go along with whatever the HMO says; others—and I'd say the split is roughly 50/50—are quite strong in their views." To which Dougherty adds the employer element. "Employers don't want to be in the position of saying, `Use this beta blocker and not another.'"
<P>
A key point to Singh's mind is that drugs are not enough of a managed care cost factor to make it worthwhile for MCOs to enforce a discipline that has such a high potential for causing disaffection in the two groups on whose loyalty they depend for long-term success: patients and physicians. Which doesn't mean, of course, that manufacturers can price ad lib; but neither are they helpless in the face of the managed care juggernaut.
<P>
Larrry Belford wants it understood that it wasn't just a case of the industry getting lucky. "Pharmaceutical companies are getting smarter," he contends, "and is in posession of better data. As a result we can fine-tune our direction so that we can negotiate mutually beneficial contracts that take into consideration not only price but long-term relationships and value-added programs.
<P>
"Also, keep in mind that we share a common goal: to benefit the patient. That means that HMOs recognize that they have an obligation to make the best available medication available to their members. That means to me that new products will continue to drive this business, regardless of the environment, and that research-based companies will continue to do well."
<P>

<H3>Promotion still prevails</H3>
"And that in turn explains," Liebman adds, "why there is still plenty of room to reap rewards through promotional and educational programs."
<P>
He cites data to prove his point. "The outpatient pescription market in 1994 was an estimated $50.3 billion, of which only three percent was accounted for by restrictive staff model HMOs. Clinics and mail order pharmacies were responsible for 14 percent, but the remaining 83 percent of prescriptions were filled in retail pharmacies, paid for by third parties (38 percent), Medicaid (11 percent), or in cash (35 percent). That means that more than 70 percent of the retail outpatient dollar is spent with few or no restrictions on prescribing."
<P>
Dougherty agrees. "The physician should still be the decision-maker for the individual patient, and we should be arming that physician with the best possible information we can. We may have moved away from that central focus of our mission in the last few years, but I see the pendulum swinging back."
<P>
Applying the image of the pendulum to sales management, he recalls that in the 1980s many companies let their salesforces get bloated, only to cut them drastically ten years later. Now, he hopes, we will reach an equilibrium that accurately reflects our needs.
<P>
The challenge for sales representatives in this environment, says Liebman, is to identify not only which physicians are involved with managed care plans, but to specify the extent to which they are controlled by formularies. Even if they are, that still leaves the task of creating "pull through" for products on the formulary.
<P>
Both Kennett and Dougherty—our two publishing representatives—see the recovery of journal advertising as proof that the awareness of this rationale is becoming widely accepted. Unlike the downtrends in total journal spending the last few years, and what Dougherty describes as "an absolutely dismal" first half of Ô95, Kennett points to an average three or four percent increase in the full year for multispecialty journals, with even specialty journals at least holding their own. Dougherty adds, however, that while the top-tier journals are doing better, many lesser journals are still hurting.
<P>
The rationale for journals, Liebman maintains, continues to be its role as a low-cost-per-hit medium that can support the sales force or deliver stand-alone messages. "At perhaps 40 cents a hit, messages can emphasize low-cost therapy, ease of administration for better compliance, as well as effectiveness. Such messages will influence physicians even in a managed care environment."
<P>
Nor should educational programs be ignored. One path is through active participation with managed care organizations in disease management programs. To quote Liebman, "Closer relations with MCOs in disease management can achieve benefits for pharmaceutical companies, such as increasing product life, justifying the price of drugs, building a treatment franchise. Promotional and CME [continuing medical education] strategies can be applied to achieve changes in patient and physician behavior that lead to everyone's goal—better prevention and management of disease."
<P>

<H3>More power to the patients</H3>
The need to communicate directly with patients was heavily underlined by Michael Sinapi, who said: "The mystery of healthcare has been cracked wide open. We are learning more about how to take care of ourselves," he said, but stressed that he was not referring only to self-care. "As a result we also want a bigger voice in determining what we get, how we get it, when we get it, and what we're willing to pay for it."
<P>
The way consumers will exercise their power is twofold.
<P>
"They will appeal to their local governments, because that's an easier way to affect change than working on the federal level. It's easier to get through to local politicians and decision makers. The result will be to exacerbate the regionalization of healthcare delivery.
<P>
"The other approach is to appeal to the sources of healthcare. Patients who have previously gone directly to a specialist will now be asked whether they have clearance from their gatekeeper doctor and the reaction is going to be, ÔHey, I don't like that.' So they'll complain to the their employer's benefits managers. Add to that the people shifted to managed care from Medicare who suddenly find they can no longer get everything they want, and you see why consumers will be major healthcare players.
<P>
"In the 80s and early 90s," Sinapi sums up, "the healthcare debate was primarily at the government and industry level, with the citizenry being swept along. I think citizens are going to be much more of a voice in what they accept, and they're not going to judge medical care on the basis of economic efficiency alone. Sure, they don't want their costs to rise, but they'll also demand quality. As a final result, I see the potential for a tremendous squeeze on HMOs."
<P>
As consumers become more sophisticated and more involved in decision-making, Sinapi believes, they may also be willing to pay extra for innovative and advanced drug treatment, "however, if the prescription is for a me-too, the answer will be no. The industry recognizes the powerful influence patients can have. This is why the industry is driving so hard with direct-to-consumer [DTC] advertising. We have a bright citizenry and we have left them out of the equation far too long."
<P>
But DTC communication would not be limited to advertising, says Dougherty, pointing to the growing number of newsletters being distributed to patients. "I see DTC promotion of all kinds increasing," he goes on, predicting that FDA will ease up on the brief summary requirements for patient communication. "And that will break down the barriers to television," he points out. However, this trend will not be entirely positive. "I'm afraid that this is going to be the cutthroat end of our business." Two other cautions: that as the DTC advertising of antihistamines has shown, it's possible to spend a bundle without greatly advancing the brand, and that some managed care organizations will oppose the key objective of much of DTC advertising—to drive patients to see their doctors.
<P>
Kennett not only agrees with the importance of reaching consumers, but says the AMA is cooperating with several drug companies in developing patient information (see <A HREF="grfig3.jpg">Figure 3</A>). "In addition, the AMA is putting consumer information on the Internet," he says. "And we are testing patient publications. We think that these efforts are critically important, because we believe that the future of healthcare is ultimately going to be determined by the consumer."
<P>
Sibley comes to a similar conclusion from a slightly different premise.
<P>
"The American system is built on choice," she points out, "and Americans don't like to be told they have less choice, and so they may resist." But ultimately, in the clash of interests, she agrees with Dougherty that the winners are likely to be the employers. "For many companies, healthcare is the fastest growing item in their budgets, so even though patients will have more clout and integrated health delivery services will shift power to providers, employers will have the last word."
<P>

<H3>Stand by for further realignments</H3>
Reflecting on the implications for medical marketers of all the realignments and power shifts in managed care, Sibley sums up: "The sky is the limit for permutations and combinations. Why wouldn't Ford, General Motors, or Chrysler get together and buy United Health Care? Why wouldn't a pharmaceutical company buy an HMO? Some of them bought PBMs [pharmacy benefit management companies], but that was a short-term solution. Long term we face much bigger problems. We'll have to do what the consumer industry has been doing for decades, which is micromarketing, targeting, regionalization—all the things that are the mainstay of consumer promotion. We need to be more consumer-focused. We have learned that a one-size-fits-all approach to marketing doesn't work. It's more like one size fits one. In the good old days, management in our industry had to make six tough decisions a year. Now they have to make six tough decisions in a day. It's more challenging. But it's also more fun."
<P>
To which Belford adds: "Last year was a very good year for our industry. Just five years ago, people were predicting doom and gloom, and it didn't happen. The reason it didn't happen also gives us good reason for hope in the next five years: the pharmaceutical industry has some very bright people. They have proved to be highly flexible, able to adapt to change very quickly. This ability to adapt to our changing environment will allow us to succeed in the future."

<H2>10 PREDICTIONS<BR>
FOR 1996</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by Carl J. Seiden</I></H4>

<HR>
<HR>

<H3>Executive summary:</H3>
<I>Industry analyst Carl Seiden says that a number of negative factors will cool industry growth. Medicare will hurt, and so will the accelerating growth of generics. Mergers will continue to make the news as companies realize that bigger is better. On the positive side, life with the FDA will get easier.</I>
<P>

<H3>1. The Bottom Line Levels Off</H3>
There has been a very significant rebound in industry earnings since 1993. That year was the pits: overall earnings growth for the industry was only about 6 percent. In 1994, growth increased to about 8 percent, while in 1995 it came in at about 11 percent. In 1996, I expect that this uptrend will stall and that earnings growth will, at best, stay flat. It may even decline.
<P>
One reason is the continued pressure of managed care. (For other comments on the future impact of managed care, see <A HREF="getready.html">"Get Ready for More of Not Quite the Same"</A>) Although the drug industry won the last round, I don't think the managed care players are going to sit on their laurels; they will squeeze back.
<P>
Another negative factor is that last year's improvement was due in large measure to restructuring and laying off of employees, but cutting back can only go so far as a contributor to profit growth. Thirdly, the weakening of the U.S. dollar helped make overseas sales more valuable, and that situation is likely to reverse going into 1996. So, relative to 1993, this is going to be a good year, but relative to the nice improvement we've seen since then, things are not so promising.
<P>

<H3>2. There Will Still Be Winners</H3>
More significant than the outlook for industry overall is to try to separate the winners from the losers, and to do that, I ask a very simple question: show me your products. What's ready for marketing? What's in your pipeline? Companies that have new products with meaningful advantages will do all right, regardless of the pace and power of managed care. The companies that are most vulnerable are those that are dependent on aging blockbusters. For my nominations of some likely winners, see the "<A HREF="tenbox.html">Likely Winners in '96.</A>"
<P>

<H3>3. Medicare Reform Will Hurt</H3>
The devil of Medicare reform is going to be in the details and we don't have all the details yet. But what we can say is that the impact on the pharmaceutical industry could have been much worse. It would have been possible for Congress to mandate that the government would pay only for managed care. Instead, they are creating incentives to move beneficiaries to managed care, but giving them the option of staying with fee-for-service coverage, though at higher cost.
<P>
That is still a negative for the industry. Today, there is no Medicare drug benefit and roughly half of Medicare patients have no such coverage. (The other half get their coverage from some other insurance or benefit plan.) Although those without a drug benefit use pharmaceuticals at a slightly lower rate than those who do, they go to the doctor at the same rate and then pay to have their prescriptions filled out of their own pockets. That means that there's no insurer, no pharmacy management company (PBM), no health maintenance organization (HMO) to negotiate on their behalf.
<P>
Now assume that over time the bulk of the Medicare population gets shifted to managed care. Next, factor in that 35 percent of all pharmaceutical business is generated by this 13 percent of the population. You can readily see why the drug industry is apt to get hurt, standing to lose one of the few remaining segments of the market that is still paying list price in a fee-for-service setting.
<P>

<H3>4. No Letup in Growth of Generics</H3>
These Medicare changes are one of the major drivers behind still more generic prescribing, still more formularies, and an ever-accelerating institutional approach to healthcare. Where the crystal ball gets cloudy is when you try to calculate to what extent the potential growth in unit volume will offset these price pressures once most of the Medicare folks join managed care. Will the 50 percent who now have to pay out of their own pockets be more likely to fill their prescriptions and stay on their therapies? Clearly, that's the hope. At the same time, they'll be under great pressure to switch to generics or other lower-cost alternatives—or even be told they have no choice. There's a lot of money riding on the outcome, especially for manufacturers of me-too products.
<P>

<H3>5. Managed Care No "Holy Grail"</H3>
While cost inflation among HMOs has been lower than in the fee-for-service setting, the jury is still out as to whether managed care can curb the long-term growth of healthcare spending. There's a huge misconception that this is the "Holy Grail" that will solve all our healthcare spending problems by focusing on wellness and fitness and preventive care. There's no question that those things have societal benefit: having people live longer, healthier lives is good. But since some 60 or 70 percent of healthcare spending is incurred in the last few years of life, anything that lets people live longer may actually increase total healthcare spending.
<P>

<H3>6. More Bark Than Bite From Formularies</H3>
I see a continuing trend toward the use of formularies and attempts to enforce them, though this evolution has been slower than I anticipated. In the early nineties, when industry was first waking up to the risks of managed care, every Tom, Dick, and Harry HMO was slapping together formularies and waving them in front of the drug companies. The threat was: "If you want your drug on our formulary, you have to give us a discount."
<P>
Industry was not terribly sophisticated about the heterogeneity of managed care, and companies flinched and gave discounts where in reality none were called for. Later they found out that most formularies are more bark than bite É that many of these HMOs have very little control over how healthcare is provided É and that being on their formularies hasn't helped, and being kept off wouldn't have hurt. By now drug industry executives have become much wiser about how to structure contracts, about the dynamics of HMOs and their ability—or inability—to move market share. This course correction is one of the main reasons why industry has been doing better and why, in fact, it won the last round.
<P>
Nonetheless, HMOs have strong incentives to continue their attempts to enforce formularies and to make their bite more painful, though I expect these efforts to be tempered by countervailing forces. Managed care organizations are engaged in fierce competition to sign up and retain members, and they have found that a broad formulary can offer a competitive advantage. So while some HMOs are getting tougher, in some parts of the country they're actually loosening up a bit.
<P>
Another factor is that the last thing an employee benefits manager wants is to get a call from a staff member saying, "Hey, your health plan stinks. My doctor tells me that I can no longer get the drug I've been depending on for the last five years." So let's not underestimate patient pressure. It's one of the reasons why we're seeing so much direct-to-consumer advertising: to build brand loyalty. When Prozac is a brand name as well known as Kleenex, it's hard for an HMO not to have Prozac on its formulary, even if they do offer other antidepressants just as good or even better.
<P>

<H3>7. Physicians Will Flex Their Muscles</H3>
Formulary enforcement, of course, is only part of the HMOs' need to control doctors' habits. What has far more effect on managed care profitability than prescription patterns is their ability to control referral practices and how long patients are kept in the hospital. But, again, as physicians get squeezed, there's a reaction—maybe not equal but definitely opposite. And one reaction of doctors is to form their own healthcare delivery systems. Doctors, and hospitals, too—having been squeezed to death by HMOs and other payers—are saying: let's join forces so we can command market share, until we get big enough so we can't be pushed around any more.
<P>
I see that trend as a modest plus for the drug industry, since the medical profession is without doubt the constituency with which it has the best relationship. Admittedly, these medical players, too, need to be mindful of the bottom line. They'll survive only if they can deliver cost-effective healthcare. But they have a far better understanding than HMO management types that drugs offer unique value in terms of healthcare. What I see happening is that products that offer such value can be priced at a decent level, while those that have a lot of me-too competitors will get hurt, whether doctors win the race with HMOs or not. The subtle levels of differentiation that drug companies used to be able to feature in promotion will no longer work, so the stakes in new product development just keep getting higher.
<P>

<H3>8. More Mergers Ahead</H3>
Columbia/HCA, the hospital chain which has been on an acquisition binge, has plans to reduce their number of drug vendors from hundreds to dozens. Also, they want to shift the responsibility and cost burden of special packaging such as unit-of-use packaging from their pharmacies to their suppliers. That's just one example of the continuing pressures on pharmaceutical companies, and why they realize, just as hospitals and HMOs do, that the bigger you are the more powerful you are and the more likely you are to be among the survivors.
<P>
That's why, in all phases of healthcare, everybody wants to be the biggest cat in town. It's why HMOs are buying other HMOs, why indemnity insurance companies are getting into managed care, why hospitals are consolidating—and why drug companies will continue to pursue mergers. Even after all the takeovers we have already seen, the number one company still doesn't have more than a 6 or 7 percent market share, and there are still substantial redundancies of cost, especially among scientific and sales staffs. An interesting company to watch will be American Home Products. They have already bought Robbins and American Cyanamid, including Lederle, and I don't think they're finished. Their management has demonstrated that one way to keep the company's earnings growing in the absence of hot new products is to rationalize their cost structure through acquisitions. And they are not alone.
<P>
True, future acquisitions will be expensive, especially as share prices rise. But the industry's cash flow is still great and debt levels are still low, so the fundamentals that make consolidation logical are still in place.
<P>

<H3>9. Mail Order Will Continue to Grow</H3>
Overall, I think that the ability of pharmacy benefit managers to move market share is mixed, and that painting all PBMs with one brush is a huge mistake. But one trend to be aware of is that all the major PBMs are learning that mail distribution is a key element in their ability to make money and to shift market shares.
Merck's Medco has the best mail service operation and CareMark has a big one. DPS (SmithKline Beecham) bought a mail service just in the last year, and PCS (Lilly) just announced a joint venture with the American Association of Retired Persons' mail order operation. The explanation is simple: they recognize that without a mail operation a PBM lacks the most effective way to enforce its formulary. So mail order is an increasingly important part of the puzzle for the medical marketing executive.
<P>

<H3>10. Life With FDA Will Get Easier</H3>
Let's end our '6 projections on a cheerful note. They used to say that the Supreme Court reads the election returns. So does the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
While Congress has not yet passed any of the threatened reform measures, the agency is looking at ways to ease some of its less defensible restrictions on promotion and to revise some of its harshest requirements. As an example, late last year it rescinded the special restrictions on biotech products. But the best news for industry is definitely that the user fee system for new drug applications seems to be working. New Drug Applications are getting through the review process faster, and I see this speedup continuing to improve.
<P>
So let's hope that all my hopeful forecasts turn out to be correct, and that my pessimistic ones are proved wrong.
<P>
But whether I'm right or wrong on the specifics, I feel safe in predicting that the pharmaceutical marketing model will get ever more complex as all these different pressure points proliferate.
<P>
Risky as it is to be an observer of this industry who is asked to make predictions, I think it's no riskier than being a marketing executive in a pharmaceutical company or one of its support services! We're all in for a wild ride

<CENTER>
<H2>The Arcane Art of Discount<BR>
Media Buying</H2>
</CENTER>

<H4><I>by Elaine Gaffney and Milt Liebman</I></H4>

<HR>
<HR>

<H3>Executive summary:</H3>
<I>A decline in advertising, coupled with sharply increased costs, have prompted publications to become more aggressive in pursuing, and keeping, sales revenue. Targeting, discount programs, and rebates are some of the many and varied deals being offered potential advertisers.</I>
<P>
In 1996, published rate cards still rule in medical journal advertising. But the rate structures are coupled with individual publisher discount programs, the number and variety of which boggle the mind and confuse the computer. In addition to the usual frequency discount schedules that reward advertising volume, today's programs provide overall corporate discounts based on annual dollar volume, combination discounts based on buying space for one product in more than one journal, continuity discounts offering dollars off, and freebies for not taking months off the ad schedule.
<P>
Discounts of this nature are not new. But this year, every publisher of multispecialty journals has its own program in an effort to increase the efficiency of space advertising and increase revenues. Identifying and applying the discount programs to best advantage is raising media buying to a new level of arcane art.
<P>
The accompanying chart (see <A HREF="arcfig1.jpg">Table 1</A>) outlines discount programs offered by the top 15 journals, from 10 publishing organizations, ranked by 1995 advertising revenue. It was prepared by the Association of Healthcare Media Directors (AHMD) whose members have to deal with this turn of events. Reviewing the chart and applying the discounts to the journals selected for a given schedule is not an easy task. Basically, using the provisions of the chart, an advertiser may earn perhaps 10 percent off the basic rate schedule which can be applied to additional advertising or, to a publisher's dismay, other promotional efforts.
<P>
"Publishers are getting an opportunity to actively market their programs," in the opinion of Steve Selinger, vice president of the media placement firm Compas, Inc. "Publishers are saying `we're going to give you every opportunity to maximize our attributes.' In so doing, they are actively trying to attract more business."
<P>

<H3>Pressure on publishers</H3>
Journal advertising has long been a major element in promotional programs for pharmaceuticals. The amount of advertising has diminished over the past three years by some 25 percent due to a number of market factors, not the least of which is the rapid growth of managed care organizations (MCOs) in the delivery of medical services. More than three quarters of physicians have some contractual relationship with MCOs, according to the American Medical Association. A segment of these physicians do not have the ease or freedom to prescribe any drug they wish—and that is a turn-off in the eyes of many advertisers.
<P>
Other forms of promotion, such as targeted direct mail and continuing medical education programs, are growing as is direct-to-consumer advertising which now attracts more dollars than journal advertising. Ad revenue in multispecialty journals dropped from a high of $453 million in 1992 to $368 million in 1993, $323 million in 1994, and a projected $330 million last year. The modest recovery in 1995 came late in the year, after a very poor start, due largely to release of new drugs by FDA.
<P>
At the same time, publishers face sharply rising expenses in two major cost areas—postage and paper. In 1995, postage increased 13.9 percent, and for medical journals (as well as other small circulation magazines) there is the threat of another 17 percent—if not greater—rise this year through possible implementation of a U.S. Postal Service reorganization plan. The list price of low-weight, coated, production-grade paper zoomed close to 60 percent in less than two years. In response, journal publishers increased space rates an estimated 6 to 8 percent for 1996 prior to initiating their discount programs.
<P>

<H3>Promoting aggressively</H3>
Given the market conditions, medical journal publishers are becoming more aggressive promoters of the benefits of their own medium. They are focusing on the interests of drug and device companies. Publishers point to the many studies that show how print advertising works to increase new prescription volume and return on investment. For example, Marshall Paul of Healthcare Communications Inc. (HCI) reported on an analysis of 20 product promotion campaigns from 11 companies, at a recent meeting of the Association of Medical Publications (AMP) (see "Newswire," MEDICAL MARKETING & MEDIA, December 1995, p. 6). The study showed that print advertising, of which 90 percent is journal advertising, increases market share and brings a significant return on promotional investment. He reported that print advertising and detailing combined brought a return on promotional investment of $3.27 for every dollar spent. A typical physician exposure via print costs 50 cents while exposure from a primary detail costs 80 dollars. The combination provides the best cost-effective use of promotion dollars, he said.
<P>

<H3>Targeting to individual physicians</H3>
The medium now uses new technology to reach almost any identifiable physician target audience. Ink-jet printing and selective binding have given journals—a mass circulation medium—the ability to direct a specific ad within an issue to physicians selected by age, specialty, prescribing behavior, type of practice, and any other criteria when the recipient can be identified by a medical information number. The selected physicians receive the ad which then drops out of issues sent to the balance of the circulation.
<P>
Selected lists, provided to journals on computer tape, can be used by many advertisers within an issue. Suzanne Johnson, advertising production director of Postgraduate Medicine, used matched name tapes from 17 companies in 1995, with 8 to 10 in any given issue. Further, physicians are targeted by specialty, geographic region, and other criteria. This mix and match of ads to physicians have resulted in as may as 3000+ editions of a given issue. Postgraduate Medicine averaged 1475 editions over the first 11 issues of the year, with the smallest number (November) having 256.
<P>
In addition, publishers are honing circulation to the most productive audiences and working with advertisers on value-added programs.
<P>

<H3>Best journals, lowest cost</H3>
Journals have become more highly competitive by offering the new dollars-off programs to the pharmaceutical industry. "It is all very logical considering what is happening at drug corporations," said Robert Girondi, executive vice president of HCI. "The rules are consolidation, downsizing, and saving as much money as possible." The fear is justified. Financial pressures on publishers have resulted in the closing of 8 journals in 1994-5 (see <A HREF="arcfig2.jpg">Table 2</A>).
<P>
The variety and complexity of the media deals greatly increase the difficulty of developing a media schedule with the most desirable journals at the lowest cost, according to media directors. Referring to HCI's media service operation, Girondi says "we try to work all of these discounts into our (computer) system—just about everything, if they can be universally applied." Discounts involving partial price rebates, protected rates, and what-if deductions will have to be done by hand.
<P>

<H3>Gathering info</H3>
The media director organization AHMD gathers current information and develops a total media report for its members, updated as much as possible. One of the reasons for founding the organization is to further understanding in the industry of the techniques, strategies, and business of media planning and buying. This year, the organization has its work cut out for it.
<P>
Many media directors feel that elements in the journals' programs such as annual corporate discounts, continuity rebates, and other factors cannot be taken into consideration when preparing a media schedule because of frequent changes that occur during a year. Stacy McHugh, media director of C&G (Ciba Geigy) Advertising, predicts that journal schedules will be developed first, and discounts considered afterward. Publications will be entered in a computer media analysis model all at the same frequency rate, with the journal selections based on circulation, readership, prescribing and cost factors. Analysis of further discount possibilities, journal by journal, would be done with a sharp pencil and mind.
<P>

<H3>Buying a discount?</H3>
"Will a journal be selected because of its attributes, or because it costs less money?" one media director asked. "Clients will want to know if I'm taking advantage of discounts," she said. "If the buy is only right because it is a discount, then I'm spending money to buy a discount." Generally, the feeling was expressed that a journal that offers a discount would not be selected for a schedule if it could not end up there without one. 
<P>	
In a case of the rich getting richer, the top journals are increasing their share of market (see <A HREF="arcfig3.jpg">Table 3</A>). Journal publishers are convinced that their discount programs give advertisers a better deal. The hope is that advertising budgets will expand to take advantage of
more efficient promotional buys, and that the top publications will carry along companion journals to increase overall revenues.
<P>

<BODY>

<CENTER><H1>How Athena Neurosciences is Funding its R&D Without Mortgaging its Future</H1></CENTER>

<HR size=4>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>A research-based company had to build a sales and marketing organization at minimal risk and cost. A three-part strategy was devised to generate both revenues and a track record by marketing branded generics and licensing immediately marketable products.</I><P>

<HR size=4><P>

While everyone's attention is focused on megamergers and megamarketers, there is a 
countervailing phenomenon: the success of smaller companies in finding protected niches for their products. This is the first of three interviews with marketing executives of such companies. This month Medical Marketing & Media speaks with Mike Coffee of Athena Neurosciences, Inc. Ahead in this series: first-hand reports on Roberts Pharmaceutical and Bock Pharmacal companies.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Let's start with a general question: is there something particular about today's healthcare market that provides an opportunity for niche marketing strategies such as those of Athena Neurosciences?</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: With continuing consolidation within the healthcare industry and large companies getting even larger, the hurdles they need to clear to make products pay off keep getting higher and higher. That applies both to mature products and, even more so, to new products in development. This situation provides opportunities for Athena and other niche marketers. Today it's hard to imagine that a major pharmaceutical company is going to be able to spend the time and energy necessary to create growth in a $10-30-million dollar product, while it may make sense for a small- or medium-sized company.<BR>
There's a second reason why there are opportunities for niche marketers. Large companies are finding it less and less fruitful to promote solely to specialty markets, yet there are a number of important products for which the target audiences are rather small. It's sound strategy for small and mid-size companies to look strategically at such products, because you can frequently promote to specialists without the tremendous expenditure it would take to market to primary care. That's why Athena's focus on neurology makes economic sense. Another example is ophthalmology. Allergan and Alcon were among the originators of this strategy, and they have done it very successfully. In today's environment such a strategy may make even more sense.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: How do you go about finding products that fit within your strategy?</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>:You might think that there would be a wealth of opportunities, but you also need to apply some discipline. You need to ask how you are going to bring value to a product that the current marketer can't, and how does the prospective product leverage the assets in your organization. If you have developed a presence with a particular specialty or in a particular area, then the incremental costs of developing additional products in that area may make sense. Our sales representatives, for example, call exclusively on neurologists, so we focus only on the development of neurology products <A HREF="nichtab1.gif">(see Table 1.)</A>. After you have done this strategic analysis, of course, you need to explore whether you can negotiate an agreement that permits you to market successfully and make a profit.<BR>
That is the logic we applied to the acquisition of Permax (pergolide mesylate) from Eli Lilly and Company. We were founded as a research-based company for the specific purpose of studying the pathology of Alzheimer's disease, and ultimately developing diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimer's. It was clear from the beginning that this search would take many years, ten or more to a new product approval.<BR>
which meant getting products to market quickly. To deal with this, we created an accelerated commercialization strategy. The value of this strategy is that it is accomplishing its financial objective without detracting from time and attention on Athena's important discovery research programs.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: How do small companies bridge this gap?</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: Traditionally, there are several ways to do that. You either license out your technology or you develop your own marketing infrastructure and burn a lot of cash waiting for the product to be approved. Either way you are apt to lose control, either to your licensees or to your backers.<BR>
We developed an alternate way: to acquire immediately marketable products to generate revenue so as to make the company at least cash neutral, and hopefully to contribute enough resources to the organization so that we would be able to commercialize the fruits of our discoveries without giving up control.<BR>
Now, that strategy is not without risk, either, but you can lower the risk by acquiring products where there is a marketing track record but still opportunity for growth. We saw this strategy as an attractive opportunity, and it's worked out very well.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: Your record with Permax certainly proves that. Tell us some of the details of how you achieved your success.</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: Our primary criterion, obviously, was to find products we could sell to neurologists, since that was the specialty we knew we would be concentrating on once we were ready to market products from our own research. We analyzed audit data to identify products that neurologists not only prescribed but influenced other physicians to use as well.<BR>
The next criterion was to find a product that we could market more efficiently by using such a strict specialty focus. Permax was a natural candidate. We approached Lilly early on, but at the time we had no salesforce, no marketing organization — we were what you might call a “virtual company.” So Lilly understandably said, well, while admittedly we're not doing a great job with Permax in the U.S., still this is a product of our research laboratories and it's an important product for us internationally, so we're not likely to give it to somebody with no track record.<BR>
So we set about our Athena line of branded generics. With that strategy we could meet three objectives:
<OL><LI>to establish a track record;
<LI>to create a marketing structure and build a sales force; and most importantly,
<LI>to generate sales of several millions of dollars.</OL><P>
After about a year and a half, we went back to Lilly and this time they said, yes, you're for real.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: How did you do all that in just 18 months?</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: We built a sales force of 24 representatives and had each rep call on at least five neurologists a day. At the same time, we selected multiple source products that were widely prescribed by neurologists, but about which they had concerns not knowing which generic their patients would get from one prescription to the next. Even minor variations in blood levels can be critical in the case of neurology products, so we set up a mail order service which we called Athena Rx Home Pharmacy. That enabled us to offer doctors the assurance of consistency, plus the price advantage of generics. Furthermore, we made sure Athena Rx Home Pharmacy would be able to provide all prescription products in addition to our own Athena products.<BR>
Here is how it works.<BR>
When a generic prescription is filled in a retail pharmacy, the patient may receive a product manufactured by different companies with each refill. But when the doctor specifies an Athena brand and recommends the patient have it filled by our home pharmacy, we can give the assurance of consistency from refill to refill. The home pharmacy also solved the distribution “Catch-22” of launching a new line of multiple-source products — how you can secure distribution when you have no sales, and how you can generate sales when you have no distribution.<BR>
There was still a third advantage to our home pharmacy service that intrigued physicians. Specialists, unlike family practitioners, frequently treat patients who do not fill their prescriptions in the “local” pharmacy, so the doctors never get any feedback. They don't know whether the patients actually got the prescription filled and, if they did, whether it was refilled. We are able to provide such feedback. When a patient uses our pharmacy service, we can provide the doctor with a report on the refill status.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: How did you go about getting your generics manufactured, and how did you price them?</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: We signed supply agreements with first-class manufacturers. As for pricing, we positioned them to be very competitive while at the same time allowing us to support the services we were providing neurologists and their patients.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: When you developed this strategy, were you aware of any other company that was doing anything similar?</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: Not at the time, no. In fact, I'm still not aware of anyone else doing it. We saw an opportunity to link the pharmacist, the physician, and the patient in a way that really hadn't been done before. It made special sense in selling to neurologists. In many cases, their patients are over 65 and don't have prescription coverage. Take, for example, Parkinson's disease. Patients will frequently spend between $2,000 and $4,000 a year on medications for which they don't get reimbursed, so neurologists are very cost-conscious and looking for ways to save the patient money without compromising quality. We offered physicians a unique opportunity to do both.<BR>
And it's worked for us. Keep in mind that at the time we were a brand new company with a brand new concept and brand new representatives — the only thing that wasn't brand new were our products. And, again, we were a small company, so we had limited funds and we did not want to steal resources from our research and development programs. Everything we did was planned to generate revenues quickly without a lot of expenditures and without risking loss of control of either our company or our products.<BR>
Essentially, my charge was to build a sales and marketing organization at minimal risk to the company. So we devised this three-step strategy: to generate both revenues and a track record by marketing branded generics … which would enable us to acquire exclusive ready-to-market products … which ultimately would enable us to launch the products of our own research.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: And you're now at stage two.</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: Right. After 18 months, we had recruited 7,000 patients for Athena Home Pharmacy and achieved a 70 percent recognition factor among neurologists. Now, by the way, we're up to 16,000 patients and revenues of some $8 million. <A HREF="nichfig1.jpg">(See Figure 1.)</A>. Obviously, the highlight of our development was in 1993 when Lilly said, OK — you're there. We will let you acquire Permax. At the time, Permax had about 15 percent of the market in the field of dopamine agonist prescriptions for Parkinson's disease. It did about $9 million in 1992; we took it on in mid-1993 and it grew to $12 million that year and to $18 million in 1994. This year [1995] it will do over $27 million … and it's not slowing down. <A HREF="nichfig2.jpg">(See Figure 2,)</A><BR>
Since many neurology products are for the treatment of chronic disorders, they continue to create loyalty and have enduring value. That has allowed us to build a really strong organization. Our 1995 sales revenues are projected at close to $44 million and we now have a sales force of 48.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: Are you looking for other products you can in-license?</I>

<B>Coffee</B>: Yes we are and we will continue to concentrate on neurology. We still see plenty of growth opportunities with this specialty. For instance, in 1994 we acquired Genica Pharmaceuticals, a leading neurodiagnostics reference laboratory, which now operates as our Athena Diagnostics division. We see additional near stage product opportunities in Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease. And in addition we have now submitted two NDA's to the FDA for their approval.<BR>
We are also looking at the market for neurology products among non-specialists, and are exploring several strategies, such as forming partnerships with other companies that would promote our products to non-neurologists. Additionally, we are looking at some drugs for rare neurological diseases, as well as exclusive distribution of other companies' niche products through Athena Rx Home Pharmacy.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: Have you considered using your sales force to co-promote products?</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: We have considered them and I expect we will continue to do so. In certain circumstances, such as being part of a broader collaboration with another company, we might consider one. Athena has had the opportunity to do several co-promotions but we turned them down because they would tie up precious sales force time but have little enduring value. All things considered, we would prefer a product acquisition where we get a better share of the long term value we create.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: A final question: how do you see the continued growth of managed care affecting your business?</I><P>

<B>Coffee</B>: In the case of Permax, we were able to work with neurology consultants who work for managed care organizations to demonstrate that the inclusion of our Permax therapeutic program is cost-effective. When we took the product over, it was listed on only one managed care formulary; today, Permax is on virtually every formulary and has actually become the preferred dopamine agonist on many formularies.<BR>
Also, we commissioned a study to find out where the neurology specialty is going. Was it going to shrink, like many other specialties are forecasted to? The study showed that while there will be a trend toward greater aggregation of neurologists into larger group practices over the next five years, the role of the specialty will remain relatively unchanged in that patients with neurological problems will continue to be referred. Perhaps a higher percentage of these patients will then go back to their primary care physicians, but that just reinforces the importance of the neurologist's influence for our products.<P>

<I><B>MM&M</B>: You have made that amply evident and we thank you for your detailed explanation of how your niche marketing strategies work.</I><P>

<CENTER><H1>IS IT TIME TO GET WIRED TO THE WORLD WIDE WEB ?</H1></CENTER><HR size=4>

<H3>Executive summary:</H3>


<I>From news and information to on-line shopping, suddenly everything and everyone 
is “on the net.” The net is hot, but is it for you? In this first of a series, we'll cover the basics, including how it works, and how to get started.</I>
<P>
<HR size=4>
<P>
 
Within the last year or so, the Internet has emerged from being a haven for “techies” to become a burgeoning area of communication and commerce. An incredible array of companies are recognizing its ability to reach millions of people 24-hours-a-day at a very low cost, and have leapt onboard the Internet bandwagon with information, ads, catalogs, and a host of other vehicles. Because it's new and evolving daily, those wishing to employ it can't draw on the years of experience and formal research available for journals and other media. The lessons are still being learned in terms of what works, and how to get the most from this new vehicle. This first of a multi-part series on the Internet will cover the basics in plain language for those not already caught up in it — what it is, how it works, how to get on line, what's known so far. In installments to come, we'll review alternative ways to use it, and profile the experiences, and failures, to date.<P>

<H4>First, just what is the Internet?</H4>

A simple analogy is that it's a world-wide phone network, but instead of linking people by telephones, telephone numbers, and spoken messages, it links computers with “addresses” and transfers files containing text and images. In the same way that domestic calls are routed through different domestic phone systems (AT&T, MCI, Sprint, etc.) and overseas calls through international carriers, the Internet links many different “networks” and systems, such as America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, etc. These latter companies provide not only their own network, but a complete range of services, information, on-line publications, etc. They also provide access to a larger, non-proprietary segment of the Internet called the “World Wide Web.”<P>

To connect to the Internet, you need a computer (PC or Mac), a modem, and a method of access. This latter can be one of the major suppliers with its own range of services and information, or alternative packages and services that provide access to all or part of the Internet. In general, connecting to the Internet involves a call to a local access point or “gateway,” so that telephone charges are minimal. The costs of linking you to the Internet are covered by each supplier with a monthly and/or hourly charge, and in some cases premium charges to utilize certain services.<P>

When you dial into the Internet from your computer, you generally enter a unique user name which identifies you to the network, then confirm with a private password that protects your account from being used by others at your expense. This combination also gives you a unique “e-mail” address that allows people to send messages to you. The address consists of your username, the “@” symbol, and the name of the network you are located on. For example “xxxx@aol.com” would be the e-mail address of someone with the username “xxxx” on America Online.<P>

As part of the connection process to the Internet, your computer transmits a request to the system you're on to transmit or “download” its “home page.” As with all “pages” this is simply a disk file, just like a word processing disk file. Generally the home page identifies the service and contains graphics and a menu providing options for accessing other information. Once the home page has been downloaded to you, it resides on your PC, allowing you to review it at your convenience.<P>

At this juncture, you can access other computer sites and receive their home pages by entering their “address.” For example, if you wish to reach our Internet site to catch up on daily news, you could enter our address, <B>http://www.cpsnet.com.</B> This string of jargon actually is fairly simple to decipher: “http” states how data is transmitted, “www” means it's on the World Wide Web, cpsnet.com is the “address” of our computer, the “.com” simply meaning that we're a commercial site. When you enter the command to access cpsnet.com, your access provider looks up the address and routes your query to our computer, which responds by transmitting our home page, or menu of options, to you.<P>

Another way of traveling from item to item is via “links” in pages that you have downloaded. These are easily identified by the fact that they are underlined, and generally in color. When you put your mouse cursor on a link and “click,” it transmits the address of the page you are requesting, just the same as if you had typed it in. The link can be to information on the site you are currently accessing, or another one anywhere in the world — it takes no longer to connect to a system in India and download a page as one in Canada, or the U.S., or in the building next door.<P>

<H4>What you see is not always the same</H4>

The files that are downloaded to your computer via the Internet are interpreted by the software package you are using, generally referred to as a “browser.” Given that all of them are not the same, different people will see these pages differently. It's sort of akin to having three different television sets, one black-and-white, one color, and one color & stereo. All of them receive the same signal, but produce three totally different results. In the case of browsers, some cannot display backgrounds, so everything floats on a grey field, even if the page downloaded has a background of color with ghosted logos in it. Similarly, some browsers display images in specific parts of the page where they have been coded to be, others shift all to the left. The “standard” for browers is Netscape, and most people design web pages to its capabilities. While most browsers are being upgraded to meet these standards, not all do, so if you don't see the gorgeous graphics on a home page that your neighbor does, the reason is probably your browser.<P>

<H4>So what can the Internet do for you?</H4>

While it's difficult to get accurate figures, it's estimated that 30-50 million people currently use the Internet. While this number is tremendous, your interest is within the medical field, not “techies” and the like. According to BMI American Medical Information, Inc., roughly 110,000 physicians owned PCs with modems as of 1994, so were candidates for Internet access. That figure was more than double the number that had them in 1992, so the number is growing rapidly. As mentioned, all of these are potential Internet visitors, who no doubt look for professional information as well as news and entertainment. In addition to MDs, estimates for other areas of healthcare show both a high degree of usage and an increasing trend toward utilization of the Internet. Most medical schools have access to the net, so tomorrow's physicians will be even more prone to making use of it to find information on techniques, procedures, and new products.<P>

The Internet provides several advantages as a medium to communicate with health care professionals:
<UL>
<LI>It can communicate text, graphics, sound, and animation
<LI>It's interactive, so can offer instruction, multiple paths of information, and the ability to send e-mail from within pages to ask for information, or order products
<LI>It's available 24 hours-a-day, from any location with a telephone
<LI>Information on it may be stored and printed out for reference
<LI>It's relatively inexpensive to create a web presence, and the cost for users to access it is extremely low</UL><P>

While the advantages are both numerous and attractive, being on the web doesn't mean you'll get attention and response. Just because you have a web site doesn't mean that people will find it. To be successful, you have to inform those you want to access your site that it exists, what it offers, and what its address is. This means not only listing the site with the many “search engines” that people use to find sites devoted to a particular topic, but actively promoting via other media — print, electronic, etc. For example, CPS Communications' site for its Caribbean publishing division began running full-page ads for the site in millions of copies of travel magazines and tourist guides in December. In the three months prior to the campaign the site was accessed or “hit” roughly 40,000 times. Since the ad campaign began in December, there have been over 200,000 hits on the various pages on islands, hotels, etc.<P>

<H4>Advertising options on the web</H4>

This might appear to be a daunting task, that will immerse you in techno-babble, but it's really quite simple. Your first, and perhaps simplest, option is to purchase an ad in one of the medical sites already operating — we'll cover these in a future installment. This is a fairly simple matter of contacting the vendor and providing the ad. Many of the vendors can create your Internet ad for you, including video, animation, and sound. Alternatively, your ad agency may offer these capabilities, and there are many companies that provide these services. We'll also provide information on these in coming issues.<P>

The next step up from purchasing advertising is creation of your own home page and running it on an 
existing service. Now you have a unique site, e.g. Placebo.com, but are not saddled with operating hardware and communications lines. For this you'll need an Internet Service Provider (ISP) who can register your name, create your home page and other pages, and provide the computer and phone link to the Internet. Again, we'll be going in to this in more detail in a future installment, and giving information on ISPs.<P>

Finally, you can create and operate your own site. This means buying and operating a “server” and purchasing a link to the Internet. The server will need to be a fast PC, Mac, or similar computer. While a fast processor and adequate RAM is important, as what you are providing is disk files, the most crucial element is a fast, large disk or disk array that can store a lot of information and transmit it quickly. Your link to the Internet can range from a dedicated line that transmits information at 56,000 bits per second (bps), to a 1.5-million bit-per-second “T-1” line, and beyond.<P>

The significance of the speed, or “bandwidth,” of your line is in how many persons can access you at once rather than how fast they'll receive information. With typical user access speed currently at 14,400bps, your 56-kilobit line can only handle four users at once, while a T-1 line can handle over 100. While all of the users will receive data at 14,400bps, sites using slower lines can only handle higher volumes by queuing users up. In addition to the hardware and communications link, operating your own site will also entail an operator/programmer who can keep it humming smoothly and maintain and update your pages.<P>

<H4>What should you put up?</H4>

It's pretty much up to you. Your site or ad can provide information, education, or an on line catalogue with ordering capabilities. You can create virtually anything possible with other media. It's also possible to create an e-mail mailing list that will let you send messages to thousands of persons instantaneously at minimal cost. E-mail transmits many times faster than faxing because text is sent as letters (one byte per letter); while a fax sends a pictures of letters (many bytes per letter). A fax that would take a minute to send requires only a few seconds with e-mail. And while faxing entails long distance phone charges, e-mail via the Internet is done at local call rates.<P>

There's no doubt about it, the Internet is exploding. Like all new media and technology, there is much to be learned, and potential problems and pitfalls to avoid. In our future installments, we'll try to help you get further acquainted the web with information on services, suppliers, and options, plus case histories of firms that are using the web successfully.<P>

<H5>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H5>
<I>Risk sharing and risk assumption are becoming elements of a pharmaceutical marketing program and are tied to managed healthcare. Manufacturers must recognize their role in sharing risk. Methods include: guaranteeing a product’s performance and/or price, and focusing on drug therapy effect on total healthcare costs.</I>
<P>
<hr size=4>
<P>
“Risk” has become an important term and concept in pharmaceutical marketing. Risk has always been a major factor in the pharmaceutical business, usually associated with research success (as in “only one in 8,000 compounds studied ultimately makes it to market”) or product safety (“elevations in liver enzymes occur in 6 percent of patients”). However, risk in today’s lexicon has more to do with financial exposure as a result of variances in spending by a health care delivery plan than the risk one chances when one gambles on pharmaceuticals, whether it is investment or ingestion.<P>

In today’s sense, risk is intimately tied into the concept of prepaid healthcare delivery, usually under a capitation method. There are also prospective payments associated with diagnostic-related groups (DRGs) that are at-risk payments for hospital in-patient stays. Both are examples of risk being generated by payers and passed on to providers to deliver services for a fixed amount of reimbursement.<P>

The system of risk-sharing is really much more complex than that. <a href="RiskFig1.html">Figure 1</a> shows the flow of capitated funds from payers to managers, then distributed under a variety of arrangements to various providers.<P>

<H4>Selling by capitation</H4>

Virtually all health maintenance organizations (HMOs) sell their comprehensive medical services to payers under a capitation scheme. According to Towers Perrin[1], the average HMO medical plan costs for an active employee in 1994 were $153 per month (a decrease of 2 percent from the previous year). According to our schematic in Figure 1, $153 per member per month (PMPM) would flow from Employer A to the managed care organization (MCO)[2]. The MCO would retain approximately 7 percent for administrative costs, or $11.06 PMPM, and would most probably realize about 5 percent in operating margin ($7.90 PMPM). Additionally, some $2.28 PMPM would be used as a marketing expense and $1.60 PMPM to service debt, depreciation, and other interest expense. The sum total of these expenses would be about $22.84 PMPM. The MCO would then attempt to spread its risk to deliver the agreed upon (and state-regulated) package of health benefits by passing risk onto as many of the providers as possible. This means $130.16 PMPM would be used as a medical expense (about 85 percent).<P>

According to Peter Kongstvedt[3], citing the Group Health Association of America (GHAA) report <I>HMO Industry Profile,</I> 60 percent of open panel plans use capitation to reimburse their primary care providers. From our best estimates at Emron, the average PMPM expense for primary care is about $20, with approximately $23.80 PMPM set aside for consultants (specialists) and $8.40 PMPM for other professional services. While Primary Care Providers may frequently be capitated, more than three quarters (78 percent) of specialists continue to be reimbursed by fee-for-service negotiated agreements[4]. This means that budgets are created (similar to the currently popular “block grants”) for specialty referral. Similarly, in-patient costs (at approximately $40 PMPM), emergency service ($4 PMPM), and out-of-area referrals ($7 PMPM) are budgeted and paid for on a per-encounter basis.<P>

In many — but certainly not all — capitated plans, the primary care provider is responsible for variances to the referral budgets. In most of these cases, a risk pool of about 20 percent of the primary care capitation rate is withheld as an incentive system for the primary care provider to meet and even surpass (in terms of savings) the budgets set aside for their referrals. This is appropriate because most of the utilization of these services is a result of primary care provider activity and behavior.<P>

Pharmacy can be somewhat different in that this $10.50 PMPM budgeted for pharmacy is only sometimes considered a controllable element in the primary care risk pool, and only a few managed care plans include the pharmacy budget as a risk element in the primary care risk pool.<P>

<a href="RiskFig2.html">Figure 2</a> shows what the flow of funds (rounded to the nearest $5 PMPM) should be. In this scenario, substantial risk resides in several important locations:

<OL><LI>$150 PMPM for a comprehensive benefit package places huge risk on MCO managers to properly manage the delivery of care in an efficient manner. Approximately 6 percent of plans were unable to accomplish this and had negative gross income in 1992[5].
<LI>Primary care physicians must provide ambulatory care in an efficient manner to receive their $20 average capitation rate. And the budgets for referrals (primarily to specialists and hospitals) must be met to preserve the $4 (20 percent) withhold.
<LI>Many ancillary services, such as laboratories, must provide their services under the negotiated capitation rate (aggregates to approximately $15).</OL>

<H4>Capitation as strategy</H4>

The identification of capitation as a possible marketing strategy for the pharmaceutical industry has not escaped notice and interest. Clearly, a company that could help to fix the pharmacy budget (currently estimated at $12.12 PMPM[6]) would be a welcome partner in the management of pharmacy costs.<P>

Pharmaceutical companies had a difficult time addressing this opportunity because no one company 
reaches 7.5 percent of the prescription drug market. According to IMS America, Glaxo-Wellcome accounts for 7.46 percent of dollars spent on drugs[7], and SmithKline Beecham leads the market, if measured by share of all prescriptions, at 5 percent[8]. Providing for such a small share appears to preclude any one company from developing an overall capitation rate for drugs. In an analysis conducted by Emron, it could be shown that managed care could reduce the number of drug suppliers from a current level of over 60 to approximately seven, accounting for 80 percent of prescription needs if severe and serious attention was paid to generic substitution and therapeutic interchange. At least in theory then, it was possible to reduce the number of suppliers to a point where capitation seemed logical for any one or a combination of several manufacturers.<P>

Another potential approach to risk sharing in the cost of drugs was to identify those therapeutic classes that accounted for the large and faster growing segments of managed care pharmacy and to focus on limited and selective therapeutic class management. The top ten (10) therapeutic classes in managed care are shown in <a href="RiskTab1.jpg">Table 1</a>. As can be seen, the top two classes, Oral Antibacterials and Gastrointestinal Agents, account for about one-quarter of total drug expenditure and the top ten classes nearly two-thirds.<P>

Because of the competitiveness of many of these classes, coupled with the therapeutic interchange potential of the leading products, a reasonable risk-sharing scenario could be conducted. Indeed, several manufacturers have engaged in pilot programs to capitate oral antibacterials, gastrointestinal agents, cholesterol reducers, ACE inhibitors, and oral contraceptives. The results must have been mixed, for we are unaware of any sustained national program beyond a pilot level. One reason given for the lack of acceptance of this approach is that after proper accounting is conducted, some manufacturers felt that they would incur additional exposure to “best price” regulations for Medicaid.<P>

Providing a performance guaranty supporting the utilization of a particular product is another potential risk sharing scheme for the manufacturer. As an example, this guaranty could take the form of measuring several different endpoints.<P>

<UL><LI>Patient satisfaction as measured by reduction in prescription switches.
<LI>Reduction in need for second-line therapy (antibiotic example).</UL>

We have worked with several companies who have piloted one or the other of these concepts. In one specific case, the company promoted the use of a generic for a “first-line” product, receiving agreement from the plan to get a preferred “second-line” status for their own drug. The risk arrangement yielded two positive outcomes. The company doubled share of their own product at the expense of several similar, expensive antibiotics, thereby generating incremental sales. They also increased share of the first-line generic agent from 35 percent of prescriptions to 50 percent (their goal was 65 percent). The results saved substantial money measured on a PMPY basis, and this was shared on a 33-1/3 percent basis with the company by the plan.<P>

Another guaranty which has been used by a pharmaceutical company to share risk was a price guaranty. In this scenario, the company promised that their own product (X) would always be 10 percent less expensive on a prescription basis than a limited list of directly competitive, similarly priced agents. This strategy has the advantage of not getting into competition with lower priced generics but, instead, focusing on other competitive brands of the manufacturer’s choosing (and targeting) for direct comparisons. After the contract period, the plan and manufacturer tally up the number of prescriptions covered by the plan for the targeted products. A weighted average is calculated (eliminating outliers), then the prescription count for the manufacturer’s product is multiplied by 90 percent of the weighted average. If the plan spent more than the resultant calculation, this manufacturer rebates the difference.<P>

<H$>Disease management application</H4>

The previous discussion placed the cost and utilization of pharmaceuticals at risk with a manufacturer willing to gain preferred status and, presumably, increased share for accepting the risk. It should be noted that discounts become somewhat moot under these risk-sharing schemes since the unit price of a product becomes almost irrelevant. The next evolution in pharmaceutical risk-sharing focuses on drug therapy effects on total health care costs. This new area presumes that the prescribing of the proper products and improved compliance results in a near term economic benefit, usually through reduced utilization of emergency services, hospital admissions, or inpatient days. The operating theory is that proper pharmaceutical care reduces costly exacerbations of disease or postpones morbidity endpoints far enough into the future to become less tangible and important.<P>

<H4>The magic age</H4>

In <a href="riskfig3.html">Figure 3</a>, premium costs steadily increase for an individual (and the payer) until age 65 when total costs (Medicare and Medigap insurance) rise significantly and increase at a faster rate until death. Actual medical expenses move upwards and downwards based on the cost of treatable exacerbations of disease, usually remaining below premium level but, occasionally, exceeding this level. The job of the managed care plan is to keep costs below premium to a sufficient degree. Under this model, the incentive for the managed care plan is to reduce the frequency and the level of expenditure associated with treating exacerbations.<P>

Will proper pharmaceutical care reduce total health care costs? This is a very complex question. In some chronic disease cases, such as asthma, diabetes, and depression, the evidence is fairly strong that improved pharmaceutical care improves outcomes and reduces costs. In other cases, such as hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, peptic ulcer disease, and even hypertension, improvements in pharmaceutical care make compelling sense, but near term cost savings are elusive to prove.<P>

<a href="RiskFig4.html">Figure 4</a> demonstrates the expense contribution of various cost components of healthcare.<P>

U.S. healthcare costs are estimated to have reached $1 trillion in 1995, or $3,875 per citizen. Pharmaceuticals will account for 8.4 percent of these costs, or $325 per citizen. Hospital care is the most costly at 36.2 percent of expenditures, followed by physician services at 19.7 percent. The goal of drug-focused disease management is to improve pharmaceutical care (expenditures could go up or down depending on aggregate utilization) resulting in a positive change in the other components, usually hospital care.<P>

As can also be seen in Figure 4, direct costs for different disease entities vary greatly. Cardiovascular disease accounts for an estimated $147 billion; neoplasms at $92 billion, etc. Each disease has its own profile of costs across the components. These are identified through elaborate burden-of-illness studies and may show dramatic differences from the averages depicted in the figure.<P>

<H4>The manufacturers’ stake</H4>

So how do manufacturers share risk for total health care costs? The most important issue to recognize and address is that product superiority alone may not assure cost reductions in hospitalization or services. The most effective and safe products available still require a support system to assure the products are being prescribed correctly and that consumers comply optimally. These support programs are part of a comprehensive disease management system, and it is with these types of systems, along with the proper data and information to monitor and improve performance, that risk sharing on total health care costs can become a reality.<P>

Risk sharing and risk assumption are becoming reasonable elements of a prescription pharmaceutical marketing program. The pharmaceutical manufacturer must understand the implications of sharing risk and utilize the appropriate approach. Risk can range from guaranteeing a product’s performance, to capitating a drug budget or demonstrating a pharmaceutical care program’s effect on total health care costs.<P>

Identifying and proving value is essential in today’s positioning of pharmaceuticals. Assuming a greater 
degree of risk demonstrates the manufacturer’s belief in that value.<P>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>
<I>The functions of a marketing research department are vitaland go beyond traditional definitions. A well-trained, professional staff is mandatory. Developing a training program may include file review functions, setting specificproblem-definition goals, developing a product point-of-view, and enrollment in outside formal training.</I>
<P>
<HR size=4>
<P>
The marketing research department of any major pharmaceutical company meets a variety of needs for the organization. It is the primary source of detailed market intelligence. It provides an orientation to marketing for sales people entering the home office environment for the first time. It is one of a planned cycle of trial areas for corporate trainees who are being evaluated for permanent hire. The marketing research department is a crossroads in the company at which one can observe, learn, and participate in the firm's marketing and business activity. The director of marketing research, with his or her staff, often performs analyses for the highest levels of management involving sensitive and far-reaching questions.<P>

 The main function of marketing research is to provide <B>information</B> (not just data) to those charged with 
making the business and marketing decisions. Information leads to insight, and insight supports appropriate action which is more likely to be both efficient and effective.<P>

 Providing accurate information requires a smoothly operating department with adequate data resources and a <B>well-trained staff</B> capable of assembling and interpreting data relevant to problems as they arise. It is sometimes popular to talk of marketing in terms of warfare, with positions to be taken and defended. In the military analogy, both offensive and defensive actions require knowledge of opposing positions, forces, weapons, mobility, and will to defend one's position. Execution of a battle plan requires confidence in your knowledge of those things, so that your actions are appropriate to the situation and to your resources. The commander must understand the real facts.<P>

<I>“Take care not to diverge from the truth — for nothing is more fatal to real advancement than to lapse into untruth.”</I>— General B. H. L. Hart, <I>Strategy</I><P>

The quality of the internally generated information on which management bases business decisions is determined, to a large extent, by:<UL><LI>the quality of the people in the department,<LI>their level of knowledge of the industry and its functioning,<LI>their understanding of the company and its goals,<LI>the extent of their training and ability to interpret data,<LI>their preparedness to use the many tools of research appropriately, and<LI>their credibility with those who will use the information.</UL><P>

<H5>Influence of top management</H5>

How well the department meets its obligation is a function of the leadership and training provided by both department and higher management. It is also a function of management's view of the marketing research job as a career position. To the extent that senior analysts are viewed as equally career-oriented as senior regional managers, members of the senior regulatory law staff, or senior product managers, the department will carry the obligations and have the resources to maintain a high-quality staff.<P>

The department training function is the responsibility of the marketing research director. However, higher levels of management have the obligation to assure that training is considered an important accountability and one on which the director is evaluated at least annually. Likewise, upper management must assure that the director has both the time and money to carry out the training. <I>This means that the director must be assured that he or she has the authority and responsibility to set priorities and to question the value of marginal projects which could usurp the time and money which would have been spent on training.</I><P>

Marketing research training in the Rx industry has consisted largely of:<UL><LI>informal, on-the-job exposure to projects,<LI>exercises in extemporaneous problem solving,<LI>training in use of the audits (now often delegated to a clerk), and<LI>exposure to the methods and processes used by research vendors.</UL><P>

Very few companies have anything approaching a formal training process for marketing research analysts. Such training has been lacking in the universities as well. Those analysts who have the benefit of working with knowledgeable and interested mentors become well grounded.<P>

But those who are not as fortunate must get it however and from whomever they can. The result is that it is not uncommon to encounter a senior marketing research staff member with large gaps in his or her knowledge of the field. And this works to the detriment of their employer.<P>

<H5>A case study</H5><P>

Consider the case of a company with Rx audit data showing a relatively low refill rate of its chronic-use product. This refill rate figure naturally became the focus of product management concern. With the turnover in both marketing research and product management, the statistic was never corroborated. Qualitative marketing research did not indicate that there was actually a problem with patients dropping out of therapy, but managers felt that the “trusted, standard industry audit” was superior to survey data. Programs were devised to deal with the “problem” because it was felt that the refill rate had to be improved.<P>

An analyst with some familiarity with the prescription audit learned by chance about the situation and was able to point out an anomoly in that particular study. In that audit, a new piece of paper from the doctor is considered a “new prescription.” Regardless of how long the patient has been on the drug, the refill rate will remain at “0” if a new piece of paper is presented to the pharmacy each time the Rx is filled. This can even be a predictable situation  — some states require that a patient be given a new piece of paper after six months.<P>

<H5> No three-day wonders</H5>

Relying on a new or undertrained analyst may create a situation where the particular quirks of a study are unknown. It takes more than a three-day orientation on the audits to instill in an analyst knowledge of the details and other tools of pharmaceutical marketing research. In this example, the time of many people involved with the brand had been consumed dealing with either a non-problem or the wrong problem.<P>

Many of the people who pass through marketing research have no intention of staying more than a short 
while, so the necessary time and money needed to make them proficient are seldom spent. Despite this, they usually approach their jobs with enthusiam, and their responsibilities remain significant.<P>

The problem compounds when the enthusiastic new analyst is paired with an equally enthusiastic new assistant product manager. Neither has training nor experience in marketing, and often the people they need as resources are too busy to offer needed experise. Add to this the understandable belief that it is not good for one's career to appear to need help, and the result can be a series of projects resulting in misinformation or, at best, misuse of scarce research money. It is not unheard of for a project to be initiated and managed by a product team whose members have no more than two years' experience in their respective positions.<P>

This raises the important issue of distinguishing between those on the obvious (and intended) fast track through the department and the person hired with the intent of remaining in the department. It also brings to mind the person who is a possible “transient” but discovers a liking for the marketing research function. Clearly, there needs to be a different and overlapping path for the professional and the transient. In most companies, this distinction is not made.<P>

<H5>Signs of inadequate training</H5>

The results of inadequate training often are difficult to detect in any single report or project. They are often perceived only by what <I>isn't</I> there over a series of projects. Seeing what<I> isn't</I> in the report requires an intimate knowledge on the part of the reader.<P>

Deficiencies in marketing research department training and /or low experience manifest as:<UL><LI>poor problem definition,<LI>inefficient setting of priorities,<LI>narrow points of view,<LI>failure to question assumptions,<LI>purchasing according to vendor relations — not program — needs,<LI>need for management to complete the analysis and recognize omissions, and<LI>loss of key marketing research staff members.</UL><P>

In broad terms, some of the actions which can help reduce the problem are:<OL><LI>Determining what proportion of the departments will be “core” or cadre and what percent will be passed through analysts.<LI>Hiring people who enjoy discovery and who want to make a career of marketing research and providing them with the incentives to become the core of a department. (This is a high-level management commitment requiring a long view of the marketing research function.)<LI>Deciding which skills and types of knowledge are important at the information gathering and evaluation level and defining them by kind and degree.<LI>Developing a “curriculum” which addresses each of the critical skill areas with definitions, skill development modules, performance expectations, and intervals of appraisal.<LI>Building attainment of skill and knowledge into the performance appraisal and salary action program. Likewise, senior management should appraise the director on the attainments of his or her direct reports.<LI>Providing rewards, acknowledgments, salary levels and bonuses which recognize attainment of these stages, not unlike the professional sales representative and similar programs adopted by some companies.</OL>

<H5>Review the files</H5>

Developing a training program is not difficult. One program which would benefit almost every company not now doing it is <I>assignment of a file review function</I> to new analysts. Upon being assigned to the department, the analyst is assigned to review the files on a given product group or marketing interest area and to learn what has been done over the past two years. That information is cataloged in some detail and the locations of key data sources are noted. Vendors often get calls from analysts for a copy of a report which should have been in the department files. This piece of the training program would create a document which can pass on to successors at least a listing of what has been done in the past.<P>

One of the most difficult points for marketing research people to appreciate is that they are <I>staff</I> and others are <I>line</I>. Even most product managers are staff rather than line because of the nature of their work. As such, line management owes both marketing research and product management clear direction (strategic or tactical) for gathering, interpreting, and applying market data. Working to specifications is a critical aspect of the training of an analyst.<P>

<H5>Research guidance</H5>

Those involved in information gathering must have a tactical or strategic focus to guide their “research.” This reveals yet another aspect of the training of the marketing research person, learning how to draw out the reasons for an information request and the likely uses of the information. Both have a great influence on how the information is gathered and interpreted, the confidence level sought, and the nature of the recommendations for using it. In this case, the training program involves setting out specific problem-definition goals which must be fulfilled. The analyst is assigned a project which has been requested by a product manager and is told to complete a “Project Control Sheet” which lays out what is to be learned, why it is needed, the specific questions which must be answered to satisfy the product manager and the methods which are best suited to the data to be collected. Even political needs of the product manager can be identified, such as size of sample, level of confidence (p value), scope of sample, etc. This assignment teaches the analyst how to background a problem and how to work with the client to assure the result will be appropriate and respected when reported.<P>

<I>The ability of any manager to arrive at several viewpoints in the course of analyzing a problem is a valuable talent.</I> Nowhere is this more apparent than in the marketing research analyst. One of the most irritating problems in product management is to try to get advisors to break out of the cultural mold and think about the market and “our product” in an entirely new way.<P>

A classic case was the introduction of Motrin in the mid-70s. The manufacturer seriously underestimated sales because much of the market was hidden from traditional audits. There was a host of consumers quietly suffering their arthritis pain because they had given up on aspirin and the more toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) of the day. While the manufacturer did all that was thought to be appropriate at the time, it was the unexpected which produced the larger sales volume.<P>

In this case, the training consists of asking the analyst to develop a viewpoint on “our product” potential using a given set of data. Then the analyst is asked to develop a technically sound view of the product as seen by the main competitor. A variant is to assign the same set of data to two analysts, say the interpretation of two focus groups, but with slightly different directions to each. The learning comes when the two analysts compare their reports and discuss the differences. This exercise is carried out frequently by managements which hire two consultants, each unaware of the other's role, to look at the same merger, acquisition, executive candidate or whatever. Too often, an analyst or other staff person becomes attached to one interpretation of a set of facts.<I> Who has not been frustrated in asking someone for two or three independent concepts only to have the “real one” and two straw men presented with a flourish?</I><P>

<H5>Other formal training</H5>

There are other, more formal ways to assure that the aspiring analyst is well trained. It is clear that field sales in one form or another will continue to be a main strength of the industry.<P>

Requiring analysts to be in the field two days per quarter making calls on customers is not at all unreasonable. Those who have not “carried the bag” need to see the difference between an NDTI patient visit and a real, live doctor visit. Those who need to be kept current with what physicians believe and do will benefit by this performance requirement. By making field work a performance appraisal parameter, it is much more likely to be done.<P>

Those who are seriously interested in marketing research can be encouraged and educated through external seminars. These include courses sponsored by Burke Marketing Research and other vendors who have courses on technical issues. However, one should not overlook the need for the analyst/manager to improve delivery of information via courses in public speaking, expository writing, and even technical writing.<P>

<H5>Send them to school</H5>

One of the simplest and most effective training courses for the person who is not from the field, or is not from your own sales force, is to send them to sales training. This is a fast course in your products, strategies, tactics, and corporate culture. It can bring the recent graduate farther “up the learning curve” than anything else the director could do.<P>

The Pharmaceutical Marketing research Group (PMRG) has developed a series of entry level training seminars that deal with some basic subjects as orientation level courses. Even the PMRG management agrees that these courses mainly teach basic concepts and not proficiency in questionnaire design, personal interviewing, promotional research, and the other topics covered. They are an excellent start toward the professional analyst, but they are not a substitute for the training function in the department.<P>

One must eventually return to the issue of professionalism. There are people who like the process of 
discovery and are good at it. Some will be discouraged while experiencing their first taste of marketing research by the tacit view that marketing research is not a proper career for anyone who can do something else. Like it or not, excel at it or not, they will be encouraged to move on and not look back. Training will come as a by-product of other activity, by association with suppliers who are interested in the profession or through attending seminars mainly intended for other purposes. <I>Too often, people who are good at it and have worked hard to learn marketing research find that their professionalism is appreciated only as a consultant to the company they would have preferred to serve as an employee.</I><P>

The quality of training, attention to training, and management accountability for training marketing research analysts are closely linked with the views of upper management on the professionalism of the marketing research function. The cost of training is borne by the company in any case. It can be as direct and beneficial as the cost of an organized and well-supported program or it can take the indirect and more costly form of spoiled projects, unnecessary or unnecessarily complicated projects, limited vision, or of actual sales and profit opportunities lost.<P>

<CENTER><H3>1995 RX CLUB SHOW</H3><H1>OBJECT LESSONS</H1> <H5><I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></H5></CENTER><BR><HR size=4><BR>

Advertising writers and designers, faced with the assignment of conveying a product feature, or a treatment situation, turn to the communication techniques of simile and metaphor to deliver their message with impact, added nuance, and creative flare. At this Fall's Rx Club Show, this approach was in evidence with a number of campaigns relying on physical objects as the central communicative element. In response to the question, posed by the dry language of a message strategy, “Well, let's think, what's it really like?” agency and client teams turned to flashlights, telephones, electric fans, bear traps, and automobile grills, among other devices, to gain attention and for message delivery.<P>

Interestingly, the spark for many of these campaigns seems to have come from headline copy, rather than begun with  of the visual device. For example, in a Zestril campaign using a flashlight, the headline “If your once daily ACE inhibitor starts to fade,” leads creatively to a dimming beam and then to restored “24 hours” of light with Zestril. Likewise, the electric fan in the Trisequens ad draws its inspiration from the “cools the symptoms” phrase in the headline.<P>

The campaign which won a Silver Print Award for Grey Healthcare of South Africa for Adcock Ingram Pharmaceutical's Stopayne comes dangerously close to extending promotion to a new level of audience involvement. On a 4" by 5-3/4" sleeve is the headline, “Whenever pain strikes…” When the pull tab is drawn, a mousetrap mechanism snaps down near your thumb. Copy on the slide: “Remember … Stopayne the Pain Killer.” A half-inch closer and you would have been a candidate for the product!<P>

A direct mail series which pushes the device metaphor to notable lengths is a ten-piece program from William Douglas McAdams for Baker Norton Pharmaceutical's P&S Liquid and Shampoo for psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp. The message is that the products are a step 1 and 2 method of successfully treating the conditions — liquid at night, shampoo in the morning. The campaign pairs devices which come together to achieve a desired result — bat and ball (“a home run”), hockey puck and stick (a goal), violin and bow (“beautiful music”), chalk and blackboard (“teaches a valuable lesson”), lock and key (“peace of mind”). The series is unusual for the number of parallels the creative team was able to draw to the action of the products.<P>

Gold Print Awards went to the McNeil pre-launch campaign for its new analgesic, Ultram, from Girgenti, Hughes, Butler & McDowell; and Dudnyk's ads for promotion of the agency.<P>

GHB&M's mailers introduced the butterfly visual which is the central element of the product launch. The cover of the first piece presents an empty collection jar headlined, “A change is in the air.” Inside, the butterfly is seen in flight with the product logo, along with a free offer of a tape cassette series, “Music du Papillon,” which is described as “soft natural sounds with light instrumental presentation of classical favorites — perfect listening for the office.” A business reply card allows for ordering. In the next two mailers, “You are just weeks away from … Ultram,” the butterfly has landed on a branch and a window sill and a continuation of the tape series is offered. In the final piece, “It's here,” the butterfly has alighted on a man's (presumably an MD's) hand and the product slogan appears, “Tough on pain, gentle on the system.” Maintaining the program's feedback system, the availability of a study on pain is announced. The mailers are not large —  only 7" by 6-1/4" — and the campaign depends on repetition of the creative elements and the offer of free materials for message registration. Creative team: Bob Ranieri, copy; Leanne Budreau, art direction.<P>

If the Ultram campaign can be described as muted, in keeping with the product's “gentle on the system” positioning, Dudnyk's approach in advertising its services can be termed threatening. Drawing on the Darwinian principle of the survival of the fittest, the challenging headline warned Rx marketers to “Adapt. Or Die.” The striking illustrations are of a canary equipped with eagle-sized talons and a goldfish with jaws worthy of a shark. Both claws and teeth sparkle with deadly sharpness. Under the menacing carp, body copy picks up from the headline explaining, “So goes the current thinking in healthcare marketing. And while we prefer a more positive approach — <I>adapt and thrive</I> — we do admit that in this marketplace, it pays to develop certain competitive advantages. Let's just say this — we're not about to let any of our clients become part of the food chain anytime soon.”<P>

For the pouncing bird of prey, copy runs,“There's no denying that healthcare marketing has become somewhat predatorial of late. Fortunately, we excel in helping our clients survive and thrive under such market conditions. Just ask anyone we've helped claw their way to the top.”<P>

Ed Dudnyk explains that the campaign is aimed at heightening awareness of the agency and that it has succeeded “beyond our wildest dreams.” He feels that the ads “hit a chord” — the feelings of uncertainty among product managers in the face of the turbulent pharmaceutical market — and have resulted in Dudnyk being included for consideration in a number of product pitches. Interestingly, graphics were produced in-house employing the morphing power of the computer. Art direction: Carleen Niemiec; copywriter: Barry Schmader.<P>

The Dudnyk campaign points up a phenomenon on display at the Rx Club Show and at other healthcare advertising competitions — the number of prizes going to non-product campaigns. At the Rx Show, five of eighteen — more than a quarter — of the Gold and Silver Awards went to pro bono work and agency self-promotion. A truism in advertising has always been “the work is only as good as the client.” The first step in putting out a good creative product is obtaining client approval. With the U.S. healthcare industry intimidated by an uncertain market, it is easy for companies to play it safe on agencies' creative impulses to do something different. Of late, most of the work selected for <I>Medical Marketing & Media's</I> “Ads I Wish I'd Done” feature by U.S. creative executives has been drawn from overseas. With clients less adventurous, agencies' creativity is gaining visibility in campaigns for non-paying, non-profit organizations, and “in-house” promotions where agencies have greater say in what is produced.<P>

One final observation on the Rx Club Show (and other 1995 competitions): Where are the managed care ads and promotional pieces? There were a few at the Rx Club Show, but for an industry preoccupied with managed care marketing, the absence of such material is noteworthy. Does the managed care scene discourage creativity of the kind agencies choose to showcase at these competitions? Or are the agencies not getting such assignments? Or, aside from a mention of cost advantages, is the basic managed care message — therapeutic effectiveness and patient satisfaction — not that different from the private practice message? After all, MDs are still writing the prescriptions.<P>

<CENTER><H1>1995 JOURNAL AD SPENDING REVIEW</H1></CENTER><HR SIZE=4>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>
<I>Last year was a turnaround for the industry, with spending rising after a two-year decline.There was relatively low activity in new products. The top four therapeutic classes were unchanged, but the leading pair lost market share.</I><P><HR SIZE=4>

It was a turnaround year for Medical/Surgical journals. Spending in 1995 rose 6% after two years of decline.<P>

This growth is due to a strong second half of the year, which was up 19%. The first quarter was weak (-11%), but the second quarter virtually stabilized (-1%), and this served as a platform for the second half takeoff.<P>

<img src="journ1.gif" width=600><P>

The tables that follow rank the top 25 products, the 25 heaviest spending advertisers, and spending for the 25 top product types.<P>

There was relatively low new product activity in 1995, with only 6 new products (if Ultram, which started spending in November 1994 is included) in the top 25. This is the same as 1993 and 1994. There were 11 new products spending over $2 million each whose combined expenditures totaled $38 million, which compares with 7 new products spending a total of $30 million in 1994. While it is a 27% increase, the spending is still below 1993's $45 million.<P>

Rather unexpectedly, the products ranking 26th to 50th provided the main growth, with expenditures rising 46%; for products ranking 11 to 25, support increased 17%; and, for the top 10, a jump of 9%. Not surprisingly, the 51st and lower products spending declined (-7%). A similar pattern is seen if we look at established products. Advertising for the products launched in 1994 or earlier that ranked in the top 25 declined 14%; for those that ranked 25-50 journal spending rose 7%.<P>

<B>Table 1</B>
<img src="journ2.gif" width=600><P>

Cardizem CD (Table 1) maintained its top ranking with a 12.5% increase, raising its share of expenditures to just over 2.5%. Hard on its heels was Adalat CC, with a 2.5% share, a 1.0 point increase over 1994. Third is Cozzar/Hyzaar with a 2.1% share. Prilosec increased spending 106.6% to rise to 5th from 31st. Ultram was 6th having launched November 1994. With the exceptions of Serevent (+51.0% to 7th) and Plendil (+66.7% to 13th) all the rest of the established products in the top 25 declined. Looking at 1994's top 25, we see that 7 are still in the top 10 and 15 in the top 25. Only four (Cardizem CD [1st], Adalat CC [2nd], Norvasc [4th] and Serevent [7th]) increased support levels. The rest all suffered cuts. Capoten's advertising was stopped. Imdur fell from 16th to 160th (-89.8%); Dynacirc went from 19th to 87th (-72.4%); Zosyn 21st to 79th (-68.9%) and Biaxin 14th to 69th (-66.7%).<P>

<B>Table 2</B>
<img src="journ3.gif" width=600><P>

Glaxo Wellcome (Table 2) increased journal support 20.0% to become the top-ranked company with a 5.7% share of spending. This increase was driven by the launches of Flonase, Lamictal, and Valtrex, which were partially offset by drastic cuts in Zantac. Merck jumped to second with a 567.9% increase again with new products (Cozzar/Hyzaar and Fosamax) providing the impetus, along with renewed support for Mevacor and Zocor. Last year's No. 1, Wyeth-Ayerst, dropped to third, cutting spending 6.7% as it reduced the efforts behind Effexor and Oruvail. Aggressive advertising for Adalat CC moved Bayer Pharmaceuticals into fourth place (+26.5%). Other companies increasing journal advertising and moving up the ranks were: Bristol-Myers, eighth (+215.8%), due to the launches of Glucophage and Serzone along with increased support for Monopril; the Astra-Merck Group, ninth (+93.2%), as they increased advertising for Plendil and Prilosec; Ciba, 14th (+61.7%), which launched Lotrel; McNeil, 17th (+1071.9%), whose growth is due to Ultram; and Berlex, 25th (+138.6%), after introducing Limara. Overall, the top growth performer was Tap Pharmaceutical, jumping from 946th to 28th with the launch of Prevacid.<P>

On the negative side, many companies cut advertising. This resulted in four dropping out of the top 25: Parke-Davis (-68.5% to 46th) stopped support for Accupril; Squibb (-76.8% to 44th) stopped advertising Capoten and cut Pravachol; Syntex (-69.4% to 40th) stopped efforts behind Ticlid and Toradol; Whitehall (-40.9%, 32nd) reduced Advil's support. Within the top 25 the biggest cut was for Sandoz (-50.0%, 19th) who spent less on Dynacirc and Lescol.<P>

<B>Table 3</B>
<img src="journ4.gif" width=600><P>

The top four therapeutic classes (Table 3) remain unchanged with calcium blocking agents at the top. They have over 10% of all advertising followed by systemic antiarthritics with 5.2%. Both are losing share. A class rise up the rankings is generally tied to the introduction of new products and this held in 1995, The introduction of Cozzar/ Hyzaar and Lotrel drove the class. Other antihypertensives increased its position from 17th to 5th; inhaled nasal steroids rose to 12th because of Flonase; oral diabetes is now 13th on the strength of Glucotrol XL; Ultram pushed non-narcotic analgesics from 161st to 14th; Fosamax, in the miscellaneous other ethical drugs category, helped this group rise to 19th. Oral estrogen/progestin entered the ranks at 21st because of Prempro/Premphase and Prepro Tablets.<P>

The same relationship is seen in declining categories. Spending was stopped for Bumex causing diuretics non-injection, other, to fall from 96th to 22nd. Similarly, Imdur received no support and nitrites/ nitrates dropped 38th from 14th; Premarin cut back 59.7% resulting in oral estrogens falling to 39th from 23rd. In the top 25, the largest decline was B-Lactamase Inhibitors (12th to 23rd), as Zosyn's support was reduced 66.40%.<HR size=4>

<CENTER><H1>THE LONG ORDEAL OF LESTER RILEY</H1> 
<H5><I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></H5></CENTER><BR><HR size=4>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>Lester W. Riley was head of Ortho's dermatological division when the FDA investigated the company's public relations program on Retin-A for photoaging. While Ortho was fined and, along with others involved, given immunity, Riley was ultimately tried in federal court for obstruction of justice.</I>
<P>
<HR size=4>
<P>

<H3>When titans clash, the earth trembles and it isn't safe for the inhabitants. So Ortho employees 
learned when FDA investigated the company's PR campaign on Retin-A.</H3>

In the conflict between the pharmaceutical industry and its critics — politicians, regulators, and the media — there have been numerous clashes but few casualties. For all the blows the industry has taken to its profits and image since the Kefauver hearings in 1961, pharmaceutical manufacturers have prospered and few of its executives have suffered personally for being on the firing line between the contending parties. The exception is Lester W. Riley.<P>

As head of Ortho Dermatological Division in 1991, Riley was at a flash point in FDA's investigation of Ortho's public relations program on Retin-A for photoaging. Four years later, Riley found himself under indictment for conspiracy to defraud the government and for destroying evidence, subject to possible multiple jail terms of at least five years, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. Riley's experience is instructive for anyone working in a politically sensitive, regulated industry and as an example of the human damage that can occur when the tectonic plates of government and industry collide.<P>

Riley's story is inexorably linked with Ortho's Retin-A (tretinoin) which was approved by the FDA for acne and came on the market in 1971. It achieved modest sales in the '70s, reaching $28 million by 1987. However, based on testimony at Riley's trial, the company saw tremendous potential for Retin-A in the research which Albert Kligman and others conducted in the '80s — research showing that Retin-A could counter photoaging — or in lay person's language — wrinkles. Based on trial testimony, it appears Ortho began planning public relations activities on Retin-A and photoaging in the mid-'80s, playing up the positive research reports in consumer and scientific media. The centerpiece of the campaign was publicity on a study by a team headed by John Voorhees of the University of Michigan which appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association in January, 1988, showing that “14 of 15 patients who received tretinoin to the face had improvement in photoaging” versus no improvement in the control group. In the same issue, an editorial headlined, “At last! A Medical Treatment for Skin Aging,” by Barbara Gilchrest of Boston University, enthusiastically endorsed the Michigan research as suggesting that “a new age has dawned.” <I>JAMA</I> publication and an editorial, academic credentials, the promise of reversing the skin's aging process — this was a publicist's dream! Ortho and its PR agencies made the most of it. <P>

A press conference was held at the Rainbow Room in New York City with Voorhees expanding on the findings. The news that there was a treatment for wrinkles was front page in the press and featured on radio and TV news broadcasts. Among the beauty-conscious population, the word spread rapidly that a prescription product was available from doctors to smooth out the wrinkles, tighten the sags, and restore the look of younger days.<P>

<H5>Free Speech or Promotion?</H5>

Sales of Retin-A responded immediately with the product suddenly in short supply. There was only one problem. Retin-A had not been approved by the FDA for photoaging. Ortho was not promoting Retin-A for photoaging via its salesforce or in advertising, but it was stimulating articles in consumer media (particularly women's magazines) and it was financing a national media tour — appearances by dermatologists on TV talking about Retin-A and wrinkles. FDA regulations were imprecise on public relations activities while specific on promotion. Ortho operated the Retin-A photoaging PR campaign in the grey area which existed (and still exists) concerning legitimate scientific and educational communication — activities which, it has been argued, are afforded First Amendment protection. In a document presented to the court on March 8, 1995 in connection with the destruction of Retin-A files, Ortho stated its case:<BR>	<CITE>Beginning in 1985 Ortho funded a program to inform the public of the scientific findings respecting Retin-A's efficacy for the treatment of photoaged skin … The program primarily involved sponsorship of symposia for medical experts to present their research findings, media tours and press conferences for respected dermatologists to discuss their clinical findings, and funding of medical publications to report on dermatological advances. In so doing, Ortho employed public relations firms and made use of other lawful techniques that had been previously utilized by Ortho's competitors without drawing any formal complaint from the FDA...At the same time, even though there were no clear cut legal standards governing the means of dissemination that Ortho could utilize, Ortho sought to be responsive to perceived views and suggestions of the FDA in this area …<P>
The bottom line is this: through its Retin-A program, Ortho funded dissemination of truthful and accurate scientific information to the medical and lay public, as permitted by FDA regulations.</CITE><P>

The FDA, however, in 1988 saw matters differently and expressed its concerns to Ortho immediately after the Rainbow Room press conference. An investigation into the Ortho PR program began in the Spring of 1988. With the FDA looking over its shoulder, Ortho continued what Ortho executives have termed an “aggressive” PR campaign aiming at the appearance monthly of a major Retin-A article in consumer media. In September, another press conference was held announcing the availability of a lower strength Retin-A and in December, Ortho was active on the PR front at the Academy of Dermatology convention. However, at the end of 1988, Ortho discontinued the media tour and assumed a lower PR profile on Retin-A. Sales of the product in 1988 had reached $64 million.<P>

<H5>“All the Remedies … at Our Disposal”</H5>

In July, 1989, Ortho submitted a supplement to its Retin-A labeling for the photoaging indication. FDA investigation of Ortho's PR activities continued. The agency's position was stated in an article by Kenneth R. Feather (then acting director of FDA's division of drug advertising and labeling) in the August, 1989, issue of <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I>, “Ask the FDA — When is PR promotion?”<P>

<CITE>The FDA has been bothered for some time about the role of public relations in promoting prescription drugs. Now with Mickey Mantle being paid to praise Voltaren on talk shows and headlines through various media proclaiming that Retin-A “reverses” the aging process, to name just two examples, we are taking a more formal look at the whole scope of public relations, press conferences, and similar publicity activities that wouldn't normally be considered advertising ...We are particularly concerned about promotion of unapproved uses of drugs that are already on the market. This is strictly a violation of the law … when a company launches a campaign that pushes an unapproved use, we're in a different realm … we don't think it is acceptable when the company that funds the research stages a press conference to promote an unapproved use of the drug. This, I think, forces us to view the activity the same way we do an ad, as promotional activity within the meaning of the act and regulations … If we conclude that these public relations ventures constitute promotional activities, then they are subject to all the remedies we have at our disposal.</CITE><P>

Tough talk.<P>

With statements like this, it would have been suicidal for Ortho to continue high 
visibility PR on Retin-A, particularly when trying to obtain FDA approval on the photoaging indication. Moreover, Congress was showing interest in drug industry sales tactics — always a productive tack in Washington — with the Retin-A PR program as a case history. Representative Ted Weiss (D.-N.Y.) began an investigation of Ortho's PR program requesting that Ortho answer questions about its activities with Ortho responding in September of 1989. <P>

The next installment in the debate over Ortho's PR on Retin-A came in a <I>60 Minutes</I> broadcast on February 4, 1990. The program reviewed the publicity splash Retin-A had made after the Voorhees press conference, presented an NIH expert who had reservations about the long-term safety of Retin-A, showed a clip from the media tour (a dermatologist praising Retin-A), and questioned FDA's Feather about Ortho PR activities on a non-approved indication.<P>

<I>60 Minutes:</I>	Isn't this [a media placement letter from an Ortho PR agency] rather a blatant example of promotion?<BR>
<I>Feather:</I>	It would seem to be. Yes.<BR>
<I>60 Minutes:</I>	Violation of the law?<BR>
<I>Feather:</I>	Probably.<BR>
<I>60 Minutes:</I>	Are you going to do anything?<BR>
<I>Feather:</I>	The situation is under active investigation right now and at this point I can't say much more about it.<BR>
And later on the Retin-A media tour:<BR>
<I>60 Minutes:</I>	It looks like they're making fools out of the FDA and the law?<BR>
<I>Feather</I> (nodding in agreement): Perhaps.<P>

Feather then explained that guidelines on PR were being developed. After reporting that Voorhees laboratory at Michigan had received $1,000,000 in J&J grants and Gilchrest's (author of the JAMA editorial) department at Boston U. had received $400,000, in the 60 Minutes style of exposing impropriety, the interview concluded:<P>

<I>60 Minutes:</I>	What kind of penalties could you impose on the drug company?<BR>
<I>Feather:</I>	Once convicted, there are fines established ... I think they run up in the range of 
hundreds of thousands of dollars.<BR>
<I>60 Minutes:</I>	Ortho made $100,000,000 on the drug last year. $100,000 is not going to scare them.<P>

The <I>60 Minutes</I> program ended with the news that Weiss' Congressional committee was continuing its probe of the Ortho PR program. By now, with these warning shots from FDA and Congress, Ortho had pulled back its PR activities and was cooperating with FDA investigations of its activities. The FDA inquiry took the form of requesting that Ortho supply information and data. Contracts between the company and its PR agencies were examined, for example, but no documents were subpoenaed. FDA would ask and Ortho legal department would answer and this challenge and response exchange continued for months. In October of 1990, FDA came under pressure from Weiss. In a letter to FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler, Weiss wrote;<P>

	<CITE>Please provide all documents regarding FDA review of the promotion of Retin-A for unapproved uses including but not limited to all HHS letters, memoranda, and internal and draft documents. I understand that these documents may include agency analyses and recommendations for criminal prosecution, which I assure you, will not be made available to the public at any time prior to a public hearing on this matter.</CITE><P>

<H5>FDA Turns Up the Heat</H5>

Subsequent to Weiss' letter, the FDA went to the Justice Department and requested a criminal investigation into whether Ortho had gone over the line in marketing Retin-A. At issue was whether Ortho had controlled the content of what physician-spokespersons said about the product.<P>

On the evening of January 2, 1991, FDA investigators called at the homes of Larry Pickering, who had been head of Ortho's dermatological division, and George Thorne, the company's medical director. Pickering and Thorne refused to answer questions referring the investigators to Ortho's legal counsel. These home visits, however, had an electrifying effect at Ortho. According to the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> (March 1, 1995, page B1), the office was aswirl the next morning with talk of the FDA investigations. One person, Carol Hebestreit, as she testified at the Riley trial, was particularly shaken by the FDA's housecalls.<P>

Hebestreit was well acquainted with the Retin-A program. She had been — during her career at Ortho — professional relations manager, product manager on the brand, and at that time, director of strategic projects, which entailed working with the legal department in responding to FDA in the Q&A process which had gone on since 1988. Heberstreit was near the top of the Ortho Derm pyramid, reporting directly to Riley who was now the head of the division. Defense attorney Joseph A. Hayden, according to the (Newark, N.J.) <I>Star-Ledger</I>, says that Heberstreit misinterpreted a brief conference with Riley concerning the files. Employees spent January 3, 1991 destroying thousands of files and videotapes relating to the Retin-A PR program on photoaging.<P>

While the staff was purging the files, a grand jury subpoena arrived by fax at Johnson & Johnson's corporate headquarters requesting all documents relating to Retin-A's PR activities. By the time it reached Ortho, Hebestreit and staff had, as she described it, removed what “it would have been better that no one saw” concerning Ortho's “hands on” role in the program. Ortho's legal department, unaware of the document destruction, proceeded to answer the subpoena and met with Hebestreit shortly thereafter to collect materials which were then sent to the grand jury investigators.<P>

A sizeable package of material from files at Ortho, J&J, and their PR agencies, was supplied to the government in response to the subpoena. It took the Justice Department and FDA investigators considerable time to absorb and analyze this flood of memos, reports, business plans, etc. But by the spring of 1992, the government had additional questions, and in April, 1992, Carol Hebestreit was personally subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury. She testified in July, 1992, coming to the court, according to her testimony at the Riley trial, with an “agenda” to obscure the role Ortho had played in influencing the content of the Retin-A public relations program.<P>

<H5>Coverup Confession</H5>

The grand jury was not satisfied and a second appearance was scheduled for late November, 1992. According to the same <I>Wall Street Journal</I> report on the case, FDA investigators had become suspicious about gaps in the Ortho Derm files as compared to those from PR agencies and other Ortho corporate offices. In a meeting for the November grand jury session with J&J lawyers, Carol Hebestreit and others involved in the shredding of documents revealed that files had been destroyed. J&J immediately reported this to the government and the regulatory struggle between the FDA and Ortho over Retin-A entered an entirely new phase. Ortho's publicity programs on Retin-A became secondary to the coverup of how the program was conducted.<P>

Riley learned about the document destruction and took the position that since it had happened “on his watch,” he should resign — which he did in December, formally leaving the company in January, 1993. Hebestreit, in her words, was “forced to resign” in February, 1993. Riley went to work for NeoStrata, a dermatological company, and Hebestreit was one of five people he had worked with at Ortho whom he brought with him.<P>

For the next two years Riley put the document incident behind him and pursued his new career at NeoStrata. Some settlement, he thought, among Ortho, FDA, and the Justice Department would be reached with him out of the picture. Hebestreit, however, was hopelessly entangled in the case. She was in a tenuous position having admitted to the document destruction and to misleading testimony before the grand jury. In July, 1994, Hebestreit again testified before the grand jury, admitting the destruction of files and implicating Riley. It had been on his instruction, she said, that she shredded Retin-A files and destroyed videotapes. Others involved were also given immunity as the government built its case against Riley and Ortho.<P>

In the fall of 1994, with rumors that indictments were pending, Riley arranged with his lawyer to take a lie-detector test in an effort to prove he had nothing to do with the document destruction. He supplied the polygraph results — which showed he was telling the truth — to the Justice Department.<P>

In early January, 1995, he was in China on business when he learned he had been indicted. He was stunned by the news, cut the trip short and returned to the U.S. “It was a long, long, ride home,” he recalls. Ortho was also charged with the destruction of evidence. The company pleaded guilty and agreed to pay a $7.5 million fine in exchange for immunity from further prosecution regarding off-label promotion of Retin-A, and the responses made by the company while the FDA was investigating the case and during the grand jury investigation.<P>

<H5>“Abandoned”</H5>

The same day, January 11, 1995, that Ortho was pleading guilty, Riley, through his lawyers, proclaimed he was, “absolutely innocent.” His statement read: “He rejects the company's decision not to fight their charges with real truths. He emphasizes that the company's plea bargain is its easy way out but a superficial disposition … In short, once the chief executive of the Dermatological Division, Les has been abandoned.”<P>

Riley could very well feel “abandoned” given the company's position and the immunity that had been granted to so many of his former fellow employers. (To add to his isolation, the indictment forced him to leave NeoStrata.)  Riley believes it appeared likely that, as the head of Ortho Derm, when the files had been destroyed, he had been singled out as the most productive target for prosecution. He was on his way to becoming the scapegoat in the FDA-Retin-A confrontation.<P>

The case went to trial before William Bassler in federal court in Newark, N.J. on October 31, 1995. Richard O. Schechter, assistant U.S. attorney in N.J. and Kenneth G. Jost, assistant director, Office of Consumer Litigation, Department of Justice, backed by two FDA representatives made up the prosecution. Riley's defense was headed up by Joseph A. Hayden, Jr. of Hayden, Perle and Silber of Weehawken, N.J. with assistance from William C. Cagney of Lane & Mittendorf of Edison, N.J.<P>

In his opening statement to the jury, Schechter asserted that “… this case is about cheating the government and hiding the truth … how this man, Lester Riley, with the help of loyal subordinates defrauded a government agency by directing employees to destroy records … how this man, when he learned the government was getting serious in its investigation of his company's biggest selling product, how he ordered employees to clean the files while he busied himself with meetings … we're not suggesting that Lester Riley or Ortho violated any criminal laws by the way they ran the public relations program about Retin-A and photoaging. The question of when someone is involved in educational activities — something the First Amendment permits everyone to do — and the question of when they're involved in promotional activities about the drug — something they're not permitted to do … that distinction between education and promotion, that's not the subject matter of this case … They [witnesses] will not be able to tell you the exact words that Lester Riley used when he gave these two employees the assignment almost five years ago. They will, however, tell you that they did receive an assignment … to clean out the files … they did what they were told … they did destroy records … the most important way the United States is going to prove this case to you is by asking you all to rely on your common sense … Ladies and gentlemen, it's that common sense that will help you understand why secretaries and employees at Ortho would spend the day shredding records and hiding the truth … that will help you understand why a boss like Lester Riley would order the destruction of records the morning after learning that the FDA was getting serious in investigating Retin-A.”<P>

In his opening statement, Hayden got immediately to Riley's basic defense — that Carol Hebestreit had misunderstood Riley's casual instructions about the files and overreacted:<P>

“… it will become clear that Mr. Riley, after hearing of visits on the 2nd of January 1991, did not have great concern. Mr. Riley felt this was a regulatory matter which the lawyers would handle with the FDA … It was Carol who was rattled, and it was Carol who misinterpreted the conversation and then went out and talked to a lot of secretaries …”<P>

Hayden then gave the jury personal history on Riley — son of a Kansas City policeman, a hard worker who had kept at night school for eight years to get his degree, a salesman with J&J who had moved his family around the country as he climbed up the ladder at Ortho until at last he became head of the Derm Division, but assuming that position after the Retin-A PR programs of 1987-88 had occurred. He explained that off-label drug usage was not unusual, that “25 percent of the prescriptions for drugs will end up being for alternative or off-label use …” He touched on the “grey area” between education and promotion and concluded: “At the end of the day, folks, this case is about communications and recall … Rather than leave you with arguments, I'll leave you with questions. Do you think it's possible that when a man who the evidence will show is a good man and an honorable man, and a man with a character and reputation for truthfulness has a brief conversation on the way out the door there could have been a miscommunications on his part? Do you think it is possible, or even likely, that if the listener is having the conversation with him in a state of high anxiety about a fear on her own part of a visit by federal agents, she could be likely or prone to misinterpret the conversation …?”<P>

<H5>The Government's Case</H5>

The prosecution of Riley was built on the following premises:<P>

<B>The threat of off-label drug promotion to public health.</B> Norman Drezin, acting deputy director and regulatory counsel for Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communication (DDMAC), testified on this point: “… when the promotion occurs for an unapproved use, it's generally considered there's inaccurate evidence of safety and effectiveness. That type of promotion — and drug companies are very persuasive in promotion, they're expert at it — could persuade physicians and consumers to use products for purposes for which they were not intended and that there's little or no evidence they are actually safe or effective for those purposes.<P>

And in addition, if these efforts are successful, then there's little incentive for the manufacturer to go back and actually study the drug to determine it if would work in those situations, because they already have the revenue. They have the sales … One of the key issues to us is that when there's promotion of those types of uses that there's greater risk to consumers. And it's our job to protect the public health …”<P>

<B>The importance of the company's internal documents in deciding on the illegality of off label promotion:</B> In judging promotion from education, Drezin cited questions the FDA considers: “… is it independent? Who is doing it? Are the drug companies behind it? Are they controlling the content of the program that is being disseminated?”<P>

And later in his testimony:<BR>
<I>Jost:</I>	In evaluating what is being done and how it is being done, what sort of evidence would be revealing on those issues?<BR>
<I>Drezin:</I>	A lot of the evidence that we would look at would be from the company. There would be internal documents of how they came to develop this program — what  their goals were … <P>
<B>The extent of document destruction — to dramatize the magnitude of the 
offense:</B><BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	When you say “thousands” is that plural?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	More than a thousand. Yes.<BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	Was it several thousand?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	I had estimated that there were several thousand pieces of paper, yes.<P>

<B>The document destruction was intended to deceive investigators:</B><BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	Did the remaining documents left in the files of the derm division create a false impression? <BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	To me it didn't paint an accurate picture. Yes …<BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	Did it paint a false impression of what Ortho had done regarding Retin-A, photoaging, and the public relations activity?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	It paints the picture that the public affairs group was not involved with those activities in the public relations area.<P>

<B>Riley's knowledge of the PR program and his sense of its commercial importance:</B><BR>
<I>Jost:</I>	Now, the increase in demand for Retin-A that followed the Rainbow Room press conference was consumer-driven demand. Is that right?<BR>
<I>Riley:</I>	Yes, I would say that patients were asking physicians for prescriptions of Retin-A and, obviously, doctors were writing prescriptions for Retin-A, yes …<BR>
<I>Jost:</I>	Do you agree that it was a consumer-driven product?<BR>
<I>Riley:</I>	I would agree that after the press conference, that the product had a tremendous amount of visibility in the consumer market, yes …<BR>
<I>Jost:</I>	And … you wrote … “I know the importance of keeping a conservative posture in regard to Retin-A publicity. We will continue to do everything possible to keep the momentum going,” that's what you wrote to your boss back in February of 1988. Is that right?<BR>
<I>Riley:</I>	That's correct.<BR>
<B>The timing of the document destruction immediately after Riley had learned of the FDA calls upon Pickering and Thorne:</B><BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	Did you discuss with Riley the visits of the FDA to the homes of Thorne and Pickering?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	Yes. I don't know if I asked him if he was aware of them but he acknowledged he was aware of more visits to the homes.<BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	And what was the relationship in time of when those visits had occurred and when you were speaking to Mr. Riley?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	The visits had occurred the night before.<P>
<B>And the cornerstone contention — both Hebestreit and Patricia Gregory (Riley's secretary) felt they had received an assignment from Riley to destroy Retin-A files:</B><P>

<I>Schechter</I> (to Gregory):Why was it you began shredding records regarding Retin-A and photoaging after you heard Mr. Riley and Ms. Hebestreit talking in front of your desk on January 3, 1991?<BR>
<I>Gregory:</I>	Just that. That's what I thought I was … should do …<BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	What words do you recall from the conversation between Mr. Riley and Ms. Hebestreit?<BR>
<I>Gregory:</I>	All I remember is, now would be a good time to clean out the files …<BR>
<I>Schechter</I> (to Hebestreit):  … what was the assignment that you were given by Mr. Riley at his office?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	It's difficult because I don't remember the words. What I think I remember the words to be was that I knew Retin-A the best, and could I take care of the files …<BR> 	<I>Schechter:</I>	When you spoke to Mr. Riley that morning, did Mr. Riley give you an assignment to look at the files concerning Retin-A …?
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	Yes, I thought he did.<BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	And when was it you formed an intention to go through those files and throw out documents contained in those files?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	After I left Les' office.<BR>
<I>Schechter:</I>	And did your decision to do that, was it in any way based on your conversation with Riley that morning?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	Yes.<P>

Schechter and Jost proceeded through the examination of witnesses and the presentation of evidence in an objective, even clinical manner. Hayden, Riley's lawyer, was equally professional in approach but his body language and vocal infliction carried an extra measure of earnestness. As Hayden explains, “When you know your client has passed a lie-detector test, when you know your client is clearly innocent, you carry an awesome responsibility in representing him.”<P>

<B>Riley's Defense</B>

Hayden attacked every aspect of the government's case to raise “the reasonable doubt” he needed for acquittal. Space does not allow recapping his challenges in detail. He needed to register the following key ideas with the jury:<P>

<B>The imprecise recall of Hebestreit and Gregory of Riley's instructions and the ambiguous language used.</B><P>
<I>Hayden</I> (to Gregory):	Is it true that you were an overhearer … or a bystander …  in connection with this conversation?<BR>
<I>Gregory:</I>	I believe so. Yes.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>	The slice of the conversation that you heard, in point of time, to your best recollection could you tell us how long it was?<BR>
<I>Gregory:</I>	Very quick. I … less than a minute.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>	Less than a minute?<BR>
<I>Gregory:</I>	I think it was just, “now would be a good time.”<BR>
<I>Hayden</I> (to Hebestreit): But was it you starting the conversation by peppering him with questions or was he peppering you with questions?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	No. I was the one that was asking the questions.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>And was it, ma'am, in the context of you asking him questions, that he made some comment, that you now best remember, “You know the files best. You take care of the files?”<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	Yes …<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>	Did he at any time pull you aside and say, “Now I want you to 
understand what I want you to do?”<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	No.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>But you walked away with your impression as to what you believed he wanted you to do?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	That's correct.<BR>
<B>Hebestreit's mental state on the morning of January 3, 1991.</B><BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>	And is it fair to characterize you as an emotional person?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	Yes.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>	And on January 3, 1991, after talking to people in the hallway for 45 minutes, you had emotion of anxiety and fear, did you not?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	I did.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>	What were you afraid might happen if there was a home visit by the FDA to your house?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	Most unfortunately, I had no idea what it would look like. That's probably what presented a lot of the fear.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>The fear of the unknown?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	Sure, the fear of the unknown. I didn't know that they'd say, what they'd do, if they were allowed to search. I didn't know anything …<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>So Mr. Riley told you that he didn't think that the FDA was, in fact, going to visit the derm division that day?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	That's correct.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>	Did you accept his prediction or did you continue to be concerned?<BR>
<I>Hebestreit:</I>	No, I still felt concern.<P>
In his examination of witnesses and his closing argument, 
Hayden stressed facts which indicated Riley had not given instructions for the shredding of the files. Most tellingly, he pointed out that none of the Retin-A files in Riley's office were cleansed — certainly an oversight if you were trying to remove incriminating evidence. Also, as Gregory and Hebestreit testified, Riley never asked for a report on what they had done or followed up in anyway on his supposed instructions. Hayden also brought out that Riley would have known that copies of the memos in the Derm Division files existed at the PR agencies and in Ortho corporate files.<P>

Hayden called character witnesses who testified as to Riley's integrity, the respect with which he was held by his business associates and friends, and his status as a good husband and father. In questioning government witness from Ortho, Hayden even obtained from them their opinion that Riley was an outstanding person — a solid citizen.<P>

<B>“Take Care of the Files”</B><P>

The case centered on the Riley-Hebestreit conversation the morning of January 3 and Hayden had Riley give his recollection of the interchange:<BR>
<I>Riley:</I>	Well, Ms. Hebestreit came to my office, walked in and walked to the front of my desk and asked me if I was aware that FDA people had visited the homes of Ortho employees the night before. And I told her, yes … at that point she said to me, “What's next? What's going to happen?” And I said, “I don't know, Carol.” And at that point she said to me, “Do you think they'll come to my home?” And I said to her “No!” She asked, “Do you think they'll come here to Ortho?” I said, “No. I don't think so … ” At that point she asked me again, “Well, if they come here to Ortho, what should I do?” And at that point I was moving to the meeting and I said “You take care of the files.”<P>

Hayden emphasized repeatedly that it was Hebestreit's job to deal with Ortho's legal department regarding Retin-A records in responding to the FDA and in other litigation concerning the Retin-A patent and trademark infringements. The picture Hayden presented was that Riley had told her not to worry and to continue doing what she usually did. Unfortunately, as Hayden theorized, Hebestreit, upset by the FDA home visits, overacted, panicked, and began the day-long destruction of material in the files she thought would show Ortho's control over the Retin-A PR program.<P>

But what about Riley's secretary, Gregory? Why did she also attack the files? Hayden explained that Gregory had been influenced by Hebestreit that day and that her recollection had been colored by subsequent contact with Hebestreit. Hebestreit as a top executive at Ortho had authority over Gregory. He asked Gregory, “Carol [Hebestreit] refreshed your recollection as to her version of what she recalled happened, and that was January of  '93?”<BR>
<I>Gregory:</I>	Yes.<BR>
<I>Hayden:</I>Could any recollection you have now or ever had in June been based on your January '93 conversation with Carol?<BR>
<I>Gregory:</I>	Yes.<P>

In his summation, Hayden reconstructed the doorway scene and argued that, given Hebestreit's state of mind, miscommunication was a more likely explanation than Riley giving the shredding order. He also displayed on a chart a list of those at Ortho who had been given immunity by the government — several executives and secretaries — implying that the case against Riley was based on self-serving testimony and dramatizing Riley's isolation and scapegoat status.<P>

The trial was concluded on November 29, 1995, and after two days' deliberation the jury reached a verdict. While the jury was out, Riley, according to Hayden, was impatient with the waiting. He was certain that he would be cleared. Hayden and Cagney, although they believed they had a strong case, were anxious since as Cagney said, “You can never tell what a jury will do.” The jury found Riley innocent on all counts.<P>

Outside the courtroom, Riley met with some of the jurors who wanted to shake his hand and speak to the man they had just acquitted. They expressed confidence in his innocence and sympathized with the ordeal he had gone through. Riley's nightmare year was over. “It was a hard time,” he said, “but it was harder on my family. I, at least, could work on the case. They just had to wait, and then there were phone calls and news stories. It was a year I want to forget.”<P>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>Survival in the pharmaceutical industry depends not just on development of new products, but of innovative and exclusive products. These are more likely to originate from basic research in academic laboratories, which has led to intensive efforts in search and acquisition and a whole new strategy that involves developing new marketing, legal, and financial skills.</I><P>

<HR size=4><BR>

<I>On December 1, 1995, the Matritech company announced that an FDA advisory committee panel had recommended conditional approval of its bladder cancer test. Ten days later, Terence (Terry) Downer, vice president for corporate development of Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc., made a presentation on improving industry/university relations to the Association of University Technology Managers (AUTM, pronounced as in “fall”) in Phoenix, Arizona.</I><P>

As straws in the wind go, the coincidence of timing was revealing: the transfer of healthcare technology from academia to private industry is becoming increasingly important to both parties. Matritech's product — in fact the entire company — originated when Steve Chubb, its founder and chairman, heard of a breakthrough in cancer research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, while Downer, like his counterparts in other major companies, is constantly on the lookout for academic contacts that could lead to worthwhile additions to his company's product line.<P>

The reasons for this growing confluence of interests are easy to find. First, there is the by now universal recognition on the part of pharmaceutical industry leaders that the key to survival is the development not just of new products but of innovative and exclusive products. With cash cows being slaughtered by generic competitors as soon as they go off patent and me-toos more than likely doomed to failure, the race to develop or acquire agents that represent true therapeutic advances has heated up to combustible temperatures. The second reason is that such new products are far more likely to originate from basic research — the kind that is pursued in academic laboratories — than from the more goal-oriented approach of in-house investigations. As Jurgen Drews, M.D., president of Hoffmann-LaRoche International, has warned, the pharmaceutical industry doesn't generate enough new compounds to sustain its growth.<P>

No wonder that all leading companies, in addition to their internal research and development efforts, now have senior executives scouring university research sites looking for acquisitions with marketing potential. A clue to the scope of these efforts is that the international Licensing Executives Society (LES) now has between 5,000 and 6,000 members. Meanwhile, universities, alert to the financial rewards of cooperation with industry in this era of tight budgets, are placing increasing emphasis on their technology transfer efforts.<P>

<H5>The role of marketing</H5>

The ratcheting up of this extramural approach to drug development has not only made the role of industry's ambassadors to academia increasingly important; it has also brought new responsibilities — and new opportunities — to marketing executives. Downer lists four areas that often involve marketing people:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>They may be asked to participate in the assessment of licensing opportunities.
<LI>They can give their licensing executives leads as to areas of medicine they consider worth pursuing.
<LI>They should serve as their company's eyes and ears in spotting opportunities.
<LI>They may wish to consider career opportunities in the field of licensing.<P>
</OL>

Lita Nelsen, director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) technology licensing office, has found that marketing personnel often participate at the earliest stages of company/university discussions. The initial contact is usually by fax or phone. It may be that her office gets in touch with a company to make them aware of research at the university that has product potential, or the company may get wind of a discovery they want to know more about. Either way, her office sends out non-confidential information to enable the corporation to determine whether they want to know more. If the answer is yes, the next step is a meeting of the company's scientists and licensing executives with the investigators and her department. It's not at all unusual for the VP of marketing to attend as well.<P>

Since any viable product that might arise from the research is likely to be six to ten years down the 
road, this might seem somewhat premature. Says Nelsen: “If they're not actually at the meeting, they will be involved behind the scenes. After all, the company has to decide not only to pay MIT a little bit of money as a license issue fee, but to be willing to make the real investment — probably thousands of times more — once they determine to take the next step: going from the professor's bright vision to a marketable product. If they get there, it will have been worth it, but what if they don't? To answer that, they have to do two calculations. The first is a scientific and technical assessment as to whether there is likely to be a product and how much it will cost to develop it. The other is, once they have a product, will it be profitable.”<P>

That presents quite a challenge for the marketing and marketing research experts, and it requires an assessment of at least five basic issues:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>What is the size of the potential market?<LI>Is it a market we want to be in? Does it fit our long-term objectives?
<LI>Can the product be priced at a level that offers a reasonable return?
<LI>Do the modes of promotion and distribution offer a rational fit with our current and projected product line?
<LI>What's the competition likely to be like by the time we get to market?<P>
</UL>

These up-front assessments are likely to be decisive in the company's decision as to whether or not to proceed. No one wants to invest money, time, and energy in a long-term process that leads to a product they cannot sell or sell for a reasonable profit, or that will be successfully launched and have one or two good years, only to be surpassed by competing technology in year three.<P>

As Nelsen admits, “In the midst of such massive uncertainty, negotiating precise terms and wording of license agreements can have a surreal quality.” But it has been done and will be done again. What is required, she explains, is that the people on both sides of the negotiating table “can deal flexibly with uncertainty, defining conditions as precisely as possible while leaving room — and good will — for future negotiations if conditions change.”<P>

<H5>A career opportunity</H5>

The critical role of marketing judgments explains why so many corporate licensing executives have marketing backgrounds. Not all of them, of course. Some are scientists, others patent lawyers; but marketing people, Terry Downer believes, often have an edge. Having himself switched to his present assignment from his company's vice-presidency for marketing, he says it's a great job for someone with a marketing background.<P>

“People from product management or sales are well qualified. They have the necessary interpersonal skills, as well as the analytical training to be able to say,  ’This makes sense, but this doesn't.’ Anyone interested should read scientific publications such as Nature and ask lots of questions of the company's scientists and physicians. Another good preparation is to be ever on the alert, whether while attending professional meetings or having a cup of coffee with a consultant. We got one of our best product leads when a product manager spotted an abstract.<P>

A good marketing person who pursues a technology transfer career can make things happen,” Downer sums up. “You take a lot of facts and figures and ask yourself how such a product can best be marketed, whether it's right for your company, whether you can negotiate a good deal. Then you have to sell your management — convince them to put up a lot of money. It's a fascinating, multi-faceted job … and may well be the life blood of your company's future.”<P>

That explains why at every major healthcare company there are either people with specific responsibility for university relationships or people like Downer with broad responsibility for business development, including university liaison. They work intensively with their internal marketing and scientific people and, on the university side, with both research scientists and technology transfer staff. “The tech transfer people are our direct counterparts,” Downer says. “That's why I attend AUTM meetings and why they, in turn, asked me to make a presentation at their meeting. This relationship is important to both of us.”<P>

As many as 700 people, about half and half from industry and from universities, attend the AUTM annual meeting. As they get to know each other, they build an awareness of their respective interests. “That, in turn, helps us to get to know key faculty people and the projects they're engaged in,” Downer explains. “Generally, the contact with the technology transfer staff is only step one. As soon as we get a lead on something of interest, we'll want to talk to the professor face-to-face. If that proves promising, we will ask the university licensing office to send non-confidential data that can be shared with the company scientists.” They will do what Downer calls a quick-and-dirty, first-cut assessment with marketing and research. If their signal is go, the next step is to draw up a confidentiality agreement so as to permit a further sharing of data.<P>

<H5>The role of academia</H5>

Given the heavy involvement of marketing in this process, it pays for marketing and marketing research personnel to have a good understanding of the importance of technology transfer.<P>

There wouldn't even be a biotechnology industry if, in the early  seventies, Stanley Cohen of Stanford University and Herbert Boyer of the University of California had not invented the process of DNA cloning. At that time, working with industry had not only not been institutionalized, it was considered not quite nice by many research scientists. As a result, Stanford almost missed its chance to patent this discovery. If their news director had not called a New York Times story on recombinant DNA research which mentioned Cohen's role to the attention of Stanford's director of technology licensing, it might well have gone into the public domain. Even as it was, when the licensing office got in touch with Cohen, he was very reluctant to cooperate in seeking patent protection. Make money from a scientific discovery? That was not how academicians were supposed to act.<P>

Times have changed. Nowadays, everyone has been sensitized to the potential for getting rich from basic research, so the partnership between academia and industry is both well accepted and highly organized. Industry, too, has shed its preconceptions. It's highly unlikely that any company — at least any company with a future — still suffers from the once ubiquitous “NIH (not invented here) syndrome.” Liaison arrangements with university research facilities are now the norm rather than the exception.<P>

As Lita Nelsen points out, there is a great advantage in being in on the ground floor of university 
research. “The early stage of the research or the invention is a positive factor in the risk equation,” she says. “Because it is basic and early, the invention represents a head start in the field; it is also unlikely to be a me-too product. If the company can get exclusive rights to such an invention, it may be able to dominate the field of any products resulting from it.” What's more, the company's close relationship with the inventor is likely to keep it up-to-date on developments in that area of research. “It is this potential to get in on the ground floor of new technology that is leading so many biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and chemical companies — both large and small — to strengthen their relationships with universities,“ Nelsen adds.<P>

Other advantages of such an alliance include being plugged into the network of experts working in the company's areas of interest. Even the largest companies cannot afford to keep in touch with thousands of scientists — even if they knew of their existence. Yet significant new discoveries are being made every month, perhaps even every week, so neither can they afford to ignore them. The technology licensing offices of universities thus become the funnels through which critically important information is relayed to healthcare companies. Add to that the fact that liaison arrangements commonly lead to consulting relationships with key faculty members, which not only permit the company to tap into the professor's pool of knowledge, but also provide the consultant with a better understanding of what's involved in the commercialization of research. Downer stresses another advantage of these personal relationships: people get to know each other. “After all the marketing and scientific assessments,” he points out, “the final question often boils down to how well we think we can get along with the people involved.”<P>

Lita Nelsen adds: “By collaborating with a leading researcher in a particular field, particularly if the collaboration is long-range, the company is kept continuously up to date on developments not only at that institution, but if the academic researcher is truly at the forefront of the field and reasonable diligent in keeping abreast of the literature, the company will also become informed of other technology that may affect it.”<P>

All that is not to say that the relationship will always be smooth. As they approach their common goals from radically different orientations, the partners may well misunderstand each other's motives or even language. Certainly it is a good idea for any marketing executive involved in a relationship with academics to have an appreciation of their point of view.<P>

<H5>The clash of two cultures</H5>

Nelsen, who put in time in industry before joining MIT, comments that the differences between the two partners begin with their reasons for being. “The university sees its mission as  fostering the public good,” she says, “with two major objectives: to educate students and to discover and disseminate knowledge. All else, at least in theory, must be subordinate to these objectives.” That, to any socially aware pharmaceutical executive, is hardly an unbridgeable gap. However, such an executive is basically goal oriented. He or she wants to bring the best possible product to market as soon and as inexpensively as possible. Researchers don't disapprove of this objective, but see their work as “discovery” rather than “development” and therefore as open-ended and largely unpredictable. This makes them reluctant to define specific goals and to balk at firm commitments. “If we knew how the project will turn out, we shouldn't be doing it,” Nelsen quotes as a typical response when a professor is asked for help in laying out a critical path.<P>

And while the university technology manager is the liaison who can smooth some of the rough spots in the relationship, don't expect too much. Nelsen puts it bluntly:    “Because of the preeminence of the individual researcher, the university technology manager is quite limited in what she can promise.” For example, contracts may call for quarterly reports to be delivered to the sponsoring company, “but if the principal investigator does not write them, there is little she can do besides nag and plead.” That is why, she adds, it is so important for the company to establish a good relationship directly with the individual researcher. “Far more than in industry, individuals are the key to success.”<P>

<H5>Agreements and wedding contracts</H5>

While no two agreements are ever exactly the same, there are some standard alliances.<P>

The most basic, the <B>industrial liaison program</B>, is basically a subscription and coordination service that gives the company the right, in return for an annual fee, to be kept informed of developments in its area or areas of interest. It receives reports and articles, and is invited to meetings with faculty members or to special seminars. Usually, nothing proprietary is given to the company. “Instead,” Nelsen says, “the emphasis is on information, which is well screened, well-selected, and delivered in a timely manner.”<P>

If from this ongoing screening process a product potential is identified, there naturally have to be further negotiations as to how to proceed. The next step may be a formal <B>research collaboration</B>. At this point both sides have a fairly clear understanding of the goal, and they agree to do it in partnership because each side has knowledge or resources that the other needs as, for instance, when a researcher has discovered a particular receptor or screening technology while the company has drugs it wants to have screened.<P>

<B>Sponsored research</B> is a similar but more general arrangement. Typically, the company will contract with the university for research to be done in a defined area for a specified period of time. In return, the company expects to be given options to license whatever patents might come out of the research.<P>

Finally comes the desired culmination: the <B>licensing of intellectual property</B>. This can be negotiated even when there was no previous sponsoring or collaborative agreement. A faculty member makes a discovery … the university patents it … and the licensing office finds a company that wants to develop and market it. Conversely, of course, the liaison people at the company may hear of the discovery and approach the university. This could be either a manufacturer with a successful track record, or a start-up company — even an ambitious entrepreneur — in which case the university may also be helpful in securing venture capital and become an active participant in the start-up.<P>

<H5>So many rainbows …</H5>

It takes a lot of rainbows to find one pot o'gold. But when the pot is as rich as the Johnson & Johnson intravascular stent to maintain the patency of coronary arteries after balloon angioplasty, for example, it's obvious why the pursuit is worth it. And devices may be a safer bet than drugs — they are often further along in development.<P>

“It's very unusual to find any drug that's in Phase I or II, let alone Phase III,” Downer reports. “With devices, the road to market may be a good bit shorter. And with diagnostic agents, you can sometimes have a product tailored to your needs.”<P>

An example, he says, is when a product manager has a successful therapeutic agent in his portfolio and would like to maximize the value of sales calls by adding another product that complements it. Finding another, non-competitive form of therapy could take years, but the company's licensing executive may know of research being done that provides a springboard for the development of a diagnostic.<P>

“At all times,” concludes Downer, “what we're trying to do is to round out the portfolio. That's especially true if the product management group feels they can successfully sell something such as a device or drug delivery technology that will serve the physicians they are already marketing to, so as to make the sales calls more productive and establish more of a company presence. Equally important is coming up with a successor to a mainstay product before the patent expires.<P>

<CENTER><H3>A revolutionary vision goes to market:<BR>a case history</H3></CENTER>

By 1986, Steve Chubb, having completed a distinguished career as President of Hyland Diagnostics and as chief executive officer of two biotechnology startup companies (Cytogen and T-Cell Sciences) was ready for an entrepreneurial venture of his own.<P>

Through friends he heard that a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was on the track of resolving a controversial issue that had long puzzled cell biologists.<P>

As Chubb tells the story: “Prof. Sheldon Penman had become fascinated by such complex questions as, what accounts for and controls cell differentiation? What accounts for cell malignancy? Most other investigators had employed conventional methods such as extraction and fractionation. The revolutionary vision of Professor Penman and his postdoctoral fellow, Ted Fey, included a characterization of cells more as relatively rigid three-dimensional structures than as sacs of biological liquids. Proceeding with these theories, they employed unconventional techniques such as electron microscopy to examine cells, and produced images of their internal structures that resemble the fiber density of Brillo pads rather than the lightly packed structures that had comprised previous models. Another, and commercially more useful, observation was that when cells become malignant the composition of these insoluble proteins changes.”<P>

Meanwhile, Penman and Fey, too, had realized the commercial potential of their discovery and contacted MIT's technology licensing office. The office confirmed that their discovery — now named nuclear matrix protein or NMP technology — was both a scientific triumph and the basis of commercially viable diagnostic tests, and filed for broad patent protection on their behalf. With the licensing office acting as matchmaker, Chubb analyzed the NMP technology. “I quickly concluded that it easily conformed to my requirements for a commercial winner,” he recalls. “At that time cancer tests and detection methods relied on indirect structures, such as those found on cell surfaces. The fact that the Food and Drug Administration had approved virtually none of them was a clear indication not only of the fundamental flaws in these approaches, but of the enormous market opportunity as well.”<P>

He obtained MIT's support for a license for a new venture, which he named Matritech and which now — ten years later — stands at the threshold of its first product launch. In late November of 1995, the FDA's immunology devices panel of the medical devices advisory committee recommended approval of Matritech's NMP22 test kit for the detection of bladder cancer, on condition that the company provide some additional data, but without the need for another panel meeting. Having cleared this major hurdle, Matritech only needs final FDA approval and successful market entry to reach its long-awaited goal. Says Chubb: “We believe that the NMP22 test kit will become as useful in bladder cancer as the PSA [prostate specific assay] is for prostate cancer.” Already on the market in Europe, the test offers a non-invasive, accurate and inexpensive alternative to current methods.. And in the Matritech pipeline are products for detecting cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers — all based on that initial discovery that the protein composition of the nuclear matrix of cancer cells differs from that of normal cells. Best of all, thanks to MIT's patents, Matritech expects to have the nuclear matrix market all to itself.<BR>

<H4>Executive summary:</H4>
<I>After a year, we reconvened a panel of FDA observers and critics to assess the year past and the immediate future. They were not surprised at the lack of congressional action in 1995, nor do they see much chance for reform this year, citing the presidential election, lack of industry activity, and congressional disagreement as factors. The panel also does not see the FDA successfully reforming from within, despite advances made in speeding product approvals and some grudging approval of Commissioner Kessler.</I><HR size=4><BR>

<B><I>Exactly one year ago, MM&M convened a panel of highly informed observers and critics of the Food and Drug Administration and asked them two questions:<BR>

1. Supposing there were no FDA, how would you design the perfect drug review agency?<BR>

2. Now that a Republican majority committed to regulatory reform has taken over Congress, what do you think is actually going to happen?<P>

Their forecast regarding action was that not much would happen in 1995; later maybe lots. For a summary of the panelists' recommendations for speeding up product approvals and removing communication roadblocks, see end of story.<P>

When Congress adjourned for its mid-session break, we went back to our panelists and asked them to assess the lack of action in 1995 and to update their hopes and predictions.<P></I></B>

<HR size=4>

<B><I>MM&M:</I> Were you surprised by the lack of Congressional action in 1995?</B><BR>
<I>Beales:</I> In a word, no.<BR>
<I>Dickinson:</I> I wasn't surprised either. The lack of action was as I expected because FDA issues are small in the public's mind.<BR>
<I>Kamp:</I> Having worked with Senator Dole on a comprehensive telecommunications bill in 1984 that didn't pass until 1996, I'm not at all surprised that reform didn't happen overnight. In fact, it's exactly what I expected.<BR>
<I>Scheineson:</I> I was a little surprised that export reform [removing the ban on exporting products not cleared for domestic marketing] didn't pass. But instead of moving as a separate piece of legislation, it got wrapped up in the budget reconciliation act.<BR>

<B><I>MM&M:</I> Do you expect any FDA reforms to pass in '96?</B><BR>
<I>Beales:</I> There'll be a lot of talk and deliberation but no substantial legislation.<BR>
<I>Dickinson:</I> There's a remote chance in the medical device area; even less in drugs. In short: no.<BR>
<I>Kamp:</I> I'm not at all optimistic. There might be action on some of the smaller issues. Legislation to speed up the drug approval process, such as permitting third-party NDA reviews, might be introduced but I doubt full-scale reform will pass.<BR>
<I>Lenard:</I> Some actions are possible in '96. Major reforms will likely have to wait until '97 or longer.<BR>
<I>Scheineson:</I> The chances may be a little better than in '95, but I'm still skeptical.<BR>
<I>Vodra:</I> With Congress so preoccupied with much bigger issues and the '96 campaign already underway, I'm very doubtful.<BR>
<B><I>MM&M:</I> With a Congressional majority committed to reform, what's the problem?</B><BR>
<I>Beales:</I> Any significant legislation generates opposition from a variety of interest groups. FDA's role is a core function of government, and most people believe that drug regulation is something the government ought to be doing. Also, it's not clear how much effort the Republicans will make to move FDA reform legislation. While their basic desire to see something done is still there, some of the optimism of the early days of this Congress that they can enact such legislation is gone. The outcome of the '96 elections is likely to determine what will eventually happen.<BR>
<I>Kamp:</I> The most important reason for inaction is that the pharmaceutical industry is neutral or ambivalent. The larger companies, the ones represented by PhRMA [Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America] have not supported comprehensive reform in either the House or Senate, and PhRMA was very straightforward in saying it was not going to submit its own bill. In addition, the loss of PhRMA's senior staff members has seriously impaired its ability to lobby. [PhRMA recently lost its top two lobbyists, and President Gerald Mossinghoff has announced that he is leaving as soon as a successor can be found — editor.] In any case, I'm not convinced that the larger companies are all that anxious to have the basic rules of the road changed so long as they can get faster new drug approvals. They may not like the status quo, but they've adapted to it, and since industry always needs some kind of certainty, all change seems threatening. Smaller companies, however, especially the biotech and device companies, have been active in pushing legislation, but so long as industry overall doesn't indicate that it really wants reform, the likelihood of a comprehensive bill passing is very small.<BR>
<I>Lenard:</I> It takes time to educate people and have the type of public discussion and debate necessary to effect a major change. In addition, of course, there are a lot of interests comfortable with the status quo.<BR>
<I>Scheineson:</I> The House Republicans have to get more realistic. As long as they try to eliminate FDA or redefine its mission too radically, it's unlikely that any legislation will pass. Even if it were adopted in the House, it won't make it through the Senate, and it would face an almost certain veto. The closer the legislation comes to the Kassebaum bill [the omnibus legislation being pushed by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas], the better the chances of it being both enacted and signed.<BR>
<I>Vodra:</I> The scuttlebutt around Washington is that the House Republicans are very disappointed in both the Senate's Kassebaum bill and in industry's proposals. They want to see far more radical changes. Their hope is that they stand a better chance to see their agenda enacted in 1997, when there could be a Republican in the White House and also a change in the Senate after Senator Kassebaum's retirement. Also, members of Congress have observed how FDA is responding to the pressure by addressing many of the issues with internal reforms. There is a feeling that they may actually get further by keeping up the pressure than through legislation.<BR>
<I>Dickinson:</I> I agree with Bill. FDA has a solid, loyal constituency among liberal-leaning voters, consumers, and the media. Also, the agency's own measures of self-reform are seen as preempting legislation.<BR>
<B><I>MM&M:</I> What do you think of the Kassebaum bill? Is it a good bill? Is it likely to pass?</B><BR>
<I>Dickinson:</I> It's a good bill.<BR>
<I>Kamp:</I> In the communications area it may be worse than nothing. There is a very serious legal question as to whether FDA has the right to regulate promotion and even some advertising of pharmaceuticals. What the communications section of the Kassebaum bill would do is to codify the promotion regulations. Essentially, it would give FDA explicit authority to do the things it is now doing, and then make some exceptions. So while it would set limits, it would not loosen up on the communications process enough to really matter. In short, if a bill like this were to pass, the industry would be in worse shape in court than it is now. As for whether the bill is likely to pass, I doubt it. I don't think it goes nearly as far as the Republican leadership in both the Senate and House would like. Much depends, therefore, on what the leadership is prepared to do, and also on what industry wants. The Kassebaum bill reflects the wishes of the larger companies, but the smaller, more entrepreneurial companies want much more drastic action. Also, with Kassebaum not running for reelection, the dynamics in the Senate may change considerably next year.<BR>
<I>Lasagna:</I> Some of the things I would like to see happening I'm not sure can be achieved by legislation. For instance, the Kassebaum bill has an item about working collegially. Now that should be happening, of course, but it's motherhood and apple pie. How can you legislate that? On the other hand, its provisions for using outside experts in NDA [new drug application] reviews and for enacting performance standards are constructive. Whether having only one clinical trial for biologics makes sense I don't know.<BR>
<I>Lenard:</I> The good thing about the bill is that it shows that, even in a relatively moderate bill, some of the ideas we at the Progress and Freedom Foundation and others have been talking about are gaining currency. For example, the bill authorizes the Secretary to accredit outside organizations to conduct GMP [good manufacturing practices] inspections, which is consistent with the European approach to device regulation. Unfortunately, the bill puts qualifications on many of its provisions. For example, there is a provision that once a product is approved by either United Kingdom or European Union regulatory bodies, it should on a fast track to approval in the U.S. — provided the FDA has not met the time requirements established in its performance standards. Why? If the U.K. or E.U. approval systems are found not to present a risk to the public health, why make their use contingent on FDA's not meeting its performance standards? There's a similar qualification in regard to the hiring of outside experts to review product applications. It's made contingent on FDA not meeting its time limits for at least 95 percent of applications. Again, why? Either the outside experts are good enough to review products or they're not good enough. In sum, I would certainly prefer enactment of the PFF proposals. On the other hand, even a less-than-perfect bill provides a platform for better ideas.<BR>
<I>Scheineson:</I> The Kassebaum bill is a good first step, but essentially it only codifies the reforms the FDA itself is in the process of making, so in a sense it's illusory. The glaring deficiency in the bill is that it does not deal with the problem of off-label uses. FDA regulations forbid promoting or even disseminating information about unapproved indications. At the same time, it's become so expensive to get labeling changed that a lot of important uses and dosages are not getting into PDR [Physician's Drug Reference] or other references, and that is creating huge problems for both doctors and manufacturers. The chances of the bill passing the Senate are good, but the House is likely to require much more stringent reforms in the review process and in converting the agency's performance goals into legal standards, so action by both houses is problematic.<BR>
<I>Vodra:</I> The Kassebaum bill covers many of the points in PhRMA's proposals, but it is far more moderate than what such industry groups as BIO [the association of biotechnology companies] and HIMA [Health Industry Manufacturers Association] have proposed. And, as I mentioned, the House Republicans consider it insufficiently revolutionary and are waiting for Kassebaum's giving up the chair of her committee.<BR>
<B><I>MM&M:</I> What do you think of the FDA's internal reforms?</B><BR>
<I>Beales:</I> Obviously, the agency is trying to take off some of the pressure, but it moves in the right direction. So far, however, they haven't gone far enough, and I think it is very unlikely that they will.<BR>
<I>Kamp:</I> Basically, I don't think FDA is able to reform itself, either because of lack of will or lack of 
power. So far, their reforms in the marketing area are more of a veil than reality. For example, their proposals regarding enduring materials [see “As I See It,” <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I>, January 1996, p. 10] are mostly rhetoric. All they've done is open the question, which clearly puts them in a better position to defend themselves against the suit by the Washington Legal Foundation. Basically, I suspect that the agency's leadership is still committed to controlling company communications issues as much as possible.<BR>
<I>Dickinson:</I> I do believe that FDA is capable of reforming itself, and its measures will likely surprise everyone in the end. I agree, however, that in the communications area its reforms will not be adequate, and will depend greatly on judicial pressure in the WLF case.<BR>
<I>Lenard:</I> FDA's initiatives are better than nothing and show that performance can be improved when the pressure is on. But it's not a permanent fix and once the pressure is off, I'd expect FDA to go back to its previous pattern of behavior. Most importantly, there is no evidence that the FDA's initiatives have had an effect on development time and product availability — which are the most important measures.<BR>
<I>Scheineson:</I> The most glaring deficiency in the proposals so far is that they don't deal adequately with the issue of off-label uses. Because of the cost of additional clinical trials, more and more companies are applying for only a single indication, which creates huge problems when it comes to disseminating scientific information. But the FDA proposals address only the symptoms: relaxing a bit on the rules regarding reprints and textbooks. What we need is to address the basic flaw, by making it possible to get approval for additional indications by submitting paper NDA supplements based on published studies. What we need is something like the DESI [drug efficacy review] system put in place in 1962: letting a panel of experts, perhaps under the auspices of the National Academy of Science, review the data on all approved pharmaceuticals and bring the labeling up-to-date. Unfortunately, industry instead of going for an overall solution has chosen the back-door approach of trying the get FDA to ease up on the rules for circulating journal reprints.<BR>
<I>Vodra:</I> The FDA internal reforms are politically adept. They are intended to break up the anti-FDA coalition by giving certain constituencies the relief they want. Once these constituencies have their demands satisfied, the likelihood of their hanging in there with the other parties are very much diminished. That doesn't mean that some of FDA's reforms aren't meaningful. But others — such as the communications proposals — are not very helpful.<BR>
<B><I>MM&M:</I> What about FDA's claim that they've been speeding product approvals?</B><BR>
<I>Dickinson:</I> I don't hear any real complaints from drug companies about FDA's progress. I think the 
gains are real.<BR>
<I>Lasagna:</I> I worry whether their success in reducing the backlog of applications has been achieved by speedier approvals or by just rejecting more applications. Commissioner Kessler does deserve credit for the fact that NDA review time has gone down in the last year or two, but it still takes a lot longer than the six months Congress called for when it passed the 1962 statute. Therefore I still believe that farming out NDAs to outside contractors should be tried at least on an experimental basis. But a more basic issue is not the time to review NDAs — it's the time it takes to get an application ready for filing. Our figures suggest that it takes 10 to 12 years or even longer, and it's been stuck at that level for a decade or so. Of course, FDA argues that they are responsible only for the review time, but in fact manufacturers, unless they're crazy, try to anticipate what FDA will demand, so FDA plays a role in the fact that the number of trials per application, the number of patients per trial, and the number of procedures per patient are all going up. I'm not sure how much of this proliferation of data collection can be blamed on FDA — some may be essential and some may be window dressing — but the agency definitely bears part of the blame.<BR>
<I>Lenard:</I> I quite agree. There's been entirely too much focus on cutting a couple of months off the FDA review time, while ignoring the main issue of the increase in development time. That should be the target for improvement if we want to reduce the cost of developing new drugs.<BR>
<I>Scheineson:</I> Commissioner Kessler is touting statistics comparing U.S. and European drug approvals. That not only ignores the development time, it ignores the number of drugs that get scratched because the cost of performing the required clinical trials keeps going up. The hurdle you have to jump has been raised under the user fee standards. Another factor he ignores is that many companies now seek U.S. approval before applying in Europe for such business reasons as patentability and setting a market price that will help when pricing products under European price control systems. So citing the number of drugs that got approved first in the U.S. is not very persuasive.<BR>
<B><I>MM&M:</I> Speaking of Kessler, what do you think of his performance?</B><BR>
<I>Kamp:</I> That depends on whether you mean Kessler I, Kessler II, or Kessler III — the one appointed by George Bush, the one who adapted to Bill Clinton's election, or the one who took note of the Republican takeover of Congress. This Kessler III is a very different commissioner, much more forward-looking, and at least talking as if he were sincerely interested in speeding the approval process. Some pharmaceutical companies now see him as an ally rather than as an opponent. Under his leadership, FDA might even adopt sufficient meaningful reforms to mitigate the need for Congressional action. In the marketing area, however — advertising, promotion and public relations — Kessler still takes the position that the agency has the right to control communications. FDA has put forward a few proposals to loosen some of their most restrictive regulations, but their core position hasn't changed.<BR>
<I>Lasagna:</I> In terms of public relations, Kessler is the most effective commissioner I've known in 30 
years. He is extraordinarily good in selling his case. Take, for example, his pronouncements that the agency is fulfilling the deadlines demanded by the user fee legislation and that the drug lag has mostly disappeared. They are trying to get out of town ahead of the sheriff as it were, and to some extent they're succeeding. To give Kessler credit, he dealt with the generic scandal with a tough approach, he has recruited some terrific people, and while he has a long way to go, he did in fact take some definite steps toward speeding up the approval process. You also have to give him a lot of credit for his willingness to take the initiative on the tobacco issue, even though that was bound to antagonize some powerful members of Congress.<BR>
<I>Lenard:</I> To some extent, FDA does change with a change of commissioners, but the basic problems are not related to any one person. The most compelling piece of data is the increase in the length of review time over the last 30 years, so the overall problem is of long standing.<BR>
<I>Vodra:</I> Kessler is the lightning rod for people who don't like FDA, and an inspiration for those who do. He is important for getting the agency through a very rugged period, and if the Republicans take over the White House next year and we get a new commissioner we might even lose all the reforms Kessler has initiated. On balance, I don't see him as a liability to FDA at this point.<BR>
<B><I>MM&M:</I> What did you think of the FDA's hearings on DTC advertising and managed care promotion? And what about their new draft guidelines?</B><BR>
<I>Kamp:</I> There seemed to be an indication that some key agency officials realize that changes would be appropriate. For instance, in commenting on testimony about problems with the brief summary requirements in direct-to-consumer advertising, one agency official said that the problem is that it's neither brief nor a summary. Similarly, I got the impression that some among the professional staff don't think that regulating communications with MCOs is really a good idea. So the seasoned professionals may be having sober second thoughts, but I doubt that they will go as far as we wish in permitting free communications. Not only is that beyond Kessler's predilections; it may even be beyond what present legislation permits.<BR>
<I>Scheineson:</I> The new guidelines would permit distribution of journal articles that mention unapproved indications only if the mentions were incidental and if the articles were relied upon in the approval process. That's meaningless. FDA has said that there should be a free flow of scientific information. Well, free flow means free flow. What's more, unless Congress stops them, FDA is likely to insist on making labeling regulations apply to communications with managed care organizations. It's ridiculous that an agency with limited resources would use its medical review staff to assess pharmacoeconomic claims. The proposal to require “Med-Guides” for consumers for every prescription pharmaceutical is equally unrealistic. Not only is it an expansion of FDA's jurisdiction, since presumably they would consider these guides to be labeling and subject to agency review, but they are simply not needed. The U.S. Pharmacopeia patient education leaflets and printouts you get at pharmacy counters already required under Medicaid laws, but generally applied to everyone, are a good example of how the need for patient information is already being met. Anyway, if industry is required to do it, company lawyers will insist that not a word be changed from the labeling to avoid liability problems, so they'll scare the living daylights out of people.<BR>
<B><I>MM&M:</I> Final comments?</B><BR>
<I>Beales:</I> Some of the momentum and optimism of the early days of this Congress may have gone, but not the basic desire to reform FDA. The outcome of the '96 election is likely to determine what will eventually happen. Personally, I haven't changed my mind as to what needs to be done.<BR>
<I>Dickinson:</I> FDA will become a lot leaner but not meaner. The opposite, in fact, is already happening — the agency is far more anxious to please industry than it has ever been, and this will continue. The lessons of the generic drug scandals won't be forgotten, either. I'm really looking forward to a new, enlightened age in drug regulation and, with a nudge from the judiciary, some meaningful concessions to marketers.<BR>
<I>Kamp:</I> Instead of using the Kassebaum method of pushing a comprehensive bill, I think the House Republicans may get behind a series of small bills addressing specific issues, such as third-party reviews of NDAs. Provided the larger and smaller companies can agree among themselves, such bills might well pass.<BR>
<I>Lasagna:</I> It would be a great improvement if, in addition to the present FDA ombudsman, who can only address administrative matters, there were a truly impartial appeals process. As for legislative reforms, one of the problems is that there is such a wide range of proposals, going all the way from the trivial to such extremes as abolishing efficacy requirements. That makes it hard for Congress to get its act together and to act on such sensible proposals as permitting the use of reprints in promotion even if they mention unapproved indications...privatizing new product reviews...and frequent updating of labeling. As long as House freshmen hold out for punitive, extremist actions that the Senate won't go along with, there's a risk that even such moderate but meaningful reforms will be blocked and nothing will happen.<BR>
<I>Lenard:</I> Our [Progress and Freedom Foundation] proposals still look to a complete change in the process by which new drugs and devices are brought to market. Safety and effectiveness do not have to be sacrificed by the introduction of greater regulatory efficiency. We also call for an FDA-approval defense in liability suits. When you are dealing with products that affect life and death, it's inevitable that there could be problems, so it is harmful to innovation that, once a product has undergone the rigorous approval process, manufacturers should still be subject to liability suits. Finally, our proposal calls for making it easier to get approval for new uses. This mitigates the off-label issue, but there needs to be additional relaxation of the restrictions on the dissemination of information.<BR>
<I>Scheineson:</I> It's important for FDA to continue to modernize its regulatory approach...to seek industry input even after the specter of Congressional action disappears...to become a little more critical of its own operation...and to become more “user friendly” in its relations with the industries it regulates. As for Congress, I think the Republican freshmen will become much more sophisticated in their understanding of the existing system and for the need for checks and balances. As they gain a better understanding of the current system, they will look for ways to improve it rather than trying to throw out the entire history of food and drug regulation and to start from scratch. It's too bad that we lost a whole year through unsophisticated attempts to impose radical changes.<BR>
<I>Vodra:</I> The real issue concerning FDA reform is the budget. FDA resources are being cut back, and since the user-fee-supported activities are sheltered by law, that means that all their other activities will take an even bigger hit. This year, for instance, the resources for clearing abbreviated new drug applications were cut, and if there's final action to balance the budget in seven years, the cuts are going to be so substantial that FDA will be forced to rethink the way it does business. That, far more than legislation, will force real reform, and it's a point people tend to miss when they focus solely on legislation. Let me cite an example of a possible administrative improvement. One of the things that drives me crazy about FDA is that when they want information from a company they send out inspectors to pick it up instead of relying on the company to send it in. Who knows? With tighter budgets they may get to discover fax machines. A more substantive example is that, 20 years ago, they in effect deregulated cosmetics. It didn't take legislation. They just moved people to different slots. Let's hope that the new budget restrictions will persuade the agency not only to work smarter but to cut out unessential activities.<BR>

<CENTER><H1>The U.S. Retail Prescription Market Year in Review</H1>
<H5><I>by John H. Meyers</I></H5></CENTER>

<HR>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>Managed care continues to have a dramatic impact on the industry. Retail prescriptions continue to dominate with third-party payers now well over 50 percent of the market. A nationwide effort to control differential pricing, driven by the need to compete for MCO business, failed. Other implications: a decrease in detailing, expansion of the MCO sales force, increase in the importance of formulary listing, and continuing regionalization.</I><P>

<HR>

While it would be an overstatement to say that 1995 was “the year of managed care,” it <I>was</I> a year that managed care continued to increase its influence in the retail prescription marketplace. As a result, it was a year of shifting promotional effort, restructuring to be “closer to the customer,” and developing new strategies to address the needs of the new prescription influencers.The total retail cost of the prescriptions dispensed in the U.S. in 1995 advanced 13.9 percent to $64.6 billion, according to Walsh America/PMSI's <I>Source</I> information service which monitors approximately 70 percent of all dispensed retail prescriptions (see Table 1, below). In terms of prescription volume, the retail market grew 7.3 percent with 1,235,708,000 and 912,565,000 new and refill prescriptions, respectively, dispensed.<BR>
Extended unit growth at 5.1 percent, however, lagged behind that of total 
prescriptions. This was especially true in chronic markets where managed care plans, in an effort to control prescription costs, typically restrict patients to about a 30-day supply. This translates into more prescriptions dispensed per patient annually for the same amount of units dispensed.<BR>
Retail prescriptions continue to represent the bulk of the U.S. pharmaceutical market at over 59 percent (see Figure 1, below). These prescriptions are currently dispensed through various channels, including chain and independent drug stores as well as mass merchandisers and food store pharmacies.<P>

<H5>Pricing legislation fizzles</H5>

Cost containment in an era of managed care continued to dominate the retail pharmaceutical market in 1995. Pricing, in particular, was a focus as 32 states tried and failed in the first three quarters to pass laws preventing drug companies from engaging in “differential” pricing. At stake over the issue lies the ability of pharmaceutical companies to compete among cost-conscious managed care plans and the ability of managed care to attract customers.<BR>

While managed care works to attract customers, the results are reflected in its ever-growing portion of the retail market (see Figure 2, below). As of fourth quarter 1995, 52.3 percent of retail prescriptions were paid by third party payers, up 7.1 percentage points versus December 1994, and up 14 points versus December 1993. Viewed another way, managed care paid for an average of seven more retail prescription share points by state in December 1995 than December 1994 (see Figure 3, below). Cash prescriptions, those paid for by the patient at the pharmacy, fell 6.5 percent in the same period. The states with the fastest growth in managed care prescriptions were South Carolina, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, with increases of 17 percent, 14 percent, and 13 percent, respectively.<P>

Figure 2<P>

Figure 3<P>

Part of the reason for the strong third party growth in regions such as the Southeast lies in their slower than average acceptance of managed care. In fact, third- party prescribing in North Carolina and Georgia is still 5.5 percent below the all-state average of 49.5 percent despite rapid growth in those states.<BR>

Also behind the third-party growth is the increased use of Medicaid waiver programs. With federal Medicaid spending quadrupling in the last decade and doubling in the last five years, Medicaid spending in 1995 is now estimated at $89 billion for the federal government and $67 billion for states. Medicaid waiver programs transfer patients from Medicaid into managed care plans with the objective being to contain costs and provide better levels of care. This move has resulted in a 30 percent to 50 percent decrease in Medicaid prescribing in states such as Oregon, Rhode Island, and Hawaii.<BR>

States which have currently exercised Medicaid waivers include Arizona, Tennessee, Hawaii, Oregon, and Rhode Island. States with waivers pending include Washington, Ohio, Minnesota, Kentucky, and Michigan.<BR>

<H5>Integration strategies</H5>

How were companies reacting in 1995 to this increasingly cost competitive, and more frequently global, marketplace? The first answer lies in the merger and acquisition frenzy which continued throughout the year. While acquisition of pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) made the headlines in 1994, companies took a “wait and see” approach to further vertical integration in 1995. The yet-to-be-seen effect of so-called PBM/manufacturer “firewalls,” as well as the yet-to-be-proven benefits of owning a PBM, slowed further activity. Owning or being allied with a PBM is expected to help a drug company by giving them access to data they need to build partnerships with HMOs and other managed care systems. As to the tangible benefits that have been realized to date of owning a PBM, the jury is still out.<BR>

Although vertical integration lost its charm in 1995, horizontal integration and continued alliance activity heated up. The largest of these deals was the $14.2-billion bid by Glaxo for Wellcome. Also noteworthy were Hoechst's $7.1-billion acquisition of Marion Merrell Dow, Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc Rorer's $1.8-billion buy of Fisons, BASF's $1.3 billion acquisition of Boots Pharma, and the Pharmacia and Upjohn merger.<BR>

Typical of many of these horizontal acquisitions was the Hoechst announcement soon after its acquisition that the newly-joined pharmaceutical division, Hoechst Marion Roussel, would close more than half of its 77 pharmaceutical plants and cut 8,000 jobs worldwide — 19 percent of the division's total staff.<BR>

All of this activity resulted in a reshuffling of the top pharmaceutical companies when ranked in terms of total retail prescription volume. American Home Products ended up 1995 in the top position capturing 6.3 percent of the market, with over 136.3 million prescriptions dispensed (see Table 2, below). The company within the top 15 with the most significant growth was Mylan, registering 27.2 percent more prescriptions than in 1994. When ranked by total retail dollars, however, Glaxo Wellcome leads the pack with prescriptions representing $4.8 billion retail dollars.<P>

<img src="rxtb2.gif" width=600>
Table 2</P>

Horizonal acquisition, however, wasn't the only game in town in 1995. Pharmaceutical companies also formed over 170 alliances with biotechnology companies for a total declared value of more than $4.7 billion, according to a review by the consulting firm Feinstein Partners Inc., Cambridge, Mass. The average deal was for $38 million, with 35 agreements exceeding $50 million in value.<BR>

<H5>Generics: friend or foe?</H5>

The way in which pharmaceutical companies approached generics varied widely in 1995. Some companies viewed generics as an opportunity, helping recapture lost revenues when a product goes off patent or providing a more complete line of products to offer cost-focused managed care organizations. These companies are more frequently teaming up with traditional generic rivals in an attempt to provide disease management programs. Here, generic substitution can help brand-name companies cap overall costs of managing diseases.<BR>
A good example is Upjohn's disease management company, Greenstone Health Systems, which became part of Upjohn's generics subsidiary to more closely align disease management programs with generic offerings. Others include the Solvay and Shein mental health alliance, bundling Luvox with 26 other psychotherapeutic products and customized disease management programs. In an example of restructuring to capitalize on the strengths of both ethical and generic pharmaceutical divisions, Ciba and its generic drug subsidiary Geneva, merged domestic sales and marketing operations.<BR>

Other companies viewed generics with more wary an eye. Merck announced plans to discontinue West Point Pharma. As a result, Medco canceled incentive rebate payments to pharmacists using West Point generics. In addition, Roche/Syntex announced plans to begin phasing out Hamilton Pharma Generics business because “it no longer fits with the strategic focus.”<BR>

In either case, both branded and generic products top the list in terms of total prescription volume in 1995 (see Table 3, below). Premarin was the drug dispensed most often in retail pharmacies, capturing 39.2 million prescriptions. The number 2 and 3 products were Apothecon's antibiotic Trimox and the generic pain reliever Hydrocodone/APAP at 33.6 and 31.0 million prescriptions respectively. The portion of prescriptions paid for by managed care varied widely across products, with 55 percent or more prescriptions for brands like Premarin, Zantac, and Prozac being paid by third-party payers.<BR>

The top ten generic companies accounted for 25 percent of dispensed retail prescriptions (see Table 4, below). This represented 11 percent of the $64.6 billion market, in terms of retail dollars.<P>

Table 4<P>

<H5>Sales structure changes</H5>

Pharmaceutical companies made a number of changes within the sales and marketing arena to address the ever-growing managed care segment. Managed care now pays for 52.3 percent of all retail prescriptions, with PBMs managing 34.6 percent of retail prescriptions in the fourth quarter 1995 up from 26.7 percent in the same period 1994. PBMs continue to increase their influence over drug selection by managing HMO formularies and imposing other cost containment methods such as differential co-payments for employer groups (see Figure 4, below).<P>

<img src="rxfg4.gif" width=600>
Figure 4<P>

The top ten corporate managed care plans grew at an average rate of 20 percent from the first quarter of 1995 to quarter four with the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association ranked the largest corporate payer in terms of total prescription volume (see Table 5, below). Corporate managed care organizations are identified as those having affiliates.<P>

<img src="rxtb5.gif" width=600>
Table 5<P>

All this activity has had interesting implications for sales and marketing within a managed care world. According to Scott-Levin's Sales Force Structures & Strategies 1995, promotion shifted in 1995 with details dropping 7 percent from 1994 levels while pharmaceutical company-sponsored meetings, on the other hand, rose 31 percent. Pfizer led the industry in promotional expenditures in 1995, spending $364 million and $93.7 million for details and events, respectively. Pfizer also led the industry in calls in 1995 with 2.7 million, followed by American Home Products and Glaxo Wellcome with 2.4 million and 2.2 million respectively. In addition, the corporations that showed the greatest growth in detail spending in 1995 were Abbott Labs (+22 percent), Bristol-Myers Squibb (+14 percent), and Merck (+13 percent).<BR>

Managed care sales forces also continued to expand. Pharmaceutical 
manufacturers made 8 percent more calls to managed care pharmacy directors in the spring of 1995 than in the spring of 1994 — from 2,800 calls to almost 3,000 — according to Scott-Levin's <I>Managed Care Pharmacy Executive Promotional Audit</I>. Zeneca, SmithKline Beecham, and Eli Lilly are rated the top three for “best contracting practices.”<BR>

Coordination and communication between the managed care national account managers and the traditional field sales reps have also increased as more office-based physicians feel the direct impact of formularies and other managed care cost containment vehicles. As a result, doctors are beginning to increase their awareness of a drug's formulary status. According to Scott-Levin's <I>Physician Drug and Diagnosis Audit</I>, for ACE inhibitors, for example, the percentage of time that physicians indicated their drug choice was on formulary increased from 25 percent in September 1994 to 28 percent in May 1995. A similar pattern was noted for calcium blockers, with the percentage increasing from 24 percent to 26 percent over the same three quarters. In the office setting, physicians appear to be more aware of formulary status. In the ACE class, the percentage of time office-based physicians indicated that their drug choice was on formulary increased from 21 percent to 25 percent while for calcium blockers the increase was from 21 percent to 27 percent.<BR>

Movement toward regional business units proved one of the more popular ways to respond to the changing customer base in 1995. More and more companies are viewing the U.S. marketplace not as one big market but as six to ten smaller ones, each demanding an individual strategy to capitalize on regional marketing forces.<BR>

A single sales and marketing approach for the entire nation does not work because 
of the varying needs of managed care and other large customers and most major pharmaceutical companies have now established regional business units in some shape or form. Last year, Roche announced that they were redesigning their sales force with 20 local business units divided among four U.S. regions; Zeneca formed 6 regional business units.<BR>

In a survey of quality and familiarity, Pfizer Labs' sales organization was ranked number one by physicians in nine core specialty groups, according to Scott-Levin's <I>Sales Force Structures & Strategies 1995</I>. The study also found that Glaxo was ranked highest by pharmacists and physician assistants and Wyeth-Ayerst was named best by nurse practitioners.<BR>

It is these field sales reps that are working to understand and address each individual prescriber's reaction to managed care. And, prescribers do respond to managed care differently. For one thing, the number of managed care plans paying for a prescriber's prescriptions vary based on the prescriber's medical specialty. Highly specialized areas, such as psychiatry and ophthalmology, for example, prescribe for fewer plans — 5.3 and 6.5 plans, respectively. Allergists prescribe for the most plans, an average of 12.7 plans per prescriber (see Figure 5, below).<P>

<img src="rxfg5.gif" width=600>
Figure 5<P>

It is also important to note that prescribers are no longer just physicians. According to the American Association of Physician Assistants (AAPA), for example, the number of physician assistant (P.A.) graduates per year is up 25 percent versus three years ago with over 33,500 P.A.s now registered. In addition, 30 new P.A. programs are awaiting accreditation. In 1995, P.A.s — as well as other ancillary prescribers such as nurse practitioners, optometrists, and podiatrists — have had demonstrable effect on drug prescribing.<BR>

And while changes are occurring within each pharmaceutical company to, in the worst case, manage through and, in the best case, capitalize on the changing environment, the environment itself, both retail and non-retail, continues to change. A case in point is the growth of integrated health care systems. With managed care the driving force, integrated systems are health care financing and delivery organizations created to provide a continuum of care ensuring that patients get the right care at the right time by the right provider. While the structure of integrated systems vary and is continuing to evolve, the idea is to use partnerships between health care providers, insurers, and even payers to provide enhanced care.<BR>

Other changing customers include the long term care market. Control of pharmacy 
services for nursing homes is in fewer and fewer hands as pharmacy providers merge and consolidate. Pharmacy services for one-third of the 1.77 million nursing home beds in the U.S. are now controlled by the top nine pharmacy provider companies, according to Scott-Levin's <I>Long-Term Care Pharmacy Provider Profiles</I>. And regional nursing home pharmacy providers are tightening control over drug dispensing. More than half (56 percent) of regional providers use formularies — up from only 44 percent in 1993.<BR>

<H5>What cures us?</H5>

Despite managed care, one thing remains constant: pharmaceuticals continue to be one of the most cost-effective ways of treating the diseases which ail us (see Table 6, below). While the top six therapeutic drug classes did not change from 1994, the rate of growth varied widely. The leading growth market among the top 15 markets was selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which also led the industry in 1995 promotion with a 25-percent increase in details and a 33-percent rise in events.<P>

<img src="rxtb6.gif" width=600>
Table 6<P>

Companies continue to look for innovative ways to reach new customers and 1995 
was no exception. According to the Task Force for Compliance of the National Pharmaceutical Council, noncompliant patients cost the U.S. economy an estimated $100 billion yearly in lost productivity and extra medical costs — not to mention lost product sales. Disease management programs, as well as patient-focused education and promotional programs, often are implemented to target the problem of under use. <BR>

Direct-to-consumer promotion proved to be an even more popular means of building brand loyalty and share in 1995. Virtually all physicians (99 percent) admit they will at least consider prescribing a drug a patient asks for by name, according to Scott-Levin's <I>Direct-to-Consumer Advertising 1995</I>. And 17 percent say they are likely to prescribe it. In addition, more patients are asking doctors about drugs, physicians report. In 1995, 51 percent of patients were inquiring about drugs; in 1992, 44 percent did; in 1989, only 21 percent brought up the subject.<BR>

Over-the-counter (OTC) products continue to be introduced to reach a mass 
consumer audience and build product usage. The increasing number of OTC products has also has effect on the retail prescription market. The 1994 introduction of cimetidine, a generic form of SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet, posed the first generic threat to antispasmodics. By the end of 1995, cimetidine ranked third in total prescriptions for antispasmodics with 13 percent of the market. While many expected cimetidine and two new OTC products, Pepcid AC and Tagamet HB, to erode prescription activity in 1995, total prescriptions for traditional antispasmodics rose 7 percent to an all-time high of 67.1 million.<BR>

Focusing marketing effort on the patient has helped create an entirely new physician-patient dynamic. Technology advances have also contributed as more patients delve into databases to second-guess doctors. According to the<I> Wall Street Journal</I>,“ the rise of health-maintenance organizations and other managed-care plans has fed patient fears — and skepticism. At HMOs, 'people often don't know their doctors, and have reason not to trust them because of the financial incentives offered' to cut costs.” As a result, medical databases and on-line medical information services are proliferating.<BR>

It is without doubt that managed care continues to impact us — our industry, our customers, our very way of doing business. These trends were especially evident when looking at the 1995 retail prescription market in review. And they will, no doubt, continue to demonstrate their affects throughout 1996.<P>

<H1>Trental Goes on the Offensive</H1>
<I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></CENTER>
<HR size=4><BR>

<H3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H3>

<I>With genericization looming in 1997, Hoechst Marion Roussel has gone on the offensive with a three-pronged, market-specific “symptom awareness” campaign to expand Trental's prescriber base before the inevitable arrives.</I><P>
<HR size=4><BR>

Trental (pentoxifylline) has been on the market since 1984 for intermittent claudication, an aspect of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in which patients experience severe leg cramps while walking, cold feet, and paresthesia or numbness. As the only drug approved by the FDA for this condition, Trental is, in effect, the market, with sales approaching $200,000,000 in 1995. Facing patent expiration in 1997, Hoechst Marion Roussel has opted to maximize return on the brand in 1996 with a new campaign before the price-cutting begins and, hopefully by the effort, to establish a prescriber base resistant to generics. “We're not just going to wait around and see what happens,” says Steve Cullinan, product manager at HMR. “It's time to become even more aggressive in the marketplace.”<P>

Trental already has a track record for energetic promotion — being an early practitioner of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising, for example. To escalate promotion, HMR and its agency, Dudnyk Healthcare Communications, are employing both humorous and threatening graphics to dramatize the symptoms of intermittent claudication and, in a logical execution of a market segmentation strategy, have created varying campaigns for three prescribing audiences — specialists and other physicians with a high Rxing potential, podiatrists, and minority M.D.s (African-American and Hispanic).<P>

<H5>One size fits one</H5>

HMR and Dudnyk have discarded the “one-size-fits-all” approach — a single creative statement for all audiences — for tailored programs to homogeneous groups. “The underlying theme is symptom awareness,” says Carleen Niemiec, Dudnyk's vice president and creative director, “but we felt that each segment of the audience deserved its own campaign look. From our research and experience, we knew the key to building loyalty in a segment was to create materials targeted specifically to psychographic and prescribing behaviors.”<P>

In late March, promotion began to the three audiences with high Rx'ers receiving both fieldforce and print coverage. For podiatrists and minority physicians, Steve Cullinan explains, “There were some physician segments that we've always wanted to go after, but they aren't cost-effective to reach through personal selling. We've always felt strongly that highly targeted print advertising and direct mail could be the way to reach these audiences.”<P>

The general M.D. campaign presents the cruel jaws of a bear trap with the headline, “It used to feel like my leg was caught in a bear trap” — a quote from a patient describing symptoms. The visual has been the centerpiece of recent Trental DTC advertising. Physician ads using the trap began in March and are intended to coordinate with the consumer program. The thinking behind this approach to patients and M.D.s is, according to Niemiec, “Physicians are hesitant to prescribe medications for symptoms that are not a great threat to a patient's overall health. Symptoms like cold feet and paresthesia aren't always compelling reasons for a patient to see a doctor — or for a physician to prescribe Trental. So we knew a two-part campaign was needed promoting the importance of symptoms — and their treatment — to both potential patients and potential prescribers.”<P>

Says Cullinan, “I like the visual of the bear trap because it immediately conjures up images of leg pain associated with intermittent claudication. And it was bold, different. In the past, we've focused on other symptoms, but pain is more of a motivation for the patient to go to the doctor — and for the physician to prescribe Trental.”<P>

<H5>Attention trap</H5>

Is the bear trap too threatening — possibly an overstatement? Cullinan responds, “Sure, the bear trap may be an exaggerated depiction of pain, but that kind of exaggeration is often what gives an image stopping power. And in this case, the exaggeration only serves to reinforce the brand's indication, so it's appropriate.” This creative approach will appear in direct mail and also in a three-dimensional pop-up sales aid — a sure “grabber.”<P>

For podiatrists, the graphic is much more friendly and whimsical. A patient's big toe is given a comic personality — dressed in a scarf and muffler for “cold feet” or with a sleep mask and nightcap for a foot that feels “asleep.” Why humor here when menace worked elsewhere? Niemiec supplies the rationale. “You can't always generalize about an audience, but in this case we had a good indication that podiatrists are not offended by and, in fact, enjoy humorous approaches in product advertising. So we capitalized on that and created a campaign that uses humorous personifications of feet to get across the message that as podiatrists they can be on the “front line” for diagnosing and treating symptoms of PAD.”<P>

Mailers to podiatrists offer samples, patient literature, a poster, and an opportunity to win the <I>1995 Yearbook of Podiatric Medicine and Surgery</I>.<P>

<H5>Developing brand loyalty</H5>

With minority M.D.s, the promotion is also light in tone. Mailers show feet and legs caked in ice, twisted into knots, and pierced by pins and needles. In preparing this promotion, Dudnyk worked with African-American and Hispanic medical organizations to develop the looks and messages for these audiences. Dudnyk reports that their market research indicates these physicians and their patients tend to be loyal to brands that create materials specific to their needs.<P>

The marketing idea behind paying special attention to this class of M.D.s appears in the first paragraph of body copy in the direct mail pieces:<BR>
<CITE>Statistics show that African-Americans have a much greater incidence of diabetes and hypertension than other patient groups. Unfortunately, the same factors (like diet and smoking) that put them at risk for those diseases may also put them at risk for developing intermittent claudication — a symptom of peripheral arterial disease (PAD).</CITE><P>

Mailers offer the physicians samples and a free waiting room poster on PAD and African-Americans.<P>

HMR and Dudnyk are not the first company/agency team that have tried to soften a brand's landing in the harsh world of generic competition. Strategies have ranged from price cutting, to take the steam out of a low-cost entry; patient involvement systems, to lock up chronic condition patients with ingratiating services they would not receive from generic suppliers; marketing a lower-cost, branded generic before patent expiration, to capture the switch momentum for yourself; and even discontinuing promotional spending to maximize return before cheaper competition begins devouring the business. None of these has been markedly successful in slowing dramatic sales erosion.<P>

<H5>Scratching a niche</H5>

Trental's new program is an example of another strategy which aims to boost sales before genericization so that, although the product goes into the inevitable decline, greater income is returned on the brand short-term because it has begun its descent from such a high level. What makes Trental's campaign unusual is the audience segmentation and the creative variety in the program to drive the brand as high as it can go. (Trental's goal in 1996 is $250,000,000.) Seeking niches that may resist generic pressure is also an admirable marketing tactic. It will be interesting to see how well it all succeeds. Launch Pad will make an effort to follow up with HMR and Dudnyk and report back.<P>

Some of the publications carrying the campaign are: <I>American Family Physician, JAMA, American Medical News, Emergency Medicine, Physicians Financial News, Family Practice Medicine, Managed Care, Postgraduate Medicine, Diabetes Educator, Medical Economics, Podiatry Today,</I> and <I>Medico Interamericano</I>.<P>

At Dudnyk, Vice President and Creative Director Carleen Niemiec, and Vice President and Associate Creative Director Barry Schmader, developed concepts for all the campaigns. Niemiec handled art direction and Schmader the copy. Strategic direction was set by the brand team which includes the Creative Group and Senior Account Executive Elisa Kraus, Vice President and Account Supervisor Nina Goodheart, and Steve Cullinan, product manager at Hoechst Marion Roussel.

HMR and Dudnyk discarded the “one-size-fits-all” approach in the Trental campaign. This advertisement is aimed at specialists and M.D.s with high prescribing potential to overcome hesitancy giving medication for symptoms that are not a great threat to a patient's overall health.<P>

<H2>Specialty Journals and 
non-journal media</H2>

<HR size=4>

<H1>A Stronger Pulse for Specialty Journals?</H1></CENTER>

Year-end 1995 HCI <I>Medical Promotion Audit</I> figures show five of the eight specialty markets with increased advertising activity. Dental and hospital management recorded growth in excess of 11 percent. This reflected a continuing strong performance for hospital management, and a significant increase for dental advertising, which mustered only three percent growth in 1994. The optometry market had a 7.5-percent gain, but this figure was far below the 16-percent increase posted in '94. The laboratory segment rebounded from a six-percent decline in 1994 to an increase of almost five percent in '95, while ophthalmology spending likewise swung from a six-percent negative to a three-percent positive figure. While these five markets recorded stronger advertising activity in 1995, the remaining three — nursing, pharmacy, and radiology — continued to shrink, albeit at a lesser rate than in 1994. Pharmacy spending slid by seven percent, while nursing advertising was off 6.6 percent, a slight improvement from '94's 8.3-percent decline. While spending in radiology journals continued to fall, the 3.7-percent slippage was a far cry from the 1994 decline of almost 16 percent. Overall the trend in 1995 was positive, reflecting a rise in activity, the same as was the case in the much larger medical surgical field.

<H5>Non-journal media are down...but up</H5>

HCI's audit of non-journal media showed a decline of 36 percent, with its share of total promotion dropping from 18 percent in 1994 to 12 percent in 1995. However, this apparent decline is primarily the result of <I>MNN</I> and <I>American Medical Television</I> dropping out of the picture. Spending for products tracked in both years increased by 13 percent. Outlays for Rx pads grew by two percent, reference guides by eight percent, and other office forms by 50 percent. Among reference guides, 
HCI figures show prescribing guides out-performing other references at a growth rate of 26 percent. Other office forms grew in large part due to the re-introduction of <I>Telegard</I> replacing <I>Medical Telelog</I>.<P> 
<img src="ADVER1.GIF"><P>
Table 1 (above) lists the top ten non-journal media during 1995, according to HCI.<P>

<img src="ADVER2.GIF"><P>
Table 2<P>
<img src="ADVER3.GIF"><P>
Table 3<P>

Tables 2 and 3 (above) list the top 20 advertisers and products in HCI's <I>Medical Promotion Audit</I>, ranked according to total promotion. Each table also gives the breakdown between journal and non-journal spending. Glaxo Wellcome was the biggest spender overall, and the leading journal advertiser, followed by Merck. SmithKline easily spent the most in non-journal media, accounting for over 13 percent of total outlays, followed by Bayer at 10.2 percent. Adalat CC was the most-promoted product, with the second highest journal budget. Paxil was by far the biggest user of non-journal media, with 9.5 percent of all expenditures.<BR>

<H5><A HREF="dental.htm">DENTAL</A>: STRONG GROWTH FOR DENTAL</H5>

Advertising in dental journals grew 11.4 percent in 1995. A significant increase over 1994's 2.8 percent growth.<BR>

Once again Densply was ranked number one, with a 6.2 percent share of spending, followed by Proctor and Gamble (2.5 percent share). Henry Schein had the largest increase in spending in the top 25 companies and moved into the top 12 (7th) with support for their Easy Cam Intraoral Camera and Easy Dental Software Products. The other two companies to break into the top 12 were Glidewell Laboratories (10th) and 3M (12th). Moving up the top 12 rankings were Ivoclar whose 74.9-percent increase pushed it to fifth, Ultradent increased spending for its Viscostat Hemostatic Syringe and Astringent Homeostatic Solution to become third.<BR>

Surprisingly, only one company (Parkwell Today) in the top 12 reduced its support level, and then by only 4.6 percent. Those companies which made significant cuts dropped out of the top 12. Colgate Palmolive cut spending for Platinum Tooth Whitener and Gelkam Fluoride Gel and dropped to 24th. Oral-B stopped advertising Minute Foam and O-B Prophy material. It also halved the funds behind Oral-B Advantage Plaque Remover. The result was 20th place. Lastly, Warner Lambert whose reduced support for Listerine Mouth Wash was not offset by funds allocated for the launch of Listerine Toothpaste, fell to 14th.<BR>

Product support is volatile. Of the 1995 top 12, two were in 1993's top 12 and a different two in 1994's. Crest remains the most heavily supported product, albeit in another form; last year it was Crest Tartar Control and, in 1955, Crest Gum Care. The other new products were Colgate Total Tooth Brush (8th) and Practice Builders (10th). The biggest increases in support were for: Prime & Bond composite Bonding Agent (281.5 percent), Rembrant Gel Plus (104.2 percent), and Lodine 400 (168.5 percent).<BR>

On the negative side, Crest Tarter control was cut 98.0 percent, Listerine Mouth Wash 61.2 percent, Plax Mouth Wash 46.5 percent and Nite White Tooth Whitener 24.1 percent.

<H5><A HREF="HOSPITAL.HTM">HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT</A>: ANOTHER STRONG YEAR DESPITE CHANGES</H5>

Advertising in hospital management journals continues to be strong. 1995 was another good year with advertising up 11.4 percent. One would expect that sustained growth would go hand in hand with stability among the largest spending companies and product, but this is not the case. Among the top 12 companies, half were not in the top 12 last year and the others have changed places.<BR>

The number one ranked company is DuPont Pharmaceuticals with 1.46 percent of the dollars spent. Last year they were fifth. Ranked second was the National Electric Information Corporation up from 252nd. This was due to support for the National Electric Information Network. Third was the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Co. None of these were in the top three last year. The other companies to make the top 12 were Siemens Medical Systems at 6th (from 24th), Comphealth at 7th (from 244th), Landis & Gyr Powers at 8th (from 95th), IBM at 10th (was 141st), and Browning-Ferris Industries at 12th (from 15th). Only Kodak among the top 12 reduced spending; dropping from 2nd to 5th. The companies that dropped out of top 12 were: Hillenbrand Industry going to 496th from first as they essentially stopped advertising, the Greenwood Trust (10th) stopped supporting the Discover Card, 3M Healthcare (3rd) is now 16th, Lederle Laboratories slid from 7th to 19th, Emcare from 9th to 15th, and Johnson Controls from 11th to 34th.<BR>

Of the top 12 products in 1994, five remained in 1995 (Coastal Physicians, BFI Medical Waste Systems, Emcare, Milliman Robertson Services, and Verelan). Verelan was the only one to cut spending and fell from 2nd to 9th. The new top ranked product was NEIC Networking Systems which started advertising in June 1994. The only other new product to break into the top 12 was IBM Network Systems at sixth. The other products all received large increases in support; all over 200 percent. Comphealth Staffing ranked 2nd versus 354th (a 1,318.7 percent increase). Landis & Gyr 4th from 77th, Valic Retirement Plans 102nd to 10th, Amsco Company ads 122nd to 11th, and the Wyeth-Ayerst Managed Care Division 12th from 90th.

<H5><A HREF="LABS.HTM">LABORATORY</A>: SPENDING STABILIZES</H5>

In 1995 manufacturers increased spending 4.4 percent for laboratory equipment and services, after reducing it 6.0 percent in 1994.<BR>
The Laboratory Market is reasonably stable as 1995's top five were all in 1994's top six. The one that dropped out, Bayer Diagnostic, fell to 9th (from 3rd) after they stopped supporting the Clinitek Urine Analyzer and Glucometer Encore AQ System. Behring Diagnostics strengthened its hold on the top spot with a 45.8 percent increase, raising their share of spending to 8.4 percent. The Syva Range of products were the beneficiaries and had three products in the top 12. Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics was second with a 5.9-percent share. Olympus increased support for the AU800 Analyzer raising them from 6th position to 4th. Becton Dickinson increased their rankings four places to 6th. The only dramatic increase in spending among top 12 companies was by AVL Scientific Corp, who increased their advertising 379.8 percent. This placed them 11th compared with 71st last year. The other two new companies in the top 12 were Johnson & Johnson Clinical Diagnostic at 8th (from 15th) and Sysmex at 12th (from 21st).<BR>
Three companies dropped out of the top 12. Roche Diagnostic cut spending on most of their supported products and fell two places to 13th. Ciba-Corning reduced spending by 51.7 percent to fall to 16th (from 7th). Biomerielux-Vitek also cut their advertising by over 50 percent to fall to 34th (from 12th).<BR>
The product picture is different with only four of last years' top 12 repeating. Of 1995's top 12, 10 were not advertised in 1993 and the other two were ranked 72nd and 84th; 18 of the top 50 and 41 of the top 100 were advertised for the first time in 1995. However, only two products in the top 12 were new in 1995 — the Syva 30R System (4th) and the AU800 Chemical Analyzer and Emit System (10th). 
Between them, the AU800 and Syva lines of products accounted for 5 of the top 12 products. In addition to the 4th ranked Syva 30R, there were the Syva Drugs of Abuse Testing System, ranked number one (from 8th), and Syva Laboratory Solutions at 9th (from 27th). AU800 Chemical Analyzer and Emit System at 10th was joined by the AU800 Analyzer at 11th (from 57th). The products to enter the top 12 were Quanta Lite Elisa with a 406.0-percent increase to 5th, Technicon Immunoassay System (7th) and the ACA Star Laboratory Analyzer (12th).<BR>
Eight products dropped out of the top 12. They included 1994's top duo. Two ranked below 200, Inova who was first and ACA (12th). Two fell below 100, Cxpress Laboratory System at 104th and LD Cholesterol Test at 109th. The other four were B-Max 50 Microscope System (2nd to 14th), Dimenscor AR (7th to 92nd), ACS 180 System (10th to 16th), and AX System Immunoanalyzer (11th to 17th).

<H5><A HREF="NURSE.HTM">NURSING</A>: ADVERTISING CONTINUES TO SLIDE AS RECRUITMENT REMAINS SOFT</H5>

Advertising in nursing journals fell 6.6 percent in 1995, compared with 8.3 percent in 1994.<BR>
This market is dominated by recruitment advertising, which continues to be very soft. Local and national recruitment accounted for just over 30 percent of all spending down in 1995, from nearly 50 percent in 1992. Local recruitment dollars fell 16.9 percent and national recruitment 5.7 percent in 1995. All other 
advertising fell 2.3 percent. The second most important category is insurance (Nurses Service Organization and Professional Nurses Organization). Their combined share of spending has remained steady at 6.2 percent.<BR>
Four companies broke into the top 12 in 1995; one had not advertised before and the others had strong growth. The new company was I.C.U. Medical, whose support for its Clave Needless connector placed it 5th. The three companies that rose up the rankings were: Becton Dickenson (11th) with support for the Insyte Autoguard Shield and Vacutainer Safety-Lok Blood Collection Set, Ohmeda (12th) due to spending behind Brevibloc and Revex, and Marion Merrell Dow (+38.04 percent to 10th) as Cardizem IV received increased advertising.<BR>
Within the Top 12, six companies received lower levels of support. The largest decline was for Convatec (-34.6 percent) followed by Local Recruitment (-16.5 percent). Four companies dropped out of the Top 12; 3M Health (16th), MBNA (22nd), B. Braun (19th), and Lippincott (18th).<BR>
Of the top 12 products or services, 8 are recruitment and two insurance (Nurse Insurance and Professional Liability). Only two (Clave Needless Connector and Tubex Blunt Point Sterile Cartridge Unit) are products. They both are entered the top 12 this year.

<H5><A HREF="OPTHAL.HTM">OPHTHALMOLOGY</A>: TURNS AROUND IN 1995 AFTER LAST YEAR'S DECLINE</H5>

Advertising in ophthalmology journals recovered somewhat during 1995, up three percent, following a six-percent decline in 1994.<BR>
Among the top 12 advertisers, seven have made the list for three years in a row. Storz Ophthalmics regained the number one spot (previously held in 1993) as spending increased by 12.0 percent. Alcon Surgical moved into second place (from number four the previous year) following a budget increase of 11.2 percent. Alcon Laboratories slipped from number one in 1994 to number three as spending dropped by 38.1 percent.<BR>
Companies making the top 12 for the first time in 1995 include Merck, advancing from 89th to 4th place, Coherent Medical Group, which increased spending by 102.6 percent and Pharmacia, Inc. which did not advertise in 1994. A 50.4 percent reduction in journals at Allergan drove the company from 2nd place to 5th in 1995. Outlays at 6th place Allergan Medical Optics were virtually unchanged from the previous year while Ciba Vision Ophthalmics, down 16.4 percent, completes the list of those in the top group which reduced advertising.<BR>
Merck's move to 4th place is directly related to support provided for Trusopt (ophthalmic solution) which ranked number one in spending among all products and Timoptic F the ophthalmic beta blocker which achieved the number three spot. Second place was held by Allergan's Acular which cut advertising by 25.6 percent. Allergan also reduced support for Ocuflox, down 56.0 percent. Alcon Surgical's new intraocular lens, Acrysof, ranked fourth with a 2.02 percent share of all advertising. Ciloxan (Alcon), Ocupress (Otsuka America Pharmaceuticals) and Ocucoat (Storz) ranked sixth through eighth respectively.
All of the remaining products among the top 12 were new to the list in 1995. Two were from Allergan Medical Optics, AMO Vitrax, which moved into 9th place with an 89.8-percent increase, and SI-30 NB, which took 11th place following a 162.6-percent boost in advertising expenditures. Diamox F took the number 10 spot following a 457.7-percent jump in spending while Alcon's Tobradex moved into 12th place after a 17-percent increase in journal support. Products dropping from the top group include Alomide, Ocuvite, Healon, Livostin, Flarex, and Volten Oph.

<H5><A HREF="OPTOM.HTM">OPTOMETRY</A>: ANOTHER GOOD YEAR</H5>

Advertising for optometry products rose 7.5 percent. A good performance albeit not as strong as 1994's 16.4-percent growth.<BR>
Frames dominate optometry advertising accounting for 34 percent of dollars. In 1995 they grew (4.5 percent) less than the market as a whole. They tend to be fashion orientated and, therefore, volatile. This volatility is seen in product support rather than company spending. In 1995, seven of the top 12 companies were frame manufacturers; five of these were also in the top 12 in both 1994 and 1993. Sola Optical USA continued to hold the top spot with a 4.7-percent share of spending. Second, as it was in 1993 and 1994, was Marchon Eyewear. The two eyeframe manufacturers that entered the top 12 were Silhouette Eyewear, which rose from 40th to 11th (+112.7 percent), and Aristar which moved up from 32nd to 12th (+74.9 percent).<BR>
Rodenstock (which sells both frames and lenses) had the greatest growth among the rest of the top 12. It increased spending 234.1 percent and took 5th place. Ciba Vision re-entered at 6th after increasing its budget 57.9 percent.<BR>
On the down side, five companies dropped out of the top 12; none of them were frame manufacturers. They were Silor at 62nd, Signet Armorlite at 29th, Allergan Pharmaceuticals at 28th, and Bausch & Lomb Pharmaceuticals at 19th.<BR>
There were three new products in the top 12 in 1995; Biomedic 55 Lenses at 4th, Harley-Davidson Frames (first advertised Nov. 1994) at 8th and at 12th Zeiss Vision System. Four other products increased spending to enter the top 12; Transition Lightweight Lenses 6th; Guess Frames 9th; Silhouette Eyewear 10th; and Espirit Eyewear, 11th.<BR>
Ranked first with a 1.9-percent share of spending was Hart Specialty Frames which moved up from second. Close behind with a 1.8 percent share and up from third was Spectlite Lenses. Varilux Lens 
after three years at the top cut support 27.3 percent and fell to 3rd.<BR>
Six products dropped out of the top 12: Hydron Biomedics Disposable Contacts stopped advertising, Kodak Progressive Lens at 108th, Complete Lens Care Solution at 48th, XL and VIP Gold Lenses 
at 33rd, Ken Mark Lenses at 22nd, and Calvin Klein Eyewear at 18th.

<H5><A HREF="PHARM.HTM">PHARMACY</A>: TRADE JOURNALS HAD A DOWN YEAR AS EXPENDITURES SLIPPED BY SEVEN PERCENT IN 1995</H5>
Glaxo Wellcome held the number one spot once again with a share of 3.5 percent even though spending was reduced by 24.5 percent. Their most heavily advertised brand in 1995 was Serevent. Pfizer moved into second place (from fifth in 1994), although spending was cut by 4.6 percent, while Wyeth-Ayerst dropped to third on a budget reduction of 51.4 percent.<BR>
The biggest spending increase among the top advertisers (276.3 percent) was attributed to Merck which moved from 60th place to 4th. The higher pharmacy budget was used to support new entries such as Cozzar/Hyzaar and Fosamax. Lifescan was another newcomer to the top 12, moving from 25th to 9th place, as advertising expenditures increased by 96.9 percent. With support for Epogen falling off, Amgen slipped from number eight in 1994 to number 28. Pratt (Div. of Pfizer) also dropped from the top 12 company listing as support for Procardia XL dropped by 70.5 percent. Other having rather significant budget cuts include Lederle, off 41.8 percent and SmithKline Beecham, down 41.1 percent.<BR>
Among the top 12 “product,” six were new to the list in 1995 and two — Mylan and Apothecon — were corporate campaigns. Bayer's Adalat CC was the most heavily promoted brand, up 13.5 percent, while Lifescan F moved up from number 129 in 1994 to number two as pharmacy spending increased 420.7 percent. Also making the list is Prilosec which increased support by 837.1 percent. This moved the brand from number 308 to number 4 in 1995. Other newcomers include Cardizem CD, up 138.6 percent as well Norvasc and Lovenox. Those falling from the top 12 include Zovirax (number 1 in 1994), Zosyn, Effexor, Procardia XL, Epogen, and Propulsid.

<H5><A HREF="RADIO.HTM">RADIOLOGY</A>: CONTINUES TO BE WEAK</H5>

Advertising in radiology journals declined 3.7 percent in 1995. If journals monitored in both 1994 and 1995 are considered the decline was 2.6 percent. This is a better effort than in 1994 when support dropped 15.5 percent.<BR>
Four companies moved into the top 12. Bracco Diagnostics increased spending 237.4 percent to become the new number one, displacing Siemens Medical Systems, which fell to second. They had the number one (Prohance Injection), 4th (Bracco Imaging) and 18th (Isovue Multipack) products. Fujisawa strongly supported the introduction of Adenoscan and rose from 126th to 7th. The other two companies were DuPont Pharma (11th) and Philips Medical Systems (12th). Of the other eight companies, only two improved their rankings, the rest declined. These two, which were reclaiming their 1993 status, were: Mallinckrodt, which rose to 4th with the introduction of Optiray, and Fuji Medical System USA at 9th. This was due to the introduction of the Ad System Chest Imaging System and the FL-IMD Laser Imaging System.<BR>
Not unexpectedly, the companies that cut spending dropped down the rankings; Lorad Medical Systems cut spending 27.3 percent and fell to sixth. 3M Health cut support for their 3M Imaging Management System and Laser Image to drop them to 15th. GE Medical Imaging Systems and Logiq Ultra Sound Imaging Systems received no support. This resulted in GE Medical Systems falling to 19th. Bennett X-Ray Corp. reduced advertising for the Contour Mammography System and ranked 20th. Agfa dropped to 21st as it stopped supporting the CR2200 Laser Imaging System and cut funds behind the Impax Image Management System.<BR>
Of 1995's top 12 products, only four were in 1994's top 12 and three in 1993's. The three new products in 1995 were Adenoscan (3rd), Optiray (6th) and Ultravist X-Ray Contrast Media (7th). Five products had very large increases: the SSD-2000 Ultrasound Scanners advertising rose 834.0 percent to 9th position. Nycomed family first received support in November 1994 and rose to 10th in 1995. Bracco Imaging jumped from 31st to 4th with a 227.8 percent increase. The Aegis Sonography Management System's Advertising increased 183.8 percent and it reached 8th. Lastly, Prohance Injection moved from 11th to first with a 165.3 percent increase.<BR>
Eight products dropped out of the top 12. Magnevist and LI-10A Laser Imager were dropped after having received no advertising at all. Hitachi Ultrasonic Transmission Media fell to 134th, Acuson 128X Computed Sonography was at 9th, the Helios Laser System at 87th, Ultraject Prefilled Syringes 32nd, Kodak Imaging Solutions 19th and Omnipaque Nonionic 17th.<P>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>After a slow start, the medical industry — including drug companies, journals, and organizations — is making varied use of the Internet as a new way of doing business. The Net is selling product, educating both consumers and professionals, and providing a platform for news and discussion.</I><P><HR size=4><P>

The medical industry finally has been caught in-ter-net. Slow to respond to the massive new medium because of inherent problems, prescription drug and other healthcare companies now are adding the Internet buy to the annual budget. This new line item is being scrutinized at the corporate level, pushed by product management, and initiated by a new crew with a variety of titles at most major firms.<P>

At the top management level, the Internet, more specifically the World Wide Web (WWW) segment (see terminology definitions in “Is it time to get wired to the World Wide Web?” <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I>,February 1996), holds promise of doing business in a different way, “reconfiguring the value chain” in corporate parlance, according to Linda Holliday, executive vice president of Medical Broadcasting, a producer of Internet programs. “This is not just a new consumer medium, but a new way of doing business.” The potential impact is enormous and companies are reluctant to reveal the status of their discussions.<P>

Product management can utilize the Internet as an effective educational and promotional medium, and some companies have done so. Primarily a consumer medium with 20 or more million people now cruising the World Wide Web, a company's site can offer education on prevention and treatment of disease in a format that is easy to use and graphically vivid. An interactive channel bringing repeat communication with potential or actual customers can be developed — and the company can get information about viewers as they obtain information about company products. The number of viewers and the quality of their experience can be measured.<P>

Medical advertising and specialized design agencies are involved in producing Web sites for the industry. Publishing organizations are beginning to produce the cyberspace — as well as coated-paper — pages. And established online and Web services are ready to bring your messages to viewers.<P>

“Awaiting a buy-in from top management,” is the frequent comment of company executives anxious to proceed. The Internet is being studied for legal, regulatory, security, and related facets of operations. Decisions are expected shortly, but there are problems. One reason for not rapidly embracing the potential of the Net is that the industry is in a five-year period of cost containment, and return on investment is a difficult concept to apply when it comes to financing use of a new technology. There is the security issue, in that the Net is an open system, holding the possibility that an outside computer may be able to track and intercept or change information of an inside corporate system. This can be solved, in part, through use of an outside provider or an inside “Webmaster” who operates a standalone, closed computer/server system.<P>

<H5>Communication important</H5>

The end users — the professional and the patient — are very important to the company, Ms. Holliday points out. Prescription drug companies have recently determined that consumers are customers and they are first learning how to communicate with them. Now, the need is to learn a dramatically different medium as well. The firms have a big stake in continued relationships with physicians and other professionals. Messages on the Web can be directed to individual audiences to some degree, but the Internet provides a mass consumer audience and most messages can be seen by all. What level of message for what audience?<P>

Based on current FDA regulations, the requirements for brief summary, fair balance, and unapproved 
indications must be determined. Right now, the answers are up to the company regulatory and legal departments, and some are reluctant to move forward for fear of violations. The FDA is beginning to study use of the World Wide Web. At a meeting called by Dan McKillen, vice president of sales for Medscape, an online service, the feeling expressed is that there are enough regulations now covering drug advertising and promotion. The FDA has assigned Internet regulatory responsibilities to Melissa Moncavage of the Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications, but she allows that there will be no answers forthcoming soon to the issues posed by use of the Internet. It is up to each company to apply current rules and move out on its own.<P>

Companies involved in the decision-making process include Hoechst Marion Roussel. Hoechst has a page serviced by corporate headquarters in Frankfurt, Germany, dealing mostly with financial matters (in English, the “official” language of the Internet). What is likely to occur in the U.S. at the outset, one staffer suggested, is development of an HMR site linked to product pages that would include access to medical information for physicians and patients — forming a network of information sources.<P>

Zeneca Pharmaceuticals “is exploring use of the Internet in many different areas of our business,” according to Joel Tau, a public affairs executive involved in this activity. As is the situation with many other companies, the value of the Internet from a marketing and communications viewpoint has only recently been realized. Zeneca is aiming to put up its own site in the first half of this year, after a decision on corporate policy is made. Discussion now is focusing on regulatory, legal, security, and business issues. The importance for the company of having a site, the strategic business impact, and the potential use as a communications tool, are some of the topics facing management.<P>

Bristol-Myers Squibb has a site providing investor, financial, and company information on its four core business groups. From it, and independently, one can reach a Womens Link site, sponsored by the Clairol division. As yet, the company does not have a site dealing with prescription pharmaceuticals and disease information. This is an example of the tip-toe-into-cyberspace approach now under way.<P>

Eli Lilly has launched an eight-week pilot project site called “Managing Your Diabetes,” containing about 200 pages of information and pictures, based on information from a print patient information workbook and video series. Lilly has had a home page dealing with business on the Internet since November 1994, but this is the company's first disease-specific Web site. The site has interactive capabilities, including a response to personal questions forwarded to the requester within 48 hours.  Additionally, people can link to other diabetes information sources through the Lilly site, which will be updated weekly.<P>

<H5>Young pioneer</H5>

The Upjohn Company's hair growth stimulant Rogaine was one of the first prescription drugs to utilize an Internet site, providing information on male and female baldness and the product. That pioneering use of the Internet was started way back (in Internet terms) — 10 months ago. “We decided that the Internet was another tool that we could use to reach consumers,” says product manager Steve Bradford. Basically, his team took the product brochure and other materials used in print programs and had them adapted to the Net. Bradford used the consumer ad agency that handled Rogaine for three years, Draft Direct International, New York, which would maintain content continuity and the databank of dermatologists and other physicians developed by Upjohn. The agency subcontracted the Web-site work to one of the growing number of new net agencies, K2 Design. The site started with a home page that gave the viewer a menu of information options, each adjacent to a “button” or link: a brochure about hair loss for men, one for women, most frequently asked questions, full prescribing information, a listing of participating physicians geographically accessible by the viewer, and a survey requesting the viewer's name and address for receipt of more information.<P>

In all, there were some 24 pages available at the site. With Web design, pages with color illustration and text present information in an easy-to-retrieve fashion. If a viewer selected a question, a touch of a “button” gave the answer without the need for paging through other text. Likewise, selection of physicians by geographic area required only the touch of a hot link. The selected physicians could be downloaded into the viewers' printer, thereby providing a hard copy of the list along with instructions and information. Those who completed the survey form by computer received more information through the mail — while Bradford got the name of another potential customer. “We were very pleased with the results,” according to Bradford, who declined to divulge the number of viewers or survey participants. Rogaine was approved for over-the-counter sale on a Friday (February 9) and a notice to that effect replaced the Rx Rogaine text on Monday, rapid copy changes being another advantage of the net. “The Internet has a definite place in our promotional mix,” Bradford concludes.<P>

Another Upjohn product requiring consumer education and acceptance, Caverject for erectile dysfunction, now is discussed on an Internet site. And Upjohn's Greenstone Healthcare Solutions division has established what the company calls the first Internet site dedicated to disease management. “As a leading edge technology company, we see the Internet as an ideal emerging medium from which to expand and deepen interest in disease management and Greenstone Healthcare Solutions,” says Gregory Schofield, division president. The site will offer a platform for news and discussion.<P>

<H5>Do-it-yourself pages</H5>

The World Wide Web on the Internet is a wide open medium. At the recent New York Internet World Expo, small communications companies were inviting attendees to put up Net pages promoting their own businesses, for access locally. Why not? One Internet specialty firm offered a course on how to design and create a home page for $275 (class enrollment limited to 10). Others sold software and offered server capabilities. Ms. Holliday advises that she checks her local movie listings and starting times on the net, because it is easy. If a local theater doesn't have a home page, it doesn't have Ms. Holliday at the box office.<P>

<H5>Don't DIY pages</H5>

For the healthcare industries there are many professional companies skilled in working with clients, developing Web pages, and registering and putting them on the Web. Among the likely ones are the client's advertising agency which knows the product being promoted, small Web site design agencies that know the medium and how to use it, and the actual on line or Web companies such as MedScape or Physicians Online that can put up and serve the site. Some of the noted design agencies are Avalanche Systems, New York, and Vivid Studios, San Francisco. Preparation costs are another matter, hard to pin down. They can range from $10,000 for preparation of a simple home page to $1 million for a battery of 300 pages.<P>

“The most popular approach is to develop a combination of product and disease information,” according to Ms. Holliday, whose Medical Broadcasting, Conshohocken, Pa., provides Web pages for major pharmaceutical companies. How extensive the site depends on subject needs. It can run from 24 pages — if the unit is basically a product brochure as presented on the Rogaine site — to 300 pages, if the concept involves access to a lot of literature and references, she says.<P>

Some sites look like consumer magazines with informative illustrations, individuals engaged in conversation, and interesting design elements. Users prefer an interesting, interactive site. But, heavy color graphics slow the time needed to show the visuals and, if it goes too slow, viewers leave. The content should largely be determined by function.<P>

<H5>There at the outset</H5>

The traditional medical community was one of the first to recognize the importance of the Web and there is a large number of medical schools and hospitals that have home sites and serve as sources of clinical and research information. Major manufacturers of consumer goods and providers of services, from AT&T to Volvo, find the Net effective as a medium for explaining and demonstrating what they have to offer. One estimate is that 70 percent of the top 500 corporations have Internet sites. Another source suggests there are from 90,000 to 265,000 sites, with a new one going up every minute. Subjects now range in variety from Mickey Mouse to rock stars to the New York Times. The National Newspaper Association lists 162 newspapers that have Web pages, and there is an estimated 50 to 75 Web sites from ad agencies of all sizes — including  J. Walter Thompson — who wish to show off their cyberware. Many federal government agencies are there, including the Food and Drug Administration.<P>

Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America has a home page that provides patient information about stroke and a directory of the organization's 100 member companies. Many companies have sites that provide some kind of information. Now, here comes the new wave of drug and device companies updating their presentations with information on diseases and drugs to treat them.<P>

<H5>Solidly established sites</H5>

One technique to fight the proliferation of home pages is to hook either onto an already established location that is proprietary online or into another site on the Internet. Either resource is already established as a source of information with a following of repeat viewers. In addition to advertising and participating on the established site, companies can provide a hot link to their own Web pages. Many services provide similar access to clinical information for professionals and the public.<P>

Among the major online proprietary systems, for which a monthly subscription fee is charged to viewers, are America Online, CompuServe, and Prodigy. America Online carries a Better Health and Medical Forum that, since the beginning of this year, seeks advertising and sponsorship. It offers access to viewer bulletin boards, national health organization information, and Medline, attracting an estimated 1.5 million viewers a month, according to Allen Douma, M.D., CEO, and medical director. Only a small segment is composed of health professionals. Healthcare companies may sponsor any of 35 forums on different health care areas. They may sponsor an online medical conference primarily for consumers, which can pull an audience of up to 5000 people, according to Douma. Glaxo was the first supporter of a conference, and it dealt with migraine headache. Rate card price was $9,750.<P>

Sponsorship with Better Health Forum, as with other established sites, brings benefits such as development of an information base, billboard ads, market surveys, message board information, and a hot link to the company site. Is it pricey? Terms require only a one-month commitment with the ad provided. Sponsorship to a targeted clinical forum, with a top banner on the title page linked to a company page, cost $80 per thousand viewers per month. The audience would be an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 viewers, or up to $4,000 a month. Support of a broad interest area would cost $40 per thousand, with a 350,000 viewer guarantee, which would hit a minimum of $14,000 per month. Obviously, Dr. Douma would like longer relationships and works with clients to achieve that.<P>

<H5>Differentiating audiences</H5>

America Online has broad consumer appeal. Physicians' Online (POL) is limited to just that audience, an estimated 80,000 physicians who have registered online, a number expected to double within a year, according to president and CEO Steve Zatz, M.D., who addressed a Healthcare Marketing Communications Council (HMCC) seminar. The online service offers physicians, without charge, access to Medline and Aidsline from the National Library of Medicine, various drug databases, disease management forums, and continuing education programs sponsored by some 30 national and state medical associations. Most recently, the 50,000-member American Academy of Pediatrics joined POL. Managed care organizations use the site for communications with affiliated physicians.<P>

<H5>Setting up shop</H5>

POL sells sponsorship of selected resource areas accessed through a “teaser bar” package with company and/or product name with a link to further information on the bottom of the main menu. Entry level participation, sponsorship of a resource area, begins at $30,000 a month with a minimum one-year commitment. A promotion package — measurements of usage and feedback reports — are included. Drug company sponsorship is very evident and president Zatz reports nine major pharmaceutical company clients promoting 21 prescription drugs.<P>

Just over nine months old, MedScape is an open Web site rather than an on-line service that concentrates on medical information for clinicians while reaching consumers. It had some 24,000 registered users at the end of 1995, of which one-quarter are physicians, one-quarter are consumers, and the other half consisting of students, nurses, and other patient care providers. MedScape president Peter Frishauf predicts 50,000 users by midyear and more than 80,000 by year end.<P>

The service offers links to medical and hospital databases, coverage of selected topic areas and updates, a managed care segment, a publishers' circle which displays articles from journals, and medical seminars. Later this year it plans to offer free Medline access, professional CME, and patient education. Opportunities for advertisers include Web pages linked to MedScape editorial content by so-called BannerLinks. Advertiser pages can be directed to physicians, patients, or both. Sales vice president Dan McKillen says participation requires a three-month commitment for a package of 12 BannerLinks on major title pages for $30,000 for the quarter.<P>

<H5>Browsing the Web</H5>

There are many other commercial information sites on the Web for the industry to hook onto. And more are coming. Orbis Broadcast Group, a major producer of healthcare videos for industry, has created American House Call Network, an online information system for access by professionals and consumers. It offers data in various disease categories through an alliance with the National Health Council, an association of 108 health agencies, drug information services, and those who produce videotapes, when appropriate. The system is being announced this month (April). It will offer links to “sponsoring companies'” home pages. Initial fee for sponsoring a therapeutic category for one year is $250,000, according to Tim Bahr, president of the Network. The fee includes participation in development of third party content, and digitizing and redesigning the company's product brochure. For its first WWW event, Orbis held a press conference for Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc Rorer to introduce Rilutek (riluzole) the first treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). According to Bahr, more than 14,000 hits worldwide were generated from the conference.<P>

Drug InfoNet is a Web site that provides disease descriptions, product information, an “Ask the Doctor” forum, FDA and healthcare news, educational programs, and patient package inserts and circulars, according to president Kelly A. Little. Obvious by its name, this site is oriented to pharmaceutical information, and it will include manufacturer supplied materials. It is linked to other Web sites providing disease information, and is directed to physicians, healthcare professionals and patients.<P>

Drug InfoNet offers sponsors advertising billboard InfoLinks to access company pages for a two-month minimum at $1,200 to $1,800 a month, depending on location. There are additional charges for information pages, and other services, but this site seems to have the lowest pricing.<P>

There are other sites focusing on pharmacy. Pharm/alert Online is a fully interactive service with multimedia ads that offer 24-hour exposure via their private site reachable only with propriety software, obtainable on a free CD-ROM. It is operated by Health Care Marketing Services, Inc., Los Altos, Calif. USPharmacopeia, based in Rockville, Md., has a home page that links to an informative member newsletter, a practitioner reporting network, and publication catalogs.<P>

For the past year, Medicine On Line has been an information service with Wellcome Oncology as its founding sponsor, and cancer as its leading disease category. It now seeking new clients in other therapeutic areas. The online service offers libraries of disease category information for professionals and patients. Other services for users include e-mail, discussion groups, and links to non-commercial information sources. It registers viewers for professional treatment forums.<P>

Medicine On Line sponsors are charged a basic fee per product indication per year of $100,000, which includes development and maintenance of information, major storage space for content and reference, and promotion and other services. UltiTech, Inc. is the publisher of Medicine On Line and it is known as well for custom, multimedia programs on medicine, primarily for healthcare companies.<P>

<H5>Publishing in cyberspace</H5>

Publishers of journals and other health periodicals and texts rarely regard the paper as the inviolate element in a page. Rather, it is the content printed upon it. Publishers develop and deliver information, they say, and if the delivery system is stuck in cyberspace, the content is no less viable, and even a little more valuable. Among professional organizations that are publishers, The American Medical Association (AMA) has started a Web site with commercial sponsorship, the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) will launch a site this month, also with a grant, but for member communications only. Many scientific journals are displayed on the Web in real time, not in archives (which have to be searched, downloaded, saved, and redisplayed), and independent medical publishers are planning or building their own sites.<P>

<I>Medical Tribune</I>, a newspaper for physicians, has been supplying news reports for MedScape and 
Physicians' Online which can be viewed by clicking on the medical news box. According to Ed Barnhardt, until recently vice president, group publisher for the owner, Jobson Publishing, there was a fee arrangement under which Medical Tribune sent five stories a day electronically to each service and supplied the New York Times Syndicate.<P>

The American Medical Association had a home page on the Web since last summer with access to a journal scan, newsline, and a few segments of each of AMA's current journals. It offers access to a new HIV/AIDS Information Center which was developed and will be maintained by JAMA and is supported by an education grant from Glaxo Wellcome. The site will offer peer reviewed HIV/AIDS clinical information, news, and discussion of social and policy questions for the public and healthcare professionals. Bob Kennett, vice president of publishing for AMA, plans to open the journal sites (JAMA, AMNews, and the Archive journals) to advertising. Banners would name companies and/or products and link viewers to supplied information pages. When plans are set, the banners would be sold by journal representatives.<P>

Companies may sponsor disease-specific sites, as Glaxo did, or may be interested in CME, advocacy, or 
other activities. Kennett says that viewer response to the Web site was high. For example, “We have received in excess of 20,000 e-mail messages and requests within an initial four-month period, mainly from consumers, looking for information from the AMA,” he says. What would the cost of advertising be? Rates are still under development, but Kennett indicates that, for an issue of any AMA publication, a company banner might cost $2,500, and a banner that hyperlinks to an expanded message or company home page might run $5000. The length of time that an issue provides on site varies with the publication's frequency.<P>

This month is the target date for the AAFP site to become operational. To start, access and information will be limited to members and will deal with Academy matters. However, AAFP does have pharmaceutical company funding — a grant from Bristol-Myers Squibb to build the Web site. The <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> is a year or two away from being on the Web. “What we're doing is experimenting,” according to Chris Lynch, executive director for product management. The Journal expects to start Web operations by providing customer services — subscriptions, address changes — and classified advertising, Lynch says.<P>

The American College of Physicians has a forum on the CompuServe online service for member physicians only. They have access to clinical discussion groups, all issues of the ACP Journal Club and back issues of <I>Annals of Internal Medicine</I>. This month, ACP is opening a Web site as well, with pages designated for the gerneral public, member physicians, and one for College leaders to hold private discussions. The American College of Surgeons has a Web site with member and meeting information, and selected articles from its <I>Bulletin</I>.<P>

McGraw-Hill Healthcare Publications plans to launch Web sites for its three clinical journals and will start this summer with <I>The Physician & Sportsmedicine</I>. The Internet version will be tied to the Olympics and will provide real time information on weather, injury reports, other health news, and content taken from the print issue, according to vice president, group publisher Jim Dougherty. Plans are for sites to be set for <I>Postgraduate Medicine</I> and <I>Hospital Practice</I> by the end of the year. It is expected that advertising will be sold for the Web pages alone and in combination with the print issues for an additional fee.<P>

In many related sciences, journals have gone wired, according to a special report in Science, the journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. At the beginning of the year, there were 100 science, technical, and medical journals on the Internet. Some, like the <I>Journal of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery</I>, exist <I>only</I> in electronic form. Others are the electronic versions or adjuncts of print publications, such as <I>Science</I>, <I>Nature</I>, <I>Lancet</I>. <I>Scientific American</I> last month began appearing on its own Web site while continuing its presence on America Online, along with its medical publications, including the <I>Cancer Journal</I>.<P>

Perhaps the most ambitious Internet program for a publishing organization is an information system being developed by Medical Economics Company and its parent, Thomson Corporation. According to Ray Zoller, senior vice president of corporate business development, Thompson is investing in a sophisticated, technical infrastructure that will enable the company to link data from different sources to provide new information.<P>

For example, the content from different journals and the company's Medstat Group, a healthcare claims information managing firm, can relate information on drug dosage, cost, indication, length of therapy, and outcomes. The combination and selected application of these data add greatly to their value. Zoller foresees three revenue streams: user-based with payment of subscription fee for high value content; advertising fees justified by audience; and transaction-delivered income from the viewer, for information benefits such as CME courses leading to credit, for example. To help achieve these goals, Medical Economics will enter a relationship soon with a “premier medical institution” to develop clinical protocols.<P>

What else will the Internet offer? At last month's annual meeting of the Health Information and 
Management Systems Society in Atlanta, a company called MedPlus announced a program for coding and placing patients' medical records on the Internet so that they would be accessible 24 hours a day when needed any place in the world. We don't know what else is on the Internet launching pad, but be assured, it will blow your socks away.<P>

<CENTER><H1>Mega-Merger of the Year</H1>
<H5><I>by Carl J. Seiden</I></H5></CENTER><HR size=4>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>The merger of bitter rivals Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy illustrates the importance of competitive strength and greater return in tomorrow's market. This marriage of equals comes at a time when the industry is doing generally well. The pain is over, except for companies that cannot offer meaningfully different products; these will become acquisition candidates. The future may bring fewer companies controlling a greater market share.</I><P>

<HR size=4>

<CENTER><I>“nothing is more important in consummating a friendly merger than the willingness and desire of the chief executives”</I></CENTER><P>

On Wednesday, March 6, two pharmaceutical giants — Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy — stunned industry observers by announcing a merger, creating the second-largest drug conglomerate after Glaxo Wellcome and ahead of Merck.<P>

Even knowledgeable industry observers, and I'll be honest to say me included, were taken by surprise by the timing and speed of the announcement. While the cultural similarities and cost-cutting synergies are clear, Ciba and Sandoz were generally regarded as bitter rivals. But perhaps nothing is more important in consummating a friendly merger than the willingness and desire of the chief executives to do the deal. Last December, Sandoz chairman Marc Moret visited Ciba's honorary chairman, Louis van Planta, to propose a merger. Within two days, the Ciba board gave the green light, and within three months the biggest merger in the history of the drug industry was announced. Through their own independent strategic reviews, both companies had concluded that a horizontal merger would provide greater competitive strength and greater return to shareholders than going it alone.<P>

As of the time this column is being written, only some details of the merger are known:
<UL>
<LI>It is to be a merger between equals.
<LI>Dr. Alex Krauer, chairman and chief executive officer of Ciba, will be chairman of the new company, and Dr. Daniel Vasella, head of the Sandoz pharmaceutical division, will be president.
<LI>Unlike the merger of the old Ciba and Geigy companies, when the partners' names (and to some extent sense of identity) were retained, this time the slate is to be wiped clean and the successor company will be named Novartis. Dr. Vasella compared the company's creation to a new baby. “Each parent looks for resemblances in the eye and face, but it has its own identity. Both sides will need to step back a bit and not impose their own culture on it.”
<LI>Novartis — might as well get used to the name — plans to spin off the Ciba chemicals division, and also to sell or demerge the Sandoz construction chemical division within a year.
<LI>The new company has sales of roughly $30 billion, and a market value of roughly $79 billion, making it about the twelfth largest company in the world.
<LI>Novartis' drug sales of $12 to 13 billion rank it second among drug manufacturers. Sales of nutritional products are roughly $3 billion, with baby and infant products accounting for 42 percent and health nutrition products for 34 percent.
<LI>Agrochemical sales of $5 to 6 billion will make Novartis the number one company worldwide in crop protection, number two in seeds, and also number two in animal health.
<LI>Cost-cutting over the next three years is expected to total $1.5 billion, representing roughly 10 percent of the entire cost base, and resulting in layoffs of an estimated 10,000 people — roughly 3,000 in Switzerland; the others in the rest of the world.</UL><P>

The stock market reacted very favor-ably to the promise of cost-cutting and improved earning. Sandoz shares skyrocketed 30 percent on the day following the announcement, and Ciba was up 20 percent. And no wonder. Due to the friendly nature of the merger, no premium was paid, no debt was incurred, no new shares were issued. The combined company's balance sheet remains strong, with $12.5 billion in cash providing ample flexibility for more deals in the future.<P>

<H5>When equals get together</H5>

The emphasis Novartis management put on the fact that this was not to be a takeover but a marriage of equals, follows the recent precedent of the formation of Pharmacia & Upjohn. Though on a far smaller scale, this too was an amicable merger, and to date the results suggest that such a union can work. It might, therefore, be revealing to look at it in detail.<P>

With the possible exception of the formation of SmithKline Beecham (SK B) such blending of equal partners has no direct precedent in our industry. The usual pattern has been hostile takeovers or acquisitions, in which the acquirer offers a premium of, say, 50 percent more per share than it had been trading at. The creation of Pharmacia & Upjohn, as in the case of Novartis, involved no dilution of value, no issue of extra shares, and no huge load of debt, all of which would have put a financial burden on the merged operation. Even so, Pharmacia & Upjohn plans to eliminate 4,000 jobs and to close 40 percent of its manufacturing plants by the year 2000. The consolation is that it would have been a far more brutal, far bloodier situation if one or the other of the two companies had virtually disappeared in a takeover.<P>

Reflecting the unusual characteristics of such marriages is that the new corporate headquarters will be neither Upjohn's, in Michigan, nor Pharmacia's, in Stockholm, but will be located in London — a neutral site, even if not quite half-way geographically. Another consideration, of course, was that London is the headquarters of the new European Medicines Evaluation Agency, a gateway to the unified European market, and a far better location for a global enterprise than either Kalamazoo or Stockholm. The London operation will be lightly staffed — just top management and a small administrative force, with operational activities remaining in the U.S. and Sweden, with a major presence in Italy.<P>

Between them, the two companies have impressive pipelines — not any single blockbuster, but rather a flurry of singles that, cumulatively, could generate an additional $1.5 billion in sales. That's a lot for a modest-sized company which — even after merger — Pharmacia & Upjohn still is. In addition, the company has announced that it will invest $3 billion in research and development during the next three years.<P>

<H5>Gain with no pain</H5>

One reason the Sandoz/Ciba Geigy announcement was a surprise is that mergers are usually motivated by pain: one party or both have basic problems that do not seem amenable to easy solutions if they go it alone. And the fact is that, as of the end of 1995, it could be justifiably said that the pain experienced by the pharmaceutical industry in the previous three or four years was over, at least for the time being. It looked as if the tide of downsizing, cost-cutting and job-destroying mergers was finally receding.<P>

One index that made us think so is that major companies have not only stopped laying off sales reps but are actually adding to the size of their sales force. According to Scott-Levin Associates, the total number of sales representatives, after declining more than 10 percent in the previous three years, went up by about three percent in 1995, with trend-setter (and numerical leader) Bristol-Myers Squibb adding 350 reps after having dropped from close to 4,000 to less than 3,000 in the previous five years (see “Industry Report,” <I>MEDICAL MARKETING & MEDIA</I>, January 1996, p. 14).<P>

Even more encouraging was the recovery of company earnings, which hit a healthy increase of 11 percent in 1995. While this rate of growth began to level off in the last quarter, my forecast is that earnings in '96 will still grow some nine or ten percent. To put this forecast in context, consider that overall earnings growth of all S&P 500 companies is expected to drop from the high teens to the single digits — from 17 percent to around five-to-ten. That makes the drug group's going from 11 to 10 or even 9 percent look pretty good. Certainly, investors seem to think so, since pharmaceutical stocks generally retain their appeal and are expected to continue to perform well.<P>

These assessments, of course, deal with averages. Not every company has succeeded in improving earnings growth or passed the need to be more aggressive in managing costs. And, obviously, not every individual who was laid off has found satisfactory employment. Still — in addition to Novartis and Pharmacia & Upjohn — a number of other companies are doing very well, indeed (see “Focus on winners,” at the end of this article.).<P>

<H5>Tracking disease management</H5>

Another major factor in assessing our industry's future is its success, or lack of it, in entering non-drug markets. Healthcare companies' participation in disease management is one such widely reported effort. However, this market segment is still in such a state of infancy and flux that no clear conclusion is possible.<P>

On the positive side, the companies that have made a commitment to provide disease management services are very excited about what they're doing — or at least say they are. On the other hand, it isn't clear exactly who the customers are supposed to be, and if you go to managed care organizations and physicians and ask them what they think, it's hard to find anyone who welcomes this effort, assuming they are even aware of it. So we're a long way from being able to say who is doing well and who isn't doing well.<P>

What further confuses the picture is that there are such widely divergent attitudes among drug companies as to what they are trying to achieve. Some, like Zeneca, look on disease management as a business that will become a profit-generating enterprise largely separate from their pharmaceutical business. At the other end of the spectrum are companies that see it as little more than a value-added service that will help them sell their products. Merck seems to be somewhere in the middle. They are not charging anybody for disease management services; however, as data are acquired they hope to prove their value and justify being compensated. The problem for Merck, and for every-one else hoping to make a go of disease management services, is that you have to be able to deliver data proving that disease management will have a measurable impact on improving care and cutting costs. The race to acquire that information is just beginning.<P>

And even once it's available, my personal opinion is that drug companies are not particularly well positioned to provide disease management services. True, as one of the most deep-pocketed players in healthcare they have the money, and at least some companies are willing to make the investment. Also, they are well organized, and there can be no question that as a society we desperately need disease management since it addresses what may well be the most fundamental problem in healthcare. The famous Dartmouth studies showing huge regional variances in the incidence of certain surgical procedures clearly demonstrates the need. The regional heterogenicity is unbelievable. Why, to cite just a couple of examples, would the incidence of prostate operations be twice as high in Utah as in New York City? Why are there so many more hysterectomies performed in Boston than in nearby Providence, Rhode Island? That clearly shows that we don't have the treatment protocols that would enable us to optimize the healthcare system. Until we know what the ideal is, we can't possibly establish treatment norms that would achieve the ideal.<P>

Unfortunately, while pharmaceutical companies may have the money and the motivation, their ability to be successful is undercut by their obvious biases. Even if they could be totally objective, their recommendations would always be suspect. Any time they develop a protocol that calls for the use of drugs — not necessarily their own brands; any drugs — skeptics would say: “Aha. What did you expect?” I think we need to wait for an objective third party, something like the Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) to publish its criteria before this can become a viable market for healthcare companies. Perhaps drug company partnerships with, or funding of, more objective third parties is the most logical solution.<P>

Another diversification effort, one we have reviewed in past columns, is the acquisition by healthcare companies of  PBMs, and there the dust has settled sufficiently to permit some judgments.<P>

<H5>Assessing PBM purchases</H5>

The main rationale for buying PBMs was that they could move market share, and so far the three acquisitions that took place — Merck buying Medco, Smith-Kline Beecham (SK B) acquiring DPS, and Lilly taking over PCS — have had remarkably different results.<P>

Merck plus Medco has proved to be a good marriage. On the one hand, Merck's dowry included products whose lack of 
differentiation make them switchable, while Medco, for its part, has the capacity to move them. For example, Merck has two big ACE inhibitors, two big cholesterol-lowering agents, and one of the major H2 inhibitors — five very movable products. Medco for its part is very good at moving market share because its business comes primarily through mail order. That gives them real clout. They actually hold the prescription in hand, without a customer waiting at the counter, getting impatient while the pharmacist makes a phone call. By contrast, Medco has some 48 hours to call the doctor and ask whether he or she would accept a switch.<P>

That's working even though Merck is fully complying with the Federal Trade Commission's disclosure requirement, which forces them to make it clear to the doctor that it's a Merck employee making the call and a Merck product that's being recommended. According to the company, their success rate hasn't fallen off at all since these restrictions were put in place, and when I talk to doctors who are the recipients of these calls I gather that, indeed, they are not very concerned about the conflict of interest. The product areas in which they get the calls tend to be the ones where their brand preferences are quite small, so instead of worrying about the substitution, their reaction is: “Let me get off the phone and see my patient.”<P>

At the other end of the spectrum is PCS, which does not have a particularly strong track record in moving market share. That's because its historical background is as a claims processor, and they need to work through the retail pharmacist to influence physicians. That's hard to do. To overcome this handicap, they're working very hard to develop a computer network that would tie them directly into doctors' offices, bypassing the retail pharmacist. If that works, of course, they could influence the writing of prescriptions upfront, but the jury is still out.<P>

SmithKline Beecham's DPS is somewhere in the middle. It contracts mostly with health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and while HMOs are better than retail pharmacists at influencing physician behavior, they are not as successful as mail order operations. After all, while HMOs do have a business relationship with doctors, which gives them access, it also makes them more dependent on doctors' good will. Realizing this dilemma, SK B last year bought a mail order company, so they may begin to catch up with Medco.<P>

<H5>Our readers write</H5>

On several past occasions, we have offered to answer readers' questions — and do so again now. One of the most 
provocative queries came from Ed Schmitt of Exelle, Inc., in Glen Rock, New Jersey. Ed correctly pointed out that in past forecasts I limited myself to predicting trends between now and the end of the century. After all, he challenged me, that's only a few years away. What will industry be like in 2005 or even 2010?<P>

Fair enough. If you're in the forecasting business you shouldn't be afraid to climb out a little further on the limb. Anyway, that leaves me 10 or 15 years to be proved wrong!<P>

One of the things that has struck me regarding the 30 years of industry history that I've tracked is that — despite the common perception — changes have not been particularly rapid. What has been rapid is management's awareness of the underlying changes, though the changes themselves have been fairly gradual. The most obvious change in healthcare in recent years has, of course, been the emergence of managed care which, in turn, has greatly accelerated the shift to generic pharmaceuticals. The operative word here, however, is accelerated. It's a shift that has been coming for a decade or more, which I think justifies my calling the changes gradual.<P>

Also significant is how well the industry has coped with these changes. What the last three years have shown is that, when things get tough, this industry can squeeze its expenses without radically affecting its operations or its profitability. I'm convinced that there remains a reservoir of potential savings so that most companies can survive further pressure from managed care. Obviously this doesn't mean that times will be easy for the people involved in cost cutting. Sales people and scientists perform highly valued yet redundant functions, making them particularly vulnerable, but executives in sales and marketing administration are not immune. So the good news for industry could be bad news for its employees: if and when the pressure resumes, industry can still deliver good earnings by cutting costs. And that will mean once again cutting jobs, though at the moment the skies appear reasonably bright.<P>

As I said before: there are encouraging indications that the pain is over. But these things are cyclical, and looking into the next century I do believe that the market is going to be increasingly harsh on companies that cannot offer meaningfully different products. Much will depend on the pace of managed care pressure, but increasingly the market will separate the haves from the have-nots, with the have-nots becoming attractive acquisition candidates. Even if their products are still profitable, they would obviously be a heck more profitable if sold by a company that can shed the acquired company's cost infrastructure. Again, let me stress that I don't see further major mergers right now. Yes, the pain is over. But it might come back.<P>

If and when it does, I believe it's quite possible that the top 15 companies will come to control 75 percent of the market, as against some 25 companies today. Which 15? There is still a certain serendipity to the research process, and with research going on in dozens and dozens of locales, there will be companies that are successful in discovering or acquiring products that are different enough to assure them good sales and protect their independence. Directionally, though, I see fewer and bigger companies.<P>

Will that trend, Ed asked, create oligopolies? I think not. In effect we have some oligopolies today. There are, for instance, only three manufacturers of state-of-the-art cholesterol-lowering agents: Merck, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Sandoz. Has that permitted the three manufacturers to fix price? On the contrary: they're beating the living daylights out of each other over price. All it takes for an oligopoly or cartel to fail is that one of the players doesn't think it's getting its fair share, making the incentive for price discounting very high.<P>

As I mentioned, research serendipity makes it hard to predict the fate of specific companies. For a five-year forecast you can look at current pipelines; beyond that much depends on R&D roulette. But I will hazard one prediction: SmithKline Beecham will be one of the winners. That's because of their exclusive relationship with HGS — Human Genome Sciences — which is leading the worldwide race to map the human genome. Now we're talking well beyond the year 2000, but sooner or later gene sequencing will produce therapeutic breakthroughs. This area of research might represent a fundamentally new paradigm in drug research, and could give SK B, with its exclusive rights to HGS discoveries, a meaningful competitive advantage. The company has placed a $125 million bet on this scenario, and I think it will pay off many times over.<P>

Finally, a word about the rivalry between research-oriented and generic drug companies. It's a conflict that's rapidly disappearing. The key to successful marketing of generics is low cost, but there's no reason why research-oriented companies can't also be low-cost manufacturers. If they're not, they will take a beating almost as soon as a product goes off patent — the concept of a value-added generic is almost an oxymoron. If a research-based company is not a low-cost manufacturer, it's in trouble in the generics game, but more and more major companies are successfully combining a generics operation with their basic brand business under the same roof.<P>

As a result, many independent generics companies are headed for trouble. The most profitable period in the life cycle of a generic drug is the six months or so immediately after patent expiration. Increasingly, that opportunity is being taken away by the brand name manufacturers. By the time the Capoten patent expired, Bristol-Myer Squibb's own generic captopril had already been on the market for two months at a 20 percent discount. Such strategies are forcing generic companies to make still deeper cuts, but by the time you're selling at a 90 percent discount — as is true of some generics today — there isn't much profit left.<P>

Since Ed Schmitt posed such provocative questions, it seems only fair to close by quoting his own perceptive comment: “I believe the pharmaceutical industry is still in the early and rapid growth stage. There are many diseases left to conquer and the threat of the sudden and inexplicable rise of a new disease, e. g., AIDS, remains ever present. Those companies which succeed in finding cures will prosper enormously. The most successful companies ten years from now are likely to be those that are best managed in the mid-nineties. Companies like Pfizer and J&J and Merck will continue to outperform because their R&D effort is productive and likely to continue to be so.”<P>

I couldn't agree more.<P>

Other questions, anyone? Send them to me in care of <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I> magazine.<P>

<H2>FOCUS ON WINNERS</H2>

The industry's positive performance is being spearheaded by a number of companies. My colleagues and I have put together a list of winners. They include:

<UL>
<LI><B>Johnson & Johnson</B>, whose U. S. pharmaceutical sales may grow as much as 15 or even 20 percent this year. Janssen's new antipsychotic agent, Risperdal, is a major contributor, but this projection also includes some $2 billion in recent acquisitions.
<LI><B>Pfizer</B>, enjoying a 15-percent EPS growth, fueled by the most powerful product line in the industry, with such fast growers as Zoloft, Norvasc, Diflucan, Cardura, and Zithromax. What's more, a 30-percent increase in R&D spending ensures a strong, long-term flow of new products.
<LI><B>SmithKline Beecham</B>, which gained the benefits of cost cutting from the Sterling OTC acquisition, and expects FDA approvals for Kredex for heart failure, Hycamptin for ovarian cancer, ropinerole for Parkinson's, and penciclovir for cold sores.
<LI><B> Astra</B>, enjoying earnings growth in the high teens, fueled by the phenomenal success of the proton pump inhibitor Losec/Prilosec, plus expected FDA approval late in the year for their asthma medication, Pulmicort Turbuhaler. In addition, Astra's ADRs (the equivalent of stock for foreign companies) are expected to be listed on the New York stock exchange by late spring.
<LI><B>Abbott</B>, with high sales of Biaxin and expected approval for combination use with Astra-Merck's Prilosec for treating ulcers, which is likely to generate double digit sales growth.</UL><P>

Among device manufacturers, Medtronic is expected to show a quarterly increase of 45 to 50 percent, followed by Boston Scientific's sales growth of some 30 percent.<P>

Mergers, more mergers, and mega-mergers, an upturn in earnings, looming FDA reform, Rx-to-OTC switches, important patent expirations, all in the shadow of the managed care revolution. The industry continues to struggle with changing times, but the struggle is being won. There are areas of great strength throughout the industry, and even those weaker elements — like pricing — do not call for alarm. The drug industry has taken the challenge and appears to have control.<P>

<I>MEDICAL MARKETING & MEDIA</I> presents here the authoritative IMS America Business Watch for 1995, an in-depth look at what made the industry tick last year, and the factors which will influence business in 1996.<P>

Overall growth in 1995, at 9.1 percent, was impressive with total dollar volume increasing to $89.7 billion<B>[1]</B>. This was especially impressive in light of the widespread fear just a couple of years ago that the pharmaceutical industry's best years were behind us. With price increases growing at a rate of only 1.9 percent, it is evident that the major contributor to overall market growth was volume. The clinic channel by far was the biggest winner in 1995; sales to this segment, at $3.7 billion, increased over 23 percent from the previous year. Other areas experiencing healthy growth rates included: Long Term Care (+17.3 percent); Mail Order (+14.5 percent); Foodstores with pharmacies (+13.3 percent); and Chains (+13.3 percent) (<A HREF="exh1.htm">see Exhibits 1A and 1B</A>).<P>

Chains continued to be the market share leader; sales of $24.4 billion comprised 27.2 percent of the overall marketplace. Independents followed behind in the number-two spot at 17.8 percent, but continued to lose market share despite a small growth in sales volume. Sales to the independent pharmacy channel were almost $16 million, an increase of 2 percent over 1994 performance (<A HREF="exh2.htm">see Exhibits 2A and 2B</A>).<P>

Prescription activity, as well, was on the rise in 1995; more than 2.2 billion Rxs<B>[2]</B> were dispensed, exceeding the 1994 level by 6 percent. The independent channel was the sole loser in Rx volume — scripts fell 4 percent. All other sectors exhibited healthy growth trends (<A HREF="exh3.htm">see Exhibit 3</A>).<P>

<H5>Product Activity</H5>

The list of 1995 leading sales volume products is strikingly similar to the list in 1994; most of the products are the same with a few shifts occurring in rank. The one notable absentee on the “top 20” list is Tagamet, not surprising given the intense competition generics have given the brand (<A HREF="exh4.htm">see Exhibit 4</A>).<P>

Prescription market leaders in 1994 maintained their long held “top 20” position as well (<A HREF="exh5.htm">see Exhibit 5</A>). Premarin continued to decidedly hold on to the number one spot with over 44 million Rxs dispensed in 1995.<P>

<H5>Leading therapy classes</H5>

With over $5.4 billion in sales, antispasmodic therapy continued to lead the market (<A HREF="exh6.htm">see Exhibits 6A and 6B</A>). The strongest growth performance, however, was exhibited by serotonin reuptake inhibitors, with a continued climb to the top. Fourth in rank in 1994, with sales of $2.25 billion, this category grew 28.7 percent over the course of 1995 to attain year-end sales of $2.9 billion and a move up in rank to the number three position. All products in this class experienced healthy growth and contributed to the strong performance of the market overall. Dista's Prozac led the class in sales volume with $1.47 billion in sales and growth of 17.6 percent. The other two major players, Roerig's Zoloft and SKB's Paxil, experienced even more dramatic increases in sales. Zoloft's sales of $895 million were an increase of 38.2 percent and Paxil grew 45.2 percent to attain 1995 sales of $487 million.<P>

The cardiovascular market was closely scrutinized in 1995, the result of negative press on the use of calcium channel blockers (CCBs). A paper presented at the AHA Epidemiology and Prevention Council Meeting in March reported on a controlled study that concluded the risk of heart attack for an hypertensive patient being treated with CCBs was substantially higher than the risk for an hypertensive patient being treated with diuretics or beta blockers (BBs). Findings were widely disseminated via print and television media.<P>

IMS's Custom Quest group performed a study to assess the awareness of the CCB study among physicians treating hypertension; the study was done to determine physicians' response and to ascertain the impact on prescribing of CCBs, BBs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), and diuretics for the treatment of hypertension. Findings of the study suggested that the majority of physicians surveyed (74 percent) expected to make no change at all in prescribing. Those that expected to decrease use of CCBs (19 percent) indicated that ACEIs and BBs were expected to be beneficiaries to the CCB declines.<P>

Prescription activity from March through December 1995 revealed that the CCB news had little effect on 
the market (<A HREF="exh7.htm">see Exhibit 7</A>). Activity across the CCB, BB, and ACEI markets remained virtually unchanged subsequent to the March report. Shifts that did occur were product shares and rankings within therapeutic classes, not across total categories. The data supports the findings of the Custom Quest findings; physicians do not appear to have changed their prescribing habits.<P>

<H5>New products</H5>

1995 was a rather sluggish year in terms of new product launches — at least in terms of their ability to generate significant sales volume. While the newly launched products lacked clout in the major sales volume arena, they were clearly among the more interesting and innovative products to be introduced when compared to 1994 activity. Some of the notable new product launches in 1995 included: Fosamax, Merck's bisphosphonate for the treatment of post menopausal osteoporosis; Caverject, Pharmacia & Upjohn's new therapy to treat male impotence; Cozaar and Hyzaar, Merck's angiotensin II receptor antagonist antihypertensives; and Prevacid, TAP's new proton pump inhibitor.<P>

Fosamax, introduced in September 1995, attained sales of $23.7 million by year end. This activity was largely due to a very aggressive promotion campaign that led to high levels of physician awareness and quick generation of new prescriptions. Fosamax is marketed by Merck and co-promoted to the OB/Gyn audience by Wyeth-Ayerst. The market will be watching to see if this product will ultimately be viewed as a replacement for the bisphosphonates Aredia and Didronel, or the estrogen replacement therapies.<P>

Cozaar and Hyzaar, both new angiotensin II receptor antagonist antihypertensives launched in April 1995 
by Merck, have attained combined sales of $44.6 million. Cozaar is the more widely used version with sales of $35.1 million; Hyzaar (the diuretic version) reached the $9.3-million level.<P>

Caverject, marketed by Pharmacia & Upjohn, is the first of new therapies to treat male impotence. Primary competition today is an herbal remedy called yohimbine. Pharmacia & Upjohn have launched an aggressive consumer campaign in the hopes of rapid market adoption and share. Sales of Caverject were $6.4 million in 1995; the product was approved in July.<P>

A few 1994 introductions faired quite well in 1995. Schering's Claritin-D, introduced late in 1994, had 1995 sales of $142 million. Allen & Hanbury's, the first once-a-day anti-rhinitic nasal spray, took market share away from competitors Beconase and Beconase AQ to attain sales of $94.6 million. The serotonin reuptake inhibitor class as a whole showed strong performance and Wyeth-Ayerst's newest entrant, Effexor, did equally as well. Launched in April 1994, Effexor moved into the top-100 product category in 1995 (at number 99 based upon sales to retail, hospital, clinic, long term care, and closed wall HMO pharmacies).<P>

<H5>Pricing</H5>

Overall price increases were modest in 1995, rising at a weighted-average of just 1.9 percent<B>[3]</B>. 
This was not significantly different from the 1.8 percent increase in 1994 and it continued the trend of decelerating price increases that began in 1991. There was, however, a wide divergence in price trends by market segment and product type. Manufacturers have been cautiously raising prices where market conditions permit, but at rates far below those seen during the 1980s and early 1990s.<P>

The retail market experienced a 2.4 percent net price increase. While price increases were a factor in the growth in the retail market, it was the increase in volume and net trade-ups to more expensive products that were the major cause for market growth.<P>

The 4.9 percent net increase in prices for the staff-model HMO sector may strike some as surprising. This may be reflective of an ongoing tendency by many manufacturers to rationalize their discount structures and, in particular, to eliminate discounts that have not proved effective. A small part of the apparent increase may reflect a shift away from acquisition-price discounts, which are captured in the IMS data, to off-invoice rebates, which IMS does not capture (<A HREF="exh8.htm">see Exhibit 8</A>).<P>

<H5>Retail method of payment</H5>

The cash portion of the market continued to decline; in 1995, 38.2 percent of prescriptions were cash payments compared to 41.6 percent in 1994 (<A HREF="exh9.htm">see Exhibit 9</A>). Growth in Medicaid Rxs, at 12.7 percent of the market, slowed as block grants to states shifted coverage from federal to state governments. Third party continued its climb, to 49.1 percent, as states contracting with plans continued to shift a larger number of prescriptions into third party plans.<P>

Leading states for third party payments included: Hawaii (73.4 percent); Arizona (65.4 percent); Rhode Island (64.6 percent); Michigan (62.6 percent); and Nevada (60.9 percent). Minnesota, the state often considered one of the leaders in managed care innovation, ranked 17th with 50.2 percent in third party payments; 36.8 percent of Rxs are still paid for with cash.<P>

<H5>Promotion</H5>

Promotion in 1995 followed the same route taken in 1994, experiencing a downward decline of 10 percent in overall spending (<A HREF="exh10.htm">see Exhibit 10</A>). Interestingly, there was a minor recovery in journal advertising that had decreased significantly from 1993 to 1994. Dollars spent on television advertising increased by 14.5 percent with 6 of the top 25 promoters using TV as a promotional medium.<P>

<H5>Rx-to-OTC switches</H5>

The biggest news in the Rx-to-OTC switch segment in 1995 was assuredly in the ulcer therapy market. This market under went some significant changes over the past couple of years, the most significant of which was the May 1994 patent expiration of Tagamet. Changes more recently, however, have resulted from several of the H2 antagonists becoming available over-the-counter. Pepcid AC (J&M Merck) launched in June 1995 and Tagamet HB (SmithKline Beecham) was introduced in August 1995. In December, Glaxo Wellcome received FDA approval to market their entry in this OTC category — Zantac 75.<P>

Introduction of the OTC products seems to have had little impact on their Rx counterparts. Tagamet continued to experience erosion in sales and market share, but at the hands of generic competitors. Prescriptions and sales for Pepcid continued strong, despite the introduction of OTC versions (<A HREF="exh11.htm">see Exhibit 11</A>); sales of the Rx version increased 10 percent in 1995.<P>

A study by IMS's Custom Quest group provided insight into brand awareness and use of over-the-counter H2 antagonists. Two hundred physicians (representing general and family practitioners, internists, and gastroenterologists) were interviewed regarding their awareness and usage of the new OTC H2 antagonists. Awareness of the new OTCs was high in all physician segments; recommended use, however, was comparatively low. Physicians overall most often prescribed an H2 antagonist to treat ulcers.<P>

<H5>Impact of consolidation</H5>

Mergers, acquisitions, and alliances were obviously the operative words again in 1995 with industry consolidation continuing at a fast clip: Glaxo Holdings plc merged with Burroughs Wellcome to form the new Glaxo Wellcome plc; Hoechst AG acquired Marion Merrill Dow, Inc., to become Hoechst Marion Roussel, Inc.; and Pharmacia AB and the Upjohn Company joined to form Pharmacia & Upjohn. This year looks to present more of the same with the acquisition of Fisons by Rh&#244;ne-Poulenc Rorer and the merger of the two Swiss companies, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, to form Novartis. The impact of these changes is demonstrated in <A HREF="exh12.htm">Exhibit 12</A>.<P>

The Glaxo Wellcome consolidation moved the newly formed company to the number one position, displacing American Home Products. Until the most recent merger of Ciba and Sandoz, consolidations have had little impact on manufacturer ranking and market share. However, the newly formed Novartis will move into the number 8 position, gaining almost 2 market share points. Previously, Ciba Geigy ranked 13th and Sandoz, 17th.<P>

<H5>Regionalization</H5>

The pharmaceutical industry continued its move to a more localized, managed care focus with further adoption of regional business units (RBUs). Of 43 surveyed companies, 27 were in various stages of RBU implementation by year end. Of the top 20 companies, 13 had regionalized and at least 2 were in a test mode. Those that consider themselves “regionalized” are actually in various stages of the process. Those furthest along have rolled out at least some aspect of the marketing function, focusing on managed care pull-through and, in some cases, providing promotional “templates” to be modified regionally. Those in earlier stages either got off to a false start and have pulled back or were hindered by consolidation activities.<P>

<H5>What to watch for in 1996</H5>

1996 is already off to an interesting start:
<UL>
<LI>More consolidation has already taken place; more of the same is expected to follow.
<LI>Biotech companies are expected to increasingly finding themselves entwined with major pharma company counterparts.
<LI>The impact of regionalization will be further scrutinized to determine if increases, decreases, or changes in geographic composition are required.
<LI>No major patent expirations are expected, but the impact of generics will surely continue to escalate in tandem with cost containment efforts and increasing pressures of managed care.
<LI>Rx-to-OTC switches, such as Pharmacia & Upjohn's Rogaine, are expected to become more commonplace.</UL>

These ads, created by Welinder AB for the new Pharmacia's global corporate campaign, really possess stopping power.<P>

Visually, they convey a vitality and spontaneity that may come from the fact that, unlike many corporate pharmaceutical ads, they do not appear overly intellectualized or self-congratulatory. In the increasingly crowded arena of corporate advertising, typically cluttered by case histories and me-too positioning, the freshness of Pharmacia's campaign really stands out.<P>

Looking at these ads, one has the sense that the illustrator was given free hand and actually had fun creating them. From the subtlety of the muted watercolors to the casual style of the handwriting, these ads work because they are not overworked.<P>

The choice of “To Life” as a corporate motto is an inspired one. It clearly positions Pharmacia above and beyond other pharmaceutical companies dedicated to producing high-quality products and services. It suggests that Pharmacia's foremost concern is the quality of life of people for whom its products and services are developed.<P>

And the message is a versatile one. “To Life” implies benefits for customers, patients, and employees alike.<P>

For customers, it promises high-quality products and services and implies added value; for consumers, it suggests compassion, care, and enhanced quality of life; and for employees, it is a clear, simple statement of Pharmacia's corporate mission. Its humanity is its appeal. As a corporate motto, it is concise, memorable, and affirmative.<P>

The imagery is universal, as is the simplicity of the copy. The beauty of “To Life” is that its very simplicity makes it immediately understandable to English, Italian, and Swedish audiences without translation — a huge plus for a global campaign.<P>

This campaign goes a long way toward differentiating the new Pharmacia in the vast global marketplace as a compassionate citizen of the world committed to — well, “To Life!”<P>

Here's to the creative team at Welinder AB. We wish we'd had a hand in creating these ads.<P>

<CENTER><H1>Contract Sales Forces Come Of Age</H1>

<H5><I>by Warren R. Ross</I></H5></CENTER>

<HR size=4>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>Using contract sales reps is now widely accepted as making good business sense. Assignments run from temporary fill-ins to contracts of several years' duration for first-line drugs. Contract field managers and reps are trained professionals that can be integrated with client sales teams for maximum flexibility and efficiency.</I><P>

<HR size=4><P>

Pick your clich&#233;: <I>Every cloud has its silver lining.</I> Or: <I>It's an ill wind that blows no one some good</I>.<P>

Whichever you choose, the principals of contract sales organizations would wholeheartedly agree. While the impact of managed care has brought downsizing and uncertainty to marketing executives of manufacturing companies, terminal grief to several publishers, and an often desperate need to reinvent themselves to healthcare advertising agencies, it has generated increased volume and profitability for the folks who supply (but don't like the term) rent-a-reps.* That, at least, is the consensus of the top executives of leading contract sales organizations (CSOs) we interviewed for this article.<P>

Barbara Saltzman, president of MMD, Inc., reports that business has quadrupled in the past five years. At Professional Detailing Network (PDN), according to chairman Harriet Frieze, business is up more than 75 percent this year and has doubled over the last five years, while Charles Saldarini, president of Professional Detailing Inc. (PDI), notes that volume has doubled over the last two years. George R. Melillo, president and CEO of PharmFlex, Inc., the youngest company of the group, reports that business has doubled each of the three years his organization has been in existence. PharmFlex had already exceeded this rate by April of 1996, the start of their fourth year.<P>

The reasons for this good news are not hard to find. They are directly related to the upheavals that have beset the pharmaceutical industry since the advent of managed care, such as the downsizing of in-house sales forces, regionalization, and the diversification of target audiences.<P>

“The major impact has been in the way pharmaceutical companies look at their sales resources,” Saldarini says. “The pressures that managed care has generated have companies saying, we're going to need sales forces that are more flexible, that are lower cost, and that can be plugged into the new, decentralized structures.” Melillo says manufacturers are more aggressive in considering alternate sales channels for ethical drugs that need promotional attention. “With an uncertain future, CSOs are a better cost-effective alternative to growing a sales force,” says Melillo. “and a suitable alternative to co-marketing.”<P>

The result, as Frieze explains, has been that more companies are using CSOs, that contracts are larger and for longer periods, and that the prospects being called on are more varied and constantly changing. Indeed, the consensus among the top executives is that there has been a basic change in the nature of their business. While the majority of calls are still on private practice physicians, flex-time reps now also call on managed care organizations (MCOs) both to do contract negotiations and to assure “pull-through” on the part of panel physicians, to implement disease management programs, to work with pharmaceutical benefit management companies (PBMs) and hospitals on contract compliance, and to staff convention exhibits and trade shows so as not to incur the opportunity costs associated with pulling staff representatives from their territories.<P>

<H5>Basic changes in perception</H5>

“The big change,” Saltzman sums up, “is that contract selling has come of age. Fifteen years ago, it used to be that manufacturers didn't want to have it known that they were using our services; didn't want us to identify them. Now the use of contract sales reps is widely accepted. And not only accepted — it is recognized as making good business sense. As a result, we are no longer getting secondary programs — small regional assignments or helping out with older products. Now we carry flagship products, so that programs have become much larger and are of much longer duration.”<P>

By way of example, Frieze cites the fact that her company has recently been awarded three contracts of two or more years' duration. A concomitant trend brought about by this more long-term type of relationship, Frieze points out, is that most contracts now include some form of measurement to evaluate the contribution made by the contract sales force.<P>

Increased reliance on data works both ways. Flex-time reps, says Saltzman, are now provided with great amounts of information, such as physician profiles that include health maintenance organization (HMO) affiliations, whether the HMO has open or closed formularies, and whether the product being detailed is on the formulary.<P>

Saldarini explains these trends in terms of companies' changing needs. “Our relationships are built much more out of strategic needs,” he says, “as opposed to just tactical needs. Where people used to say, 'I need 25 reps for six months to fill a gap,' now they say: 'We want to discuss 100 reps for two or three years to implement a brand strategy.' In other words, there is now a recognition that the sales force flexibility supplied by companies like ours has become a basic core competency.”<P>

The way this translates into contracts, he says, is that PDI is getting assignments to help promote first-line drugs — drugs of primary importance to the manufacturer. “We're no longer getting just the cash cows or the fallen stars.” Melillo points out that, “At PharmFlex, we are involved with major product launches, managing product groups with total fiscal responsibility, and working alongside our customers' sales representatives to expand reach and intensify frequency.”<P>

<H5>The growing role of outsourcing</H5>

Clients are looking to contract sales companies not only for more but for different types of assignments. PDN has been in discussions with some ten potential clients about major launch programs scheduled for this year or next. MMD has been introducing major new products for the past 10 years, and has helped launch several significant entries, including Eldepryl for Sandoz, Theracys for Connaught, and Theo-Dur Sprinkle for Key.<P>

And Saldarini, expanding on his concept of “core competency,” cites one client that has adopted a basic policy of maintaining an undersized sales force and relying on PDI to bring its representation up to strength. He quotes one of his clients as saying: “We purposely went out light to see what we needed. What we do have is a sales force of 50 and contract for everything over that.”<P>

As might be expected, target audiences have also been expanded to keep pace with the times. At PDN, the proportion of selling programs specific to the managed care sector are still relatively small, but calling on MCOs — both to negotiate contracts and to promote “pull through” with providers — is now almost routinely part of major proposals. “Managed care generally requires us to align our managers based on specific geography or on account sales volume,” Frieze points out. “This is primarily due to the regionalization of the major managed care groups, as well as the products' market share penetration. For one of our clients, our representatives handle all managed care clinics outside of the territories covered by their own representatives.”<P>

In addition, PDN has been contacted both by managed care and pharmacy benefit organizations themselves, to help them with educating prescribing physicians.<P>

PDI has set up a new division, called Maxcess, specifically to target the buyers and purchasing agents of MCOs, long-term care institutions, wholesalers, and retailers. Staffed by eight full-time executives, Maxcess primarily helps smaller and start-up companies that lack the account infrastructure needed to establish relationships with the managed care trade, though even a top-20 company might use Maxcess to supplement its coverage of a class of trade that it doesn't want to put full-time resources against. Similarly, PDN offers specialized managed care business units. MMD has established a Japanese connection, investing in Nippon Pharma Promotion and offering representation to Japanese manufacturers wishing to penetrate the U.S. market.<P>

Melillo emphasizes that a CSO sales force is almost infinitely flexible. They can be geared to relate to any contractor project. In addition, his company, for example, offers trade and distribution coverage to the industry. PharmFlex is a total sales marketing operation and has participated in the introduction of new product, beginning with its stocking and distribution at the wholesale and chain drug level. The second and third phases will include a sales launch to both physicians and managed care formularies, as well as executing pull-through strategies.<P>

Saltzman singles out long-term care as a big growth area, adding: “We also make calls to assure contract compliance, and are doing 'wellness' programs as part of disease management marketing. MMD's reps promote a headache kit as part of Bristol's promotion of Excedrin. Now the representative puts the emphasis on the management of tension headaches, covering diet, exercise, and lifestyle, in addition to talking about the product.”<P>

Asked to explain her company's role in contract compliance, she points out that generic companies, such as her former client Solopak, sign multiproduct contracts with hospitals and managed care organizations and depend on follow-up calls to make sure the pharmacists live up to the terms of the agreement. Since such companies usually have only limited sales forces, they may call on CSOs to do the job for them.<P>

<H5>Hiring and training</H5>

Given the tremendous layoffs of experienced representatives by major pharmaceutical companies in recent years, one might assume that this has represented a recruiting bonanza for contract sales organizations.<P>

Not quite.<P>

The hesitancy on the part of CSOs is that they employ primarily part-time people and that they 
fear that a downsized rep would spend his or her time on their payroll looking for another full-time job. Says Frieze: “ With all the recent downsizing, more candidates — both male and female — are available, but we need to be sure that the downsized rep is not just taking a flex-time position until a full-time job comes along. Our goal is to have a large resource of 100 to 200 top-performing representatives available to fill new programs quickly.” Also, as Saldarini puts it, “We're not interested in picking up the bottom 20 percent of someone's downsized sales force.” Nonetheless, he agrees that the pool of candidates has expanded. “It's much tougher to be hired now than it was three or four years ago because, given the larger pool, we have dramatically tightened our standards.”<P>

Because of the emphasis on part-time people, the skew in hiring is still primarily toward women. At PDI, the percentage of female reps stands at about 98 percent; at MMD it is 80 percent. At PharmFlex, two groups have shown the greatest success, according to Melillo: younger females who have been affected by restructuring or elected to spend more time with their families, and those over 50 years of age who have elected to take early retirement after having a successful corporate career. Melillo says he has observed that the best employees are the first to elect for early retirement and young working mothers. At all the companies, however, managers — who are more often full-time — are more nearly balanced between male and female.<P>

<H5>The best and brightest.</H5>

Frieze stresses the need for careful recruiting by describing the criteria that new client relationships demand. “Our representatives must be able to sell products, make sound business judgments, and adjust to change. They must make the decision whether the target they are calling on matches the sales potential and, if not, how to adjust to meet the objectives. Therefore, we believe selling ability and business judgment to be the top priorities in hiring. Another clear advantage is previous pharmaceutical experience.”<P>

PharmFlex hires from a pool of 3,000 perspective employees in their data banks. They require a customer to fill out a profile sheet listing, among other things, the typical background of representatives they want PharmFlex to hire. Candidates are tailored to the profile the manufacturer has provided, must have the necessary educational background, and several years' experience in the industry during which they have build strong ties with physicians.<P>

Saltzman sums up the new emphasis in recruiting in four words: “Reps who can sell.” No longer is it enough for a rep to be able to educate. “We take turnover orders. We sell to nursing homes. We do retail and wholesale programs. That calls for the ability to close a sale. Also, because of our special programs, we have a need for representatives with more varied backgrounds in the healthcare field, not just the traditional pharmaceutical rep, so we have people who do only retail selling; others who call only on HMOs.” Emphasizing the great strides CSOs have made in recent years, Melillo says acceptance of contract reps by physicians has been “fantastic,” despite the fact that his employees are always identified as PharmFlex on their business cards, which also always highlight the name of their customer. And because of the extraordinary care that is taken in choosing contract sales reps, performance has been above average. Indeed, on one Hoechst product, PharmFlex reps were responsible for one and two in the country.<P>

The new, more demanding criteria also apply to the managers. Saltzman estimates that some 65 to 70 percent of the 80 field managers on her staff have had previous management experience with manufacturers. They supervise approximately 1700 reps now in the field, and there are an additional 600 or so on MMD's roster, waiting to be assigned as the need arises. (PDI maintains a “strike force” that's available for quick deployment for short-term needs.) And whereas the management level used to be nearly 100 percent women, now some 70 percent are men. The reason: experienced regional managers who have been laid off — and who are predominantly male — are now available for hire.<P>

After the recruiting phase is complete, of course, comes training.<P>

A change at PDI is that they now have a full-time director of training who helps each client customize the training programs, which Saldarini calls “sort of a hybrid approach that everyone is comfortable with.” Reflecting this flexibility, the training site may be PDI's, the client's, or a number of regional hotels or other facilities. The first two weeks of training, however, are devoted to home study to learn about the disease states.<P>

At MMD, training also takes place in two stages. Pre-training involves product knowledge and may include field work with the manufacturer's representatives. This phase runs about three weeks and is followed by on-site training in the specific sales program. One change is that, because of regionalization, there may now be as many as eight or ten or even twelve breakout rooms, where the individual needs of each of the regional managers can be addressed.<P>

Deirdre Eliopoulos, who heads up client services at PDN, reports that “most companies provide the product knowledge and marketing strategy for training programs, since they know their products best.” Then PDN's full-time managers conduct the plan-of-action training meetings, and coach the reps on an ongoing basis. When it comes to providing managed care support, PDN's reps usually receive the same training the client gives its full-time sales force. Additionally, PDN conducts quarterly “Sell Sessions” to keep fine-tuning its representatives' performance. “At PharmFlex, training is developed with the customer,” says Melillo. “We establish a program that incorporates home study prior to attending the training meetings. District managers attend seminars with an outside consultant to develop current selling sessions for their representatives. Training is an ongoing process at PharmFlex.”<P>

<H5>Deployment and motivation</H5>

After hiring and training, the CSOs must deploy their reps so as to be efficiently integrated with the client sales teams … and keep them motivated to perform at optimum levels.<P>

Deployment depends on many factors: the client's objectives, sales structure, and the specific CSO assignment. The range of possibilities is wide, indeed.<P>

Since the flex-time reps' primary mission is to supplement an in-house force, they have to be well integrated into the client field force. The way Frieze describes it: “Most of our clients use PDN as they would their own sale force. That means that, in a given territory, a representative is expected to perform all the same tasks that are assigned to an employee of the manufacturer. If the company is operating on a team concept, the PDN rep is assigned targets as a member of the team, and covers all audiences, including managed care.” One complication of such complete integration, she points out, is it makes it more difficult to measure sales results. Most PDN clients require an average of 100 representatives per contract, though some call for 250 or more.<P>

MMD's Saltzman agrees that the deployment of contract sales representatives has to be adapted to each client's needs. Size to start with. For some companies, MMD may field only a handful of reps while for one client they have 600 people in the field … comparable to the entire sales force of some manufacturers.<P>

“A very clean way to work,” she says, “is to take over the entire responsibility for a given specialty or 
several specialties. But for another client we call on the same doctor as their in-house staff — actually for the same product, but for another indication. A third way is to call on the same doctors with the same product and the same indication, for a double hit. Still different is a situation where we give a product top priority while the manufacturer's reps have it in third place. In each instance our people have to learn how to integrate their efforts with those of the staff sales force. We've been doing this for 26 years and we've learned to be flexible and to adapt to new developments such as regionalization, which has had a huge impact on how our clients use our services. It means we may have up to a dozen different programs, or that we're doing something quite different on the West Coast from what we're doing in the Southeast. Essentially, each regional business head is a different client.”<P>

The decisive factor in deployment, in Saldarini's view, is the client's analysis of the prescription data base. “People take a look at their quintiles and decis and overlay their current coverage against their sales and Rx potential, and use our resources to make sure they have complete coverage. Sometimes they'll carve out a group of physicians and have us handle them; sometimes we'll call on doctors their people are also calling on with different products, and sometimes, as Barbara explained, we'll call on the same doctors with the same products to increase contact frequency.”<P>

Melillo agrees that sales teams should be developed with customers' best interests in mind. “With some clients, we manage the entire project, with others we integrate our activity with their sales force's activity,” he explains. “We never split our projects. Our sales and management teams are totally dedicated to one customer. Our managers bring to the flex-time industry the same expertise they had at hiring people in the pharmaceutical industry.”<P>

Even staffing of the territories can be adjusted to serve each client's needs. Saldarini says: “We try to customize the territories to maximize the reach of our clients' audiences. Sometimes that demands that we hire full-time people, as opposed to the part-time staffing that is our general pattern, and up to 10 percent of our staff may now be full-time.”<P>

The growing importance of accurate data in deployment is underscored by a point Frieze makes: that most of the assignments today are based on specific targeted audiences and, in some cases, a defined call plan. “With targeting, clients have predetermined that the physicians they've identified have the sales potential to provide a return, and as you would expect, our best results are with clients that provide our representatives with the sales data by individual targeted physicians.”<P>

The key point, according to all three companies, is that each sales team is dedicated to only one project and deployed to give each particular client a maximum return on its investment.<P>

<H5>Keeping spirits high</H5>

An essential part of being able to provide top quality service is to maintain morale and motivation — something that might not seem easy to do with part-time people.<P>

Saldarini explains how it can be done.<P>

“It's not difficult to go out and hire a former full-time pharmaceutical rep who meets the standard contract sales force profile — which usually means a woman with school-age children, who needs to be able to adjust her working hours to her family needs. What's tough is making sure that you've recruited somebody who really is committed to working part time, and is not just looking for a resting place between full-time positions. One way we do that is to promote from within, so that our representatives have a career path laid out for them and can move into management positions, still on a part-time basis. As a result, we have a staff of people with a career orientation.” The philosophy at PharmFlex seems to agree. “We promote a team concept throughout the organization,” says Melillo. “We provide incentive programs to enhance competitiveness and we promote from within.”<P>

Saltzman sees pros and cons. Reps can make more money and get better benefits as members of a company sales force. But, pointing out that she herself started as a flex-time rep, she stresses that being able to arrange one's own time is a primary motivation. But there's more to it than that, she thinks. “It's a professional part-time job,” she says, “and there aren't that many professional part-time jobs around. It gives people a sense of pride to hand over a business card that says they are representing a Procter & Gamble, a Ciba, or a Bristol-Myers Squibb.”<P>

<H5>Future prospects</H5>

Speaking of motivation, will manufacturers — once this period of transition is over — want to keep using contract sales forces on the same extensive basis?<P>

Saldarini is convinced that the flexibilities offered by CSOs will continue to attract business. “In the past, they might have expanded their staff whenever there was an opportunity to attract incremental business. But I don't think they will do that again because they can't be sure of the future. For instance, no one can now guarantee that physicians will retain independent prescribing authority, so our customers have become a good deal more cautious about adding to the head count. CSOs fit the contemporary needs of a changing world, “ he concludes, “where outsourcing has become a strategic imperative.”<P>

There is, however, a third option: organizing an in-house part-time sales force.<P>

“I think manufacturers ask themselves that all the time,” Saltzman concedes. “They look at the dollars they're spending with CSOs and say, 'Hey, I could do this in-house, and retain full control.' Well, one reason they don't is that it requires a long-term commitment, and thus contradicts the whole rationale for downsizing. Another reason is that it isn't cost-effective and some companies that have tried it have found it didn't work out. Contract sales forces are one-third to one-half the cost of an in-house force.”<P>

But Melillo points out that there is a difference when one deals with a CSO. “Many companies find it difficult to work effectively with a flex-time force. Patience, motivation, and understanding the objectives of flex-time workers are important to success.”<P>

Saltzman doubts that new competition will crimp her business, though the great success of the CSOs has attracted newcomers to the field. Where once there used to be only three players, now there are several more on the field.<P>

“The interesting thing,” says Saltzman, “is that the leading companies of a few years back are still the leading companies. As programs get larger and larger, and as companies rely on us for primary products, not only does the entry fee for start-up companies get higher, but clients are more insistent on knowing the CSO's track record. Sure, there'll be additional competitors, but basically, I think our field will remain fairly stable and will continue to grow.”<P>

Melillo sees two areas to watch for future CSO growth—oncology and assisting with the launching of new products.<P>

Frieze's view of the future is consistent with Saldarini, Saltzman, and Melillo. In fact, she expects to see the business quadrupling over the next five years as the manufacturers contract for larger programs and have to expand the use of contract sales networks globally. The deciding factor for using more contract sales will be the financial return on investment coupled with the ability to deliver this sales volume while maintaining the highest ethical and professional standards embraced by the healthcare industry.<P>

Melillo sees a bright future ahead for the industry, even while predicting the eventual emergence of several established leaders in CSOs. “Confidence manufacturers are showing is building,” he says, “but the responsibility is ours. CSOs must produce an image of quality. We must be a resourceful, competitive force when manufacturers are considering an alternate sales channel in which to choose. CSOs should be interested in improving their positions, not one-upping each other. We must all build a strong reputation for contract sales.”<P>

<TITLE>NEW PLAYERS RECAST THE PPI DEBATE</TITLE>

<CENTER><H1>NEW PLAYERS RECAST THE PPI DEBATE</H1>
<I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></CENTER>

<HR size=4>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

The idea of accompanying prescriptions with written instructions — patient package inserts (PPIs) — has been on the table for almost 30 years. It has surfaced again as mandatory “medication guides.”  However, any resolution must contend with new information technology and the power of managed care providers.<P>


<HR size=4><P>

Most observers of the healthcare system acknowledge that a formidable communications gap exists 
between providers and patients. Research has shown that many physicians are poor instructors and spend insufficient time explaining the drug therapies they prescribe. Likewise, pharmacists, filling hundreds of Rxs a day, cannot be expected to carry the educational burden. And lastly, studies indicate that sizeable percentages of patients don't listen, don't understand basic medical concepts, don't ask questions, and often simply are indifferent to details about their medications. This failure of instruction and receptivity contributes to higher levels of morbidity and mortality, extra billions to the nation's healthcare bill, and lost sales for pharmaceutical manufacturers through noncompliance.<P>

An attack on the problem was proposed by the FDA in the August 24, 1995, <I>Federal Register</I>. New FDA rules would institute a literature distribution system — “medication guides” — to accompany all prescriptions. The FDA invited comment on the proposal and held two days of open meetings on the issue in February of this year at which a range of views was aired representative of the debate on what should be done. The FDA is planning to evaluate all the comments it receives and then issue rules or guidelines within a few months. What the FDA decides will have significant impact on pharmaceutical marketing since a new information system will affect a central element in healthcare of the future — the role of informed patients participating in their own care.<P>

The FDA's current proposal has new wrinkles, but the idea of literature distribution with prescriptions has been on the table since the mid-1960s. At that time, a task force, examining the feasibility of covering prescription drugs under Medicare, recommended patient package inserts (PPIs) as a worthwhile policy. In 1970, the idea bore practical fruit when women's groups, demanding “a woman's right to know,” successfully lobbied for PPIs to accompany all prescriptions for oral contraceptives.<P>

<H5>PPIs — 30 years of contention</H5>

This precedent was not lost on consumerist organizations which petitioned the FDA for a similar system for all Rx drugs in 1975. The agency moved in that direction and, after going through the involved rule-making process, did issue regulations requiring PPIs for 10 drug categories (benzodiazepines, digoxin, pro-poxyphene, for example) in September 1980. However, there was a change of administration that fall and in 1981 the rule was rescinded because (according to the FDA's recent proposal) “PPIs would be unnecessarily burdensome, costly, and inconsistent with [new executive directives on rule-making].<P>

But the idea did not die. Further hearings on the subject were held that year and in 1982, in the spirit of private sector initiatives that animated the Reagan administration, a voluntary system was adopted relying on drug manufacturers, United States Pharmacopeia (USP), the American Medical Association (AMA), American Society of Hospital Pharmacists (ASHP), American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), and other non-governmental organizations to fill in the communications gap. An important group recognized by the FDA as coordinating and driving the process was the National Council on Patient Information and Education (NCPIE) — a consortium of providers, consumers, trade organizations, and interested government agencies.<P>

The FDA added other products to the mandatory PPI list — estrogens and isoproterenol inhalers — prior to the 1982 voluntary system. Since then, drugs which pose particular safety concerns to FDA have had to include PPIs as part of their labeling — for example Roferon, Introna, Nicoderm, Nicorette, Rogaine, Halcion, Norplant, Proscar, and Accutane. PPIs are nothing new. FDA is now, once again, proposing to extend them to all Rx drugs.<P>

The FDA began its August 1995 medication guide proposal with a critique of the present voluntary system and found it comes up short. Drawing on academic studies and its own research, the agency concluded that not enough patients are getting the “useful” information they ought to receive. The FDA has conducted telephone research among 1,000 consumers in 1982, 1984, and 1992.<P>

The 1992 findings (to cite only a few) are: 66 percent get some form of counseling by their prescriber, but percentages fall off markedly on particular aspects of the counseling. For example, adverse reactions were mentioned by 29 percent, up from 23 percent in 1984; written instruction received by 14 percent, up from 5 percent in 1982. For pharmacists' interaction, 32 percent received instruction on taking medication, an increase from 23 percent in 1984; adverse reaction counseling came in at 13 percent, below the 1982 reading of 16 percent. The FDA sums up: “Three-fourths of all patients surveyed … received no written prescription information.”<P>

The FDA also surveyed the literature being distributed to patients from a range of companies and services, using alprazolam (a tranquilizer), amoxicillin, and the ACE inhibitor enapapril as test cases and found “substantial differences between sources in the quality of information being provided.” Some literature left out indications while others included too many off-label uses — for example, nonapproved indications for alprazolam were “… insomnia, muscle spasms, convulsive disorders, and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.” Additionally, “serious but rare risks were often missing.” Overall, an unsatisfactory performance in the FDA's eyes.<P>

Displaying an appreciation of whom its opponents are on medication guides, the FDA takes time in its proposal for a rebuttal of a meta-analysis conducted by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA, now PhRMA) in 1984, which, the FDA states, concluded that, “PPIs were an ineffective tool to improve patient knowledge about or use of medication.” An FDA review of the study found, “The methodology flawed … conclusions … unsupported by the analysis performed by the authors … major definitional … problems.” The FDA then revisited the studies the PMA used and reports they show that, “PPIs lead to reliable gains in drug knowledge.” Clearly, we have a selective reading by both sides of the literature in question which displays the adversarial climate in which PPIs are being discussed.<P>

Further, in scanning the field of patient education, the FDA in its proposal again discredits the Rx industry by citing the “problematic” growth of direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) as a negative factor:<BR>
<UL>Although individual advertising materials disseminated to consumers may meet regulatory standards in that they are in fair balance and not false or misleading, FDA remains concerned that the overrated practice of DTCA will have a cumulative effect providing patients with information based primarily on promotional materials furnished by the pharmaceutical industry and that this promotional focus will result in a problematic overall perception of prescription drugs … to perceive prescription drugs — i.e. potentially dangerous medicines — as relatively non-serious … FDA believes that … quality patient information will help counter any unbalanced perceptions of prescription drugs promoted to the consumer.</UL><P>

The FDA's proposal includes mandated medication guides for drugs posing “serious and significant public health concern” and continuation of the current voluntary system for all other drugs with provision for monitoring the performance of these private programs. Goals are set: 75 percent of patients receiving “useful,” written information with prescriptions by the year 2000, 95 percent by 2006. The FDA defines “useful” as encompassing these criteria — scientific accuracy, consistency (format), nonpromotional in tone, specificity (warnings, risks, etc.), comprehensiveness, understandable language, and legibility. If the 75 percent/95 percent goals are not achieved, the present voluntary system, to the FDA's thinking, will have demonstrated its inadequacy and medication guides (per FDA content and format) will then be required for all drug products.<P>

To measure progress, the FDA will research consumer receipt of “useful” information via telephone studies in the year 2000 (or five years from the effective date of the regulation) and 2006 (or six years after the prior study). A shopping study at pharmacies will also be conducted to validate and calibrate the first consumer telephone study. The agency observes that reports in the literature indicate “patients forget much of what they are told during medical consultations.”<P>

Regardless of the language in the proposal, the hard deadlines, and extensively outlined guide content, the FDA appears to be hedging on its course of action. In the August proposal, the agency outlines two regulatory alternatives: Plans A and B. Under A, the voluntary system would continue, be “given an opportunity to achieve specific goals,” and if the system doesn't measure up, <I>the regulations requiring medication guides would be implemented</I>. Under B, matters would proceed as in A but, “The agency <I>does not intend to finalize the proposed standards</I> [emphasis added] or the sections that defer implementation in the form of regulation.<P>

Instead, the agency intends to use the proposed performance standards as guidance for the private sector.” Interpreting this “regulationese,” it seems the FDA would hold back for now from chiseling medication guides in stone. The paragraph continues, “If the performance standards are not met … then the agency will seek public comment on whether a comprehensive medication guide program … should be finalized … and what other steps should be taken to meet the patient information goals.” The FDA proposes issuing final regulations (as described in the proposal) <I>now</I> or putting forward the goals and standards it sees as desirable, with the checkpoints on performance, etc. and indicating that it is willing to talk the subject <I>in the future</I>.<P>

The FDA, in its <I>Federal Register</I> offering, and participants at the February meeting put forward strong arguments for medication guides. It is asserted that the guides will increase informed drug use and regimen compliance with positive effects on clinical outcomes. Lower healthcare expenditures will result from fewer adverse drug reactions and reduced hospitalizations for same (estimated by the FDA as 5.3 percent of admissions in 1986). The proponents of medication guides also maintain that they will encourage greater provider/patient interaction by promoting questions and encouraging an information interchange. Patient knowledge on drugs will increase.<P>

<H5>The case for guides</H5>

Along these lines, guides are seen as particularly useful as more potent medicines become more common with their potential for inadvertent damage. Similarly, their importance is stressed for the elderly on multiple medications. Advocates also point out their value as reference texts for patients who encounter side effects or adverse reactions after taking the drugs for an extended period. Additionally, they are seen as providing information to the disadvantaged sector of our society — patients who may be receiving short shrift in the health-care system — women, AIDS patients, minority populations. Finally, the pro-guide side calls attention to the European Community's use of mandated patient information leaflets since 1992. If the drug industry can do it in Europe, why not in the U.S.?<P>

From what was said at the February meeting, and from comments filed on the proposal, among those favoring medication guides are consumer activists, pharmaceutical industry critics, public health academics, minority groups, patient organizations (AIDS, for example), and a resident FDA staff who has set guides as a long-term goal — those who saw the 1980 regulations pulled back by the Reagan administration. Folded within their arguments for the proposal are a distrust and an antagonism toward the Rx industry and organized medicine and pharmacy. This attitude is evident in comments from the Public Citizens Health Research Group (HRG) which, according to the January 29, 1996, <I>FDC Reports</I>, put it this way: “The distribution of clear, accurate, and complete information based on a drug's approved labeling with all prescriptions is a simple, sensible idea that should have been finalized and put into practice in the U.S. 16 years ago. FDA's proposal for medication guides will only further delay consumer access to vital drug information for at least four more years, but if history is the guide, it will be for much longer if FDA does not find the determination to resist the pressure of drug company and professional trade groups. All that has ever stood between U.S. consumers and access to potentially lifesaving drug information has been FDA's resolve to resist these pressures.”<P>

<H5>Opposition to medication guides</H5>

Overall, there is an adversarial tone evident in the debate over medication guides, to say nothing of special interest positioning by such vocal organizations as the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturing Association (PhRMA), American Pharmaceutical Association (APhA), AMA, ASHP, AARP, individual Rx firms, and patient education companies which have commented on the proposal. That these organizations, although expressing sympathy with FDA direction on patient information, are opposed to these proposed regulations arises from the tangible stake they have in the present system. They see the new rules as a wasteful cost burden (Rx industry and pharmacy), complicating their day-to-day operations (retail pharmacy), impinging on their professional role with patients (medical and pharmacy organizations), and directly competitive to their business (patient education companies).<P>

Ironically, these groups see many of the premises advanced by medication guides advocates not as benefits, but as counterproductive. For example, the FDA feels that guides will assist provider/patient interaction. Robert Schwartz, an AMA vice president, told the February meeting that FDA-mandated information would interfere with the doctor/patient relationship. He raised the issue of off-label use of pharmaceuticals by physicians — a point which was brought up again and again at the meeting. Schwartz said that 40 to 60 percent of physician-prescribing was for dosages and indications not approved by the FDA. How would doctors handle off-label uses when the guides patients receive in their offices and at pharmacies say nothing about these applications of the drugs? What would this do, he asked, to patients' attitude toward their doctors?<P>

PhRMA in its December 14, 1995, letter commenting on the proposal also raises concerns about guides and the provider/patient exchange. “The interaction with the patient — so critical to individual counseling on appropriate drug use based on the patient's particular medical history and condition — will be diminished by a Federal mandate requiring medication guides.”<P>

PhRMA's objection to guides, however, extends beyond the doctor-patient relationship to a much more crucial issue for the industry — the physician's role as “the learned intermediary” between itself and the public. The association puts its case as follows: “Mandatory patient labeling would increase the number of product liability claims, and could encourage courts to abrogate the 'learned intermediary' doctrine and establish a court-imposed duty to warn the patient. In addition, mandatory patient labeling would increase the number of claims of inadequate warning based on a comparison of the patient and professional labeling … The manufacturers' litigation experience with FDA mandated patient labeling demonstrates that the adoption of this FDA proposal would substantially increase manufacturers litigation costs.”<P>

David B. Brushwood, of the University of Florida, dealt with this question at length in his presentation at the FDA meeting. He stressed the strong influence litigation has on healthcare delivery and outlined the problem of writing a medication guide that would simplify labeling. Guides must aim for the average patient, he said, but it will be the unusual side effects or drug reactions which will cause the problems and lead to lawsuits. How do you decide on the “probability and magnitude of risk” in deciding what should be included in a guide? Unfortunately, he said, it would be left to the courts, on a case-by-case basis, to settle whether the omission of certain information was consistent with the FDA's concept of “usefulness.”<P>

The presentation of this dilemma was challenged by Barbara Seaman of the National Women's Health Network, who favors medication guides. She maintained that PPIs had been productive on oral contraceptives (OCs) by simply putting “the common problems up front.” In contrast, a spokesperson from Johnson & Johnson commented that PPIs on OCs had contributed to difficult litigation for the company.<P>

<H5>What, no data?</H5>

The exchange on PPIs on OCs raises a provocative observation on the controversy about 
medication guides. With more than twelve products distributing PPIs with prescriptions for a number of years, what has been the effect on therapy with these drugs? Are drug usage problems lower on OCs, estrogen, and nicotine patches, for example? Has treatment been improved? Costs lowered? No one came forward at the February meeting with this kind of information. The FDA proposal cites many references to the effectiveness of written instructions in transferring drug information and in increasing compliance. And, there are anecdotal opinions that PPIs have been useful, as well as opinions that they have been ineffective and obstacles to treatment. But where is the data? Is the necessary research, which would involve mixing behavioral and clinical science, too difficult? Some critics of medication guides (PhRMA and APhA) do call for additional research which guide advocates can dismiss as a delaying tactic, but given this puzzling information void, they may have a point.<P>

In a polemic manner, critics of the FDA's proposal take issue with every argument put forward by advocates. Then, they add two considerations which weaken the FDA proposal. The first of these objections to medication guides is that the agency is behind the times. The FDA makes reference to computer technology in delivering drug information to patients at the pharmacy. But a number of voices at the meeting charged that the FDA, even when including the computer for generating written information, is not forward-thinking as to what patient communication will be like in 2000 or 2006. Liz Moench of the MediciGroup — a Princeton, N.J., public relations company — devoted her entire presentation at the meeting to this subject. Here is a sampling of what she said, centering on the new trend toward “demand management” in patient education.<P>
<UL>“The issue today should not be mandating and regulating patient information, but rather how to make treatment and health information <I>available</I> and <I>relevant</I> to patients when they need it most. The patient information trend is toward information-on-demand … known as 'demand management' … programs accessible to patients with the use of 1-800 telephone numbers providing … 'peace of mind' information … [recognizing] that patients will seek and access information when they are most ready to receive and use the information.<BR>

“The Internet offers the next step … with two key features — the ability to dialogue with consumers in real time and provide information-on-demand … But the Internet alone cannot achieve this … [what is needed is] integrating all forms of communication … health news on television … educational programs … talk with their doctors, friends, or neighbors … on-line … in chat rooms … questions to medical experts … specific disease information … in an interactive format … the most valuable form of information.”<BR>

“Experts in broadcast and information technology … predict that by the end of the decade … many physicians will be equipped with digitalized computer editing equipment which will allow them to specifically tailor patient information to patients … Where does this leave medication guides? Perhaps the ability of new information technologies to provide specific and real time feedback from patients will better direct us all in the understanding which, when, and in what form information is most useful and meaningful to patients.”</UL><P>

Other speakers at the February meeting reinforced the theme that the FDA was not approaching the 
problem with sufficient breadth. James Boyd of Medi-Span — a company that supplies pharmacies and other providers with drug information for distribution with prescriptions — described the potential of his system to tailor information to patients based on age, sex, other conditions, concomitant medications, etc. He felt mandatory regulations “were inappropriate” in that they would inhibit the experimentation and innovation occurring in the field. Jim Breen of First Data Bank seconded Boyd's comments challenging guides with a set format as too restrictive. “One size cannot fit all,” he said and noted that computer technology could not only customize for greater patient receptivity, but also provide rapid updating — something printed guides could not do.<P>

<H5>The off-label argument</H5>

The second instructive criticism of the FDA's proposal concerns the extent of off-label prescribing. Authoritative sources describe it as widespread. The FDA is meticulous in avoiding the suggestion that its labeling of pharmaceuticals inhibits the practice of medicine. Herein lies a difficult, if not insurmountable, problem for medication guides. The FDA tries to address the issue by noting that guides can carry the line that the drug “may be used for other purposes as prescribed by your doctor,” but this is a Band-Aid on a philosophical hemorrhage.<P>

The FDA's proposal is caught on the agency's devotion to the principle that approved labeling is the Bible for a drug when science and medical practice have often gone beyond indication and dosage instructions provided when the drug was first introduced. Drug compendia, coverage policy by insurance companies, and most tellingly, USP's patient literature expand on FDA labeling. Physicians sticking to FDA labeling can, of course, practice medicine effectively, but they are almost inevitably behind the wave.<P>

The situation poses problems for the FDA proposal. For example, consider the plan to research PPIs in 2000 and 2006 evaluating for scientific accuracy. At that time, a USP leaflet on a drug, which will be the consensus of an international panel of experts, may include dosage information at variance with labeling and will be judged inaccurate and not “useful.” No small problem.<P>

Throw into the informational mix the activities of managed care organizations (MCOs). These providers must supply effective, cost-conscious treatment if they are to thrive. Important to them is an informed and cooperative patient base and, understandably, they are involved in patient education. Because they have to be alert to the latest thinking on treating asthma, hypertension, diabetes, etc., with drug therapy they will turn to the latest ideas on how to do this effectively. Rather than inform their patient about drugs with FDA-approved labeling, they will use oral presentations and written materials that reflect their decisions as to what is best. MCOs are already producing their own patient literature, or contracting with specialized literature suppliers. It is inevitable that what they produce on pharmaceuticals will be more up-to-date and, accordingly, superior to FDA medication guides based on approved labeling. In effect, the marketplace — in the form of the most market-sensitive provider — will make FDA guides obsolete because of the need for the latest and most practical knowledge about pharmaceuticals.<P>

At the February meeting, I asked a representative of a large MCO, “Aren't you going to gravitate toward literature which will be independent of FDA labeling?” and I received a positive reply — along with a request for anonymity. This attitude has significance for Rx companies producing patient education literature for MCOs — particularly disease management programs which will have to conform with labeling if they originate from a drug manufacturer.<P>

<H5>A different view</H5>

Considering these factors, the FDA <I>Federal Register</I> notice with its Plan A and B options takes on a new light. Plan A with its immediate rule-making action runs into practical and political obstacles. Is it credible that with the “end of big government” preached by both parties, the FDA is going to force an end to a voluntary system, even if the date is in the future? This option appears to be a strawman to be passed over in favor of the more reasonable Plan B. Under this proposal, mandatory medication guides would be extended where a real need exists (although critics charge that the language here is disturbingly vague) and decisions on the shape and extent of mandatory guides for all drugs would be postponed. Who can quarrel with the FDA holding up a standard and asking those involved with patient education on drugs — Rx firms, AMA, APhA, NCPIE, USP, information suppliers, etc. — to do a better job? All parties profess agreement with the FDA's long-term objective. The character of improvement, however, is not likely to follow the FDA's thinking. The use of new technology to satisfy the goals of demand management — immediacy and interaction for patients — and response of MCOs to market needs will likely determine how drug information is delivered to patients in the millennium.<P>

<H5><I>An Interview with William D. Ballantyne</I></H5></CENTER>

<HR size=4><BR>

<B>Executive summary:</B><I><P>

A niche-marketer has to be customer-focused, whether that customer is an M.D., an MCO, or a PBM. They target their physician base on dollar potential. Aggressive selling to MCOs ties pricing to performance. Bock tries to differentiate their products. For long-term strategy, they prefer licensing, acquisition, or new product development over co-promotion. Mega-mergers open opportunities for smaller companies who can pick up unwanted brands.</I><P><HR size=4><BR>

While everyone's attention is focused on megamergers and megamarketers, there is a countervailing phenomenon: the success of smaller companies in finding protected niches for their products. One of the pioneers of this strategy is Bock Pharmacal Company which just celebrated its 50th anniversary. In the second article in this series, <I>MM&M</I> asked Bock's Bill Ballantyne for the secrets of their success.<P>

<B>Ballantyne:</B> I think the success of smaller pharmaceutical companies such as ours lies in our ability to build relationships with our customers. We are very customer-focused, and that is what enables us to be a major player in small, protected areas.<BR>

We got our start by building relationships with prescribing physicians, but now it works just as well with other market segments, whether it be the managed care customer or the PBM [pharmaceutical benefit manager]. So even as we have grown out of our core base — becoming one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies in the country — we have maintained our basic strategy.<BR>

We started our company with multi-source products, but our goal has always been not only to produce the highest quality, pharmaceutically elegant products, but to differentiate them with characteristics that contribute to patient compliance and thus help ensure effective outcomes. Also, our customer — primarily the physician — has always looked to our sales organization as being both highly trained and highly motivated as well as very focused on their needs.<BR>

Like Athena Neurosciences (see <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I>, February 1996, page 56), we graduated from the base of multi-source products to the marketing of patent-protected products, consistently looking for opportunities to license, acquire and, finally, develop products that fit our profile<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> You made the comparison with Athena, but looking at your product line it's clear that you are not as focused as they are. In other words, you do not concentrate on a single specialty.</I><P>

<B>Ballantyne:</B> That's very true, but we do concentrate primarily on women's health care and respiratory diseases, so to that extent we are also niche marketers (see Exhibit 1, below). We just define it a little differently. I say that because, if the criteria fit, we wouldn't necessarily rule out another therapeutic area or, if you will, another niche market. Those criteria are that there be a strategic fit with our organization and, perhaps even more importantly, a cultural fit with the partner company. It's very important not to neglect the personal aspect, especially if you're going to be in a co-marketing arrangement. Otherwise there are very likely going to be problems somewhere down the line. Obviously you really need to look at the profit opportunities, but if you're going to enter into a partnership, especially with a major manufacturer, you really need to consider the cultural fit.<BR>

Speaking of co-promotion, to be honest, I'm ambivalent about it. If it is strategic, it may make sense, but not if it's purely opportunistic. What co-promotion allows you to do is to generate quick but short-term revenue, but it will not get you to the level of maturity we are aiming at. Licensing or acquisition arrangements allow us more of a long-term strategy, but the real long-term growth will come from the development of our own products, and we now have that capability. Each of those strategies presents some risk, so we aim to maintain a balance of all three.<P>

<CENTER><H5>Exhibit 1</H5>
<IMG SRC="bock1.gif"><P></CENTER>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Do potential partner companies come to you or do you seek them out?</I><P>

<B>Ballantyne:</B> Just two or three years ago very few people even knew who Bock was, but since our success in marketing Keftab, we have now had a number of major companies contacting us to say, “We have some products you may be interested in. What are your capabilities?” Obviously, they want a partner who will promote their product aggressively and successfully, so they look for someone with a track record that proves that they have that capability. That's what our Keftab performance has done for us. We have now established strategic partnerships with top-quality pharmacautical manufacturers.<BR>

To sum up the Keftab story very briefly, this is a patent-protected oral cephalosporin that we took over from Lilly when it was in steep decline, and started promoting the third quarter of 1993 (see Exhibit 2, below). Lilly still owns it, but it is marketed exclusively by us, and in those first two years, we were able to achieve a 150 percent increase over Lilly's baseline. Since then we have added Dynabac to our line — an advanced macrolide antibiotic — for which we acquired the exclusive marketing rights from Lilly in 1995, the year the NDA was approved.<BR>

Of course, we don't rely solely on people coming to us. We have a very aggressive business development group whose sole function is to look for opportunities to acquire products that we can make grow.<P>

<CENTER><H5>Exhibit 2</H5>
<IMG SRC="bock2.gif"><P></CENTER>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Can you define such products for us?</I><P>

<B>Ballantyne:</B> They may be either mature or new products that for some reason don't fit with the organization of the owner. It may be that the volume is too small to make it worthwhile for a large company, or it may no longer be a strategic fit because they're now emphasizing a different therapeutic area, or it may be that they already have a winner in that product category that they don't want to cannibalize. Sometimes they lose interest because there is a drop in sales volume, possibly because of generic erosion, or they have new products with higher priorities and don't want to dilute their resources. It could be any or all these reasons.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> You say you consider yourself a niche company, yet unlike companies that concentrate on relatively small specialties you're competing with the giants in fields like antibiotics. You're out there in the middle of the traffic. That has to be a lot tougher than operating in a sheltered market segment.</I><P>

<B>Ballantyne:</B> That may well be true, but perhaps a little corporate history will explain how it came about (see Exhibit 3, “Corporate Overview,” below). Our company grew out of a small, St. Louis- based, family-owned operation with a line of cough-cold medications. That's how we learned the marketing and sales side of the business. It wasn't until the current owners of the company, both brothers of the founder, took over that we set ourselves the goal of growing into a national company.<BR>

In order to hit our strategic goal we decided we would have to either license, acquire or develop additional products. Using our cold products to generate cash flow, we first, as I mentioned, added multi-source products to our line, and then moved to the next level of growth through acquisitions, licensing, and co-promotion. Our first licensing deal was Emetrol, a product marketed for nausea by Pharmacia [now Pharmacia-Upjohn]. We had a two-fold purpose: obviously to increase revenue, and also to begin to establish a track record. Then came Keftab. And now we are ready for the next level: to market products we have developed internally. We are currently engaged in Phase Three clinical studies with diatomic iodine, which, when approved, will be the first drug for benign fibrocystic breast disease. That, of course, fits right in with our women's healthcare product line. The whole process was very well thought out — a very logical, planned series of events that added up to controlled growth.<BR>

What makes us niche marketers, then, is that while we look at all opportunities that come our way, we turn down those that  really don't fit strategically with our core business — where we don't have the expertise or capability. Admittedly, we have a broader product spectrum than a company like Athena, which concentrates on a single specialty, but we do concentrate on two or perhaps three primary therapeutic areas.<P>

<CENTER><H5>Exhibit 3</H5>
<IMG SRC="bock3.gif"><P></CENTER>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> How do you promote your products? Do you call on primary care physicians?</I><P>

<B>Ballantyne:</B> Yes we do. We use the complete marketing mix, including personal selling and the full range of print promotion. We now have almost ten times as many sales representatives as we started with, who call on more than 70,000 physicians (see Exhibit 4, below). More significantly, our sales per representative have increased 230 percent over the past five years.<P>

<CENTER><H5>Exhibit 4</H5>
<IMG SRC="bock4.gif"><P></CENTER>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Since you don't concentrate your sales calls by specialty, do you concentrate geographically? Or how?</I><P>

<B>Ballantyne:</B> The success of a company our size clearly depends on the ability to target your physician base. After all, our 235 sales reps are competing with companies that can put 1,000 or even 2,000 people in the field, so for us to go after all physicians who could potentially use our products would not be a cost-effective strategy. However, we provide focus not geographically but by micromarketing. With the data and the accuracy of targeting tools that are available today, we can focus on physicians by dollar potential. What that requires is, first, that you have to make sure you are calling on the right physicians, that is, those who are really the ones who are generating the business you're after. Second, you have to make sure your sales force understands and implements the strategy. And third, you have to have a compensation plan that supports the strategy. Actually, being small may be an advantage in targeting our best prospects. All those things are harder to accomplish if you're big.<BR>

Admittedly, though, our size makes life more difficult when it comes to selling multi-source products to managed care organizations, because we can't offer as broad a product line as our competitors. On the other hand, industry is past the phase where people were willing to give discounts regardless of bottom line impact just to be able to get on a formulary. Now that managed care is better understood, companies are being more selective about contracting and so our strategy is to be as aggressive as possible in order to be included in as many formularies and as many plans as possible. But we tie pricing to performance on the part of the MCO — there's no point in being on a formulary if it isn't profitable.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> What do you see as the future of niche marketers? Given the trend to consolidation and elephantiasis in the pharmaceutical industry, will there continue to be room for smaller companies like yours? You rank just about in the middle of the 100 leading companies (see Exhibit 5, below).</I><P>

<B>Ballantyne:</B> All the mergers and acquisitions do make it seem that everyone wants to get bigger, whether for the right reasons or not. Actually, I think this trend opens up additional opportunities for companies such as ours, because as mergers make product lines grow, more companies will find that they really don't have the capability to promote what they would consider some of their smaller brands…which could well be large brands to companies like ours.<BR>

As I look at the market right now, I see three tiers of company sizes. There are the huge companies that have been getting bigger through mergers and acquisitions. Then you've got medium-sized companies that really aren't sure which way to go. They would like to be one of the big companies, but they're not big enough to be able to compete with the giants. At the same time they're too big to be successful as niche companies because they can't make decisions or move as quickly as we can. That leads me to conclude that all the consolidating of large companies that's going on adds to the role companies like ours can play and that the services we provide will be needed that much more. So I am confident that the niche companies will continue to grow in value.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Thank you for sharing your strategic thinking with our readers. As major companies continue to downsize, there are a lot of pharmaceutical executives looking at the opportunities in niche marketing. They will be encouraged by what you have said.</I><P>

<TITLE>DISEASE MANAGEMENT POINTERS</TITLE>

<BODY>

<body bgcolor="ffffff">

<CENTER><H1>EUROPE LOOKS TO U.S. <BR>FOR DISEASE MANAGEMENT POINTERS</H1>

<H5><I>by Jenny Sims</I></H5></CENTER>

<HR><P>
<B>Executive summary:</B><P>

<I>Europeans recognize the potential benefits of disease management, but a conflicting web of public and private interests have kept movement to a minimum with teaching hospitals or physicians' associations acting as the focal point. How the individual markets develop may provide useful information for American marketers in the years to come.</I><P>
<HR><P>

<CENTER><H2><I>“What are they doing in Europe?”</I></H2></CENTER>

Traditionally this was the reaction of U.S. pharmaceutical marketing executives when learning to live with new restrictive practices. Limits on physicians' prescribing prerogatives, pricing restrictions, demands for proof of cost-effectiveness as well as the efficacy of drugs, limits on promotion — as managed care brought one restraint after another to the American market, healthcare companies could turn to their British and other European peers for clues as to how to survive the cost-cutting schemes of government health plans now being adopted by American managed care organizations.<P>

In the case of disease management, however, the trend has been reversed.<P>

A survey of major pharmaceutical companies in the U.K., and a sampling on the continent, shows that Europeans are watching and waiting to see how disease management develops in the U.S. before deciding what they are going to do. Government attempts to cut their drug bills and other healthcare costs make the concept of disease management as attractive to third-party payers in Europe as it is in America. However, as every European country has a different healthcare system — some insurance-based and others government-funded — actual implementation is developing in different ways and at different rates of progress. The only common denominator our survey uncovered is that <I>there is general awareness of the potential benefits of partnerships between payers and pharmaceutical companies aimed at delivering more cost-effective care.</I> This is particularly true in the management of chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes. The fashionable phrase in Europe is “evidence-based medicine,” and all the stakeholders — governments, insurers, the pharmaceutical industry, the medical profession — pay at least lip service to the concept.<P>

But there are stumbling blocks, and they are essentially the same as in the U.S. Chief among them are fear on the part of physicians that they might lose clinical control — be forced to practice “cookbook medicine” — and the lack of outcomes data to prove long-term costs savings, often in the face of higher initial costs.<P>

<H5>The U.K. on hold</H5>

Hard evidence concerning who is doing what in disease management in the United Kingdom is hard to obtain. While admitting interest, pharmaceutical company spokespersons we interviewed (including those at Zeneca, Glaxo Wellcome, Pfizer, Astra, Smith-Kline Beecham, Merck Sharp and Dohme, and Eli Lilly) tried at the same time to draw a veil of secrecy over what they are actually doing. According to Dr. Graham Lister, author of “European Healthcare Trends: Towards Managed Care in Europe,” a Coopers & Lybrand report, disease management is discussed “in darkened rooms.” The usual competitive secrecy is one obvious reason; another is the state of limbo that has been created by the British government.<P>

In the U.K., everyone has access to free treatment under the National Health Service (NHS), though a small, standard fee has to be paid for any drugs prescribed by a primary care physician. This gives the government a decisive voice in the practice of medicine, and 18 months ago it imposed a temporary ban forbidding all organizations in the NHS from making any deals with pharmaceutical companies on disease management packages.<P>

The reasons the Department of Health gave for its ban was that it needed time to seek advice on the legal and ethical implications of NHS organizations entering into monopolistic contracts with drug companies. Meanwhile, they said health service managers and physicians could talk to pharmaceutical companies, but had to report back to the Department of Health on their discussions. The ban is due to expire this month, and pharmaceutical companies are understandably reluctant to be too specific about their plans, which in effect would mean sharing them with their competitors.<P>

As Dr. Lister points out, the result has been not only a lot of secrecy but also a lot of misunderstanding. Where does one draw the line between negotiating deals and discussions? And at what point does reporting to the Department of Health become mandatory — when options are explored or when agreement is reached? The ban came into effect in December 1994, and was issued in the form of an NHS Management Executive Letter to health service managers. It happened to be the 94th executive letter issued since the health service was reformed in 1990, so the ban has become infamously known as EL(94)94.<P>

What will replace the ban is anyone's guess, but there are hopes that at least pilot projects will be allowed. The Department of Health is aware that disease management could save money by introducing more cost-effective ways of treating patients, especially in light of the recent restructuring of the health service. Under this reorganization, the primary- and secondary-care drug budgets of NHS commissioners were combined, making shared care packages more financially attractive to both purchasers and providers. Previously, there was a lack of continuity between the people responsible for initiating treatment and those in charge of long-term care. Under the new system, those most likely to lead the way are the new, innovative breed of primary care physicians — the General Practitioner Fundholders who have been given responsibility for their own budgets and are therefore increasingly concerned about the pharmacoeconomic aspects of their practices.<P>

For instance, such physicians participated in a recent Glaxo Wellcome study that showed that, by switching most asthmatic patients to anti-inflammatory medications, a GP practice can achieve a dramatic decrease in practice visits and hospital admissions, even though initial impact will be to push up its prescribing costs. This is the sort of data pharmaceutical companies desperately need to generate in order to be able to attract partnerships in disease management, but Glaxo Wellcome denies they are doing anything in the disease management field in the U.K. yet. “We have nothing up and running. We are researching and looking at developments in the U.S., but we haven't decided on anything,” Margaret Morgan, Glaxo's communications manager, told <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I>.<P>

<H5>News from the private sector</H5>

While the British government ban holds up deals between pharmaceutical companies and the public sector, private medical insurers, who cover 11 percent of the population, are forging ahead. BUPA, the biggest such company, with 45 percent market share and three million members, has recently set up a disease management team.<P>

BUPA says the primary reasons they are interested in disease management are generating outcome data, and maximizing the return for members.<P>

Ruth Stone, head of BUPA's disease management team, said, “Disease management provides us with opportunities to develop a longer term relationship with members and also gives us an avenue for providing for what might otherwise be considered as high risk members. This may make private health insurance attractive to more people.”<P>

They intend to align patient expectations with outcome through proven quality of treatment, more information about choice of treatment, opportunities for intervention at an earlier stage, seamless service between primary and secondary care and between acute and chronic conditions, and providing members with fuller and more accessible service in maintaining and managing their health.<P>

British physicians, however, tend to be skeptical about their role in disease management plans, and the British Medical Association (BMA) recently published a report on managed care and disease management packages, citing its members' concern over loss of autonomy, as well as concern about data protection of prescribing and other patient information.<P>

Dr. Vivienne Nathanson, head of the BMA's health policy and economic research group, which produced the report, expresses some of the association's fears. “Proposals for disease management packages may in the longer term compromise best medical practice,” she explained. “They may delay the introduction and availability to patients of newer drugs as these come on the market, and will limit doctors' ability to have a clinical input in assessing individual clinical problems and put strict limits on clinical freedom.”<P>

A survey carried out by IBM pharmaceutical consultancy among health service managers confirmed that a major obstacle to disease management in the U.K. is clinician resistance. While the majority of the managers were themselves enthusiastic about its potential, they reported that doctors did not share this positive outlook. In fact, they themselves displayed some polarity of views about pharmaceutical company involvement.<P>

“Mistrust and antipathy are firmly embedded in some quarters,” the report said. Some respondents expressed the opinion that pharmaceutical companies felt they could run services better than the National Health Service, and the NHS managers understandably resented that attitude. Nevertheless, more than 40 percent said they would support programs which would benefit a particular product, provided there was evidence that it would benefit patients. Any program not based on such evidence, however, was out of the question.<P>

<H5>The picture on the continent</H5>

Meanwhile, disease management is also being discussed and developed in other European countries, though the Coopers & Lybrand report referred to earlier warns stakeholders that selection of appropriate strategies for disease management will require an understanding of the main factors contributing to the impact of particular diseases. It adds, “Identification of diseases for which costs are expected to rise faster than average is important.”<P>

It says it is essential to:
<UL><LI> consider the impact of the aging population and other changes in demography and morbidity,
<LI> be able to examine the impact on overall disease costs of different strategies for medical intervention, and
<LI> be able to estimate the impact of a change to greater use of health prevention measures, switching from secondary to primary care and alternative medical treatment protocols.</UL><P>

As for data on specific countries they, as in the U.K., are hard to come by.<P>

<B>In the Netherlands</B>, healthcare costs are forecast to rise by one percent per year until 2030, of which 70 percent will be due to aging, the rest due to population growth. The Dutch government, not surprisingly, is examining ways of containing costs, including disease management strategies, basing its priorities on the predicted development of healthcare costs by disease category (see Table 1, below).<P>

<CENTER><H5>Table 1</H5>
<IMG SRC="dm_tab1.gif"></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Demography has an important role to play in rising healthcare costs. In the Netherlands, costs are forecast to rise by one percent per year until 2030, of which 70 percent will be due to ageing, the rest to population growth.</I></CENTER><P>

<B>In Germany</B>, Glaxo Wellcome is planning to launch a pilot project this summer for the treatment of asthma. It involves a sickness fund (as state insurance plans are called) and a physicians' association, and could become a model for future packages in other disease categories. The GPs and hospital doctors participating in the study will provide data to determine whether healthcare providers are adhering to treatment guidelines, compare prescribing habits, and measure patients' quality of life. According to a company spokesman in Hamburg, the findings will be kept confidential and not used against individual physicians; instead they will be used to compile a better package of patient care.<P>

This is the pattern, the Coopers & Lybrand report predicts, that is likely to prevail in other European countries as well: a consensual arrangement in which teaching hospitals or physician associations, rather than third-party payers, will act as the focal point for clinical guidelines and information systems.<P>

German doctors have reason to show heightened interest in disease management schemes which might 
cut prescribing costs since the German government introduced harsh new legislation a few years ago to fine those who failed to keep within prescribed drug budgets. And while only a very small proportion of the population has private health insurance, the insurance companies are showing increasing interest in disease management partnerships.<P>

As in Great Britain, other German healthcare reforms have brought hospital and primary care prescribing budgets together, further opening the door to disease management possibilities. Previously, German GPs were not interested in measures that cut costs only in the hospital sector. Taking all these trends into account, Dr. Klaus Welzel, director of corporate affairs at Eli Lilly, says: “I think elements of managed care, like disease management, will help improve quality [as well as] maintain or reduce costs, but a lot of issues are involved and it might take another three years before things take off.” He told us that Lilly is planning a disease management project for congenital heart failure in Berlin, but would not reveal further details. Also, the company is going ahead with a two-year pilot project in <B>Russia</B> for the management of diabetes, in partnership with the U.S. government and others.<P>

<B>In Sweden</B>, too, changes are taking place which favor the development of disease management partnerships. Current government proposals will bring the financing of hospital care, general practitioners, and the retail pharmacy budget all under the control of regional authorities, enabling healthcare purchasers to balance expenditures across the different sectors and to set longer term treatment objectives. Astra Pharmaceuticals is believed to be developing major disease management packages, but a company spokesperson said they are not prepared to go public yet.<P>

<H5>What's at stake for the U.S.</H5>

Apart from the obvious interest of U.S. healthcare companies that do business there, the development of disease management programs in Europe could soon provide useful information for American marketers. According to Dr. Lister, “Capture of outcomes data is at the heart of disease management development in Europe.” Nothing new there — except that two factors about the European situation may prove helpful:<P>

1. European health systems are more highly centralized than ours, so that the capture of such data will 
present far fewer problems. In some countries, in fact, it may already exist, awaiting only appropriate analysis.<P>

2. At the same time, each country's system is somewhat different, so that there will be a variety of models to examine. Continuous comparisons of costs as different countries adopt different disease management strategies will provide data to replace the hypothetical assumptions that disease management planning has up to now been forced to rely on.<P>

As a result, while European pharmaceutical companies are continuing to observe developments in the U.S., in a few years' time the roles may be reversed.<P>

<TITLE>Adding the Internet to your marketing strategy</TITLE>

<body bgcolor="ffffff">

<CENTER><H1>Adding the Internet<BR> to your marketing strategy</H1>
<H5><I>by Janet Carlson</I></H5></CENTER><P>
<HR><P>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>The Internet has shown itself to be a valuable resource to pharmaceutical manufacturers, well worth the time and effort it takes to establish a site. Companies define their site strategy by defining their customers' needs and interests. A site is used to disseminate information, launch product, develop disease resource centers, and provide a database of customers. The process takes time and thought—content, graphics, internal review — because companies look at the Net as a new medium, unlike any other. And once online, a site is subject to constant updating and refining.</I><P>
<HR><P>

Everyone, including pharmaceutical companies, is convinced that cyberspace is the place to be these days — on the “Net” to those in the know. Why? Because that's where the future is and, one hopes, the customer of tomorrow. Bottom line, the Net offers the latest way to reach out, greet, and communicate with the medical profession, patients, researchers, and the public at large.<P>

Creating a company home page is like going on one's first date. The experience can be rather chilling and exhilarating at the same time, and always more expensive than you ever guessed. There's no guarantee it will be a positive experience. Worse, what if you like it but the other person doesn't like you and doesn't respond? Why bother? Like dating, everyone hopes that creating a site will be great once they finally do it.<P>

How can you as a marketer in the medical industry get on this information highway? Should your company simply dive in? Is it better to wait and figure out your direction first? What kind of results are you looking to achieve, and how much are you willing to invest to get those results? These are not easy questions and no easy answers exist; more questions keep cropping up as the Internet keeps changing and expanding to include more and more information — and competitors, no less — each day.<P>

Deciding to investigate, we convened a panel of experts: Jim Taylor of Pfizer, Kevin White of Roche Laboratories, David Hopp of Cato Source, Jim Bickley and team of Eli Lilly and Company, and Rob Partridge of Rh&#244;ne-Polenc Rohr, and we asked their opinions about what's going on and what direction they expect these sites to take in the future. Each, a veritable Webmaster or Master of the Web Universe, has been intimately involved in the creation of their respective company's web site. The following discussion should provide some ideas and insights to help you determine the direction your company can take with your site.<P>

We asked our panel the following questions: what was the company's overall goal for the site? What's the process and how long does it take? What have you learned? How will your site grow and change?<P>

<H5>Web site strategy</H5>

Each company developed its Web site strategy based on how it defined its customers' needs and interests. In developing a communications strategy utilizing the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW), there is no wrong approach, there are no rules. Many companies are still struggling with how they define the Internet; some companies see it is an advertising vehicle, some as a communications tool, some as a combination of the two. Many manufacturers have used the Net for product launches or to develop disease resource centers, while others focus on developing a database of customers.<P>

Jim Taylor says Pfizer's original goal was “basically to get information out there about our products to anyone interested.” The Internet offers the best medium for providing consumers with more comprehensive, user-friendly information on their condition, and provides a solution in the form of the Pfizer product. Through the number of recorded visits to the site, the home page also serves as an immediate market research tool, both in measuring consumer interest in a product and/or company whose page the customer visits.<P>

By contrast, Roche took a more exploratory route. According to Kevin White, Roche wanted to “figure out how we can achieve a shared value of providing services and sticking to our core capabilities with customers and consumers.” He adds, “We didn't expect any neat plans going in [the Internet]. We knew it would be a learning experience which, combined with business knowledge, would enable us to build a plan in the future.” Setting up a web site may be nerve-wracking or scary at first, but according to White of Roche, it should be viewed as an investment. “The Internet provides a virtual 24-hour store in which you can market and sell individual products/efforts within the company,” claims White. More specifically, marketers should view the Internet as a long-term investment that has not reached its full target audience potential. “As far as physicians and their use of the Internet goes,” warns White, “many would love to talk to each other more via e-mail on the Net, but specialists are the main physicians on-line today.” White had a few words of warning for those looking for business strategies, “Don't wait, because they don't exist yet!”<P>

David Hopp of Cato Source says, “A site's purpose is simple. To use IBM's creed: provide timely, accurate, comprehensive information.” A company can expect to mature on the Net, adding news and tips, for example, as it goes along. To most users, the Internet is a whole new world, says Hopp, but it has been around for 30 years and has been evolving over that long period of time. He noted that for the last ten years, the best work done on the Internet has been created at universities, but that is rapidly changing. The way the Internet is used today is quite different from how it was used historically, and he expects many more changes in its utilization in the future.<P>

Eli Lilly was one of the first pharmaceutical companies to have a site in cyberspace, which it is constantly revising and refining. Jim Bickley sees the Internet as a unique outlet for developing disease-specific resource centers and Lilly has redefined its goal to be the “center of the diabetes universe in cyberspace.” It introduced a customized pilot called “Managing Your Diabetes,” complete with patient information on diabetes, frequently asked questions (FAQ), diabetic games and product information, along with a schedule of medical meetings and events pertaining to diabetes. “We designed this site specifically for patients who are looking for ways to manage their disease, and for healthcare professionals who are looking for the latest updates on the disease.”<P>

The Rh&#244;ne-Polenc Rohr web site strategy is to be connected — or interlinked — with other profit and nonprofit sites on the World Wide Web, says Rob Partridge. “We're trying to be as much a clearinghouse for everyone to get to other areas of information after they investigated what RPR has to offer,” he says. “Our home page is going to evolve along the lines of people using it, through feedback, and through new ideas and applications that come to our attention.” As a company, RPR feels strongly that the investment they are making today will pay off exponentially, especially if it is tied to the activities of the field sales force. By adding the strength of the medical affairs department in their ability to direct customers to the site, RPR believes that the site will increase peoples' familiarity with the company's products and that a return on investment will result.<P>

<H5>Creating the Web site</H5>

Creating a company Web site is still an exciting idea to many pharmaceutical companies. Most have explored their options, surfing the Net and feeling their way around on their own. Seeing the competitive company pack grow on the Web, many companies felt the pressure to establish a presence sooner rather than later. The challenge in negotiating these uncharted waters is first to find your destination, or goals. Most companies then researched in the form of focus groups with customers as they developed and revised their strategies and creative approaches.<P>

White of Roche says the first steps in the creation of a site was “to figure out how we as a company can achieve shared value with our customers and consumers.” He went on to emphasize the importance the company placed in “moving to information-based selling from selling 'out of the bag.'” Roche focused on fundamental issues in creating their site, such as understanding their company's current relationship with their customers and how they could evolve the relationship into a virtual environment. “If we think through the relationship,” says White, “we will have a competitive advantage.”<P>

“We at Pfizer saw the task of developing a web site for our allergy product as a creative team effort,” says Taylor. A team was assembled of internal information systems people and representatives from marketing, medical affairs, traditional ad agencies, and website developers. “We asked ourselves, what can we do that would be useful and interesting to our customers,” says Taylor. The process of deciding site content took several months. There were many policy issues that had to be tabled, discussed, and approved. Research was done with several focus groups. In addition, Pfizer wanted to experiment with several new technologies. Perhaps the single biggest issue was the creative aspect of site design. “This was a new medium for us,” says Taylor. “It takes time to decide on positioning, and how to take advantage of the Net. We were sensitive about not wanting to shovel copies of print ads onto the Web, so we took our time to make this interesting to people.” After the preliminary work was done, the results were subject to an internal review process. The site even went up on an experimental “intranet” so that employees could use it and make their suggestions. “The site continues to evolve in response to the number and areas of interest that appeal to our customers,” says Taylor.<P>

Hopp of Cato Source looks at setting up a web site from a very practical standpoint. Because market research is critical to establishing a site, he recommends starting the process by “understanding what people, customers specifically, see as value.” He suggests that customers or “end-users” have no time to waste, and a successful site guides “people to get their job done in their own terms. This is not a treasure hunt or an IQ test. The Web site helps my customers get their job done.”<P>

Infrastructure can take months to create, while the design phase with user testing can also add a few months. In addressing the infrastructure requirements in building a site, Hopp recommends choosing rational databases and search tools. He says that the navigational tools must be easy to use, and you should be aware of the number of “clicks” it takes the customer to get to the information he or she wants from your site. Hopp advised keeping the “click count” as low as possible, which will impact the Web design. To help potential customers find your site, he recommends using targeted print media, trade shows, direct mail, and meetings, using “search engine” listings (such as Yahoo!, Alta Vista, or “The Next Big Thing,” which combines 250 search tools and can be a very powerful traffic driving device) for your site. To measure traffic, Hopp uses WebLog software, which registers users, validates e-mail, establishes “hits” versus the location of entry, and “hits” on advertising within the site.<P>

According to Bickley of Eli Lilly, establishing the corporate site was a ten-month process that used the skills of both internal and external consultants. Bickley and his team all felt strongly that the keys to success are to have a specific purpose and use dedicated people, giving them a flexible timeline, because things don't always go as planned. The team focussed their efforts on being responsive to customers' needs and providing customer service. They are dedicated to responding to customers' feedback and requests within 48 hours.<P>
This kind of response capability requires state-of-the-art technology. Lilly's customers access the corporate home page and the “Managing Your Diabetes” site via a full T1 line (allowing a maximum number of people to dial into the site at one time with no delay). The diabetes group provides the content and plans to update the site on a weekly basis. The team will eventually upgrade the site to include “bells and whistles” such as Webforce (a multimedia software program which provides audio and video capabilities) to add interest and spur additional interactivity with the site. They plan to analyze traffic to the site via a program called Web Traffic, while actively promoting the site through interviews, Internet servers, and press notices, as well as through diabetes, business, and medical publications.<P>

RPR's first Internet presence was established last September through the Orbis Broadcast Group on “America's Housecall.” According to Partridge, RPR plans to continue using that forum, because it is a third party area with other communication links that offers some important advantages.<P>

The development of the dedicated RPR site, from start to finish, took about five months. While he doesn't recommend it, Partridge says that companies can cut this time in half by putting part of the site up under an “under construction” sign. He further adds that RPR “wanted to wait until the site was airtight, and had all the initial applications that we wanted it to have, knowing it's going to continue to evolve.”<P>

The RPR site was intended to be “a deep and thorough treatment of all our product categories,” says Partridge. No small task for a company with 85 products making up their portfolio. In addition, they wanted to include links to patient and professional organizations and different therapeutic areas. “This was not,” says Partridge, “to be an electronic version of our annual report. This was a new project which required us to treat each area as a starting point. We have more than 4,000 individual 'pages' backing up all the components of the Web site.”<P>

Further time was taken for internal review. “In a company of this size, we have many people who had contributions and opinions to make about how things should look. So there were many meetings, many refinements, many reviews.” Some of the content was driven by outside forces. Partridge says that the driving force behind their establishing a site was the growing numbers of people asking for information—patients, vendors, consultants. “It became clear that this was another communications tool that the healthcare industry would be looking toward for information.” But supplying information to the pharmaceutical universe is no easy task. “There are many targets for our message—consumers, physicians, nurses, and pharmacists to name a few. We have to make sure that we are accurate and approved by the trade. There are regulatory requirements for language which is included in the development of a page, and this has to be considered.” At RPR, product materials were developed with the product managers, research and development with the clinical people. This was a team effort, with no one person having absolute veto power over anything that went into the site. The medium made this process easy and successful. “Unlike a printed press kit, brochure, or document, anything that is found objectionable can be quickly modified and fine tuned,” says Partridge. But the technology can be too successful. The team decided to postpone plans to establish an interactive e-mail page. They felt the expected 2,000-3,000 responses a day would quickly swamp the staff. They are exploring other ways, including an 800/ 888 number, to handle questions.<P>

As a result of their research, RPR feels confident of higher online usage within certain therapeutic areas, especially oncology and orthopedics. A common question by physicians, says Partridge, is “Do you have some of this stuff available on the Internet?'” He says that the Internet is another way to communicate with the patient/consumer, especially now that people are increasingly relying on themselves to get information. He notes that more and more consumers are reading medical magazines and watching televised medical reports or special cable segments on certain therapeutic areas. They then walk into their physician's office armed with information about their condition or about the drugs they feel might be appropriate for them.<P>

<H5>What has been learned?</H5>

Most companies who took the plunge in creating a pharmaceutical company site have seen the site undergo various levels of revision, learning along the way. No company we spoke with felt it had enough experience on the Web to create a “handbook for success,” yet there were insights:<P>

Taylor of Pfizer felt a major key to success was to find people who work well together and who share an interest in the site's content as well as in developing ideas and creativity that make it work. The Pfizer site takes a disease-focused approach and continually refreshes its data. In the works are technical enhancements such as Java software, so that users who want a “high tech” site (provided they have the tools needed) will be able to take advantage of the newest browsing technology. Pfizer plans to let its customers guide them in future site development.<P>

White of Roche offers a positive approach to the challenges of an evolving site. “Don't hold up the process for a second, be pragmatic, be legal, but know that we are all learning,” he says. “We have an environment that will be adapting to all changes. There really are no serious mistakes you can make if you treat your customers well.” He recommends that each page have a specific focus, and that we recognize that pages will become more focused with customer input and usage over time. “Before we can do much in Internet development,” he says, “we need to understand what our customers need and what the Internet means to them.”<P>

Highly in favor of creating a company site, despite the challenge of creating and launching a successful site, David Hopp of Cato Source feels that there is not yet solid ground for business decisions on the Internet. That having been said, he predicts that, “Things will be different in years to come. The Internet is a great idea, it is lots of fun and will position your company for sound business decisions in the future.”<P>

Partridge of RPR emphasizes the power of the Internet and the impact it could have on the practice of 
medicine. Because companies are changing the way information is disseminated, the Net has had major impact in empowering patients, which changes the way medical decisions are being made. Partridge feels it is this kind of power which will cause the Internet to “leapfrog other communications vehicles.” He adds that the Internet is a great equalizer of companies, because a company can excel in certain areas.”<P>

<H5>What about the future?</H5>

There is no question that our panel feels the Internet will be a key tool in their future communications mix. Each panelist says his respective company has plans to expand into other therapeutic areas and perhaps partner with other companies, such as managed healthcare groups. The results of their current efforts, guided by feedback from their customers, will impact their future efforts as well as the evolution and creation of other companies' sites within the pharmaceutical industry.<P>

Taylor of Pfizer takes a very optimistic viewpoint. “I certainly think you're going to see more sites, because we have a rich product line out there already. You're going to see more sites on our different products. I think you're also going to see this [current] site expand. We have lots of ideas of additional things we can do to help people get more information about allergies and treatment options and our intent is to see what we've done, how that's received and just keep growing the site.” Taylor says Pfizer is exploring adding a managed care organization section within the site. “The best feedback for us is going to be which part of the site you visited. So if we see a lot of visits to a certain part of the site, we'll do more of that kind of thing. If we see areas where people aren't spending a lot of time, we'll agree that it might be a good idea to us, but eliminate it if it is not what people are interested in.”<P>

Roche will be focusing on a strategy of developing a relationship with the customer on a one-to-one basis using information gained through their site to develop a “virtual selling” scenario, says White. “All of a sudden our customers are talking to us. It's almost like you can touch them, which is certainly a new ball game for us. Companies aren't used to that kind of relationship.”<P>

Hopp's main goal in looking at the future of his site is to “bring products and services to the people who need them in order to do their work more easily.” He finds gathering information in the form of feedback from his customers the key in the directionality of the site's development and has created a reader electronic response in the form of a business reply card.<P>

Bickley and the Lilly team view the corporate site and the diabetes center as being linked, with the corporate site serving as a springboard for those searching for more information on diabetes. Because the “Managing Your Diabetes” site is in a pilot phase, Lilly will closely monitor the feedback and results to determine the “go/no go” status of the disease-focused information center. Currently, they are at the midway point with the pilot. Bickley states they are receiving a “healthy amount of constructive feedback” that will lead to enriching further development of the site.<P>

To Partridge of RPR, “What's next is the ongoing effort to update the page as it matures and evolves.” RPR views the Internet as another communications tool and plans to include its sales representatives in the effort to drive traffic to the site.<P>

According to Partridge, every representative has the home address (uniform resource locator, or URL) of the site on their business card. RPR will be including components of the site and its URL at key medical meetings, in symposia, and in slide kits given to doctors. Partridge notes that the Internet is indeed a unique medium, but that they will be looking at milestones which are no different from those employed in the evaluation of other forms of communication.<P>

Pharmaceutical marketing is moving toward the World Wide Web, and doing so quickly. Many lessons have already been learned, but much work still needs to be done in order to say our industry has mastered this medium.<P>

<CENTER><H1>FDA letters provide useful pointers</H1>

<H5><I>by James G. Dickinson</I></H5></CENTER>

<HR>

<H4>Executive summary:</H4>

<I>To facilitate industry compliance in a non-threatening, non-embarrassing manner, the FDA has been issuing to manufacturers nonpublic letters that are not officially labeled “Warning Letters,” but which call the recipients to task for various shortcomings.  A typical month provides many pointers for the careful drug manufacturer to follow in order to steer clear of FDA admonition.</I><P>

<HR><P>

<I>With marketing materials, the word “treat” has more power and needs more care than the term “used in”…<BR>
If you want to tell a formulary committee that your product is better value than a competing product for the 
same indication, be careful to include a qualifying statement that this doesn't necessarily suggest comparable safety and efficacy…<BR>
Don't use the term “excellent side-effect profile” for a product that has FDA-required serious warnings…</I><P>
These are but a few of the useful pointers to industry contained in just one monthly batch of FDA letters 
to pharmaceutical marketers issued by the agency's Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications (DDMAC).<P>
The usually nonpublic letters have recently become the focus of congressional attention through a request from House Commerce oversight and investigations chairman Joe Barton (R. - Texas) to FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler for all such letters sent during 1995 (see “Should we be embarrassed?” <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I>, June 1996, p. 10).<P>

<H5>Suspicious letters</H5>

Because they are not officially-labeled “Warning Letters” which the agency is required to make routinely available for public scrutiny, these DDMAC letters have come under suspicion in some quarters for being somehow instruments for “under the counter” conduct of public business.<P>

DDMAC's own explanation for them is that they are really no different from other FDA offices' routine correspondence with industry that doesn't rise to the level of a formal Warning Letter. Moreover, by not posting these lower-level letters publicly, DDMAC feels that it spares the recipients some needless embarrassment (competitors might be quick to exploit the letters in trade channels) and thereby induces faster, more cooperative compliance.<P>

That may or may not be a sufficient reason to conceal the letters from the public. Congressman Barton, however, suspects that serious matters may be hidden this way, including improper FDA coercion of industry and unfair surrender of companies' rights to do as they wish in their own marketing operations.<P>

There's another consideration, also. Concealment of the correspondence may deprive other companies of 
the valuable lessons to be learned from observing the outcomes of real-world regulatory situations.<P>

And there's yet another element, as well. Faith in “the system” may be undermined if its processes are kept in the dark. That can lead directly to wider noncompliance.<P>

With these considerations in mind, I have begun filing routine monthly requests for these DDMAC untitled letters to industry, and for the associated company responses. A determination has been made in the agency that, provided the release of the correspondence will not impact a so-called “open investigatory file,” such letters may be released.<P>

One such monthly package (August 1995) contained a total of 24 letters in correspondence files for 18 companies (see list, below). Of these, 13 responded to requests for preclearance of materials voluntarily submitted; 4 were letters initiated by DDMAC from its own monitoring of industry marketing activities; 4 responded to routine submissions of FDA Form 2253s by companies reporting on their marketing activities for specific products; 2 were conclusions of earlier correspondence about matters that could not be readily characterized as to source; and 2 were initiated by DDMAC in response to complaints.<P>

Of the total, 12 letters contained DDMAC objections to the industry marketing material in question; 8 gave clean bills of health to specific marketing pieces; 4 were informational or of an “advice” nature without being judgmental concerning marketing concepts under development; and 1 was administrative.<P>

<H5>Important principals</H5>

Although letters that were critical of company materials were obviously crafted to address specific situations in their own contexts, principles were discernible that would apply to any company in any context.<P>

For example, in an August 31 letter to Martha A. Brumfield, senior associate director in Pfizer's regulatory affairs division, DDMAC's Joan Hankin took issue with “homemade” promotional materials for Zoloft disseminated to the Pikes Peak Formulary Committee by a Pfizer representative, Bob Benson.<P>

How those materials got into DDMAC hands can only be wondered about, but it's a fair bet that they first fell into the hands of a competitor who faxed them to the FDA in an effort to ruin Mr. Benson's game.<P>

The materials bore, DDMAC's letter noted, a footnote acknowledging their unauthorized status: “This data 
is for informational purposes only — not all is FDA approved nor does it represent Pfizer's official viewpoints.”<P>

DDMAC deduced from the materials that they contained unsubstantiated claims for Zoloft, and it requested Pfizer's “written response to DDMAC by tomorrow,” including:
<UL>
<LI>1. A copy of the complete set of promotional materials at issue;
<LI>2. The results of Pfizer's investigation into this matter; and
<LI>3. Pfizer's plan for corrective action.</UL><P>

The DDMAC package of correspondence I received did not contain the final outcome of this matter (probably because it continued through the following month and the package was limited to August), but it did include the next-day response of Margaret A. Longshore, Pfizer's director of regulatory affairs, which assured DDMAC: “All attempts are being made to determine the existence of and obtain copies of any and all 'homemade' promotional materials at issue. We expect to meet with the Pfizer representative and any other appropriate field personnel on Tuesday, September 5, 1995, our next business, to further investigate this issue and determine if further disciplinary action is appropriate. A letter will be provided to the Pikes Peak Formulary Committee that provides appropriate information on Zoloft, prior to its September 7, 1995 meetings, subject to our confirmation of the issue you have brought to our attention.”<P>

<H5>Lessons learned</H5>

The bottom line for bystanders out of this normally nonpublic exchange is:<BR>
<I>Don't let sales representatives develop their own promotional materials that may not comply with either company or FDA requirements…</I><P>

Other lessons to be learned from correspondence in the package include:<BR>
<I>You can't claim superiority for a product that is the same as its therapeutically equivalent generic competitor…</I><BR>
<I>Price comparisons based on Average Wholesale Price (AWP) must be “extremely limited” because such data do not represent actual costs to patients or pharmacies…</I><BR>
Statements like <I>“All prescription medicines may sometimes produce undesirable side effects in some people” can actually minimize risk and should not be used in place of side effects information…</I><BR>
<I>Materials that are not product-specific (and thus not regulated by the FDA) may nevertheless be deemed 
product-specific (and regulatable) if they refer patients to their doctor and the product is the only one on the market for the condition…</I><P>

For as long as the FDA continues to have statutory authority to regulate the language that pharmaceutical marketers use, the agency must be commended for rendering a significant service to the industry by making these letters publicly available at last.<P>

<CENTER><H3>In-House Agencies have the Advantage</H3>
<I>by Martin M. Meaney</I></CENTER>
<H5>Executive summary:</H5>
<I>To be effective, an in-house agency must operate like a full-service agency or else it is nothing more than an expanded advertising department. Advantages are: intimacy with the parent corporation, more efficient communication, less expensive.</I><HR><P>

The current healthcare marketing environment challenges manufacturers to keep an eye on cost without taking the other eye off quality. Typically, companies are responding to this challenge by integrating their sales and marketing departments and allowing greater decision-making at a more local level. Another common consolidating strategy is to cut down on the number of advertising agencies they work with, since having one therapeutic marketing group — whether it be cardiovasculars, analgesics, or antibiotics — work with more than one or at most two agencies is often seen as too time-consuming and wasteful of economic resources.<P>

Judging by the queries and visits we have received at 30 West Advertising, a Wyeth-Ayerst Company (see “Profile of 30 West,” below), one of the options major companies are looking into is to work with an in-house advertising agency. They want to know how we operate and whether our experience can shed light on the pros and cons of such a relationship. Since others may at least have asked themselves these questions, let me answer them from the point of view of an in-house agency head who previously had worked at independent shops and even headed his own. Frankly, I'll put the emphasis on the pros; others are better positioned to make the case for independent agencies (see Perspective #2, below).<P>

<H5>Down trends and up</H5>

Those of us who have been part of the pharmaceutical advertising scene for a number of years remember when a fair number of companies had major internal advertising capabilities, including some that rivaled independent agencies in size and scope. During the '80s, the pendulum swung to the other end with only two or three companies maintaining such facilities. At the same time, there was an incredible growth in the number of independent healthcare advertising agencies.<P>
Now the trend may once again be reversing.<P>
One reason is that mergers and acquisitions have produced greatly expanded product lines. Often that means that the company is involved in a substantial number of therapeutic areas, and that is a prerequisite in setting up a truly professional internal agency, one that can compete across the board, not just handle routine tasks and left-over products. I'll have more to say about recruiting later, but essentially, you cannot attract top-flight professionals if you cannot assure them of a broad variety of challenging assignments.<P>

Another reason why I look to a resurgence of in-house agencies is the current emphasis on tight, 
economical operation. Again, saving the details for later, the key facts about in-house agencies are: they can operate at substantially lower cost; they can be more efficient in media planning and placement, and they make it unnecessary to have a separate advertising department as well.<P>

Those who are considering the possibility of opening an internal agency should be aware of the critical difference between having a full-service agency that happens to belong to the manufacturer, and something called an agency that is de facto an expanded advertising department. Let me, therefore, outline the ways in which 30 West is just like any other agency.<P>

<H5>The similarities</H5>

These are the highlights:
<UL>
<LI> We keep time sheets and work on a fee basis.
<LI> We negotiate compensation with our client at the beginning of each year, based on projected work load, and adjust the fee periodically if necessary.
<LI>Our clients don't just pop in to see us. They call and schedule meetings, just as if we were out of town.
<LI>We make competitive presentations, and are given exactly the same briefing as the other competitors, 
no more no less.
<LI>We take the same aggressive attitude toward new business as any other agency. The excitement is the same, and this strong competitive sense keeps the creative juices flowing.
<LI>We can be fired, just like an outside agency. That may seem surprising since we are a division of the same corporation as our client, but product managers are judged by the success of their promotions, and if what the agency produces doesn't measure up, it directly affects their own careers. Frankly, I believe that's a good thing because a little anxiety is very helpful in creating the best product.</UL><P>

<H5>Emphasizing people</H5>

I have left to last the most critical similarity between internal and independent agencies: the primary emphasis on personnel, with creative talent taking precedence for obvious reasons. In recruiting writers and artists, we look for people of exceptional competence, who have the self-discipline necessary for consistent, high-quality work. Mostly, we hire people from major agencies, but in addition to their track record we also try to assess their adaptability to the corporate milieu. Ours is a somewhat more structured environment than you might find in an independent agency, with perhaps a stricter dress code. After all, we are located at company headquarters.<P>

What we offer in return is location. We want people who enjoy big-agency excitement, but who would rather work in or near the community where they live.<P>

When we first started, many friends in the profession cautioned me: what good, creative talent would want to move — not even to Philadelphia but to a Philadelphia suburb? Every ancient W.C. Fields joke was revived. As it turned out, the kind of talented person we wanted not only was willing to relocate, but considered the pleasant environment a major plus.<P>

Since then, in fact, a number of independent agencies have moved to the suburbs, indicating a change in attitude. Lots of people prefer a 15-minute commute to a 70-minute drive or an hour on a train or bus. Also, New York City rents are higher, and stepping over bodies in the street gets a little worrisome after awhile. A consequent advantage for us is that the people we attract are family-oriented, more serious about their work, less liable to spend a lot of time playing. In any case, the two-martini lunch is rare nowadays, anywhere.<P>

Finally, but extremely important, the salaries we pay are commensurate with people's experience and competence. No one is going to come here from another job for less money.<P>

A quick word about what anyone planning to staff an in-house agency should not do. There has been a tendency in the past to staff such agencies with people from the client side who lack agency experience. A good district manager is not likely to make a good art director or even account executive. In fact, in our recruiting we look for people whose background complements — but does not mimic — that of product managers.<P>

In short, like any agency, we take great pride in our work and delight in considering ourselves highly competitive. But to justify our existence we obviously also need to offer our client some advantages.<P>

<H5>On the plus side</H5>

The most challenging work going on in our industry right now — long before anyone starts working on promotion campaigns — is strategic market planning. Ideally, an agency should be involved in this planning process almost as soon as a product comes out of R&D. New brands are too precious and too rare to rely on the traditional agency relationship. Unfortunately, at that point in the planning process, the agency all too often has not even been appointed.<P>

An in-house agency is far better positioned to play this role of helping to structure the brand profile. Since it's part of the corporation, there's less concern about confidentiality; in addition, such an agency is more in tune with what's going on in the company, more likely to be intimate with corporate thinking.<P>

The second advantage I would cite is more efficient communication. I said the client didn't drop in on us without an appointment. True. Yet proximity allows for daily, on-going, bump-into-you-in-the-cafeteria dialogue with product management.<P>

The benefit of such daily contact is clearly shown in the development of new campaigns. Like any agency's, our work sometimes gets rejected, but because communication is swift and precise, it happens more rarely. We are not averse to showing the client preliminary sketches or to discuss copy strategies as they evolve. As a result, by the time the campaign is finished we are usually in close agreement.<P>

The third major advantage from the product manager's point of view is that an in-house agency is significantly less expensive. Take 30 West as an example. We are not a profit center. That obviously reduces our hourly rate, since it is based solely on salary costs, rent, phones, and office expenses. Where the average rate for independent agencies now ranges from $100 an hour and up, we charge some 30 to 40 percent less.<P>

Another economy factor is that there is no advertising department, hence no duplication. Instead, there are two technical groups: one for print production, the other for audiovisual work. The production group handles everything except journal inserts both for 30 West and for all outside agencies.<P>

The agency media department also plays a key role in the company's return on investment. Since it handles all Wyeth-Ayerst products, whether assigned to 30 West or not, it has assumed the number one position in space placed among all healthcare agencies. Significant savings accrue simply by the elimination of duplication and the ability to negotiate the best rates without recourse to a syndicated buying service.<P>

There was a time in making new business presentations when I started with the cost advantage. I no longer feel the need even to bring it up. If we did not offer advantages in the quality of the work, better communications and deeper involvement, the cost advantage wouldn't cut much ice.<P>

Are there disadvantages to being an in-house agency?<P>

They have a reputation that is troublesome...a feeling that developed over the years that they are less professional. To be perfectly honest, I think the feeling was often justified. When we started, that made it more difficult for us to be assigned major brands, since the prevailing pattern was for in-house agencies to be assigned the left-overs, the ancillary jobs it wasn't worth giving to an independent agency. I'm happy to say that this is no longer the case. We don't divide any products with external agencies; we either do it all or nothing. And I anticipate that from here on in we will be invited to take part in all competitive presentations.<P>

<H5>The global view</H5>

One way to sum up the distinctive character of an in-house agency is this: if I were a marketing director who's hired a new product manager, I'd have him spend time at the internal agency to learn the ropes. Their staff not only knows advertising and promotion as well as any other agency, they also know the corporate problems, the corporate pitfalls, the corporate protocols, the corporate culture. They have the kind of intimate product knowledge — plus the continuity — that can save the new product manager a lot of time and trouble. In our case, we don't just have a good working relationship with the product management group, I don't think it would be overstating things to call it bonding.<P>

So we are in truth an advertising agency that happens to be owned by a corporation. Whether or not we're setting a trend remains to be seen, but I do think that the more cost conscious advertisers become, the more likely they are at least to consider the in-house option. Of course, a company has to be big enough to sustain an internal agency…to have the critical mass to be able to afford to hire the best professionals, to be able to offer enough variety to attract quality people, and to provide them with sufficient challenges to keep them content.<P>

I have only one word of caution. Hiring agency people, structuring yourself like an agency, and charging like an agency doesn't make you an agency. What makes an agency is determined by the spirit and attitude engendered from within.<HR><P>

<CENTER><H2>Profile of 30 West</H2></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI>Wyeth-Ayerst's in-house advertising agency, 30 West Advertising, is in its fourth year of operation. Its staff now numbers 55.
<LI>It currently handles a diverse roster of brands whose combined annual sales exceed $700 million. Billings, which roughly doubled in three years, now make 30 West the number one Wyeth-Ayerst agency. It is also the agency of record for all American Home Products pharmaceutical advertising journal space.
<LI>The agency is located in a separate building on the Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories headquarters campus in St. Davids, Pennsylvania, about a five-minute walk from the marketing department. Organizationally, too, it is parallel to — not under — the marketing function, reporting to the vice president of sales and marketing operations.
<LI>Products on its roster include Oruvail, Cordarone (oral and IV), Sectral, Quinidex, Cardone IV, Lo/Ovral, Nordette, Materna, Flu-Shield, ESI-Lederle Generics, and the Managed Care Division. Both Oruvail and Cordarone IV represented major product launches.
<LI>Says Marty Meaney: If we were an independent agency we would be a 'hot shop' based on our product and new business success.” </UL>

<CENTER><H3>Independent Agencies Retain Their Edge</H3>
<I>by Thomas L. Harrison</I></CENTER>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>

<I>Independent agencies are freer to analyze and challenge the client's key assumptions and initiatives. They have a better network of communication capabilities. Personnel can sharpen strategic skills working with multiple clients. Cost savings with an in-house agency are not possible without quality sacrifice.</I><HR><P>

Today's healthcare communications environment is the most intensely competitive that I've ever seen. 
Some have suggested that this environment will generate a trend towards more in-house advertising agencies (see Prespective #1, above).<P>

Personally, I don't agree, but rather than just state an opinion, I would like to explain why independent agencies will continue to be dominant in the healthcare field.<P>

Mature strategic vision, coupled with razor-sharp creativity, is needed more than ever to successfully drive new brands into new or crowded markets or to stimulate the growth of mature brands. This vision, this mature insight, comes from fine-tuned and hard-won expertise that is gained only from representing a variety of brands from a range of pharmaceutical manufacturers in various markets with complex communications challenges.<P>

The very nature of gaining a solid breadth of pharmaceutical marketing expertise by representing multiple pharmaceutical manufacturers is inconsistent with the limited corporate landscape available to the one-client, in-house agency. This does not mean that in-house agencies can not develop strong communications programs for their client. It means that opportunities for cross-pollination of ideas and approaches and for the broadened conceptual thinking that evolves from servicing multiple clients are generally not available to the client serviced by the in-house agency. Even with a larger in-house agency that services multiple brands for its sole corporate client, the ability to represent an expanded range of therapeutic areas and to generate useful experience from multiple marketing arenas is necessarily limited by the number of finite therapeutic categories in which the parent corporation is focused.<P>

<H5>Risking tunnel vision</H5>

The marketing director serviced by an in-house agency must always be sensitive to the fact that his or her agency's advice and proposals may be conditioned to mimic too closely the direction of the corporation's product managers. The agency's strategic counsel may be overshadowed by a stronger-minded product manager or may assume a secondary position relative to the parent company's marketing direction. If the agency account team does not challenge every key assumption and initiative, and if every intellectual approach is not fully analyzed, then the advertiser is not getting its money's worth from its investment in in-house personnel and, more seriously, the performance of the brand represented by the in-house capability could be compromised.<P>

Each brand has its own set of unique marketing challenges. Yet subtle similarities between brands often surface, which can more readily be seen by an outside agency because of its multi-client exposure. The outside agency has the ability to pull together virtual teams of professionals who have already addressed similar marketing situations for products in other therapeutic areas and whose strategic insight and counsel can be channeled to efficiently and effectively provide solutions.<P>

<H5>The environment counts</H5>

Today's communications environment is not only intensely competitive, but extremely complex. Traditional copy and art alone just do not sell anymore. It's an integrated, finely woven fabric of communication programs that will move a brand in today's multi-dimensional healthcare delivery arena. Each communications program must evolve from a singular, well-crafted strategic platform. While each program may reach a separate, unique audience, the total impact of all programs must be unidirectional in message.<P>

To achieve this consistency, a network of communications initiatives must be brought together in absolute harmony and orchestrated to carry one brand message. This multi-dimensional, multi-disciplinary approach is generally not in the capability set of a traditional, resource-challenged in-house agency.<P>

Top creative talent generally finds it more appealing and creatively stimulating to have the opportunity to work on varied assignments in an environment created in a multiple-client agency. Often, creative personnel find the corporate environment of an in-house agency less entrepreneurial than that in outside agencies, which may lead them to temper their creative expression. Even the large in-house shop that works hard at developing its own culture can often find it difficult to insulate itself from the corporate culture of its sole client. The risk is that a static sameness in its creative process may evolve, and produce a certain sameness in the product.<P>

Complacency may gradually take over within the in-house agency if that agency is not challenged to compete for new business and to defend its current assignments. By contrast, there is an innate level of insecurity in non-corporate, entrepreneurial agencies that mandates a keen sense of competitiveness which, in turn, keeps all staff members on their toes and stimulates them to try a little harder.<P>

<H5>The second opinion</H5>

Even today, many pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to populate their product management positions with highly successful sales representatives. These sales-oriented marketing executives understand the selling needs of the brand and the informational needs of the various target audiences; they also bring to the marketing department a strong rapport with the sales staff that is important to an ongoing and healthy relationship between the marketing and sales departments.<P>

 Often, however, they are in need of a better understanding of broader marketing principles and how various marketing channels can support their new role in driving the selling process from the home office. This is where a strategic, highly respected agency which has lived with the product for years, has crafted strategic direction and marketing plans and has the entrepreneurial ownership inherent to the outside agency can provide that brand with transitional consistency and simultaneously assist in the development of the new marketing manager's skills.<P>

Once again, the client's senior level management must be comfortable with the agency's range of counsel at this crucial time when brand management is changing. Which brings up a related question. Suppose the agency disagrees with the strategic direction set by product management. Who is more likely to be able to get a hearing from management: the independent agency chosen for its expertise and past counsel, or the in-house “dissenter?” And who will feel more confident about speaking out?<P>

Most in-house agencies are founded on the principle that they can save the corporation money both short- and long-term. The fact is that if the company fully allocates overhead and if the in-house agency provides services consistent with those provided by the outside agency, then cost savings simply are not possible without quality sacrifice. All the in-house agencies which have been founded on this false assumption are now extinct or soon will be.<P>

<H5>Special situations</H5>

All of this assessment does not necessarily mean that there is no place in some corporations for an in-house advertising capability. Certain situations may exist for certain manufacturers in which an in-house relationship offers an advantage. In-house shops are well-positioned to work on matured brands that do not require the broad strategic counsel of newer, larger performing products. These shops are more cost-effective in turning out secondary promotional and sales items, corporate newsletters, and similar materials that do not require the seasoned strategic expertise of the outside agency. In-house personnel can also play a role in coordinating the activities of various outside vendors to assist the brand manager in his or her responsibilities, saving the brand manager time so he or she can spend more time with the long-term strategic needs of the brand.<P>

These observations don't necessarily apply to all corporate-owned agencies. There are a few that over the years have built and maintained an entrepreneurial environment separate from the corporation that owns them, that have consistently performed well, done exceptional strategic and creative work, and have been a valuable asset to their sole client. It can be done, but clearly only a few have been able to keep the entrepreneurial formula and maintain their value to their parent company through the long term. But in assessing whether there will be a trend toward more in-house agencies, I would offer this caution: do not judge the field by these few outstanding exceptions.<P><HR>

<TITLE>Remembrance of Kings Past</TITLE>

<CENTER><H1>Remembrance of Kings Past</H1>
<I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<H5>Executive summary:</H5>
<I>Forty years ago, healthcare advertising agencies grew like Topsy with the skyrocketing sales of Rx drugs. The founders of ad agencies in that era — now legendary names from the past — left a rich history of accomplishment and anecdotes. What follows is a sampling of recollections about these titans from the glory days of pharmaceutical advertising.</I><P><HR>

To preserve some of the colorful history of healthcare advertising, <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I> polled some 200 senior agency, company, and publication executives asking them for anecdotes, stories, and remembrances of that “Golden Age” before managed care and corporate ownership. We received a gratifying response — pungent quips and humorous situations that, hopefully, will give our younger readers a feel for what the agency world was like back then and jog the memories of our older readers about the time they met their first ad manager, wrote their first headline, or bought their first journal page.<P>

Pharmaceutical marketing did not come of age until the mid-1950's. The industry had its beginnings in the 
late 19th century with the founding of such native American manufacturers as Lilly, Upjohn, and Wyeth, and the arrival in the U.S. of European companies like Merck and Burroughs-Wellcome, but prior to World War II, pharmaceutical firms were essentially in the generic drug business with emphasis on production and distribution. The flowering of pharmaceutical science after the war revolutionized the industry and its marketing methods. Antibiotics, antihistamines, steroids, diuretics — a flood of advanced chemotherapeutic agents — stimulated the marketing side of operations. This plethora of branded products generated expansion of advertising agencies specializing in prescription pharmaceuticals — “ethical drugs” as they were called in contrast to OTCs which were still stigmatized by the excess of the patent medicine era. What had been prosaic advertising featuring packaging photographs in trade journals, suddenly enriched by sizeable budgets, became a sophisticated, high stakes, communications competition which drew upon the latest in graphics, promotional copywriting, and the full arsenal of the art of advertising.<P>

It was a boom time for advertising agencies. Many of the basic Rx promotional tactics were established on the spot to answer the demands of a burgeoning marketplace — i.e., direct mail, controlled circulation journals, sampling campaigns, and single-sponsor publications. As in any boom environment, strong personalities asserted themselves. With few exceptions, advertising agencies were independent — run by single owners or partnerships of individuals attuned to the swelling opportunities around them. They were expansive, bold personalities who, by what they did, shaped what we do today in healthcare advertising and promotion.<P>

Not surprisingly in the 40 years that have past, healthcare advertising has experienced change. Pharmaceutical companies now count their sales in billions rather than millions and ad agencies have taken on a corporate coloration. Now, most sizable healthcare agencies are pieces of communication holding companies operating worldwide with consumer, PR, direct marketing, and specialized promotional units. Distance romanticizes the past, but it is fair to say that today's healthcare agency ceos, operating in a different climate, do not have the freedom to indulge their personalities the way the independent agency owners could in the boom market of the 1950-60's.<P>

<H5>A Grab Bag of Memories</H5>

<I>MM&M</I>'s request for stories about “the good old days” of pharmaceutical advertising opened up a floodgate of remembrances. Many thanks to all who contributed by letter, fax, telephone, or in person. A special nod to:<BR>
<I>Bill Gibson</I> on Matt Hennessey's skill as a recruiter and his philosophy of “putting the best players on the field.” Also, <I>Marty Meaney</I> who paid tribute to Hennessey — “He taught all of us to take real pride in what was created. He taught us good advertising.” And further on Hennessey, <I>Jack Timko</I> who, as a young product manager, received an unexpected visit at 7:30 pm, while at his desk at Warner-Chilcott, from the S&H ceo and never forgot Hennessey's command of the facts about the market and his hands-on knowledge of his agency's work on the product.<BR>
<I>Bill Martin</I> wrote about nervously breaking the news to Dean Burdick when he had carelessly totaled a company car and Burdick's unconcerned instructions to “Call the dealer and order another car.”<BR>
<I>John Palshaw</I> recalled the speech Reg Bowes gave “which had not been cleared by his client … actually offended them and … led to his departure from Ted Bates,” and the “larger-than-life persona,” a la Orson Wells of Dr. James Barnum, the founder of J. Walter Thompson's Deltakos Division. <I>Harry Sweeney</I> passed on the horrific tale of alcohol on an account supervisor's empty stomach and unfortunate commuters “marching their merry way homeward” under the roof garden conference rooms at the Frohlich building on 51st Street in Manhattan.<BR>
Many described the stimulation they got years ago as beginners entering the field from mixing with pharmaceutical ad people. <I>George Naimark</I> cites the “talented, broad-gauged individuals” he met when he joined Burdick & Becker in 1960. <I>Gus Mosso</I> mentions Al Molinaro, Joel Lauber, Ed Maitland, and Maynard Fones at Robert A. Becker and singles out the marketing executive, Joe Menduni, asking, “How many millions of dollars went to the bottom line [for clients] on a “Menduni lunch'?” <I>Irwin Block</I> remembers the late Ken Lavey at Frohlich as “always trying to help regardless of how busy he was.”<BR>
<I>Frank Corbett</I>, one of the founding fathers of the industry, passed on a number of stories — one with a decided 1990's ring. He tells how Ray Hetterick was downsized twice from, first the William R. Warner Company and then, the Lambert Company by the pharmaceutical entrepreneur, Elmer Bobst when Bobst acquired Warner and then merged it with Lambert. But Corbett writes, “It turned out Mr. Bobst did Ray a favor. Ray went on to become president of Lakeside Laboratories and developed the first really new antidepressant, Norpramin.”<BR>
<I>Jack Fisher</I> asked if we could remember when “Many pharmaceutical companies were controlled by the founding families,” or “International business came in over the transom?” <I>Pat McTigue</I> related how Joe McIntyre successfully campaigned at the top to gain Parke-Davis business.<BR>
We received a long letter from <I>Duke Powell</I> in praise of the salesmanship of Herb Day and Bruce Ross in handling direct mail clients. He writes, “While they started as salesmen, they developed individual styles that set them apart. As such, they flew above humdrum daily production and water cooler politics. They were rarely in the office and traveled incessantly. Palo Alto, Phoenix, Lincoln, Raleigh, Kalamazoo, and Rochester were prominent towns on their itineraries. Luncheon alone was unheard of. So were expense budgets.”<BR>
<I>John Kallir</I> sent in a tribute to Dr. V.D. “Barney” Mattia of Hoffmann-LaRoche — “The most brilliant client I ever worked for” — whose premature death at age 39 was a shock to the industry. <I>Sander Flaum</I> also commented on clients — the late Andy Anderson of Searle on a weekend in the Hamptons, and Larry Tilton, a Texan, who headed up Lederle's salesforce and whose motto was “Time to stop pettin' the mule and load the wagons.”<BR>
Arthur Sackler's accomplishments were detailed by <I>Herb Grossman</I> and seconded by <I>Win Gerson</I> and <I>Tony D'Onofrio</I>. Win and Tony were also recalled fondly by their colleague at McAdams, <I>Ron Vignone</I>. <I>Toby Jacobson</I>, the veteran copywriter, went back to the Harry Phibbs agency to recount how Phibbs, who claimed to have founded the first medical agency with an assist from the American Medical Association in 1925, had a heavily Irish Catholic staff. This became a problem with his assignment for the first OC. His relationship with Searle was so strong he was able to trade Enovid for Metamucil. <I>Milt Liebman</I> passed on memories of the publisher representative, George Janco, who worked for <I>Modern Medicine</I> when it was pocket-sized, as was <I>Medical Economics</I>. When <I>Medical Economics</I> went A-sized, <I>Modern Medicine</I> resisted and as the only small-sized journal, lost business because of the extra engraving cost entailed by having it on the schedule.<BR>

However, it is true that there really was a Frohlich account man so attentive with his Zippo he never let a client light a cigarette. He was the fastest on “Medicine Avenue.” So fast, in fact, that in a dimly lit Italian restaurant he ignited a bread stick that a Mead Johnson executive was moving to his lips.<P><HR><P>

Under the management of <B>Matthew Hennessey</B>, Sudler & Hennessey grew to become the largest U.S. healthcare agency during the 1970s. Hennessey retired following the acquisition of S&H by Young & Rubicam. A number of S&H alumni went on to successfully found their own agencies, testifying to Hennessey's ability to judge and nurture creative and account service talent.<P>

Although S&H under Hennessey was aggressive in style, and Matt, himself, projected a tough-minded image, he had difficulty with one aspect of management — firing employees. He would delegate the job to his lieutenants, often being absent from the agency the day the pink slip was delivered.<P>

It so happened that a market researcher, who had been promoted to account work, was not able to make the transition. Hennessey saw that he was hurting the agency's performance and decided he had to go. Since he was adverse to breaking the news, he asked the late John Dorittie (subsequently, a principal of Dorittie Lyons Nickel) to handle the matter. Dorittie, unfortunately, was almost as reluctant as Hennessey when it came to firing people and at the fateful interview he agreed to let the researcher stay on for a time until he found a job. In the interim, he could put his analytical background to good use doing project work for the various agency account teams.<P>

Dorittie, however, did not tell Hennessey about the arrangement. Hennessey thought the employee was gone. The researcher had trouble finding a job and over time, moved from account team to account team helping out in a variety of ways. Dorittie worked with the account supervisors to keep the researcher from running into Hennessey. If Matt was headed into the area where the researcher was working, a coded telephone message would go to the account group and the researcher would temporarily disappear.<P>

The likelihood of such an arrangement avoiding an accidental encounter was not promising. But given 
the multiple-floor, brownstone layout of the agency at that time, and the dedication of the staff in playfully deceiving the “boss,” the researcher gained an extended reprieve. According to Ron Pantello, now Chairman of Lally, McFarland & Pantello, and then an employee at S&H, the researcher was kept underground for 18 months before he landed a job and moved on!<P>

A year and a half is a long time. Could it be that Hennessey learned of the cover-up, saw that the researcher was now productive, and went along with the gag? In the freewheeling atmosphere that existed at S&H at that time, this is a possibility.<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H2>An Instant Vocabulary Lesson</H2></CENTER>

<B>Ludwig Wilhelm Frohlich</B> had come to the U.S. as a German immigrant in the 1930s. He became involved in pharmaceuticals through the typography business and was on the scene with an ad agency in time to catch the promotional wave of new products in the 1950s. With an international orientation, he was the first to set up advertising offices in Europe and, farsightedly, in Japan. He was also central to the formation of the Rx data company, IMS. Frohlich died unexpectedly of a brain tumor in 1971 and the agency in the U.S. was disbanded.<P>

Frohlich was fluent in English, but never mastered American colloquialisms. Once, at a discussion meeting with J&J executives, he learned he was on shaky ground with local figures of speech when he announced he, “Would like to throw up something on the table,” and was met with unexpected laughter.<P>

On a trip to Parke-Davis, then in Detroit, he attended a meeting at which the agency's proposals were turned down. Frohlich took such rejection personally and was greatly affronted by the instructions to try again. Once outside the meeting room with his second-in-command, Julian Farren, he remonstrated about the client's unappreciative opinion of the agency's work.<P>

Frohlich, as did most agency leaders at that time, had access to their client's high command and cultivated close relations with these executives, and now as they walked down the hall at Parke-Davis, with Frohlich fuming, they saw the company president approaching. Frohlich recognized him immediately and whispered to Farren, “Quick Julian! Am I 'pissed off' or 'pissed up'?”<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H2>“We've Come a Long Way,” Ladies</H2></CENTER>

To our request for remembrances, we received the following story from Marie Miller, a veteran publication representative and now regional sales manager for <I>U.S. Pharmacist:</I><P>

My first PAC (now HMCC) Sports Day was in June of 1973 or 1974. I can only recall about eight women showing up for the event — it had always been a men's-only affair held at the Westchester Country Club.<P>

The women were not allowed to have their lunch in the same dining room as the men — I think it was next 
to the men's locker room. We ladies sat outside by ourselves. (Luckily for us it was a warm day and some of our male colleagues strolled outside with their buffet lunch in hand to join us.)<P>

Of course, we complained to the PAC Sports Day Chairman that we paid the same money as the men and should be allowed the same privileges. He promised we would be allowed to join the whole group for cocktails in the same men's-only room before dinner.<P>

The late John Dorittie — always the gentlemen — met Harriet Frieze (of NCI) and me at the ladies' locker room and escorted us to the cocktail hour. We no sooner opened the side door (the only door we were told we could use) when the Westchester Country Club “bouncer” escorted us right outside. What an embarrassment!! John remarked that he had heard about discrimination of women, but this was the first time he had ever seen it first hand. It certainly was not <I>my</I> first time.<P>

Fortunately for women in our industry, it was the last time Sports Day has been held at the Westchester Country Club — but mostly it was because the club had promised ten tennis courts and then only let us use two — and because the golf game was held up an hour before and after Robert Merrill, the opera singer, played through.<P>

What a difference in today's Sports Day! Anyone in the industry at that time will also recall the small number of female product managers, detail salespeople and agency account managers in the industry. There certainly were no presidents!<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H2>No Representation Without Accommodation</H2></CENTER>

<B>Arthur Sackler, M.D.</B>, who was the principal owner of William Douglas McAdams until his death in 1987 has been described by Herb Grossman “not as 'an' industry giant,” but “as 'the' industry giant.” It is hard to take issue with his appraisal. <I>MM&M</I> received a number of tributes to him, describing Dr. Sackler as an unparalleled idea man who created many of the promotional techniques used today. More importantly, he was recalled as the advertising executive who saw the potential to expand pharmaceutical usage exponentially through modern marketing methods.<P>

Dr. Sackler was a force to be reckoned with and in pursuing his ideas, he often stepped on other people's toes. For Tony D'Onofrio, a long time McAdams executive, he was “controversial, unsettling, and difficult but … a pioneer and visionary who broke new ground in … perfecting the effectiveness of medical communications.”<P>

Museums, universities, hospitals, good causes of all kinds were beneficiaries of his prodigious generosity. However, Dr. Sackler had a frugal side which was recalled by both Win Gerson and Ray Hargreaves. When he flew, Dr. Sackler traveled coach, specifying the seat in the back of the plane near the emergency exit where he had room for his legs and briefcase.<P>

When Hargreaves was managing Sackler interests in London, he received instructions to obtain two coach tickets for a trip to Boston for individuals traveling under the fictitious-sounding names of “Mr. and Mrs. Jones.” Hargreaves bought the tickets and sent them off to New York. Shortly thereafter, he received a call from Buckingham Palace. A security officer explained that the Duchess of Kent and Prince Michael could not possibly travel in the rear of the plane and that the trip to the Harvard ceremony to which they had been invited by Dr. Sackler as celebrity representatives of the U.K. was off if something couldn't be done. Flabbergasted at the faux pas, Hargreaves contacted his boss who conceded that his preference for economy travel would have to be waived in this instance. Two first-class accommodations were booked for the royal pair.<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H2>Battered But Not Bitter</H2></CENTER>

An aura of affection surrounds the recollections <I>MM&M</I> received about <B>Dean Burdick</B>. His agency, Dean L. Burdick Associates, introduced important brands in the pharmaceutical heyday of the 1960s-1970s. Those who worked for him recall most of all his bemused reactions to the bruises and blows of the ad business.<P>

Burdick was not adverse to seeing humor in a situation even when the joke was on him. Clay Warrington of Dugan/Farley tells of the time Burdick won a sizable new account. After an office celebration, Burdick headed down Madison Avenue to Grand Central Station for his commute home. As he passed Abercrombie & Fitch, he noticed a beautiful pool table on sale at a 50% reduction. He had wanted to buy one and so buoyed by the new business win, he bought it. However, when the table was delivered, Burdick received devastating news. The movers couldn't get it into the house. Warrington writes, “Dean wound up building a $38,000 addition to his home to accommodate his 'bargain' pool table.” Although he was kidded about it for years. Burdick was willing to tell the story with a smile.<P>

Burdick was a skilled copywriter and an off-the-cuff quipster. His agency introduced Ayerst's Inderal — the first beta-blocker in the U.S. — to towering success. Inderal ads won readership prizes and it was at one of these award ceremonies that his wit was on display. Unfortunately, for all Burdick's efforts, the agency had lost the Inderal assignment. At the award ceremony, Burdick's Inderal ad won best ad in the cardiovascular category, which he accepted with minor comment. Then, with heightened irony, the ad won best pharmaceutical ad for the year, outscoring all others. Burdick mounted the stage slowly, took the plaque in his hand, looked it over and paused, looking out over the expectant audience. Then he said, “For myself and for the agency, I thank you for this posthumous award.”<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H1>WINNING STRATEGIES FOR MEDICAL EXHIBITORS</H1>

<H3><I>by Dr. Allen Konopacki, Ph.D.</I></H3></CENTER>
<HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>
<I>The secret to successful exhibiting, according to a survey of physicians planning to attend medical conferences, lies in providing educational value and personalized service at the booth. To keep people interested, wear a smile, use an effective opener, use time wisely, and quickly acknowledge all visitors.</I><P><HR><P>

When I asked physicians to indicate the single greatest factor for attracting their interest and prompting a visit to an exhibit, they overwhelmingly replied that “the opportunity to obtain educational information” is the main reason for visiting (see Figure 1, below). In fact, Maryland physician Dr. David Morgan said that the more educational information and materials — such as handouts and video — the better the exhibit.<P>

Figure 1.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="winfig5.gif"></CENTER><P>

<I>Conclusion: The perception physicians have of the value of technical exhibits is that they are first and foremost a means of educating and keeping them informed. It is very likely that if an exhibit appears to be too commercial, less than scientific, and not offering educational value, the credibility of the exhibit is greatly diminished. For medical conventions, unlike commercial trade shows, the exhibit's message is more important than the medium. The design of the exhibit needs to focus on how the message is presented in a credible style.</I><HR><P>

Clearly, visiting exhibits at conventions has become more important to physicians. In our survey of 300 
physicians, over 40 percent indicated that they felt it is of increasing value to spend time with exhibitors and cited reasons such as changing technology, necessary educational advancements, and the opportunity to have hands-on demo time or discussion time in the exhibit. Compared to previous years, 39 percent felt that visiting technical exhibits had increasing or more value than previously, 59 percent thought the value was the same, and only 2 percent indicated that it was of less value (see Figure 2, below).<P>

Figure 2.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="winfig1.gif"></CENTER><P>
<I>Conclusion: It is interesting to note that more physicians did not indicate a lesser value in light of the negative perception convention attendees have about the cost and time to attend conventions. When the respondents were questioned why they cited higher value, reasons included: effectiveness of being able to stay current; updating their skills; and remaining informed about techniques. As compared to ten years ago, when conventions were considered holidays away from the office, there is now a higher emphasis on educational productivity.</I><HR><P>

With the exhibit hall aisles full of physicians eager to visit with exhibitors, (see Figure 3, below) what can a company do to maximize the effectiveness of its booth? (see Figure 4, below) The survey sought the answer to that question.<P>

Figure 3.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="winfig2.gif"></CENTER><P>

<I>Conclusion: Graphics can play an important part in attracting the interest and attention of the physician. The exhibit should boldly identify new products and areas offering educational assistance if live, educational presentations are offered.</I><HR><P>

Figure 4.<P>

<CENTER><H2>How can an exhibitor make its exhibit<BR> more helpful to you?</H2></CENTER>

<B>The most frequently offered ideas from physicians…</B><BR>
<I>(listed in priority based upon frequency)</I><P>
1 Easy access to literature booth<BR>
2 More educational materials or information<BR>
3 More chairs<BR>
4 A browsing area with products<BR>
5 More booth staffers<BR>
6 Send mailings before the convention<BR>
7 Have new products in one area<P>

<I>Source: ©1995, Dr. Allen Konopacki</I><P>

<I>Design tip: Conventions are a cluttered, confusing environment to physicians. The booth is unfamiliar territory and by making it easier for doctors to use and finding what they have an interest in can be a secret to success. Design for the comfort and user friendliness of your visitor. Create easy-to-identify areas with a zone for browsing. Also provide easy access to literature and identify this area as your Physician's Resource Area.</I><P><HR><P>

Once you enter their tiny domain, an exhibitor wants you to stay as long as possible. So it is significant that 63 percent indicated that the responsiveness, politeness, and professionalism of the representative in the booth was of key importance in determining the amount of time that they spend with an exhibitor:<P>

The doctors clearly point out that the crowds, clutter, and confusion that are sometimes part of the exhibit floor leave them with a high desire to deal with low pressure, friendly booth personnel (see Figure 5, below).<P>

Figure 5.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="winfig3.gif"></CENTER><P>

<I>Conclusion: With more changes occurring in medicine and at a faster pace, physicians are experiencing a greater sense of doubt. Product obsolescence or changes tend to create the feeling that the salesperson or company was not honest. A faster pace of change creates a higher sense of discomfort in the marketplace. This creates a greater need for consultative selling and building supporting partnerships and relationships with the customer. For the exhibitor, this means the pitch-and-sell techniques of the past need to be abandoned and that an educational support selling process will be more successful.</I><HR><P>

In today's ultra-fast-paced and stressful environment, the winners in marketing are the companies that make it easy to do business with them.  Your booth staff can create positive impressions and attract prospects across the carpetline by utilizing these tips.<P>

<H3>1) ALWAYS WEAR A SMILE</H3>

A smile is the most powerful visual impression you can send. From a distance of twenty feet, it attracts attention and causes a person to engage visually with you. Smiles also create what I call “the double-take.” Visitors will look at the booth a second time, if only to assess why you're smiling at them. Wal-Mart reached a new level of success by having security guards smile at customers who now perceive the person at the front of the store to be a “greeter” instead of a “jailor.” Nothing is more intimidating to the doctor than to see a salesperson who looks like a guard with a frown rather than a welcoming smile. Smiles can attract doctors across your carpetline.<P>

<H3>2) THE OPENER AND CONVERSATION STARTER</H3>

You've probably experienced a salesperson at a retail store greeting you with, “May I help you?” or “Do you have any questions?” And you most likely said, “No, just looking.” Even the most successful and seasoned salesperson staffing a booth often uses greetings that create a negative response or the feeling of sales pressure.<P>

What's the best opener to use? A line that eliminates any sense of sales pressure, such as “Welcome to our booth, it's our pleasure to have you visit us.” Any greeting that says something nice is likely to create a tone of friendliness and encourage open, non-defensive dialogue. Ask yourself, how would you greet a guest coming to your home? You would certainly not greet your guest with, “May I help you?” The first four seconds establish an impression that remains throughout the conversation. According to the survey, sales pressure is the last thing the doctor wants to experience; welcoming or thanking them for visiting sends a warm and engaging greeting.<P>

<H3>3) TIME MANAGEMENT WITH VISITORS</H3>

Time is a luxury at the booth that few salespeople will have — but it's not how much time you spend with the doctor that counts as much as how well that time is used. Presentations can consume a lot of time; a way to make them more effective is to utilize focusing questions during the presentation to assess if you're on the right track. Don't be fooled into thinking that just because a doctor asked for a demonstration that he/she wants a full demonstration: 73 percent of doctors indicated that most sales demonstrations take too long. The best way to manage their time is to ask, “What are the key points you'd like me to cover?” This guides you, but also creates a psychological buy into the presentation and makes it interactive versus passive on the part of the doctor.<P>

<H3>4) HANDLING MULTIPLE VISITORS</H3>

The physician perceives exhibitions as a group-selling environment versus a one-on-one discussion. Their answer on how to handle multiple visitors is simply to engage them and make them feel that they can listen in. The physicians surveyed report that many times they approach an ongoing discussion and the salesperson never acknowledges them and makes them feel like an outsider. The suggested solution is to make eye contact and acknowledge the doctor. It makes sense when you think about how many times you may have been at a store and the sales clerk never looked at you to let you know you were noticed. A majority of the visitors who are not acknowledged walk away representing lost sales opportunities.<P>

<H3>5) HOW TO HAVE YOUR DOCTOR WAIT WHEN YOU'RE WITH ANOTHER</H3>

Not all doctors will wait if you're not available to serve them, but with a little extra effort 60 percent of them will wait a minute. The secret is in negotiating with both the waiting doctor and the one you're demonstrating to. A proven technique is to simply ask, “Doctor, could you help me out? I'd like to let Dr. Smith know I will be available later to help him.” You may think that this would trigger a disengagement but actually it allows you to assess if you could turn this demonstration into a multiple presentation, or at least it provides you with permission to acknowledge the other doctor without seeming rude. Asking, “Could you help me doctor?” gives you the power to determine what action you can take. The survey identified that salespeople who demonstrate politeness are admired and respected. So if another doctor is waiting, ask permission to be able to greet the waiting doctor. This has proven to increase the effectiveness of the sales process.<P>

Although your exhibit design, product displays, and materials at the booth are important, the “people performance” far outweighs everything else when it comes to creating success on the floor. A study by the University of Wisconsin found that 56 percent of the exhibiting impression depends on the attitude and behavior of the booth staff.<P>

These tips, based on the recommendations from physicians planning to attend this year's annual meeting, provide you with an extra edge in creating positive impressions that can lead to more sales results.<P><HR><P>

<H1>Major Medical Meetings</H1>
<H3><I>by Bea Riemschneider</I></H3></CENTER><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>
<I>To help plan your year, here is</I> Medical Marketing & Media's <I>annual listing of major medical meetings, conventions, and exhibitions. Information is supplied by</I> Physicians' Travel & Meeting Guide. <I>It includes themes, dates, venue, estimated attendance, and contact telephone and fax numbers.</I>
<P><HR><P>

The advent of managed care has affected all aspects of the physician's professional life, including an 
even greater need for continuing medical education. The specialist requires more information and the generalist requires more specialty skills. If anything, managed care has expanded the need for education especially on the part of the subspecialists who are expanding the primary-care portion of their practices. Education is available in print, on-line and in videos, but the large association meeting — the hallmark of medical education — is still the most visible and accessible form of medical training available to the physician.<P>

Large annual meetings are very much part of the continuing medical education (CME) scene and, in fact, there was a 24 percent increase in attendance in 1995 from 1994 by physicians in primary care and selected specialties. Eight out of 12 selected associations posted gains in 1995 attendance, and five of these associations had their best attendance in five years.<P>

October is still the busiest meeting month of the year, with 20 large annual meetings scheduled. The most popular destinations are New Orleans, Orlando, and San Francisco, top choices of meeting planners year-round. More than 120,000 physicians and others will be training in the month of October, followed by a surprising 141,000 doctors (attending a fewer amount of meetings) in the second busiest month of November.<P>

The meetings that represent the greatest number of physicians fall into the usual categories — cardiology and surgery. In fact, the largest CME meetings of the year are the American College of Surgeons (20,000), the American College of Cardiology (20,000), and the American Heart Association (25,000).<P>

Posting large numbers as well are the following specialty groups — the Radiological Society of North America (60,000), the American Academy of Ophthalmology (21,000), the American Society of Anesthesiologists (17,000), the American Psychiatric Association (16,000), the American Society of Hematology (11,000), the American Society of Immunologists/Clinical Immunologists (10,000), and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (9,500).<P>

<I>Physicians' Travel & Meeting Guide</I> publishes all major medical meetings in a comprehensive monthly guide to CME opportunities worldwide. Physicians can find meetings referenced by specialty or destination five months before the event. Specific topics and other details, including 800 numbers, faxes, and telephone numbers allow the physician to contact the association directly for registration and further questions. Physicians of all specialties have used this valuable tool for more than a dozen years to select their CME venue and prepare themselves for the challenges that lie ahead.<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H1>Enhancing ROI through exhibiting</H1>

<H3><I>by Frank M. Corcoran and Clare Sullivan</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<H3>Executive summary:</H3>

<I>Research to quantify return on investment of healthcare exhibitions has shown that exhibits increase prescriptions, M.D. penetration, total prescription activity, and product market share. With attendence at medical meetings rising, exhibitions may take on increasing importance.</I><P><HR><P>

Demonstrating the Return On Investment of healthcare exhibiting has always had its mysterious side. An exhibit hall, viewed through the eyes of a spreadsheet, is a murky world of commerce — a pop-up city where people talk, signs boast, hands shake. But how much business really gets done? How many sales actually result?<P>

Marketing personnel — and specifically convention and exhibit personnel on occasion — are prone to answer this question in generalities. “You've got to have your name out there.” Which is true. Or, “We're there to get leads, then the sales force can follow up with them,” which is also true, but sounds as if exhibiting were really just a pre-marketing activity, and the real work gets done later.<P>

Because many sales — especially of pharmaceuticals — rarely can take place on the exhibit floor, it's usually hard to answer any differently. But with marketing budgets coming under increasing scrutiny, both from a dwindling dollar flow and from the demand of an increasing array of marketing vehicles (the World Wide Web, for example), it's becoming imperative to find a better answer.<P>

Fortunately, a better answer exists.<P>

The Healthcare Convention & Exhibitors Association (HCEA), a trade association of more than 650 companies and associations involved in healthcare conventions and exhibitions, conducted research to explore the effect of exhibits on physicians who visit them versus those who don't. <P>

HCEA gathered data through a prototype research study on the prescribing habits of physicians attending the American Academy of Family Physicians' (AAFP) Annual Scientific Assembly. Mickey Schaefer, director of the meetings and convention division of AAFP, offered her organization's cooperation and support — particularly valuable given the primary-care nature of AAFP's attendees and the meeting's broad appeal to the pharmaceutical segment of HCEA's membership.<P>

The data were gathered for three-month periods both before and after the meeting. Six major pharmaceutical companies participated in the study, which was conducted by IMS America.<P>

The results provide industry-wide quantifiable answers publishable for the first time on the value of healthcare exhibiting.<P>

<H3>Exhibits increase prescriptions</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Prescriptions for the products exhibited at the booths of the companies participating in the study increased 18 percent among doctors who visited those exhibits and generally received product presentations (the test group). That compares to an increase of only 2 percent among those who didn't visit those exhibits (the control group). (It should be noted that this latter group could have included physicians who visited the AAFP exhibition, but did not visit the exhibits of the participating companies and receive a product presentation.)

<LI>In addition, the study found that exhibits increased M.D. penetration — the percentage of doctors writing prescriptions for the products promoted. The percentage of physicians writing prescriptions for products marketed at the exhibit after visiting an exhibit increased 14.5 percent, versus an increase of only 6 percent among those who did not visit the exhibits of the studied products. This finding has particular impact for pharmaceutical companies because it indicates that exhibits are effective ways to influence physicians to begin writing prescriptions for their products. Once they've begun, additional efforts can be directed toward increasing the number of prescriptions — a sort of two-tiered approach for which the study indicates exhibits also are effective.

<LI>The total prescription activity — the average number of prescriptions written per doctor for the studied products — also increased among the physicians visiting exhibits — by 5.2 percent. By comparison, the average number of prescriptions actually decreased by 1 percent among doctors not visiting the exhibits.

<LI>Product market share for the pharmaceutical products within their therapeutic classes also increased more among physicians who visited the companies' exhibits than among those who did not.<P>

<H3>Attracting top doctors</H3>

One might be tempted to question the data showing higher growth in prescriptions among physicians who visited the exhibits of the participating companies if these physicians were “insignificant” potential customers in the first place — retirees, for example (which seems to be a common misperception), who might only write a few prescriptions a year.<P>

But, in fact, the HCEA study also showed that the physicians visiting the participating companies' exhibit booths were of a very high caliber. Indeed, two-thirds of them came from the top two prescribing quintiles for the products the companies were exhibiting. More than half (51 percent) came from the top quintile (i.e., the top 20 percent of prescribers).<P>

This is good news for marketers not only because of the high-quality audience that exhibits can reach. It also means that any percentage increase in prescriptions that exhibits bring about will result in a greater actual number of prescriptions than it would if the visiting physicians were coming from lower quintiles. (For example, a 14.5-percent increase by a physician who writes 1,000 prescriptions a year results in 145 new prescriptions, while the same increase by a physician who writes only 400 prescriptions a year results in only 58 new prescriptions).<P>

“Although HCEA has always maintained that physicians coming to healthcare exhibit booths are high-quality, it is the study which confirmed this impression as fact,” said Robert Gelardi, executive director of HCEA.<P>

“Maybe there were some who thought that the doctors who visited exhibits don't have big practices or have time on their hands,” he said. “But when you look at the quintiles, you can see they're the right doctors.”<P>

<H3>What makes it happen?</H3>

None of this comes as much of a surprise to those who have been exhibiting for years. Exhibitions are a unique selling environment. They provide an opportunity to access large numbers of customers, already stratified by specialty, and not distracted by patients, phone calls or any of the dozen other interruptions that can be encountered on a sales call.<P>

Physicians are guided by a complex mix of objectives and behaviors when they're at a convention. Breaking down a few of the major elements might help explain why exhibits possess the selling power that they do.<P>

For one thing, an increasing number of the doctors who attend conventions and visit exhibits refuse to see sales representatives in their offices. Research conducted by Exhibitchek, an exhibit research firm, found in 1994 that 31 percent of physicians at medical meetings refused to see sales reps in the office. That was up from 24 percent in 1992.<P>

“Physicians today are more cognizant that their available time at the office is growing smaller and smaller,” said John Wasilewski, associate director of professional relations at Merck Human Health Division. “Yet they still have a need for information. One very effective way they get that information is the convention and its exhibition.”<P>

Research confirms that physicians come to conventions to learn and to obtain continuing medical education credits. For example, a study by the Center for Exhibit Industry Research (formerly Trade Show Bureau) found that professional education was the most important factor in physicians' decisions to attend conventions.<P>

And the exhibition is an important part of that. HCEA research conducted from 1984-91 found that 77 percent of healthcare convention attendees identified the information they received from the exhibition as important to their practice.<P>

“The HCEA research shows that doctors who visit conventions changed their prescribing habits,” Gelardi said. “That's evidence that there's learning going on. The doctors have changed their behavior.”<P>

Exhibits also offer an effective two-way communication avenue to healthcare companies. “You get 
immediate feedback at an exhibit, which is especially important for new product launches,” said Marianne Yeager, immediate past president of HCEA and manager of conventions for SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals.<P>

“Product managers can assess the effectiveness of product details and get customer feedback right on the spot. We find out immediately how much they already know and what their reaction is to a new product.”<P>

As Wasilewski put it, “Putting representatives in front of doctors is a good thing to do — that's pretty 
simple. Exhibits put more doctors, good quality doctors, in face-to-face selling situations with our number one resource — the sales representative. How can you get any better than that?”<P>

<H3>Prototype for the future</H3>

Though all of these facts are valuable, none of them could quantify the impact of a healthcare exhibition on sales until the HCEA prototype study. Indeed, conjuring up a methodology to track this impact was one of the trickiest issues faced by HCEA's Marketing Committee, the arm of HCEA charged with overseeing the study.<P>

First, each of the companies participating in the study had to capture information on the physicians visiting their booths at AAFP. IMS, a research firm specializing in pharmaceutical prescription data, conducted the independent study. IMS' promotion testing service, Promotrak, was used to measure changes in product prescription activity of physicians visiting and generally receiving a product presentation at a participating company's booth (the test group) versus that of physicians who did not visit a participating exhibit booth.<P>

The control group was selected to mirror the test group in specialty, pre-test new prescription volume of 
the product of interest, pre-test new prescription market share, and geography. In addition to tracking the new prescription counts for each product of interest, IMS also tracked each product's competitive market as provided by each company. HCEA coordinated the exchange of information between IMS and the companies to ensure confidentiality.<P>

Additionally, to ensure that the physician responses were not affected by the study, the sales representatives did not alter their presentation or style.<P>

The test group consisted of 2,075 physicians. Their behavior was tracked through IMS' database — 33,913 computerized chain, independent and foodstore pharmacies with information from approximately 692,000 physicians representing 62 percent of all U.S. dispensing retail pharmacies.<P>

This methodology holds promise for the future as well. Clearly, this study is not the end of the road for research in this direction. Healthcare companies will want to study products in other categories, to study other meetings, and perhaps add additional variables to the research. The study demonstrated how exhibiting companies can hold down research costs and preserve their confidentiality by conducting pooled research of this nature. This is precisely why HCEA titled its project the <I>“Prototype Market Research Study on the Marketing Effectiveness of Pharmaceutical Exhibiting.”</I> Almost as interesting as the findings are the implications for future research along these same lines.<P>

<H3>The future of healthcare exhibiting</H3>

Combined with other data, the results of the HCEA study indicate that dollars spent on healthcare exhibiting may be taking on increasing importance. Medical meetings are growing in size. HCEA maintains a worldwide database on healthcare meetings and, according to that data, U.S. national medical meetings averaged over 2,500 total attendees per meeting in 1995, up from 2,400 in 1994 and 2,300 in 1993.
The same growth trend can be seen in regional and state meetings. An average of 2,263 people attended regional healthcare meetings in 1995, up from 2,151 in 1993. State meetings averaged nearly 1,040 attendees in 1995, up from 879 in 1993.<P>

These growth trends may well continue, with an increasing number of physicians attending healthcare conventions for the information they can get. As a result, the marketing opportunities — now quantifiable — that these meetings provide look to be a bull market for healthcare marketers for many years to come. <P><HR><P>

<H1>Genotropin's Introductory Program Explores the New Rx Marketing Model</H1>

<H3><I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></H3><P></CENTER><HR><P>

<H3>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H3>

<I>Pharmacia & Upjohn developed a total program for its growth hormone Genotropin, integrating every aspect of “health delivery” marketing from advertising, to drug administration, to financing the expensive medication.</I><P><HR><P>

Marketing consultants, business school academics, and futurist gurus have been prodding pharmaceutical manufacturers to re-think the mission of their industry. “You're not in the pill business anymore,” they advise, “You're in the business of delivering health.” Some company executives have quickly grasped this revolutionary change in philosophy. Disease management programs from drug companies express this new thinking, but practical responses to immediate sales needs may yield clearer insights into where more comprehensive marketing programs are headed than ambitious disease management offerings.<P>

The marketing of “big ticket” pharmaceuticals is a case in point — drugs which cost the patient many thousands of dollars annually. To sell such a $10,000 to $20,000 a year product — well beyond an average patient's resources — requires operating within the governmental and private insurance system, and since so much is being invested in the drug regimen, assisting patient and physician with the mechanics of treatment to reduce the risk of therapeutic failure.<P>

The program which Pharmacia & Upjohn have recently launched, through Gerbig, Snell/Weisheimer & Associates of Columbus, Ohio, for the growth hormone Genotropin (somatropin [rDNA origin] for injection) is such an in-depth approach in which the company goes well beyond simply supplying the product and instructions on its use.<P>

Genotropin is the fourth entrant into the U.S. growth hormone market, following Genentech's Protropin and Nutropin and Lilly's Humatrope. Pharmacia, however, is no newcomer to the field. In 1985, Pharmacia was the first to introduce human growth hormone (hGH) in Europe and the Swedish company has been engaged in growth hormone research for many years.<P>

The incidence of idiopathic growth hormone insufficiency varies from country to country, ranging from 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 10,000 children. It has been estimated that 20,000 children in the U.S. are receiving hGH treatment. This patient population is treated by some 500 to 800 physicians practicing pediatric endocrinology. At over $10,000 annually per patient, the growth hormone market represents hundreds of millions in sales, albeit intensely concentrated in a small group of specialists.<P>

In planning to bring Genotropin to this country, Pharmacia (before its merger with Upjohn) studied this marketing situation carefully, recognizing that competition was well established. An introduction of a product at parity with competition was not likely to make much headway with an audience comfortable with what was already available in the complicated and emotionally sensitive area of treatment. Genotropin needed added features to attract attention and obtain trial.<P>

The first advantage designed into Genotropin marketing was a unique delivery system — a simplified injection unit tradenamed the Genotropin Pen 5 (see photo below). Growth hormone is injected daily, the drug reconstituted from a powder and a diluent. The new device performs the mixing within the syringe unit, provides a digital display of the dosage administered and minimizes the discomfort of injection. The heart of the system is a two-chamber reconstitution cartridge.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="launch3.gif"></CENTER><P>

With an attractively designed new delivery device for added convenience in administrating the drug, Pharmacia could approach the pediatric endocrinologists with a “selling feature.” But the company felt more was needed. And here is where the program makes a leap into the “health delivery” zone — providing significant additional services to assist the patient and physician with the treatment process.<P>

Market research had shown drug delivery and payment were seen by physicians and their nurses as the number one problem in handling growth hormone cases. Establishing patient eligibility with insurance companies could easily take 10 to 20 phone calls by the M.D.s and their staffs. Working with Gerbig Snell/Weisheimer, Pharmacia developed the Genotropin Bridge Program. According to Greg Hall, associate director, third-party payment relations at Pharmacia & Upjohn, its goal is, “to streamline and reduce the hassles and difficulties associated with distribution and reimbursement.”<P>

Given the cost, insurance companies are understandably careful with growth hormone coverage. The paperwork has to be done correctly with the inevitable variations from company to company. The Bridge Program takes over this complicated job from the M.D. and office personnel. Once medical necessity forms are sent by the physician to Pharmacia & Upjohn, a case manager begins work with the family and the insurance carrier to secure insurance benefits and to define any co-payment responsibilities. The insurance carrier is instructed to direct all coverage inquiries to the Bridge Program. If adequate insurance coverage is not available, the case manager looks into alternative sources — i.e., Medicaid, charities, state funds, military. If this search is unsuccessful, the child becomes eligible for the Genotropin Support Program under which the drug is supplied free for at least six months and that period can be extended. This is a bare bones description of what can be a complex management process, since every case is different and unexpected medical, logistical, financial, and family problems can occur. The company employs three technical representatives, located regionally, in a medical practice support unit, as well as a staff of case managers.<P>

Pharmacia & Upjohn does not allow the paper processing to delay the initiation of treatment. The medical necessity form which includes a medical assessment of the child's condition (including provision for a growth chart), also serves as a prescription. The form of Genotropin designated by the M.D. and a starter kit/education package is sent to the patient's family within 24 to 48 hours if no major reimbursement problems exist. Drug and the instructional materials can go to the doctor if so requested. The next step is a patient counseling session between M.D., the child, and the family and treatments begin.<P>

The patient starter kit contains:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>instructional videos,
<LI>an insulated bag to keep the drug cool during travel,
<LI>a backpack for holding Genotropin and materials,
<LI>a bag with medical supplies — alcohol 	swabs, pressure release needles, insulin syringes, and demonstration cartridges,
<LI>a complimentary belt pouch displaying the product's graphic symbol, and
<LI>a calendar for keeping track of administration.</UL><P>

Commenting on the starter kit, Susanne Kondracke, account executive at Gerbig, Snell/Weisheimer, says “Families and patients involved in daily injection therapy have numerous questions and concerns. In addition, the costly investment of daily therapy and the insurance issues surrounding such a product are a lot for a family to consume. We have tried to address those concerns as simply and as thoroughly as possible to ensure patient compliance.”<P>

Other patient materials include:
<UL>
<LI>a hooked refrigerator magnet for hanging the calendar,
<LI>a Rolodex card with Bridge Program telephone and FAX numbers,
<LI>a pack of international flag stickers shaped to decorate the injection unit,
<LI>Q&A educational brochures for patients and parents.
</UL><P>

Professional materials provided are a product monograph, a product brochure, as well as charts, forms, and booklets to explain the service to parents and to enroll patients in the program.<P>

A logo lends design continuity to all these diverse items. It consists of a square marked by a sweep of color standing for the product, and then, with variations, other aspects — the Bridge Program, the Support Program, etc. Dominant colors are blue and yellow, coincidentally the colors of the Swedish flag. In fact, a flag theme is another unifying feature used on the injection unit stickers and in graphics on the calendar which also carries photos of children from around the world emphasizing Pharmacia & Upjohn's worldwide marketing of Genotropin.<P>

A notable feature in the creative package is the provision to record injection sites on the calendar. Since injection locations must be rotated daily, color-coded stickers (“left arm,” “right thigh,” etc.) are provided to be placed on the calendar allowing parents to hold to the desired sequence. Also, testifying to the thought which has gone into the program, the instructional videos are cast and produced with sensitivity to their audience — sub-teens. The format of the videos is a TV news broadcast — GNN, the Genotropin News Network. The anchorpersons at the news desk are the audience's age, as is the patient/reporter “in the field” covering what's new in growth hormone treatment and instructing on injection techniques. Samples of the kid-oriented dialogue: showing the Genotropin Pen 5 — “a cool device”; giving instructions — “Don't shake it too hard. You're not making a milkshake”; explaining terms — “Diluent. 'Dill' as in pickle. 'You' as in 'you.' And 'aunt' as in your mom or dad's sister.” The tone is upbeat: “Get out there and grow,” and in association with the backpack, “Grow while on the go.” In describing the program's materials, Diane Hay, senior art director at Gerbig, Snell/Weisheimer, says that the agency tried for items that are visually appealing, yet practical, and communicate necessary product information in ways that are compelling and non-threatening.”<P>

Rounding out Pharmacia & Upjohn's Genotropin program is its distribution system. As mentioned, the first supply of the drug is usually sent to the patient just prior to the M.D./patient/parents' orientation meeting at which a treatment plan is mapped out and is therapy initiated. After that, refills go to the patient, prompted by calls from the parents to the company case managers. The drug can also be sent to the M.D. if this is desirable. Case managers follow up if the drug is not ordered and, in general, monitor compliance, issuing reports on utilization to physicians.<P>

Pharmacia & Upjohn's program encompasses reimbursement, patient and professional education, drug distribution, and compliance monitoring. The company is managing virtually all the non-medical aspects of treatment. The breadth of this marketing activity moves it qualitatively into a different realm from product-oriented marketing. The program is based on what the company <I>needs to do</I> in order to sell its product, not what it feels it <I>ought to do</I> to satisfy a new business theory. As such, experience in this kind of marketing is not dependent on comparative outcomes data (financial or clinical) to prove itself. The lessons learned with extremely expensive products like Genotropin will have influence on the new “greater service” model predicted for the future. A number of companies are similarly involved — Genentech (Protropin and Nutropin), Lilly (Humatrope), Amgen (Epogen), and Ortho Biotech (Procrit) to name a few.<P>

The team at Gerbig Snell/ Weisheimer on Genotropin's introduction is: R. Blane Walter, director of new 
business development; Susanne H. Kondracke, account executive; Julie Thomasgard, writer; Diane Hay, senior art director; Chris Tredway, production director; Amy Dryden, senior traffic manager.<P>

<CENTER><H1>IS DTC ADVERTISING<BR> A PALATABLE MEDIUM FOR<BR> MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS?</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><H3><I>by Ernestine McCarren</I></H3></CENTER>
<HR>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>

<I>MCOs and DTC advertising are presently working at cross-purposes, but they can — and should — work together if only because of their mutually explosive growth rate. Rx companies can successfully use DTC marketing by understanding the needs and concerns of MCOs and actively involving them in DTC efforts.</I><P><HR><P>

Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising is a growing phenomenon — over $350 million in branded and non-branded was spent in 1995, up from $70 million in 1990 — that is simultaneously impacting the marketing of pharmaceuticals and the cost-containment policies of managed care organizations (MCOs).<P>

Right now, these two entities are working at cross-purposes. On the one hand, you have MCOs trying to 
control costs through the use of drug formularies and DURs (Drug Utilization Reviews). On the other, you have drug companies trying to drive up prescription volume with DTC advertising, and trying to get around the managed care system by generating brand-specific demand.<P>

The managed care environment should be an important consideration in your DTC efforts. These two accelerating monoliths can actually work together, and we all can play a role in that cooperation.<P>

DTC advertising and managed care are facts of life in our business — growth and utilization of both are inevitable. On the one hand, every major pharmaceutical company is actively engaged in, and experiencing success from, DTC efforts. On the other hand, patient enrollment in managed care organizations is increasing at an astounding rate.<P>

<H4>Exhibit 1</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure1.gif"></CENTER><P>

Presently, 76 percent of the population is covered by some form of managed care (see Exhibit 1, above), up from 47 percent in 1990. And in 1994, for the first time ever, third party surpassed cash as the method of payment for prescription drugs, with third party payment now at 45.1 percent and cash payment at 41.6 percent (see Exhibit 2, below). Today more than half of the U.S. population is covered by some form of managed drug plan — virtually double the rate of 1990 (see Exhibit 3, below 2) — with 20 percent covered by “closed” or strict control formularies, and another 35 percent by limited formularies (see Exhibit 4, below 3). These trends confirm that some degree of formulary restriction will prevail in the coming years.<P>

<H4>Exhibit 2</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure2.gif"></CENTER><P>

<H4>Exhibit 3</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure3.gif"></CENTER><P>

<H4>Exhibit 4</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure4.gif"></CENTER><P>

As this trend is inevitable, there is the need to make DTC advertising and managed care compatible. We, as manufacturers and marketers, will have to try to anticipate and accommodate the views of managed care organizations in our DTC marketing efforts.<P>

<H3>Why drug companies favor DTC</H3>

We know why drug manufacturers favor DTC. Companies recognize the value of DTC because it is reliable in building Rx volume and in creating brand identity, and it is important for OTC switch candidates who want to create brand awareness and strengthen the Rx user base. A recent study by Scott-Levin, Newtown, Pa., established that 83 percent of physicians will consider or discuss a patient's request for a specific medication.<P>

Companies recognize the importance of consumers and the need to communicate with them directly. Consumers are becoming a motivated, receptive audience to information about conditions, diseases, and treatment options as they take on more and more responsibility for their own health, become increasingly aware of health issues, and take on greater control of their own disease management and treatment.<P>

In fact, managed care organizations themselves are forcing consumers to take on more responsibility. They are requiring consumers to decide on which plan, provider, and treatment to choose based on a menu of benefits at varying costs. They are also shifting responsibility to consumers through wellness and prevention programs.<P>

The key here is that patient empowerment, through education and compliance efforts, is the very foundation of disease management programs. The theory is simple: A better informed patient is a more conscientious, compliant patient, which leads to better, cost-effective treatment and outcome.<P>

Yet, MCOs remain skeptical about DTC advertising and consider it to be aimed at generating prescriptions, not always in the best interest of the consumer. Dale Kramer, co-director of pharmacy operations, Northern California region of Kaiser Permanente, stated that “the direct-to-consumer advertising pharmaceutical companies are running today is really self-serving and in most instances product oriented.” Kramer believes that the advertising “often doesn't give a full enough or balanced picture — not enough information is provided to make an intelligent decision.”<P>

This is what leading MCO representatives are saying. It may be that the basis of their skepticism originates in the need to factor consumer demand and consumer satisfaction into the formulary decision-making process.<P>

Thus, if DTC advertising and marketing stimulates consumer demand and thereby increases prescription volume, as intended, then MCOs face the risk of member dissatisfaction if a drug is not covered on formulary or the risk of higher costs being forced by patient demand.<P>

<H3>How Rx companies could respond</H3>

At the heart of the matter is the question of how drug companies can successfully utilize DTC marketing in a fast-growing managed care environment. There are four key steps by which drug companies can respond, which are more fully explored in the next section:<P>

Step 1.	Assess the importance and impact of MCOs on your bottom line.<BR>
Step 2.	Understand the needs and concerns of MCOs.<BR>
Step 3.	Understand the tiers in the pharmaceutical customer chain and how the consumer fits into them.<BR>
Step 4.	Design integrated direct-to-consumer/direct-to-patient programs that address the MCO's needs.<P>

<H3>Assessing MCO impact</H3>

To determine how important MCOs are as a group (or the importance of any individual MCO), the drug company must assess the need for formulary acceptance of a particular brand, along with their overall relationship with these organizations.<P>

Among drug makers, there are two schools of thought about these issues. One approach is to take the view that a managed care marketplace will not affect a particular product because of its stand-alone point of difference (e.g., efficacy, side-effect profile) at the end of the day, getting the name and benefits “out there” will drive up the numbers no matter what MCOs do.<P>

The other approach is to do nothing out of uncertainty as to how MCOs will react to a company or its products.<P>

Either way is unsatisfactory. Few companies are in a position to take the first approach and most companies are unhappy with the second.<P>

The solution may be to measure the impact of DTC before “going public,” using a modeling concept to measure the potential payout of your DTC effort with or without formulary acceptance. Begin with your typical ROI forecasting model which factors in the key variables such as potential awareness, physician visits, patient inquiries, and Rx conversions relative to the cost of the program and the price of the drug (see Exhibit 5, below).<P>

<H4>Exhibit 5</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure5.gif"></CENTER><P>

Next, factor in the impact of the managed care segment based on the degree of formulary restrictions and the program's ability to withstand the consequences. Additional input factors, such as those highlighted in Exhibit 6, below, modify the Rx conversion rate depending on whether a drug will be covered on the formulary or paid by the patient versus not filled at all.<P>

Finally, assuming that MCO acceptance is important or desirable, plug in the additional resources that will be needed to cultivate their acceptance.<P>

<H4>Exhibit 6</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure6.gif"></CENTER><P>

<H3>Understanding the MCO</H3>

Assuming that managed care will become an increasingly important consideration in a company's overall DTC efforts, the next step is to understand how MCOs perceive DTC advertising relative to their overall needs and objectives.<P>

Here is a partial MCO “wish list”:
<UL>
<LI>MCOs are more comfortable knowing what the message is and that it is in line with their other programs.
<LI>They are in favor of drug companies working with the health plan in its promotional efforts.
<LI>MCOs prefer seeing DTC “education” about health and prevention rather than branded “advertising” whose main intent is to sell product.
<LI>They prefer that education comes from the plan rather than directly from the drug companies.
<LI>MCOs would like to have more “control” over the message to ensure a balanced approach.
<LI>The results of these efforts should be that they improve health outcomes and lead to more cost-efficient drug use.
</UL><P>

If drug companies took the “big picture” into consideration and understood the overall needs and concerns of MCOs, more options and greater flexibility in addressing those needs would emerge.<P>

It is important to understand the key concerns of MCOs in their struggle to remain competitive. They are: patient satisfaction; attracting and maintaining a customer base; differentiating their provider networks, benefits structure, and costs; and addressing employer needs by offering high-quality healthcare service, administrative simplicity, lower costs, and fewer claims.<P>

<H3>Understanding the customer chain</H3>

It is important that the tiers in the pharmaceutical customer chain be understood — particularly how the consumer fits into what is becoming an increasingly complex matrix (see Exhibit 7, below). Clearly, the patient is the common target customer of drug companies and MCOs (as well as individual providers). It logically follows that patient satisfaction or <B>Positive Patient Management</B> is the common goal for these constituents.<P>

<H4>Exhibit 7</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure7.gif"></CENTER><P>

Since we all share <B>Positive Patient Management</B> as a common goal, how can all this be integrated into compatible DTC campaigns? Here are some suggestions:<P>

<B>1. Involve key MCOs in your DTC planning efforts.</B> Just as successful DTC efforts get doctors involved by seeking their reactions to advertising and advising them of DTC efforts beforehand so that inquiries can be addressed in a positive way, so should the drug industry do the following: apprise MCOs of the DTC effort beforehand; anticipate their concerns in your campaign design; and try to relate increased demand to cost-effective outcomes.<P>

<B>2. Don't plan your DTC campaign in a vacuum.</B> All good marketing campaigns should have a consistent message that you keep hammering home. The successful overall strategy is going to be the one that addresses the needs of all the empowered audiences. So think in terms of <B>Positive Patient Management</B> as a common goal for all your patient- and consumer-directed efforts (see Exhibit 8, below). Then, integrate your direct-to-patient and direct-to-consumer efforts so that the messages are consistently and synergistically focused on that goal.<P>

<B>3. Partner with MCOs and healthcare providers</B> in patient/consumer efforts that strive to achieve <B>Positive Patient Management</B> (see Exhibit 9, below 8). Integrate all elements of the programs to link your company to MCOs, patients, and providers in a cohesive way. Work with MCOs. Let them know that what you want is the same as what they want — <B>Positive Patient Management.</B> Show them how your programs work with theirs to accomplish this common goal.<P>

<H4>Exhibit 8</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure8.gif"></CENTER><P>

<H4>Exhibit 9</H4>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="figure9.gif"></CENTER><P>

<H3>No more cross-purposes</H3>

The patient/consumer is the pharmaceutical and managed care industry's common interest and common goal. If we work together toward making the patient happy and satisfied, if we all focus on <B>Positive Patient Management</B>, then our efforts will be indeed compatible and cooperation will replace opposition.<P>

<CENTER><H1>1996 HCI Midyear Advertising Review</H1>

<H3>Happy days are here again</H3>

<H3><I>by Robert A. Girondi</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>

<I>There was a dramatic turnaround in medical/journal spending during the first half of the year, with expenditures up more than 34 percent, compared to two years of declines. Strength was registered both in new product introductions and established products. The top 25 spenders accounted for the lion's share of the total. Calcium channel blockers continued as the most heavily promoted class.</I><P><HR><P>

HCI's Medical Promotion Auditª (MPA) indicates a dramatic turnaround in medical/journal spending, with first half 1996 expenditures up 34.2 percent over the comparable year-ago period. This extraordinary gain follows a 5.3 percent decline in 1995 and a 13.8 percent reduction in spending in 1994. While new product introductions were clearly the driving force during the first half 1996, established products also contributed to the gain. Seventeen new products spent over $1 million, for a total of $43.7 million and an average of $2.6 million each. The total spent was almost three times the amount accounted for by the relatively few new products (9 in total) which spent over $1 million in the year-ago period.<P>

When just the top 25 most heavily advertised medical/surgical products are considered, we find that 11 were new product introductions for which a total of $35.7 million was spent on promotion, or an average of $3.2 million each. In the year ago period, there were only five new products among the 25 most heavily promoted. Quite surprising is that the top three appearing on this year's list are all new, namely Cozaar/Hyzaar with a 2.9 percent share, Tiazac, close behind with a 2.7 percent share, and Fosamax at 2.4 percent of total expenditures. The heavy spending by these newcomers pushed Cardizem CD from its first place rank in 1995 to fourth place in 1996, even though the HMR brand increased spending by almost 8 percent and accounted for 2.3 percent of the total.<P>

Other new products joining the top 25 through mid-year include Miacalcin NS, Precose, Lotrel, Naprelan, Zytec, Sular, Amaryl, and Renova. When their spending is combined with the top three new drugs, the total represents 16.3 percent of all promotion.<P>

Among the established products moving into the top 25 are Sporanox (7th place) as spending increased by 310 percent in support of a new indication, while Valtrex took the number 8 spot and Ultram moved into 15th place with a 130 percent increase. Prempro (16th) and Glucophage (19th), introduced within the last 15 months, also had significant budget increases by 488 percent and 191 percent, respectively. Rounding out the list of established products which moved into the top 25 are Prozac (in 21st place) and Zocor (in 23rd). In total, the 14 established products in the top group accounted for 17.5 percent of all promotion.<P>

As a result of all these spending charges, 15 products that made the first half of 1995 list fell from the top 
25 in 1996. Serevent experienced the sharpest decline by dropping to 223rd position after holding 4th place through mid-year 1995, while Propulsid ended in 129th place after previously taking the 16th spot. Serzone dropped from 19th position to 77th following a 60 percent budget reduction, Glucotrol XL cut spending by 54 percent and dropped form 23rd to 77th, Ambien was off 51 percent and slipped from 21st to 67th while Paxil moved from 14th to 61st following a 55 percent decline in spending. Other products falling from the top 25 include Lodine 400, Flonase, Cataflam, Rocephin, Cipro, Effexor, Famvir, Plendil, and Lescol.<P>

In spite of all the product shifts that took place, most companies that were in the top group during the first half of 1995 stayed there in 1996, although there were some surprising changes in the rankings. Driven by high promotional support for Cozaar/Hyzaar, Fosamax, Mevacor, Zocor, and Vasotec, Merck climbed from 26th in the year ago period to first place after spending at a rate which resulted in an 8.9 percent share of total industry promotion. This was almost twice the level of Wyeth-Ayerst which had a 4.9 percent share and thereby retained 2nd place. Another interesting shift was Forest's move from 23rd to 6th place, a change which was driven by the introduction of Tiazac. At the same time, Glaxo Wellcome dropped from first place to 7th following spending cuts on Flonase and Serevent.<P>

In addition to Merck, other companies joining the top group include Ortho Pharmaceuticals (22nd), following the company's launch of Renova; Boehringer Ingelheim (23rd), due to Atrovent NS promotion; and McNeil Pharmaceuticals (25th) as spending for Ultran increased. Those dropping out of the top 25 include McNeil Consumer, which slipped from 24th place to 26th, even though spending increased by 23 percent; Lilly, which dropped from 15th to 28th following a 27 percent spending cut; and Pratt, which moved from 20th to 29th after a 4 percent budget reduction. The importance of the top 25 can perhaps best be summarized by the fact that, in total, they account for 69 percent of all promotional expenditures. In the first half of 1995, their share was 63 percent of total expenditures.<P>

By product type, Calcium Channel Blockers continued as the most heavily promoted therapeutic class, while Antispasmodics (3rd) and Antiarthritics (4th) remained within the top five. Driven by support for Cozaar/Hyzaar and Lotrel, Antihypertensives — Other, climbed from 17th place in mid-year 1995 to second place in 1996. New product introductions were responsible for moving the Ethical Drugs Misc. — Other category from 46th to 5th and Derm Acne Therapy from 73rd to 21st. The Fungicides class, which moved from 45th to 17th and Analgesics, Non-Narcotic (35th to 19th), complete the list of those moving into the top 25. Product groups falling from the top include Beta-Blocking Agents (15th to 26th), B-Lactamase Inhibitors (23rd to 27th), Non-Barb Sed Others (22nd to 46th), and Beta Agonists (14th to 144th).<P>

<CENTER><H3>Point of View</H3>
<H1>Fast forward on the sales force:<BR> Where do we go from here?</H1>

<H3><I>by Charles T. Saldarini</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>

<I>Movement from a traditional sales structure to strong regional business units may be necessary to cope with the hundreds of MCOs and PBMs. This may create the need for new types of marketing methods such as regional co-promotion, regional portfolio alliances, and franchising. Yet, some traditional structures can be adjusted to deal successfully with the changing realities of the marketplace.</I><P><HR><P>

The first question is obvious: Where is here? With so many companies making radical changes to their sales force structures, the here-and-now of today's sales force is best described as a hodgepodge of traditional and cutting-edge approaches. While some companies remain firmly committed to the advantages of a command-and-control type of structure — the classical approach that many of us grew up in — others are running to embrace the virtues of the decentralized, flat structure characterized by regional units.<P>

Regional units we are told, are the future. Smaller, lighter, less costly, and more focused on the bottom 
line than any previous sales force alignment, decentralized regional business units may be the necessary answer to a market rapidly being dominated by over 600 managed care organizations (MCOs), almost 80 pharmacy benefit management companies (PBMs), and virtually every other type of purchasing organization you can imagine. The mantra is: Get close, or get clobbered.<P>

So, while the movement to regional units has been recent and may best be described as embryonic, it is nevertheless interesting to speculate on where this direction might eventually take the industry. If this approach is successful, and I rate that as a major “if,” the face of sales and marketing will change forever.<P>

<H3>The groundwork</H3>

First, my assumptions:<P>

Regional business units (RBUs) will succeed at getting closer to the customer not only through a strategy of closer physical proximity, but also through the advanced use of the prescription databases currently in favor. These will enable extraordinarily focused marketing and sales efforts. RBUs will use database sophistication to enhance the regional bottom line through the excellent relationships they develop with customers. When I say “excellent relationships,” I mean the type built on an explicit and detailed understanding of the customer's needs coupled with tools a regional structure brings. For example, representatives who can assist providers in improving their administrative positions with MCOs, or representatives whose understanding of practices are so detailed that physicians rely on them as therapeutic consultants. How many reps do you know who could break down one of their customer practices into patient types, payor status, and managed care affiliations? These are things that go far beyond the level of many current relationships based on an exchange of samples, gifts (pads, pens, office items) and information for what is often only nominal access.<P>

This different type of relationship will be based on treating the customer as a business, which in turn has customers (patients and insurers) who will want something different from what has been possible to date. If I see any overriding advantage to decentralization, it is the hope that selling skills will be upgraded to business relationship skills. I would be thrilled to see every rep in the unit opening every call quite literally with the phrase, “How's business?” all the while knowing the answer in advance.<P>

This closeness to customers will represent a barrier to entry against competitors; that is, the sales force's relationships with customers will be so strong and so mutually rewarding that competitors will need to make commitments far beyond matching sample quantities and details. Ideally, many of them will opt for other approaches, including the ones I'll discuss shortly.<P>

So, with those assumptions in mind, let's consider a few scenarios for the future.<P>

<H3>Regional co-promotion</H3>

One immediate implication of successfully decentralized sales forces will be that companies' full portfolios of products will become more vulnerable faster based on individual preference of MCOs for various companies. MCOs may restrict the number of companies they will buy from on an across-the-board basis, tending toward preferred suppliers. The upshot here is that individual products will have regional life cycles that may bear little resemblance to those sustained by large-scale detailing and marketing efforts of the past. This means that regional directors will recognize the need to strengthen the bottom line by bringing in other brands from other companies. In effect, regional co-promotion deals will be built around one unit's unique relationships with customers.<P>

For example:<P>

Company A finds that its angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor simply cannot compete in the region. It is too “me too” or too expensive or comes without the value-added supports of products selling at much higher levels in that region. Company A drops this product to clear space in its detail cycle and sells that slot to Company B, which judges that it can benefit from Company A's customer relationships. The unit directors of Company A determine that the profits lost from the ACE inhibitor they were not succeeding with anyway will be more than offset by the incremental rewards of successfully promoting Company B's antihypertensive (ACE, beta blocker, etc. … depending on the nature of Company A's line and the availability of products from Company B). So when it comes to hypertension, they switch to another company's product in the field.<P>

All kinds of deals may be struck under this broad type of arrangement. The point is, they are customer-driven and based on the outgrowth of the regional structure. National co-promotion deals may never make sense again.<P>

<H3>Regional portfolio alliances</H3>

This is simply a more formal version of regional co-promotion. Here, Company A, with a nominal share of regional ACE business, decides it can strengthen itself by doing two things. First, it admits the futility of the battle with its ACE and looks for another product that its customers would respond to more readily. It then prepares to trade its weak link for another company's strong link in an attempt to become stronger in the process.<P>

Thus, Company A “trades” its laggard ACE for Company B's laggard anti-biotic. Company B wants the ACE because they have developed a sector of strength with cardiovascular brands, but not with antibiotics. Both companies are improved. Both companies' customers are better served as each now offers a deeper line within a therapeutic area where they already lead. This deeper line may protect the companies from having to discount or bundle their star performers with laggard products. Doesn't this make more sense than continuing to pummel each other for minuscule share levels? It essentially provides a way for companies to get out of the dilemma many face by wasting precious sales resources on lesser brands in order to maintain some small presence in the market at the cost of incremental sales from star performers in the line.<P>

Companies may have more to sell than products. Both PBMs and MCOs have needs in formulary compliance and protocol management interventions. Regional units with outstanding customer relationships may target PBMs, for example, which have a need to reach the same customers for their disease-management interventions. In this instance, the regional sales organization would take on responsibility for the disease management programs. Since many PBMs will have disease-management programs with at-risk components, regional drug company units may find ample interest from these players.<P>

<H3>The franchise</H3>

Outstanding customer relationships alone may not be enough. There will be companies which, despite this strategy, will be unable to sustain the R&D output required to hold customers with new products over the long term. Now what? More downsizing? Another merger? Perhaps, instead, a franchise.<P>

Franchise a regional unit. Let the company purchasing the franchise agree to continue to promote whatever parts of the original company's line of products it chooses. Let them figure out what to do in terms of marketing and sales in the region (FDA regulations presumably somehow satisfied at the national level) and let the franchisee keep a substantial piece of the profits from the retained brands. Of course, the new owners will create their own portfolios of products based on their evaluation of what customers want. This may mean, then, that the company buying the unit may or may not continue to sell the drugs of the original company and may use its newly acquired local franchise to work with multiple companies.<P>

I see a role for contract sales help in each of these scenarios. The attention to the regional unit's bottom line is such that they will see quickly how properly deployed contract sales organizations will pay out in terms of both customer relationships and basic return on investment.<P>

<H3>Tradition can be accommodated</H3>

One final point: I should add that I believe that companies who do not regionalize are not necessarily at any disadvantage. Traditional structures can be adjusted to accommodate a shifting customer base and I believe that those who retain a massive, national punching power may reap the higher levels of sales and profits required to maintain the one activity that sustains all — innovative research — than companies dependent upon a decentralized approach.<P>

However, decentralized approaches, if successful, may lead to a whole new set of structures for companies to consider. It was not so long ago that local General Motors dealers, carrying Pontiac, Buicks, etc., would never add to their lines a non-GM model. Today we see dealers using their franchise in a market to sell a mixture of Detroit, Japanese, and European cars. Also, in soft drinks, local bottlers have extended their lines beyond their basic connection to Coke or Pepsi. There examples are not directly analogous to Rx drugs, but are illustrative of the kind of arrangement which may develop out of strong RBUs with important implications for pharmaceutical marketing.<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H1>Advocacy Groups</H1><H2> —your unlikely allies</H2>

<H3><I>by Ilyssa Levins</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>

<I>Managing perceptions about marketed and investigational drugs among advocacy groups has become a crucial job for marketers. No longer an option, working with consumer activists can actually aid in the marketing and medical process — they can accelerate NDA submission and drug approval, promote healthy behaviors, and help overcome reimbursement obstacles. But profitably working with advocacy groups takes understanding of their individual agendas, and asking yourself the right questions throughout a brand's market lifecycle.</I><P><HR><P>

When you look back 10 years to 1985, consumer activism around specific diseases was an unfamiliar and relatively obscure occurrence. Today, the pace of consumer involvement has increased dramatically. Activism has moved beyond the AIDS arena to cancer, women's health, various CNS disorders, and more. This is not surprising, since most are life-threatening diseases for which new investigational agents on the horizon can easily mobilize advocates to “act up.” Their lives depend on it.<P>

When a drug firm embarks on phase I and II clinical trials, ready or not, you begin marching into a field of communications challenges. Marketers quickly realize that managing perceptions about their drug and corporate image with advocacy groups becomes as crucial as getting the NDA/PLA filed.<P>

Excluding patient groups from drug development and marketing issues is no longer an option. Today, appropriately mobilized advocacy groups bring a lot to the party.
<UL>
<LI>They advance clinical findings by providing direct feedback on the feasibility of accruing clinical trial participants, assessing the relevance and value of disease management programs, and helping to alert patient members to clinical trial enrollment opportunities.
<LI>They accelerate drug approval by: discussing the compound's value among themselves and their colleagues, who may include regulatory experts and media; voicing concerns at the open mike” during FDA advisory board hearings; and creating and participating in expanded access programs.
<LI>They secure drug coverage by lobbying for reimbursement of approved drugs, assuring that suggested indigent care programs are effective, and serving as spokespeople to regulators and the media.
<LI>They promote healthy behaviors by: disseminating up-to-the-minute information on new drugs relevant to their members though their group's publications, bulletins, and Internet homepages; designing health promotion programs for the community at large; and drawing doctor's attention to your drugs.</UL><P>

Patient groups are so strong that some clinical studies have been unblinded by members tapping into 
extremely active communications networks formed by the advocates. For example, the ALS Prodigy bulletin board disseminates patients' descriptions of treatment regimens and their effects on general health, including their guess as to whether they're on an active drug or placebo.<P>

<H3>Advocates in drug development</H3>

Advocate involvement binds patients, doctors, government agencies, and drug companies together. It is everyone's responsibility to incorporate these groups into market and strategic planning, particularly when you look at the drug development continuum (<A HREF="chart.html">click here to print out “The Marketing Continuum” chart</A>).<P>

<IMG SRC="time.gif"><P>

Early on in this continuum, drug firms are fielding clinical studies so data can be collected for NDA submission. It's critical that Phase I & II trials are filled with qualified patients to advance research — a goal that is often difficult to achieve for a variety of reasons: orphan diseases with small patient pools, trials with rigorous exclusion criteria, several drugs within that therapeutic category under study competing for patients, etc.<P>

Patient groups are a rich source of study candidates and can become allies in accrual. They are one of the best sources to tell you if a protocol, as designed, will in fact appeal to patients. They can also help companies deal with ancillary concerns such as child care and the cost of supportive care. Furthermore, as companies look for scientific answers within FDA guidelines, patient advocates can assure that a trial will not only attract patients, but also retain them till the very end. Finally, they can identify grassroots doctors who treat a disease but were not currently being contacted by pharmaceutical companies.<P>

As drug studies move to Phase II & III, questions about expanded access and compassionate use arise. Here again, involvement of advocates can help mitigate problems regarding access or, in some cases, provide input that improves the program. In both ALS and AIDS for example, advocates helped sponsors faced with a shortage of drug supply deal with thorny issues surrounding lotteries. The groups then became interested in the program and helped the sponsors respond to the concerns of the media and others.<P>

<H3>Launching assistance</H3>

At launch, advocacy groups have a vested interest in helping communicate information about a new drug to their constituencies. For example, at the launch press conference for a new drug for schizophrenia, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill presented results of the first self-assessment survey of patients with schizophrenia to evaluate treatment needs. Recently, the ALS Association participated in an Internet-conducted launch event for a new Lou Gehrig's disease drug. There were about 15,000 participants in just one hour. Two years ago, Jehovah's Witnesses actually rallied behind the availability of a new drug that reduced the need for transfusions during open heart surgery.<P>

Once a drug is on the market, advocacy groups don't have the resources or the dollars to implement large-scale programs to educate constituencies about the new option. Often, advocates seek drug companies to underwrite events or materials because of a mutual benefit.<P>

For example, an anti-stigma campaign for people with schizophrenia is being run by NAMI and funded by several drug firms. In other therapeutic categories, advocacy groups are actively involved with drug firms to execute educational campaigns. In another example, the National Stroke Association went on the road to educate patients about early warning signs of stroke shortly after a new drug for this condition was approved.<P>

Managed care and disease management offer other collaborative opportunities. In the case of ALS, patient advocates are helping MCOs understand the ramifications of disease, now that drug therapies are available. Sometimes advocacy groups lobby managed care decisionmakers to keep drugs on formulary. Frequently, they are instrumental in championing compliance programs that not only improve outcomes, but also maximize drug use-up rates.<P>

<H3>Charting the road ahead</H3>

Senior management — from CEOs to marketing VPs and brand managers — can effectively incorporate advocacy into marketing and promotion by asking a few simple questions:<BR>
Have you considered inviting advocates to sit on one of your marketing or scientific advisory boards? If so, are you satisfied with the role they play?<BR>
Have advocates been exposed to your product's clinical data?<BR>
Do you know if advocates support your protocols? data? clinical design? product? Are they criticizing your protocols (data, clinical design, product) to their members, other advocates, media, the FDA?<BR>
Are you working with advocacy groups to accrue patients or to develop investigator/patient support materials?<BR>
Is there legislation that could affect the success of your brand which could be attacked by advocates?<BR>
Are there labeling changes you'd like advocates to know about?<BR>
Are there regulatory stumbling blocks inhibiting your brands that could be helped by advocate support?<BR>
Have you made efforts to work with advocates to ensure product reimbursement?<BR>
Are you working with advocates to ensure brand access to all patients?<BR>
Before embarking on any advocacy program, be sure you understand the issues affecting diverse advocacy groups. Take HIV as one example. Gay white men organized around the AIDS epidemic remain the most influential and best informed.  Yet, demographics of the AIDS epidemic are shifting to communities of color, who need education and access to drugs. Several of the most prominent AIDS activists are also thought-leading physicians. Marketers need to know who these “hybrid” experts are to maximize impact with relationship building efforts targeted at these influencers.<P>

There are specific AIDS groups that see pharmaceutical companies as villains that exploit patients living with these diseases for personal gain. Before engaging in a dialogue, be sure to know where the land mines are buried. Conversely, there is only one group mobilized in ALS, whose first experience with a drug firm was extremely rewarding. This group is open to receiving educational support from drug firms but, as with all advocacy groups, its leadership expects marketers to understand how to enter into productive relationships with advocates as their influence increases.<P>

<H3>Providing information</H3>

Just like the medical community, advocates want accurate and balanced information on epidemiology, study design, and research programs so they can make their own assessment of investigational drugs. Drug companies can quench that information thirst by connecting advocates to investigators who can speak from personal experience about a study's progress. If you are communicating drug information during the pre-approval stages, the simplest rule to follow is FDA Commissioner David Kessler's very own:<UL>
<LI>Use fair balance
<LI>Offer full disclosure
<LI>Show independence</UL><P>

When updates on clinical studies are requested, be clear about a drug's investigational status.<P>

Advocacy is here to stay. Supporting patients groups will appear at more and more advisory board hearings to express opinions at the open mike. In some cases, such as with antivirals, oncology drugs, or CNS agents, advocates now sit on or directly advise committees, thus affecting approval votes. They will raise questions that can directly influence the drug approval process or at least spotlight core issues.<P>

That's why the clash between breast cancer advocates and Dr. Paul Bunn at a recent Oncologic Advisory Board Committee meeting was inevitable. Just how involved advocacy groups should be with drug approval is a hotly debated issue. Pharmaceutical companies don't want to get caught in the fray, but should watch carefully as the situation unfolds.<P>

<H3>Integrating advocacy relations</H3>

If marketers, regulators, and communications agencies share the same agenda — keeping our country healthy — we must work hard to make advocacy relations integral to the system. Our agency is helping our clients ready themselves for advocacy involvement by holding discussions between in-house regulatory and marketing executives to spell out the opportunities and the challenges along the way.<P>

Systems will eventually be put in place to facilitate advocacy involvement. For example, Dr. Kessler's suggestion of making patients and/or patient advocates nonvoting members of advisory committees might be one option.<P>

In two years, every FDA committee may have a full voting patient or patient-advocate member. These members will be well-trained in drug evaluation. Results of votes will change, and approvals will hinge on patient's and advocates' opinions. We must begin to reach out to these men and women — and the thousands of patients they represent — today, if we are to have their confidence and their buying power tomorrow.<P><HR><P>

<H1>Get Ready for HEDIS 3</H1>

<H3><I>What it is, how to use it</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

Marketers are fast learning two new sets of initials:<UL>
<LI> HEDIS: the Health Plan Employer and Information Set, which is just putting into effect its latest, enhanced version, called HEDIS 3.0, and 
<LI>NCQA: the National Committee for Quality Assurance, the group that's developing HEDIS. </UL><P>

This two-part article addresses the obvious questions raised by these bare definitions: what are HEDIS and NCQA…and how will they affect healthcare marketers? But first a word of background.<P>

“All too often,” a recent article in Science reported, “physicians rely on custom, hearsay, and dogma in choosing treatments.”<P>

When medicine was still a cottage industry, this practice pattern was of concern primarily to patients, but now that health maintenance organizations are looking over doctors' shoulders, they are increasingly asking: <I>Is that the best thing to do? How well is it going to work? What's the up-front cost and, long-term, is it the most cost-effective way of treating this condition?</I><P>

Next, looking over the shoulders of the HMOs, are the employers who ultimately pay many of the bills. Nor are they the only interested observers. As HMOs develop treatment protocols in response to these economic and social pressures, healthcare manufacturers want to make sure that their products are included where and when appropriate. Pharmaceutical companies are particularly concerned, since conservative medical care can often be more cost-effective over the long term than invasive procedures and hospitalization. As advertising executive Arthur Sturm says, since HEDIS standards are cruicial to managed care operations, “Using HEDIS is basic marketing: understand your customer's needs.” But no one is likely to take the manufacturers' word for it — they need objective data. That's where HEDIS can help: as a respected, independent evaluator of the best way to treat common disorders and diseases.<P>

With this brief sketch as background, let's take a closer look at the answer to our initial questions: what is HEDIS and what can it do for me?<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H1>HEDIS:</H1><H2> Searching for the Gold Standard?</H2><H3><I>by Kathleen Kimball-Baker</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>

<I>HEDIS, the Health Plan Employer and Information Set, was developed to establish a reliable way to define quality of healthcare and comparisons of health plans. Critics say the latest version, HEDIS 3, still has shortcomings, but most agree that it is another step closer to the ideal — a system of automated clinical data.</I><P><HR><P>

As medicine and business collide in the world of managed care, one voice rises above the commotion: that of healthcare buyers. Be they employers, the local, state, or the federal governments, or business coalitions, their message is loud and clear: they want the best quality care at the best price possible. Never before in United States healthcare history has the demand to measure and account for quality been so great.<P>

Not surprisingly, keeping managed care organizations answerable for cost control has been simple compared to holding them accountable for quality. A sterling record of managing costs is one of the main reasons why managed care plans have grown so popular. But when it comes to quality, problem No. 1 is defining it; No. 2 is measuring it.<P>

This was the challenge that a small band of people from several health maintenance organizations, four big corporations, and a benefits consulting group took up in 1989. They wanted a legitimate and reliable way to define quality and examine and compare health plans. The model they developed (later dubbed HEDIS 1.0) was tested with a small number of health plans and deemed promising enough to move to the next stage of development.<P>

In 1991, the HEDIS developers transferred the task of converting the model into a workable tool worthy of widespread acceptance to an independent nonprofit organization called the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA), which was then just beginning its work as an accrediting agency. HEDIS fit comfortably with NCQA's mission to be the leader in assessing, measuring, and reporting the quality of care provided by the nation's MCOs. Two updates — HEDIS 2.0 and 2.5, as well as a Medicaid HEDIS — followed. While each new version offered improvements, the measurement tool was still far from perfect, which is why HEDIS 3.0 — which was released for public comment in July and is due to be launched in December — is a widely anticipated overhaul.<P>

Here are two indications as to the wide acceptance of the HEDIS standards not only by payers but by other active participants in the American healthcare system:<P>

1. PhRMA (the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America), through its health outcomes working group, submitted performance measures to NCQA for inclusion in HEDIS. These performance measures covered seven major disease entities: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic stable angina, depression, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. What's at stake for marketers in these areas is critical. To take one example, it is whether drug management of angina should be given an adequate trial before the patient is referred for angioplasty.<P>

2. When the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) announced this spring that it would license HMOs to use its name, it explained that it would use the NCQA criteria in evaluating which plans to bless with its imprimatur.<P>

The weakness of previous HEDIS measures was their failure to meaningfully address healthcare outcomes — the holy grail of quality measurement.<P>

Critics and defenders alike agreed that HEDIS was too “process-oriented,” measuring such things as percentages of children immunized and women who receive mammography, instead of calculating whether those actions actually improve members' health. This is still a problem. For example, while mammography is certainly an index of quality care, HEDIS leaves unanswered the key question of how much longer women found to have breast cancer live past detection. In fact, the only two measures in earlier versions of HEDIS that actually demonstrated health outcomes were the number of low-birth-weight babies, and the number of people with asthma who required hospitalization.<P>

“HEDIS 3.0 takes the science of performance measurement to a significantly higher level,” according to NCQA president, Margaret E. O'Kane. “It moves toward measuring the outcomes, or results, that purchasers and consumers really care about.”<P>

Thus, the new HEDIS includes 75 “reporting sets” — the measures that health plans will be expected to track and report starting in 1997. That's some 15 more than at present. In addition, there are 30 “testing sets” — measures that will be evaluated for possible inclusion in the future. The objective is to give employers shopping for healthcare coverage a better “snapshot in time,” which is essentially what HEDIS provides.<P>

HEDIS 3.0 was developed under the direction of the Committee on Performance Measurement (CPM), which includes payers, consumers, and measurement experts. The indicators they selected cover both “outcomes” and “process,” as explained by David Eddy, M.D., a CPM member. “A measure of mortality after heart surgery tells us one thing about a health plan,” he said, “namely, how well the plan does treating people with acute heart conditions. But the smoking measures (process measures) tell us something equally important: Is a plan doing what it should be doing to keep its members from getting heart disease in the first place?”<P>

<H3>Criticism and competition</H3>

It remains to be seen whether this latest round of revisions will satisfy the HEDIS critics. Last year, the founding father of HMOs, Paul M. Ellwood, Jr., M.D., convened a powerhouse group of employers, including such heavyweights as American Express and IBM, to determine if they were satisfied with current measures. “And as it turned out, they weren't. They want to see things move more rapidly,” Ellwood says, explaining why they launched an alternative organization, named the Foundation for Accountability. Ellwood predicts that the ever-increasing demand for, and eventual delivery of, outcomes information will alter the practice of medicine far more profoundly than the introduction of managed care ever did. If he is right, then the original vision of HMOs that Ellwood put forth more than 25 years ago — that HMOs should compete on <I>quality</I> as well as price — may finally become a reality.<P>

HEDIS backers don't basically disagree. As CPM co-chair George Isham, M.D., puts it: “We're at the very beginning of the quality measurement revolution, and a lot of people are impatient. I like to think of myself as one of them.” HEDIS 2.0 and 2.5 “produced a set of standards that allowed health plans to set up information systems and report to a standard so that the information [would be] reliable.” The new version of HEDIS is expected to get still closer to the goal of establishing a universally recognized gold standard for medical care.<P>

Another HEDIS shortcoming is that it makes no adjustment for demographic factors. Thus an HMO that serves a region with a disproportionate number of women who don't seek prenatal care until late in their pregnancies may score poorly on its percentage of low-birth-weight babies even though it has been doing an exemplary job of reducing the number of such vulnerable infants from one year to the next. While earlier versions of HEDIS included a low birth-weight measure, the CPM opted to defer this measure for the 1996 reporting year “because of presistent problems” with risk adjustment issues.<P>

As anyone who has ever tried to make sense of the chaotic world of managed care will attest, there is very little one can now call “standard” in healthcare. The adage “When you've seen one HMO, you've seen one HMO,” applies to all aspects of managed care, from the plethora of practice guidelines, to the legions of computing systems, to the multitude of patient record systems.<P>

Helen Darling, manager of healthcare strategy and programs for the Xerox Corporation and another CPM co-chair, likens HEDIS to the standardization of electrical outlets in the United States. “Anywhere you go in this country, you know you can plug in your hair dryer and it'll work. With HEDIS, we're saying this is the way you should do your reporting. We've standardized measures so they'll be more meaningful, so that, for example, a low-birth-weight rate in Chicago is reported the same way as one in Los Angeles.”<P>

Obviously, such standardization will also be a tremendous boon for healthcare companies struggling to 
develop credible pharmacoeconomic data to use in selling to managed care organizations or in setting up disease management programs. As Catherine Kunkle, R. N., vice president of the National Business Coalition on Health in Washington, D.C., explains: “So many pharmaceutical manufacturers have developed secondary lines of business around disease management. People look at these with a little bit of skepticism.” Presumably if they can demonstrate results by objective standards such as HEDIS, they will be able to answer such questioning. Also, she points out, “a lot of pharmaceutical companies have real issues about formularies. They should make sure they are straightforward and put their goals on the table, be able to demonstrate outcomes and best practices, and actually work with plans on something concrete.”<P>

Again, such efforts will become far more feasible once HEDIS 3.0 begins to generate data regarding comparative outcomes of various therapeutic approaches.<P>

Other areas for creative partnering might include:<UL>
<LI><B>Preventive care and health promotion:</B> HEDIS requires plans to identify what health promotion/education programs they provide and how many enrollees participate in each of the programs.
<LI><B>Member satisfaction</B> based on HEDIS data of overall enrollee satisfaction. Armed with such data, medical marketers will be in a far better position to tailor support programs for specific target HMOs.</UL><P>

Most important, perhaps, will be the impact of the HEDIS standards on prescription levels. For instance, one of the measurements of proper care is the percentage of plan members diagnosed with chronic atrial fibrillation who are put on Coumadin. Since this anticoagulant can decrease the probability of stroke by two-thirds, the report considers it “surprising” that “very large numbers of people with atrial fibrillation” are not receiving it. A similar recommendation points to the desirability of treating post-myocardial infarction patients with beta blockers.<P>

<H3>Beyond HEDIS</H3>

Paul Ellwood argues that one of the biggest barriers to the application of modern information systems to the practice of medicine has been the lack of agreement on what to measure. But “outcomes measures will break the information dam,” he predicts.<P>

Isham agrees. “In the short run, HEDIS will encourage a more consistent administrative system. In the long term, long meaning a year or two,” he laughs, “people are going to see the need for automated clinical data. But we're <I>billions</I> of dollars of investment away from that goal.” Who, then, will convert those billions into a new revenue stream? And which marketers will have vision big enough to plan strategically for such momentous change?<P>

Isham adds that although employers are at present the biggest force calling for outcomes information, ultimately it's the patient — the employee, the consumer — whose need for information must be met.<P>

As an example of the business opportunities such trends will generate, one publisher, Martin I. Schneider, some three years ago began publishing a consumer magazine called <I>Health Pages</I>, which combines wellness articles with “community- specific” comparative information on physicians, hospitals, allied health professionals, and health plans. Gathering the information to make such comparisons, says Carol Cronin, senior vice president of <I>Health Pages</I>, involves analyzing HEDIS reports from health plans in each of the 12 cities where the magazine is available.<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H1>HEDIS:</H1> <H2>Turning the Standards to Gold</H2>

<H3><I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>

<I>HEDIS-related promotion in three categories — product-related, partnership-oriented, and influence campaigns — are rapidly accelerating. Current programs currently include education and disease management to, and even partnering with, MCOs. But we are just in the beginning stages and insiders feel HEDIS-related promotion will become a determining factor in winning MCO contracts in the future.</I><P><HR><P>

The trend toward HEDIS-related promotion is rapidly accelerating.<P>

This is the upshot of interviews <I>Medical Marketing & Media</I> conducted with ten executives at healthcare companies, ad agencies, and consulting firms involved in marketing to managed care. Those who were not already conducting promotional programs hitched to HEDIS were in the process of actively planning such activities.<P>

Here are some sound bites reflecting the importance of HEDIS in the minds of these executives:<UL>
<LI>“It's driving the marketing of products in HEDIS categories.” — <I>John Eichert, CEO/president of the marketing consulting firm, Hastings Healthcare.</I>
<LI>“HEDIS is dictating the agenda of this organization.” — <I>the head of a health maintenance organization, quoted by Risa Janoff Bernstein of advertising agency Gross Townsend Frank Hoffman.</I>
<LI>“HEDIS is the important test in a NCQA review.” — <I>Ron Peyton, director of disease management at Boehringer Mannheim.</I>
<LI>“MCOs take HEDIS very seriously.” — <I>Myron Holubiak, CEO of consulting firm Emron.</I>
<LI>“… an essential component in MCO planning.” — <I>Arthur Sturm, president/ chairman of Sturm Rosenberg Cafferata Advertising.</I></UL><P>

HEDIS programs, they reported, fall into three categories: product-related, partnership-oriented, and influence campaigns.<P>

<H3>Product activities</H3>

As an indication of the way HEDIS is shaping the thinking at MCOs and, accordingly, marketing programs directed to them, one of our contacts told of a creative redirection which occurred on a product presentation aid. The first version demonstrated how the product would save money for the MCO. Apparently, this was an all too familiar refrain, for it was rejected. The second version demonstrated how the product would help the MCO achieve a higher HEDIS score — and was accepted.<P>

In product categories where HEDIS standards have been established — asthma, cholesterol screening, vaccination, prenatal care, for example — product managers and their agencies are tailoring their programs to be in sync with HEDIS measures. Patient compliance programs are a logical fit. Ron Peyton described a joint activity which Boehringer Mannheim and Lilly are conducting. It involves education programs to physicians and diabetes educators to acquaint them with HEDIS standards for the clinical marker HbA<SUB>1C</SUB> for glucose. The goal of the program is to raise an MCO's performance in this area. That's good for the MCO, for the patients, and also for sales of Lilly's insulin and Boehringer Mannheim's glucose monitors. The activity resembles a pull-through campaign, but here the reference point is not formulary status, but how the MCO's goal of meeting HEDIS standards can be assisted by the companies' products and programs.<P>

For companies offering disease management programs to MCOs for conditions for which HEDIS has established performance measures, it is virtually a necessity that the HEDIS requirements be met. For example, disease management in hypertension has to include provisions for HEDIS screening measures for cholesterol levels and diabetes, such as retinal examinations. Janoff Bernstein says that some disease management programs aim at meeting or exceeding HEDIS scores in defining the measurement aspect of their programs.<P>

<H3>Partnering with MCOs</H3>

Up to now, MCOs have not been enthusiastic about accepting healthcare manufacturers as partners. HEDIS presents an opportunity for improving these relationships. According to Patricia Wolfangel, director of client services of the Zitter Group, a consulting/marketing company:“HEDIS is at the top of the radar screen for MCOs. Healthcare companies understand this and are advancing their partnership with MCOs by helping them do a better job in meeting HEDIS measures.” She points to two programs Zitter has prepared for Ciba-Geneva.<P>

The first of these is a three-day “dialogue” conducted by the company for an MCO's top-level staff — the ceo, coo, medical director, quality assurance officer, medical information specialists, marketing director, etc. In extended sessions, faculty from NCQA, employers, HEDIS, and Dr. Ellwood's Foundation for Accountability make presentations and conduct group discussions. The program's goals are to explain what the performance audits are looking for, to examine the impact of HEDIS on purchasing and quality improvement decisions, to instruct on how to train MCO employees for quality accountability, and, lastly, to show the MCO how to communicate to its enrollees and its community what it is doing to improve the quality of care.<P>

The second Zitter program is called the HEDIS Tool Kit and consists of a boxed, print and videotape information package distributed to MCOs by Ciba-Geneva. The kit is aimed at educating MCO employees on HEDIS, and helping the MCO to market to its key customers — employers purchasing healthcare coverage — by explaining how it is improving the quality of the care it provides through the application of HEDIS standards. There is no product link in either of these activities. They are simply intended to improve the relationship between the company and the MCO.<P>

Other partnership programs cited by those interviewed included a telemarketing program provided by a company to improve an MCO's HEDIS patient satisfaction scores, while another company is helping an MCO cope with the data requirements HEDIS places on providers. For proprietory reasons, they are obviously not willing to go into greater detail.<P>

<H3>Influencing HEDIS</H3>

As Kathleen Kimball-Baker points out in the first part of this article, PhRMA is making a concerted effort on behalf of our industry to make sure that drug treatment is not overlooked in HEDIS 3.<P>

Myron Holubiak adds that, “Most drug companies are also making individual efforts to make sure that HEDIS standards include measurements relevant to their products.” He reports that NCQA executives have told him they are approached frequently on this subject. The discussions are essentially epidemiological — the company explaining why a condition is a significant health problem and worthy of HEDIS' attention. Of course, these companies market products that are appropriate for that particular disease — an important consideration, since there is no benefit in measuring an MCO's diagnostic performance if there is no effective therapeutic follow-up. Holubiak notes that osteoporosis is a good candidate for HEDIS inclusion in the future given new clinical developments.<P>

Jon Doniger, vice president, director of managed care of the advertising agency Medicus Communications, cites other statistical measures that, if included in HEDIS, could benefit the pharmaceutical industry. As examples, he mentions companies with products that reduce the length of hospitalization in certain conditions, or diminish the rate of particular types of heart failure as obvious candidates for bringing their evidence to the attention of HEDIS/NCQA. Regarding the future impact of HEDIS, he reports that companies have even begun to structure their clinical research to include data which can be used in approaching NCQA.<P>

The subject of influencing HEDIS standards leads Holubiak to point out another important development. Although the HEDIS/NCQA system dominates MCO thinking, some employers believe it doesn't go far enough. That is why some purchasers of managed care are retaining consultants to advise them on how to increase the quality of care from MCOs — particularly with regard to patient (their employees') satisfaction. Some drug companies are now including these consulting firms in their influence program.<P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

How important is HEDIS to manufacturers in their marketing to HMOs? Consider that a 
national managed care organization is advertising to the public that it has the approval of the organization evaluating MCO quality (i.e., NCQA with its HEDIS measure). Also consider that, as mentioned by John Eichert, HEDIS scores can be the tie-breaker in highly competitive MCO markets with sizable contracts as the prize.<P>

Finally, as <I>MM&M</I> columnist Carl Seiden mentioned in his latest industry overview, companies involved in disease management programs have to face the fact that the data they themselves generate are invariably viewed with suspicion. “Therefore, the extent to which they can depend on HEDIS…to document their claims, the more successful they will be.”<P><HR><P>

<H1>MISSION IMPONDERABLE:</H1>

<H4><I>Experts debate industry's changing identity</I></H4></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<H3>Participants:</H3>
<I><B>Lawrence Belford</B>, Executive Director, Marketing Services, Ciba-Geigy.<BR>
<B>William G. Castagnoli</B>, Contributing Editor, MM&M.<BR>

<H3>Moderator</H3>
<I><B>Warren Ross</B>, editor of MM&M, moderated the discussion.</I><P><HR><P>

<B><I>“An apt analogy for what has happened in healthcare in the last few years is that it's like the Berlin Wall coming down — like the experience of the Eastern European countries that had to start virtually from scratch. That's the environment in which we're doing business right now, and it's very exciting. All possibilities are open to us.”— Jim Dougherty</I></B><P>

Jim Dougherty's analogy provides the focus for this roundtable discussion which took place among <I>Medical Marketing & Media's</I> editorial advisory board earlier this year. No one will disagree that we have seen dramatic changes in the healthcare industry. The question is: do these changes represent a basic redirection of the type of business we're in, or are they tactical adjustments? And how will they affect people who work for healthcare companies of all types.<P>

<B><I>Dougherty:</I></B> The most basic change I see is the growth in healthcare information technology, which will have a tremendous impact on the way healthcare is delivered and hence on our industry. Integrated systems, new data bases, computerized patient records — when all these things start to take hold, everything will be different. For instance, integrated systems linking labs, hospitals, pharmacies, and physicians will make it possible to assess the effects of a new therapy very rapidly: does it work or doesn't it. You'll be able to adjust marketing strategy and pricing based on almost instant feedback. And such changes won't be long in coming. Spending on information technology in the healthcare industry is projected to have a 53 percent annual compound growth rate.<P>

<B><I>Castagnoli:</I></B> Certainly that will change the way companies operate, but will it change their basic mission?<P>

<B><I>Sinapi:</I></B> I doubt it. The basic industry mission is to develop and market pharmaceuticals or biotech products. That means that R&D will continue to be fundamental. What will change is the behavior of these corporations as they adjust to market changes. In addition to what Jim mentioned, I see these market changes as the aging of the baby boomers; the opening up not only of new domestic markets, but also of such foreign markets as China; the wellness push among consumers; the growing emphasis on preventive interventions — these are just a few examples.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> So when Glaxo Wellcome forms a joint venture with Physician Computer Network to market information systems or Zeneca buys Salick Health Care — to cite just two recent examples (see “From pills to what?” below) — you don't see that as a basic change in our industry's mission, from pills to…who knows what?</I><P>

<B><I>Sinapi:</I></B> If you mean, will today's pharmaceutical companies no longer be focused on basic research and the development of new chemical entities and on product delivery, my answer is no. Marketing of pharmaceuticals and new chemical entities will continue to be where basic revenues come from. The actions you mention are just new ways of adjusting to the market.<P>

<B><I>Castagnoli:</I></B> But now the market includes the delivery of care. That seems to me to be a qualitative change.<P>

<B><I>Liebman:</I></B> As healthcare delivery is changing, our customer is changing. We used to be concerned primarily with acute illness or acute episodes of chronic illness, but since our new customer is managed care, our mission from now on will have to be the over-all, even lifetime care of the patient.<P>

<H3>Example: disease management</H3>

<B><I>Kennett:</I></B> I don't think even the companies themselves know whether these are basic, strategic, or merely tactical changes, because they don't have the foggiest idea what the market is going to be like in six months, let alone three years. So I think they're making a lot of tactical decisions rather than long-term or even mid-term strategic decisions. Take disease management as an example. Right now it looks like a very reasonable way to adapt to a changing market. Three years from now we may look back and say it was just a fad. We're going to have to wait until the market settles and find out who the real customers are. My guess is that it's going to be the consumer, the patient, who's going to call the shots.<P>

<B><I>Belford:</I></B> I don't agree that top management is just hedging its bets. I do agree that it's too early to determine if there's a trend to redefine our industry, though there's definitely a groundswell of change. What I see happening is that there are a lot of forward-thinking companies that recognize that that there are better ways of providing care, and that there has to be a partnership between managed care and pharmaceutical companies.<P>

Believe me, these are very bright people in charge of companies and they're not going to spend 100 million dollars on a disease management program, and man it with 90 people, on sort of a trial-and-error basis. They know exactly where they are going. Disease management is definitely a new business, and it's a business that we'll still be in five years out and longer.<P>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> I don't think that you can sell disease management as a stand-alone concept rather than as an add-on service. If you sell it, whether on a fee or a risk basis, you have to demonstrate offsetting savings for the MCO. Suppose you do it so well that the first year you reduce inefficiencies by 50 percent. The following year it's going to be a lot harder to squeeze out another dollar. So essentially you have set up a design where growth will keep constricting…you have built in your own obsolescence. That says to me that disease management based on sharing savings ultimately defeats itself; that the only industry involvement in disease management that makes sense is one based on supporting your own brands. That's not a bad thing — it's a good thing. But it's not a new business.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Then what is the future mission of the drug industry?</I><P>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> The challenge facing the pharmaceutical industry is that it's aging and its product line is aging, with a lot of important products having reached or about to reach patent expiration. True, new products will come out of biotech research, but that doesn't change the fact that our industry can't afford a narrow vision of its mission. It has to recognize that its business is healthcare, not just drugs. It can't make the mistake of the railroad industry, which focused on railroads instead of transportation.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> But isn't drug development still its core competency?</I>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> So it is. But we also have other competencies that lend themselves to today's world in healthcare: expertise in protocol development, in research and communications; and we've gotten pretty good at healthcare behavior change. We have to capitalize on all those competencies to build something bigger than just drug companies. That doesn't mean that companies would not still prefer to have good, well-differentiated sole source products, but they can no longer depend on them for growth.<P>

<H3>The generic challenge</H3>

<B><I>Singh:</I></B> And it's all because of the impact of generics. The best way to attack generics is to own the patient. And the best way to own the patient is to develop products that make present drugs irrelevant and can't be readily copied. I'm talking about drugs like Bayer's new antidiabetic that treat not symptoms but the underlying physiological disorder. I'm talking especially about chronic conditions, which will increase tremendously as the baby boomers grow older. If you can treat these disorders with drugs that correct basic mechanisms, you will own those patients for life and your future is secure.<P>

<B><I>Belford:</I></B> But generics will still be the dynamic that will radically change the nature of this industry. There have been all sorts of efforts to stem generics by increasing compliance and developing special packaging and adding to the image of the product, but with very few exceptions none of them have worked.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> What should be the response: to get into healthcare delivery? There are persistent rumors that some drug companies are considering mergers with HMOs.</I><P>

<B><I>Dougherty:</I></B> You don't have to buy an HMO; control of information will sufffice. If you own a PBM and provide physicians with hand-held computers that include Rx software, you can work it so that when the doctor wants to write a prescription, the first product to pop up on the computer screen will be yours…much like the airline reservation systems.<P>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> But isn't it true that the incremental improvements that rejuvenated product lines in the past will no longer suffice to sustain the industry? Except in cases of new technology where health economic studies prove that the incremental benefit is worth an incremental price, we will not be able to fight off generics. Which is why we're going to see more mergers designed to increase volume so that earnings continue to grow even though profit ratios shrink.<P>

<H3>Living with managed care</H3>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Is the underlying assumption that all this is due to the impact of managed care?</I><P>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> There's a commmon assumption that managed care is in the driver's seat. I think drug companies are in a much stronger position than managed care companies.<P>

<B><I>Belford:</I></B> Anyway, that battle has already been fought and is now almost a non-issue. I conclude from that that the industry is pretty much what it's going to be for the next decade or so in terms of being able to influence its relationship with third parties. That's why you are seeing drug companies buying other drug companies. That's still where the bucks are.<P>

<B><I>Kennett:</I></B> The real battle for control is going to be between managed care and organized medicine, and the outcome will depend on who can provide the best service to the customer — and the customer is going to be the patient. That's why it's not going to be outcomes so much that will drive the market; it's going to be customer satisfaction, and customer satisfaction is not necessarily going to be, hey, I'm still alive. It's going to be: I saw the doctor in ten minutes, he gave me good information, he was friendly, the staff was friendly. It's the same kind of thing good retailers give their customers: access and a pleasant experience. What pharmaceutical companies need to do is to help providers — whoever they are — earn customer satisfaction.<P>

<B><I>Dougherty:</I></B> What you're describing is the Nordstrom model. But there is also the Wal-Mart model. Wal-Mart wins because they know what the demand is and provide the product where and when the customer wants it. In other words, they control the information. And that's where I think the pharmaceutical industry has the edge. Whoever has control of the information will be the winner.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Are we arriving at a consensus that the pharmaceutical industry will remain basically the same? That it may engage in some new enterprises, but that its core mission will still be the development of new and better drugs?</I><P>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> No, I don't agree. There's going to be incredible change. For one thing, we'll see tremendous merger activity over the next decade. We could end up with a half a dozen primary care companies plus a lot of special “niche” companies. That would represent an enormous reduction of waste and inefficiency, so the surviving companies will have lots of earnings but not at the profit ratios there used to be. Also, there will be enormous pressure to squeeze inefficiency out of the R&D effort. There's got to be a way to develop products quickly, get them through the regulatory system quickly — to tame the monster that now is wasting millions of dollars a year.<P>

<B><I>Belford:</I></B> Isn't that a straight-line projection of what's already happening? Mergers…greater efficiency — it's happening now.<P>

<B><I>Castagnoli:</I></B> What concerns me, from the advertising agencies' point of view, is that you see very little promotion of products that are not patent protected — which, of course, translates into reduced agency volume. On the other hand, I'm convinced that there will always be a role for agencies that prove themselves efficient…that deliver what they claim they can deliver in terms of creative communications and creative marketing ideas…but I also have a question for Myron. You said you expected the industry to change drastically. Yet what I hear you describing is a quantitative, not a qualitative, change.<P>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> Let's agree that it's a huge change.<P>

<B><I>Liebman:</I></B> I'm not sure I even agree with that. What the industry is doing in marketing is not really innovative; it's following where the customer is going — and it's being a little slow about that for that matter.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> You think it's slow? Didn't every company set up managed care marketing functions within months?</I><P>

<B><I>Liebman:</I></B> They set them up within months, but they did the same thing they were doing before with a new label. They didn't change marketing stategies until very recently. Now they are finally beginning to do what the customer wants, such as providing disease management services and patient and physician education programs, and saying to HMOs: I will work with you, discuss price with you, and I hope you will buy my drug.<P>

<B><I>Sinapi:</I></B> Companies are still experimenting with how to reach managed care organizations; how to deal with Medicare and Medicaid; how to cope with the effects of rebates. I agree with Myron on the basic life cycle the industry is going through. If you have mature products in a mature industry, it forces you to do some things you otherwise might not have done. Clearly we need to go beyond traditional thinking and traditional markets. So while the mainstay of our business will continue to be providing medications, that doesn't mean that we won't be changing. In fact, while it may seem like just evolutionary change now, when we look back a few years from now, I don't think we'll recognize this industry.<P>

<B><I>Belford:</I></B> I'd characterize it as almost catastrophic change. To say we'll be doing business as usual with just a few tweaks here and there, that's not the case at all. If this discussion had been held ten or even four years ago, we'd be talking about journals, direct mail, and detailing. This is a different world. By year 2000, there will be topics we haven't even heard of.<P>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> We have to move from focusing on products to the value of the products. That's what disease management and health economics and outcome studies are all about. It's no longer enough to say, we created a product that has the following features and benefits. I see that as a fundamental change that affects how we position products, how we price them, how we communicate about them.<P>

<B><I>Liebman:</I></B> What not only every pharmaceutical company but every supplier in this business has to be concerned with is that our physician/customer is now part of a managed care organization, and therefore concerned with the health of the patient through a course of time.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> To conclude, let's go around the table and have each panel member tell us what you think the people making a living in the various segments of our industry you represent should be doing to prepare for the changes that are coming.</I>

<B><I>Kennett:</I></B> What publishers have to do is find new ways to help the pharmaceutical industry communicate with both professionals and consumers. Managed care organizations are going to depend on patient satisfaction for their success, and part of that satisfaction is having medications that the patient/customer believes will help improve the quality of life. Brand awareness will be extremely important in keeping these customers happy.<P>

<H3>Reinforcing the bond</H3>

<B><I>Singh:</I></B> The same concept applies to the non-traditional media, which is why companies in our field have already started going beyond providing information to physicians. I have used the phrase “to own the patient.” I see a very important role for non-traditional media in helping healthcare companies reinforce the bond with their members in new and unique ways, not only with product information but with disease and self-care information.<P>

<B><I>Dougherty:</I></B> This is a paradigm everyone who wants to do well in this business should keep in mind: data becomes information; information becomes knowledge; knowledge becomes wisdom. At each step there is value added. Whether you work for a pharmaceutical company, a managed care organization, publisher, or agency — whoever it is that can add value at any one of those steps and thereby contribute to greater efficiency will be a winner.<P>

<B><I>Liebman:</I></B> One growth area, I think, will be continuing professional education. In rapidly changing fields, people need to catch up with the technology. So both within pharmaceutical companies and in related service organizations there will be a great need for people who know how to change and update the behavior of health professionals.<P>

<B><I>Sinapi:</I></B> Industry people need to keep up with the rapid market trends, and not only understand them but understand the implications. They need to remain flexible and to know how to work efficiently in teams, both inside the company and in partnerships outside the company. I believe that a generalist's background will be favored over more specialized qualifications. Finally, I think the new environment will definitely favor those who become the most sophisticated in their thinking.<P>

<B><I>Belford:</I></B> I think the focus in industry will be on giving people the opportunity to be entrepreneurial. As companies explore all kinds of separate businesses — as I think they will have to do or they won't be around next year — they will say to their staff members: would you be interested in working on this? And they will also reward people who go to management and say: why don't we do such and such? In short, this is going to be one great place to work for the next few years, but you're going to have bring something to the party.<P>

<B><I>Holubiak:</I></B> From the point of view of consulting, research, and communications companies, I'd say that they have to help their clients seek the truth, not simply make them feel good about what they've done. For instance, they have to answer tough questions about marginal return on investment — what is the incremental value of new enterprises? How do you reduce waste, become more efficient? Those are tough questions, and whatever services help industry answer them correctly will continue to thrive.<P>

<B><I>Castagnoli:</I></B> What Myron said certainly applies to advertising agencies. They have to understand new audiences and new marketing services, and develop competitive, creative ways of expressing new strategies. Those who can stay on top of all of that — well, they will stay on top.<P>

<I><B>MM&M:</B> Thank you all for your frank and challenging comments. One conclusion is clear: there are exciting times ahead.</I> <P><HR><P>

<H2>From Pills to…What?</H2>

While horizontal mergers (Pharmacia & Upjohn, Ciba and Sandoz) are making headlines, another trend may more radically change the nature of the pharmaceutical industry: the efforts to acquire or form partnerships with new and different types of enterprises. For example:<BR><UL>

<LI>Pfizer announces an agreement with National Health Enhancement Systems to set up a “medical phone center” for patients, and sets up Pfizer Healthcare Solutions to deliver information systems; while Searle contracts with SSI to establish a “medical information line.”

<LI>Greenstone (a Pharmacia & Upjohn subsidiary) joins with Lovelace Clinic Foundation to market disease management protocols.

<LI>Glaxo Wellcome forms a joint venture with Physician Computer Network to market information systems for physicians.

<LI>Eli Lilly acquires Integrated Medical Systems to tie physicians, hospitals, pharmacists, and patients into a “true healthcare system.”

<LI>JAMA and Glaxo Wellcome create HIV/AIDS Internet Web site.

<LI>Zeneca buys Salick Health Care, putting it in the treatment business.

<LI>Bristol-Myers Squibb and Harvard Medical School join with CW Ventures to develop cardiovascular information products, and funds “Oncology Online” to distribute news, CME, and dialogue for cancer researchers.</UL><P>

All such moves raise the question whether the pharmaceutical industry is merely making tactical adjustments or is redefining its basic mission. That is the question discussed by <I>MM&M</I>'s expert panel.

<CENTER><H1>Developing Blockbuster Portfolios</H1>

<H3><I>by Al Paz</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>

<I>The drastically shortened patent protection enjoyed by pharmaceutical companies has meant a change in the way they think about product development and marketing. Successful strategies have centered around the development of therapeutic categories, physiologic systems, combination drugs, and alternate formulations. Targeted R&D should be part of a systematic plan of drug introduction, which encompasses defining therapeutic categories, developing a portfolio, licensing, and product development. Failure to do so may force a company out of a therapeutic category altogether.</I><P><HR><P>

In the past, pharmaceutical companies could develop a blockbuster drug and then dominate that market for the 20-year life of the patent. Today's more complex healthcare environment requires that pharmaceutical companies change the way they think about product development and marketing and focus on drug “portfolios” rather than single drugs.<P>

Due to changes in the laws governing approval of generic drugs, most branded drugs only have a patent life of three to seven years before generic competition can be introduced. The growing dominance of managed care organizations also has had a significant impact on the profitability of branded drugs. Because managed care organizations generally require automatic substitution once a generic becomes available, a company can lose in excess of 50 percent of unit sales within six months of the introduction of a generic.<P>

To combat these forces and maintain strong positions in target markets over the long term, pharmaceutical companies must devise long-range strategies for developing and marketing products that revolve around the treatment of a disease or around a body system, rather than being single-product driven. By developing expertise in therapeutic categories or physiologic systems, and by understanding the needs and concerns of those who treat the targeted complex of diseases, companies can compete in the marketplace from a position of strength.<P>

<H3>Long-range planning</H3>

An effective long-range strategy starts with the introduction of a novel lead compound. While the patent life is still protected, researchers should develop an incremental improvement. Before a generic or competing product is introduced, the company should be first to introduce this enhanced product (e.g., once-a-day formulation) and then first replace it with a second-generation drug that represents a significant improvement (see Table 1, below).<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>FOUR STEPS TO DEVELOP A BLOCKBUSTER PORTFOLIO</H3></CENTER>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="block2.gif"></CENTER><P>

Companies such as Pfizer and Merck have achieved success by embracing this strategy centered around development in therapeutic categories.<P>

Pfizer's experience with dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers is a prime example. The company licensed Procardia and began selling it. They immediately began developing a long-acting formulation, Procardia XL. As soon as the patent on Procardia ran out, Pfizer introduced Procardia XL. The next step was to develop a second-generation product and to do so before any competitor. As the three-year patent on Procardia XL was running out, Pfizer was ready with Norvasc.<P>

Pfizer employed the same strategy with alpha blockers. First, they introduced Minipress, followed by Minipress XL. This was replaced with Cardura. They introduced these drugs at a time when no other company was developing alpha blockers and now they own the category.<P>

Merck has achieved success by concentrating on dominance in the treatment of specific diseases. For example, the company is a leader in the ulcer market not by being first, but rather by developing a broad product line. SmithKline Beecham was the first company to launch an H<SUB>2</SUB>- antagonist (Tagamet), and Glaxo soon came along with Zantac. But Merck retains the strongest position, because the company has in its portfolio an over-the-counter antacid (Mylanta), an H<SUB>2</SUB> antagonist (Pepcid, which has just been released in an over-the-counter formulation), and a proton pump inhibitor (Prilosec).<P>

Rather than focus on one specific disease, some companies will develop products around a physiologic system, such as the renin angiotensin system. Bristol-Myers Squibb first developed Corgard, a beta-blocker, followed by two angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (Capoten and Monopril). The company is currently developing an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist, the next generation of antihypertensives that have activity in the renin angiotensin system.<P>

In the area of cephalosporin antibiotics, Bristol-Myers Squibb first came out with Duricef, an oral antibiotic used primarily in the treatment of skin infections and pharyngitis. This was replaced with Cefzil, a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that also is indicated for the treatment of skin infections and pharyngitis but also covers otitis media and bronchitis.<P>

<H3>The FDA helps out</H3>

New FDA guidelines are good news for companies that wish to implement this strategy of developing therapeutic portfolios. The FDA now allows companies to create combination drugs from first-line therapies and to get these compounds quickly through the approval process. This means that new effective combination therapies can be developed and marketed in a very timely fashion.<P>

For example, Wyeth-Ayerst was able to create Ziac, a combination of zhydrochlorothiazide and the cardioselective beta-blocker bisoprolol. These agents were combined in an innovative way to create an antihypertensive agent with 80% efficacy and placebo-like side effects. This is greater efficacy than any single antihypertensive agent can offer.<P>

If implemented wisely, the development of combination formulations may be one way that a company can quickly introduce an improvement on a lead compound.<P>

The failure to continue to provide a succession of new products to follow a breakthrough drug has taken its toll on some companies. It is interesting to note that many of the companies that created some of the largest therapeutic categories no longer play a prominent role in the treatment of those diseases.<P>

In the 1970s, Ciba-Geigy and Merck, Sharpe & Dohme were the dominant players in the field of antidepressants with their tricyclic antidepressants. When selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) were introduced, a flood of new players entered the market. Ciba-Geigy and Merck, Sharpe & Dohme failed to introduce SSRIs, and now the antidepressant market is dominated by other companies.<P>

The question now is: Who will come up with the next generation of antidepressants? Will it be one of the established companies or will they lose their edge to a new player?<P>

Some pharmaceutical companies that develop effective and profitable drugs ultimately lose the leadership position in the marketplace, because they fail to plan for the day the drug goes off patent or an improvement on the compound is developed. Some companies succeed in introducing an upgrade drug, such as a sustained-release formulation, but then fail to follow that up with a new-generation drug to replace their flagship product.<P>

Searle, for example, introduced Calan SR to replace Calan, but then failed to follow it up with a replacement compound. ICI did well with a beta-blocker, and Merck failed initially. But Merck eventually beat ICI in the ACE-inhibitor category and now is a dominant player, while ICI is trailing. Merck has recently introduced an angiotensin-II receptor antagonist to maintain its strong presence in producing drugs that work on the renin angiotensin system.<P>

Whenever an innovative drug enters the market, the critical question is: Will the company maintain its dominance in the market or eventually lose to the competition. Will SmithKline Beecham come up with a replacement for Augmentin? Or will one of its competitors?<P>

<H3>Defining a target area</H3>

There are several steps in the process of defining target areas to concentrate research and development efforts, and to systematically plan for the next 10 to 15 years during which time drugs are introduced and replaced in an orderly fashion (see Table 2, below).<P>

First, a company must define the therapeutic categories in which it wants to focus. There should be a large market for the drugs in that category and a certain level of dissatisfaction with the current treatments. Ideally, the company should have some expertise in R&D in that area.<P>

Second, a company must develop a portfolio of products that will attack a disease through a variety of routes or be specific to a particular physiologic system.<P>

Third, the company should be prepared with an aggressive licensing program in order to enter the marketplace ahead of the competition in case internal research and development efforts do not result in viable new compounds quickly enough. Being first on the market is extremely important, not just the first time but all along the way.<P>

Sometimes it may even be advisable for a company to get in the door fast with a less than stellar product, but with a succession plan that will allow the company to enhance the original compound and identify additional compounds to improve market share and always stay ahead of competition.<P>

Fourth, the company must establish an aggressive product development program to derive the greatest benefit from each new product through line extensions and new indications.<P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

When faced with potential competition (both branded and generic), some companies will move to defend their existing product through aggressive marketing rather than outmaneuvering the competition by beating them to the market with advanced products. Other companies shift their marketing and promotion efforts to another, unrelated drug.<P>

Rather than introduce one breakthrough drug and then move on, companies need to look at developing a whole range of products to treat a targeted physiologic system or a specific disease. In this way, they don't just have the benefit of the patent life of one product, but may be able to sustain a leadership position within a therapeutic category for decades.<P>

The strategy is to focus on a disease category, determine the unmet needs, and identify a portfolio of products to satisfy those unmet needs. It's no longer possible to rest on the laurels of a blockbuster drug.<P>

The most important message for pharmaceutical companies is, whichever therapeutic category they decide to go into, go in to own it. This means a long-term plan that includes a successful introduction of a lead compound, systematic improvements on that compound (e.g., sustained release technology or new indications), followed by replacement compounds.<P>

The replacement does not have to be a breakthrough product, but rather a developmental advancement over the lead compound. Once a lead compound is developed, waste no time beginning development of a compound that will make it obsolete. And do it before the competition does.<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H1>Mr. Impossible</H1>

<H3><I>by William G. Castagnoli</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H3>Executive summary:</H3></CENTER>

<I>The agency's copy chief and pointman had just returned from a business trip at a Midwestern client's office. The client hated the presentation. The new product manger wanted something completely different. But he had his comeuppance in the end and the agency made good.</I><P><HR><P>

<H4>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:</H4>

<B><I>This isn't a REAL Executive SUMMARY! Who taught you how to write? Why are we doing an ES in the first place? Whose lamebrained idea was THAT? Go back and do it again.</I></B><P><HR><P>

The meeting had been such a disaster that Courtney, the account supervisor, ordered a “double Black Label” from the flight attendant as we boarded the plane. We were on our way back from a day-long meeting at our Midwestern client's headquarters. We had taken the early, early flight from New York, arrived tenish, did some minor business, had lunch, and then gone into an afternoon session on detail aids for Thipineonal, the CCB/Beta-blocker/Diuretic combo. It wasn't a drop-dead, crucial presentation, so Brad Banner, the agency's copy chief and pointman on all things creative, had skipped that meeting for another session in the building — a data dump on PBMs. I had shown the work along with Courtney. Now, as I settled into my window seat wondering how I could face all the revisions/comments we'd received, Banner came up the aisle.<P>

When he saw my expression, he frowned. “It couldn't have been that bad.” he said.<P>

“'Bad' is on the scale. We didn't make the scale,” I said.<P>

“Oh, come on now, that work was first-rate. You had some good stuff.”<P>

“Rogers hated it.”<P>

“Rogers? Since when is he in charge? Isn't he the assistant?”<P>

“Was. Now he's product manager and what has gone before is…”<P>

“Not for him.”<P>

“You got it.”<P>

Courtney, who was next to me leafing through his briefcase, turned my way and said, “You did very well today.”<P>

“'Very well?' He questioned whether I understood the principles of pharmaceutical advertising, if I knew an M.D. from a D.O. and nit-picked the copy's grammar!”<P>

“But you didn't lose it.” he said.<P>

“I was too stunned.”<P>

When we were in the air, Banner returned, switching seats with Courtney. “So, tell me,” he said.<P>

“Well, basically, he challenged the message strategy, which made everything wrong. Courtney, who was a prince by the way, went over all the research, but Rogers wasn't buying — sample size, questionnaire flaws, you know the drill. He'd sold the product in the field and it was dosage flexibility that switched scripts. Many forms for many patients is his sales line … We went over the numbers again and pointed out that Higgins, the last PM, had approved the side effect approach, had been enthusiastic about it. Now, that really made him crazy.”<P>

“What do you mean 'crazy?'”<P>

“He said Higgins was a home office shut-in who didn't know the real world. That it was his product now and we'd do it his way.”<P>

“Wasn't Higgins promoted? Doesn't Rogers report to him?”<P>

“Yes, Higgins is the groupie.”<P>

“What does Rogers want?”<P>

“A dosage campaign.”<P>

“The marketing plan is all side effects.”<P>

“Correctomundo ... what do we do?”<P>

Banner pursed his lips and then his face relaxed as he looked past me out the window at the glorious sunset receding in the West. “Give it to him,” he said.<P>

The next two months we were on a roller coaster with Rogers. We'd get something he'd okay, take it to finish, and he'd kill it. Second thoughts on the headline or not a striking enough graphic, or simply an I'm-Not-Impressed rejection. The detail round on Thipineonal had been postponed so our deadline was soft, but we were logging in a lot of creative hours. Courtney was nervous. “Wait until they see the bill,” he warned.<P>

One evening, Bernie, the art director on the account, and I were having drinks after work at the agency annex up the street when Banner came in and sat down with a woman who apparently had been waiting for him. He saw us and came over. “Recruitment interview,” he said, answering Bernie's leering grin; then with a sigh, he said, “Well, they've hit the ceiling on Thipineonal creative charges.”<P>

“You know the score,” said Bernie, “It's Rogers. Keeps shifting ground. Insists on one of his ideas. Then hates it and blames us.”<P>

“And, he's always playing the scare card,” I said, “Like, 'You're the agency. You get it right!'”<P>

“You've got to do something, Brad,” said Bernie.<P>

“Me? What about the account group?” said Banner glancing over at the job candidate who was looking at her watch.<P>

“They're demoralized,” I said. “Think we're losing the assignment.”<P>

“What?” Banner exclaimed. The woman was staring at us. Banner was shaking his head. “I've seen his type before.”<P>

“So do something. You know people at the top,” I said.<P>

“I just can't go after him as 'impossible,'” said Banner, “I need chapter and verse. Bring me all the submissions, the conference reports, the research. I've got to have the whole picture.”<P>

He headed back to the job candidate. “I'm sorry. Minor crisis,” he told her.<P>

On the way to the subway we ran into Courtney.<P>

“Brad's going after Rogers,” Bernie said beaming.<P>

“Hold it, fun group,” said Courtney. “Rogers is connected somewhere. This could blow up in our face!”<P>

“So talk to Banner,” I said. “We're dying the death of a thousand cuts now. What's to lose?”<P>

“Well, at least let's get the bills paid before we call anyone,” said Courtney. “I'll talk to Brad.”<P>

Nothing happened for two weeks except more thumbscrew work on the creatives. Then one day, Bernie burst, like Seinfeld's Kramer, into my office. “Oh happy day,” he sang. “Mr. Impossible is no more. Shipped out to International! … Caracas!”<P>

I went to see Banner. “Rogers is out of our hair.”<P>

“I know.”<P>

“You called?”<P>

“No, they called me a few days ago.”<P>

“And?”<P>

“I listened. Higgins wanted to know what I thought about Rogers.”<P>

“You're kidding! What an opening.”<P>

“It wasn't like that. Higgins began complaining about Rogers before I could say a thing.”<P>

“Competitive with the other PM. Critical of all decisions. Scapegoating everyone. And he had really done a number on us. Higgins was pissed and was looking for support.”<P>

“So you gave it to him?”<P>

“Not exactly.”<P>

“What? Didn't you tell him our side?”<P>

“No. I didn't have to. I just agreed with him. Look, there's something you have to learn about clients. And it works both ways. Good client people understand it, too. From time to time, you run into bad apples in organizations you're working with. You have to deal with them, but they're impossible. If you're a supplier, you're at a disadvantage because they're paying the bills and have clout on their side. But that doesn't mean the situation is hopeless. It's risky to go to the boss and complain because organizations tend to protect their own. And who put the problem in the job to begin with? The boss you're bitching to.”<P>

“So, where's the hope?”<P>

“With a difficult guy like Rogers, appreciate the fact that he's difficult with everybody. He's just not 'impossible' with the agency. He's a pain to everyone he works with and eventually that gets through to management. The trick is to be patient, hang on, and let him sink himself.”<P>

“But, he made our life hell!”<P>

“Yes, and he did it at home too. He did himself in.”<P>

Courtney popped his head into Banner's door. “Rogers is history. We got a call from Higgins.”<P>

“And you told him we couldn't work with Rogers?”<P>

“No. The Old Man got the call. But he had been briefed.”<P>

“And he asked for Rogers to be sent to Caracas?”<P>

“No. Rogers shot off his mouth in a big meeting last week. Really showed an attitude. That killed him.”<P>

Banner smiled at me. “You'll get the bills paid,” he said to Courtney, “Rogers is the 'bad guy' right 
now.”<P>

When Courtney left, I said, “I can understand how hanging tough might work with a tyro like Rogers. But what if Mr. Impossible is Mr. Big?”<P>

Banner looked glum. “I've never won that one,” he said.<P><HR><P>

<CENTER><H1>Ads I wish I'd done</H1>

<H3><I>by Skip Thurnauer</I></H3></CENTER><P><HR><P>

“Laughter, The Best Medicine&#174;” was always my favorite column in the Reader's Digest when I was young. And I am an admitted member of CLAA, Cartoon Lovers Anonymous of America. I enjoy a good laugh. When it's related to our business — healthcare — all the better. Perhaps that's one of the reasons this advertisement, created by Lowe McAdams, caught my attention. However, my reaction to the ad was not merely visceral, it was also cerebral. The graphics and copy communicate a very clear message about Cedax, “A New Antibiotic With Patient-Friendly Benefits.”<P><HR><P>

<IMG SRC="adsi1.gif" align=right><P>

Product: Cedax<BR>
Agency: Lowe McAdams<BR>
Client: Schering Laboratories<BR>
Creative Team: Kevin McShane, creative director, writer;<BR> Mike Cummo & Haig Adishian, art directors<P><HR><P>

When entering a market congested with rainbow spectra, flying microbia, infiltrated lungs, and lightning bolts of antibiotic power, it is indeed a challenge to be noticed, let alone stand out from the competition. Were Cedax the first or the only once-a-day broad-spectrum antibiotic, a giant-sized “1” would have effectively positioned the product. That territory has been claimed and reclaimed many times. Product Manager David Fink challenged the creative team — copywriter Kevin McShane and art director Mike Cummo — to break away from the routine imagery of antibiotic advertising and create an image for Cedax that would help it stand out from the crowd.<P>

<IMG SRC="adsi2.gif"><P>

“Patient-friendly benefits” succinctly states the key product attributes: once-a-day administration and a low incidence of side effects. Combined, these features translate to convenience, backed by experience in approximately 1.5 million patients. The creative team told me that numerous “patient-friendly” concepts were explored and tested. Physicians responded positively to the “patient-friendly” positioning because it communicated the merits of the product. A doctor-patient graphic completed the message. But the creative team felt something was missing: the spark that would grab the reader's attention.<P>

The idea of adding an ingredient of humor to the ad was the spark that could make that difference. Kevin McShane stated that “at first, the client was a little edgy, but the idea of a joke had an appeal” that they liked. Fred Hilliard was selected as the cartoonist. The Nixonesque deadpan expressions of his characters poke fun at patient-doctor relationships. Page one is the straight-man in this three-page act and sets us up. Page two delivers the punch line. The ad is not merely a standalone vehicle, but is an element in an integrated campaign including sales literature and promotion. It has been an effective door-opener and “sale”-closer for the sales force. And the good news for us cartoon buffs is that there are more ads in the series coming our way.<P>

So hats off to the team from Schering and Lowe McAdams! Not only have you created an ad I wish I'd done, but you've given me a great line to use the next time I find myself in this familiar, uncomfortable position in my own doctor's office.<P><HR><P>

<h1 align="center"><a name="#top">WHAT MATTERS MOST IN</a>
ADVERTISING AGENCY PERFORMANCE TO CLIENTS</h1>

<h3 align="center"><i>by Joseph Doyle, R. Ph.<br>
</i></h3>

<hr>

<h3 align="center">Executive summary:</h3>

<p><i>A study found, in measurable terms, what companies feel are
important criteria in judging the performance of an advertising
agency. The two basic requirements are that an agency understand
the client's industry and the client's needs. Most desired is an
agency that follows strategy and stays focused on objectives.</i>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Both pharmaceutical companies and their advertising agencies
need to know, in measurable terms, what customers look for in
their suppliers, what roles they want them to play, and what
factors contribute to their satisfaction. However, it is not
enough to merely develop these factors; it is more important to <i>prioritize
</i>which are <i>most </i>meaningful to the &quot;buyers&quot;
(or, in our case, clients) in the relationship and upon which the
&quot;suppliers&quot; (agencies) can act. </p>

<p>A study recently conducted by my firm initially had the goal
of determining the criteria most important to our past, current,
and potential clients in assessing an advertising agency. Rather
than relying on anecdotal, sporadic feedback, the qualitative and
quantitative research we undertook provided a systematic approach
to evaluating the elements of client service. The research
project was inspired by a Harvard Executive Seminar. For the
benefit of our agency - as well as the other seminar attendees -
we committed to design and carry out one initiative that would
have a significant impact on our business. </p>

<p>What we learned has wider implications for virtually any
business where customer satisfaction drives sales and can be
instructive for pharmaceutical companies in meeting the needs of
their customers. This ranking is key to understanding a
particular company's (or, in this case, the agency's) areas of
high impact strengths and opportunities. Knowing what is
important to a customer enables the company to focus on improving
performance where performance counts. The company can then
concentrate its resources cost efficiently into those areas of
service or product that the customer truly deems important, not
simply what the company thinks may be important. </p>

<p><b>Essential findings<br>
</b>Two basic principles emerged from the BGM Client Satisfaction
Study, each of which has profound influence in creating and
keeping clients for any business. </p>

<p><b>1. The price of admission is understanding the client's
industry and is reflected in the agency's output.<br>
</b>This one underlying principle informed most respondents'
answers. Most wanted an agency that understood the intricacies of
their business and the complexities and influences of the
marketplace for their products and services. The agency must
demonstrate a thorough understanding of what the client faces in
the marketplace and translate that understanding into specific
communications programs that will help the client company achieve
its goals effectively. </p>

<p><b>2. The price of admission is also understanding
specifically what the client needs from the agency and delivering
it.<br>
</b>Our survey found that, not surprisingly, different
respondents held different expectations as to what its agency
role should be. Survey participants expect an agency to perform
multiple roles during the course of their relationship. The
specific roles varied with the respondent and the size of the
company and, in some cases, overlapped. For example, small to
mid-sized companies valued the agency as a strategic partner and
consultant, particularly in terms of strategic planning
capability and marketing expertise, as well as creative concepts
and execution. </p>

<p>Some larger companies also look to the agency for the
strategic function, but not as greatly. For those companies that
have internal strategic planning capabilities or that appropriate
that role to outside consultants, the strategic function is
subordinated to the importance of producing creative ideas and on
target strategy execution. It should be noted that outside
influences, such as budget constraints and number of agencies
worked with, impact expectations. </p>

<p>The difference in rankings among specific respondents
demonstrates the varying importance each placed on the items in
question. When the client rankings of importance match the actual
performance of an individual agency on each specific item, the
agency is meeting expectations, a significant measure of customer
satisfaction. Where the actual performance exceeds rankings, then
the agency has produced a very satisfied, loyal customer. </p>

<p>By extension, pharmaceutical companies, especially in dealing
with the varying sizes, maturity, and missions of managed care
companies, must know what those customers really want and need
from them. That information shapes the negotiation of pricing,
marketing support, and ancillary services to create and keep a
satisfied customer. The revealed strengths in meeting needs
indicate, in allocating resources, areas to maintain and promote.
It then becomes another decision as to which other areas need
attention and how much, weighed against return on investment. </p>

<p><b>What mattered most<br>
</b>Results suggest that, in viewing the agency relationship in
general, clients prefer that their agency play a receptive role.
The top four criteria (see Exhibit 1, <i>&quot;Evaluating your
agency,&quot;</i> facing page) indicate that an agency that
follows direction and delivers what is expected of it is
considered to be doing a very satisfactory job. Note that the top
rankings are tightly bunched; there is not much difference
statistically between the first and the third. </p>

<p>The first tenet of doing business with a client is that the
agency possess a profound, insightful understanding of the client
company and the business challenges it faces. Equally significant
is knowing what the client deems important in servicing its
business. This knowledge points to opportunities to maintain and
enhance customer satisfaction. In viewing agencies in general,
knowing the business and delivering an on target product was most
important among the survey participants. To see how your rankings
compare to the survey, we have included a survey for you to fill
out (see Exhibit 2,<i>&quot;What matters most to you?&quot;</i>,
facing page). </p>

<p>Pharmaceutical companies, especially those engaged in managed
care marketing, can apply the larger questions: How do the
findings relate to our customers? What is important to our
customers and how can we identify, improve where needed, and
deliver the internal and external resources to satisfy what
matters most to them? </p>

<p>The essence of the study was a valuable lesson in
customer-listening as the first step toward concentrating our
efforts where it matters most. In the specific rankings of BGM,
our client survey pointed out to us those areas for continuously
improving performance. As this was a benchmark study, we intend
to repeat it in the future to measure our progress in increasing
client satisfaction. <br>

<h3 align="center">Has stability finally returned to the market? </h3>

<h3 align="center"><i>by Robert A. Girondi<br>
</i></h3>

<hr>

<h3 align="center">Executive summary:</h3>

<p><i>A measure of stability has entered the market as a majority
of categories saw growth in advertising spending so far in 1996.
Pharmacy journals led the pack, dramatically reversing a
double-digit loss last year. The largest decline was registered
by nursing and radiology journals, continuing a downward trend.</i>
</p>

<hr>

<p>Are we finally beginning to see some stability in the
specialty markets? For two years in a row, five of the eight
markets reported on here have registered gains. The following
information taken from HCI's Medical Promotion Audit (MPA) shows
both the winners and the losers, as well as the major advertisers
in each of the markets covered. </p>

<p>The dramatic turnaround in medical/ surgical advertising as
reported in the September issue (see &quot;1996 HCI Midyear
Advertising Review, Happy Days Are Here Again,&quot; p. 40) was
in large part due to new product introductions. New products were
also responsible for many of the positive changes we now see in a
number of the specialty journals. Of the eight markets reviewed
here, five registered growth during the first half of 1996. This
trend is similar to that seen in the 1995 midyear summary when we
reported the first signs of a turnaround as five of the eight
markets also indicated an upturn at that time (see <i>Medical
Marketing &amp; Media</i>, Oct. 1995, &quot;Midyear 1995
Advertising Review, The Specialty Market: Signs of a
Turnaround,&quot; p. 52). </p>

<p>Spending in Pharmacy journals was clearly the bright spot
during the first half of 1996. Not only was the double-digit loss
of the year-ago period reversed, the turnaround that developed
represented a remarkable gain of almost 40 percent. At the other
end of the spectrum, Nursing and Radiology journals continued to
decline, the latter once again by double-digit numbers, while
Optometry journals turned negative after a rather strong showing
last year. Conversely, spending in the other specialty markets
reported on here (Dental, Hospital Management, Laboratory, and
Ophthalmology) continued to increase. However, each grew less
than 10 percent, and only Ophthalmology advertising exceeded the
growth achieved in the prior year-to-date period. Still, the
overall trends are an indication of stability in a majority of
these specialty markets. </p>

<p>The following pages give a brief review of each specialty
market, including the twelve largest advertisers and the twelve
most heavily promoted products/services. The tables provided show
the midyear rankings (for 1996, 1995, and 1994), share of
spending, and percent change for each company and product/service
listed. The journals audited in each market are given at the end
of the review. </p>

<p><b>Dental advertising shows marginal gain <br>
</b>Following double digit growth (12.5 percent) during the first
half 1995, advertising in Dental journals edged up only 2.9
percent in the first six months of 1996. Nine advertisers who
were in the first half 1996 top 12 also made the list in 1995.
Dentsply International continued in the number one spot (a
position it has held for three years in a row) even though
spending was reduced by 11.7 percent. The company's share (6.55
percent) is more than three times that of second place Ivoclar
North America which had 2.11 percent of all spending, following a
5.5 percent cut from first half 1995. Ultradent was third with a
2.05 percent share as spending declined by 19.0 percent. Of those
in the top five, only fourth place Henry Schein and fifth ranked
Glidewell Laboratories increased spending, each by approximately
14 percent. </p>

<p>3M Healthcare is new to this year's top 12 list following an
11.0 percent increase that resulted in a 1.55 percent share of
spending. Also new this year is Jeneric-Pentron, Inc., up from
17th to 11th on a 52.1 percent increase, and ESPE-Premier, that
moved from 20th to 12th following a 63.1 percent spending rise.
The other companies in the top 12, Den-Mat (sixth), Bisco Dental
Products (seventh), Procter &amp; Gamble (ninth), and Parkell
(tenth) all spent less during the first half 1996. </p>

<p>While there was relative stability among the top 12 companies,
there was a dramatic change in the top 12 dental products and
services as only four made both the 1996 and 1995 lists. Crest
Gum Care retained the number one position with 1.50 percent of
all expenditures even though the brand's budget was cut by 15.8
percent. Lorcet 10 moved from third to second place following a
9.0 percent spending increase while Vicodin Extra Strength
slipped from second to third after cutting expenditures by 14.6
percent. Prime &amp; Bond, which slipped from seventh to 12th,
was the only other product in the top 12 in both years. </p>

<p>Products new to the top 12 (and holding the fourth through
eleventh positions) include Easy Dent H, Denlite DM, Dyract,
Optimal, Sonicare/QP, Lynx F, Dimension/E, and Sensodyne. </p>

<p><b>Hospital Management spending rises<br>
</b>Spending in Hospital Management journals rose 9.9 percent
during the first half 1996, off somewhat from the 13.0 percent
gain recorded in the year ago period. Major shifts in promotion
continue. Only three companies in the top 12 during the first
half 1995 made the list in 1996. A similar turnover was seen
between 1995 and 1994. </p>

<p>While new to Hospital Management advertising, KPMG Peat
Marwick nevertheless entered this specialty market with a budget
large enough to capture a 1.67 percent share and the number one
spot. SMS, 457th in the year ago period, moved into second place
with a 1.32 percent share while VALIC went from 20th to third
following an 84.4 percent increase in spending. The two companies
which previously held first and second place (Kodak and DuPont)
slipped to fifth and fourth, respectively, following spending
cuts of 15.2 percent and 6.7 percent. </p>

<p>Johnson Controls jumped from 82nd to sixth, following a 203.3
percent budget increase, HBO moved into seventh (from 26th) with
a 56.2 percent boost in spending and 3M Healthcare moved into
eighth place with a 5.9 percent increase in expenditures. Nycomed
Imaging rose from 140th to ninth following a 359.6 percent budget
increase while Marshall went from 28th to tenth. Browning-Ferris
Industries was the only other company in the current list to
reduce spending (-11.0 percent), placing it 11th overall while
Spacelabs Medical moved into 12th following a 262.1 percent gain
in spending. </p>

<p>The high turnover seen at the company level was also observed
among the most heavily promoted products/services with eleven
being new to this year's top 12 list. KPMG Health
Ventures/Financial took the number one spot with a 1.11 percent
share. Novis was second while Johnson Control Services took third
and Kodak Diagnostic was fourth. None of the top four
products/services noted above were advertised last year. </p>

<p>With a 318.2 percent increase in spending, HBO &amp; Co. moved
from 123rd during the first six months 1995 to fifth in the
current period, Marshall Erdman and Associates went from 18th to
sixth following a 39.7 percent increase, while Intesys Clinical
Information Solutions (advertising for the first time) was
seventh. Eighth place HBE Medical Buildings resumed promotion
after an absence in 1995 while Amsco F Surgical Equipment
(ninth), J &amp; J Healthcare Systems (tenth), and
Transcser/Transcend Services, Inc. (12th) all had very
significant promotional increases which moved them into the top
12 listing. BFI Medical Waste Systems, dropping from sixth to
11th on a 16.5 percent spending cut, was the only other
carry-over from 1995. </p>

<p><b>Laboratory spending continues to grow<br>
</b>With a 4.8 percent increase in spending during the first half
of 1996, Laboratory journal advertising has now moved upward for
two years in a row. The first half 1995 gain was 9.3 percent. </p>

<p>Behring Diagnostics, which now includes Syva, is just
marginally ahead of Sigma Diagnostics in total spending, however
each company's share comes in at 4.35 percent. Behring reduced
spending in Laboratory journals by 46.9 percent while Sigma
increased its budget by 120.6 percent. Boehringer Mannheim
Diagnostics slipped from second to third after cutting
expenditures by 35.3 percent. Becton-Dickinson retained the
number four spot with an 18.0 percent increase in spending, Dade
International went from seventh to fifth on a 50.0 percent
increase while Johnson &amp; Johnson Clinical Diagnostics jumped
from 14th to sixth following a 112.1 percent increase. </p>

<p>Abbott Diagnostics is also new to the top 12 list this year,
going from 31st to seventh as spending went up by 183.5 percent.
Inova Diagnostics was eighth (up from eleventh last year) and
Metra Biosystems (a new advertiser this year) took ninth place.
Bayer Diagnostics (tenth), Beckman Instruments (11th), and
Olympus (12th) complete the top 12. These three companies all
reduced spending during the first half 1996 and in so doing fell
in rank when compared to the previous year ago period. </p>

<p>While there were only three new companies in the top 12, a
review of products/services shows an entirely different picture.
All are new to the list and only two advertised in 1995. Leading
the newcomers is Vistros Systems/Family of Lab Products with a
1.77 percent share followed by Dimen/ACA (1.64 percent),
Pyrilinks-D/Assay/Bone Disease (1.56 percent) and Papnet Testing
(1.40 percent). Quantalite ACA (HRP) was fifth, Cardiotrap was
sixth, and Cell-DYN 3500 Hematology Analyzer, last promoted in
1994, was seventh. </p>

<p>AU 800 Analyzer &amp; Emit System, ranked 83rd in 1995, moved
to eighth place following a 278.2 percent increase in spending.
Ektachem Analyzers from Kodak, Amelung Coagulation Analyzers and
STA Hemostasis System/Coagulation Analyzer took the ninth through
11th positions. Cardio-Rep/CK-MB Isoforms Analyzer, which
advertised in both 1994 and 1995, moved from 22nd to 12th place
following a 33.9 percent rise in spending. </p>

<p><b>Nursing in long-term decline<br>
</b>The long term spending decline in Nursing journals continued
during the first half of 1996, although the rate of decline (down
1.8 percent) was less than in the prior year ago period, which
was off 5.9 percent. </p>

<p>There was a fair degree of stability among the top nursing
advertisers with eight of the top twelve in 1995 back on the list
during the first half of 1996. The top four this year all
remained unchanged from prior year-to-date, and all except
first-ranked Florida increased spending in 1996. Florida had a
5.43 percent share followed closely by Recruitment at 5.05
percent. Third ranked Nurses Service Organization was at 3.77
percent of total spending, while California came in fourth with
2.72 percent. 3M Healthcare was new to the list this year, moving
from 20th to fifth place as spending increased by 130.0 percent. </p>

<p>Trav Corporation dropped from fifth to sixth as expenditures
were reduced by 3.8 percent, while Sherwood Medical went from
11th to 7th with a 34.4 percent budget increase. Also new this
year are Wyeth-Ayerst, moving from 17th to eighth after
increasing spending by 75.4 percent and Texas which went from
13th to ninth following a 36.1 percent jump. Johnson &amp;
Johnson's Medical Division and Colorado, ranked tenth and 11th
respectively, have now been in the top twelve for at least three
years, while Iowa makes its first appearance following a 29.0
percent increase in spending. </p>

<p>A review of the top 12 products/services being advertised
during the first half 1996 also indicates a high level of
stability when compared with the year ago period, with nine
making the list in both time periods. Of the twelve, seven deal
with recruitment, two are for liability insurance, and three
cover other products/services. Liability Insurance for Nurses
(from Nurses Service Organization) is once again number one (a
position held for over three years) as spending edged up by 3.5
percent. Army Reserve Medical/National Guard held second place
(2.63 percent share) up from fifth last year, while Travcorps
Recruitment maintained its previous third place rank even though
spending was reduced by 3.8 percent. Cross County Healthcare
Recruitment slipped from second to fourth following a 23.1
percent budget reduction, while American Mobile Nurses
Recruitment went from eighth to fifth after a 40.1 percent
spending increase. </p>

<p>The sixth and seventh ranked products/services, 3M Skin Care
Program and the Air Force Reserve, are new to the top 12 this
year. Eighth ranked Graceland College Recruitment moved up from
ninth place last year as spending increased by 31.0 percent,
Medical Express Recruitment slipped to ninth (versus seventh in
1995) following a 10.5 percent increase, while Genius Tympanic
Thermometer from Sherwood Medical maintained its former tenth
place rank with a 28.0 percent increase in expenditures.
Professional Liability Insurance dropped to 11th (from sixth)
after a 16.0 percent budget cut, while Cordarone IV from
Wyeth-Ayerst was the other new entry to the top 12 in 1996. </p>

<p><b>Ophthalmology shows good gain<br>
</b>Advertising in Ophthalmology journals grew by 7.9 percent
following a marginal gain of 1.5 percent during the first half
1995. A review of the top 12 companies (first half 1996)
indicates that eight were also in this select list in the year
ago period. A significant increase in spending on Trusopt was
responsible for Merckís move from sixth (last year) to the
number one spot in Ophthalmology journals. Merckís share of
total spending was 8.78 percent as the company increased
expenditures by 87.6 percent. As in 1995, Alcon Laboratories and
Alcon Surgical once again held the second and third place
positions while Storz Ophthalmics slipped from first place last
year to fourth following a 50.8 percent budget cut. Allergan
Medical Optics held onto fifth place even though spending was cut
by 35.2 percent. Chiron Vision was sixth (up from seventh in
1995) with a 3.36 percent share of promotion. </p>

<p>Alcon Ophthalmic, new to the top 12, took the number seven
spot following strong advertising support for Vexol Ophthalmic
Solution. Eighth place Ciba Vision Ophthalmics (unchanged in rank
from prior year) increased spending by 7.3 percent while Allergan
Pharmaceuticals, fourth in 1995, dropped to ninth after a 61.3
percent budget reduction. The remaining companies in the top 12
were all new to the list during the first half 1996. Visx
Incorporated took tenth place as a result of heavy spending on
the Star Excimer Laser System, Staar Surgical moved from 13th to
11th following a 39.7 percent increase in spending, while
Allergan Inc. moved from 17th to 12th by raising expenditures
98.1 percent. </p>

<p>As in recent years, Ophthalmology journal advertising was
again driven by a number of new products. Only four of the top 12
in the current year were on the first half 1995 list. Merckís
Trusopt Ophthalmic Solution, which ranked 11th last year, was by
far the most heavily promoted product, accounting for 6.04
percent of total expenditures. Second place went to Vexol
Ophthalmic Solution (new this year) with a 3.34 percent share.
Merck also had the third ranked product, Timoptic-XE, which
previously was number one in 1995. Following a 47.9 percent
increase in spending, Alcon Surgicalís Acrysof Acrylic Foldable
IOL moved from 14th to fourth while the Star Excimer Laser System
took fifth place. Another new entry this year was the Microstaar
Injector System (sixth) with a 1.65 percent share of total
spending. </p>

<p>Ciloxan Steril Ophthalmic Solution fell from third to seventh
following a 37.8 percent budget reduction while Healon GV and
Chiroflex were new entries which took eighth and ninth place
respectively. A 21.9 percent budget cut on Ocupress dropped the
product from fifth to tenth while the Microflow Needle from Storz
Ophthalmics, also new this year, was 11th. A big boost in
spending (259.3 percent) drove Alconís Series 2000 Legacy System
from 58th to 12th. </p>

<p><b>Optometry advertising down<br>
</b>Following good growth during the first half 1995 (+10.8
percent), spending in Optometry journals fell off by 4.9 percent
during the January-June 1996 period. </p>

<p>There was a high degree of company and product movement
relative to Optometry journal advertising as evidenced by the
fact that only five companies, and three products in the top
twelve from 1995, made the current top 12 lists. The one area of
stability on the company side is Sola Optical USA which has held
the number one spot for three years in a row. Sola accounted for
5.89 percent of total promotion after increasing spending by 41.0
percent. New to the list is Ciba Vision Ophthalmics which moved
from 14th to second following a 96.3 percent increase. The next
three have been in the top twelve for the last three years.
Safilo moved from ninth to third on a 65.0 percent increase in
expenditures, Hart Specialties went from seventh to fourth with
an 18.6 percent gain in spending, while Marchon Eyeware dropped
from second to fifth after a 34.6 percent budget cut. Bausch
&amp; Lomb Pharmaceutical Products went from 28th to sixth and
Carrera from 45th to seventh following increases of 68.4 percent
and 151.4 percent respectively. </p>

<p>Brain Power Inc., the last of the companies to make the top 12
in both 1995 and 1996, slipped from fourth to eighth after
cutting advertising by 32.8 percent. Wesley-James jumped from
26th to ninth on a 52.6 percent spending increase, Transitions
Optical from 19th to tenth (up 29.9 percent), Nassau Vision
Group, 20th to 11th (up 27.9 percent) and Seiko Optical Products,
67th to 12th following a 260.7 percent increase. </p>

<p>Of the nine new products in the top 12, five did not advertise
at all in the first half 1995 while four did. VIP Gold from Sola
Optical USA took first place, up from 482nd as the product's
share of advertising reached 2.94 percent. Bausch &amp; Lombís
Renu Multi Purpose Solution moved from 27th to second on a 165.3
percent increase while Hart Specialty Frames maintained the third
place ranking achieved last year. Transition Lightweight Plastic
Lenses slipped from fifth to fourth this year even as spending
increased by 25.0 percent. The second largest gain from a
previously promoted product was Safilo Eyeglass Frames, from
304th to fifth. </p>

<p>The next four products are newly promoted entries which
include Varilux Comfort Lenses (sixth), Boston Simplicity
Solution (seventh), Essilor Natural Lenses (eighth), and Nassau
Contact Lenses (ninth). Single Vision High Index Lenses from Sola
Optical USA dropped from number one last year to tenth following
a 48.0 percent budget cut. A 62.2 percent spending increase took
Vistakon Disposable Contacts/1 Day from 33rd to 11th, while
Hydron Biomedics Disposable Contacts from Ocular Sciences was
12th after not promoting at all during the first half 1995. </p>

<p><b>Pharmacy spending has big gain<br>
</b>Pharmacy journal advertising jumped 39.4 percent during the
first half of 1996. This dramatic increase follows a 16.8 percent
decline in spending in the year ago period. Clearly, new product
introductions (both Rx and OTC entries) are the driving force
behind the first half gain. </p>

<p>Of the top twelve companies, five are new to the list in 1996
and only one of them, Glaxo Wellcome, reduced Pharmacy journal
advertising. An 83.3 percent increase in spending put
Wyeth-Ayerst back into the number one spot, a position last held
in 1994. In the year ago period, the company ranked fifth. Merck
jumped from 32nd to second after increasing advertising by 300.8
percent. Hoechst Marion Roussel moved from fourth to third, while
Pfizer slipped from second to fourth. Glaxo Wellcome, number one
last year, dropped to fifth after cutting expenditures by 24.0
percent. Bayer Pharmaceuticals moved from eighth to sixth,
primarily on the strength of their new diabetes preparation,
Precose, which was heavily promoted. </p>

<p>Sandoz, new to the top 12 this year, jumped from 20th to
seventh after the introduction and promotion of Miacalcin Nasal
Spray. Lifescan went from 12th to eighth following a 69.2 percent
increase in spending, while Watson Laboratories, Inc., also new
to this yearís list, took ninth. Whitehall Labs moved up from
13th to tenth with a 69.4 percent increase in expenditures, while
Janssen Pharmaceutica slipped from ninth to 11th and Roche
dropped from sixth to 12th. </p>

<p>Eight products made the top 12 for the first time during the
January-June 1996 period, and of them, six were new to the
market. Precose was number one with a 1.23 percent share of all
Pharmacy journal advertising, while Pepcid AC, from Johnson &amp;
Johnson-Merck Consumer, took second place with a 1.15 percent
share of spending. Merckís new entry, Fosamax, was third, while
Cardizem CD dropped from seventh to fourth even though
advertising was increased by 54.9 percent. Mylan
Pharmaceuticalís Diff Co. Ad slipped from third to fifth while
Forestís new calcium channel blocker, Tiazac, was sixth. </p>

<p>Miacalcin Nasal Spray was seventh with 0.91 percent of all
journal advertising and Synthroid with increased spending of
238.4 percent climbed from 70th to eighth. A 23.6 percent
reduction in advertising for Lifescan's 1 Touch Test Strips
resulted in the product dropping from number one last year to
ninth in the current period. Valtrex and Renova, new products
from Glaxo Wellcome and Ortho Pharmaceuticals took tenth and 11th
place, respectively. Rounding out the list was Adalat CC, which
dropped from second to 12th after a 22.5 percent budget cut. </p>

<p><b>Radiology continues to lose<br>
</b>Spending in Radiology journals fell by 16.4 percent during
the first half of 1996. This loss comes on top of a 10.4 percent
decline last year. </p>

<p>Eight of the companies included in the top 12 during the first
half 1995 made the list in the current period. Siemens Medical
Systems was again the number one company as it has been for three
years in a row. Siemens' share of total spending in radiology
journals was 5.05 percent even though it reduced spending by 33.0
percent. Bracco was second, unchanged in rank from the year ago
period. Lorad, which did not promote in the two previous
six-month periods was third. Mallincrodtís 4.7 percent increase
in spending was sufficient to move from fifth to fourth, while
Nycomed, Inc. slipped from third to fifth. Fujisawa, which
accounted for 3.55 percent of radiology advertising, climbed from
70th to sixth following a large increase in spending. </p>

<p>Hitachi also moved up, from 12th to seventh, after increasing
expenditures by 27.1 percent. Another newcomer to the top 12 was
Cordis Corp., which went from 28th to eighth on a 300.8 percent
increase. Acuson dropped from seventh to ninth, while Kodak took
the number 10 spot (from 13th last year). Fuji Medical Systems
USA slipped from tenth to 11th, and Toshiba from sixth to 12th
following budget cuts of 17.7 percent and 43.1 percent,
respectively. </p>

<p>While there was a fair degree of stability among the top 12
companies, this was not the case at the product level as nine of
the top 12 were either new products or did not make the list in
either 1994 or 1995. The Lorad M-IV Mammography System took first
place with 4.32 percent of total spending. Optiray jumped from
22nd to second following a 242.3 percent budget increase, and
Adenoscan, a new entry from Fujisawa, was third. Prohance
Gadoteridol Injection from Bracco slipped from second to fourth
after an 18.3 percent reduction in spending, while the new Airis
MR Imaging System from Hitachi was fifth. With a 10.7 percent
increase in spending, Bennett's Contour Mammography System moved
from ninth to sixth. </p>

<p>Diagnostics from Kodak, promoted for the first time in the
current period, was seventh, while Omniscan Injection moved up
from 12th to eighth. A 255.9 percent spending increase for Palmaz
drove the product from 57th to ninth. Another newcomer, the
Sonoline Elegra Ultra Sound System from Siemens was tenth. The
Quicklinx Workstation from Dupont jumped from 107th last year to
11th after a 426.7 percent increase in spending, while the
Gyroscan NT Series MR <br>
System climbed from 25th to 12th after a 30.6 percent gain in
spending. <br>

<title>The Industry Clash Over PBM Ownership</title>

Industry Clash</h1>

<h3 align="center"><i>by Jan Hodnett<br>

<hr>

<h3 align="center">Executive summary:</h3>

<p><i>The ownership of PBMs by pharmaceutical companies has
raised serious questions about regulation and marketing tactics.
The questions of whether drug companies have shielded themselves
from public scrutiny and raised unfair commercial barriers to
competition are under advisement at the FDA. Some in the industry
see big winners and losers if and when word comes down from
Washington.</i> </p>

<hr>

<p>As managed care has dramatically changed the face of
healthcare, it has also shaken up the accepted way of doing
things in marketing and promotion. If that has led industry
executives to take stock and make radical departures, it has also
caused the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be concerned
about the impact of pharmaceutical manufacturers expanding into
areas of business that control the dispensing of prescription
drugs, particularly through the acquisition of Pharmacy Benefit
Management companies (PBMs). </p>

<p>To help it decide whether new regulations are needed, the FDA
held a public hearing on &quot;Pharmaceutical Marketing and
Information Exchange in Managed Care Environments.&quot; The
intent was to gather information on drug marketing and promotion
in this new forum. Of particular interest to the FDA is the
pharmacoeconomic data and other information being distributed by
PBMs, particularly those allied with a pharmaceutical
manufacturer. Traditional promotional materials produced by
pharmaceutical companies are covered by FDA regulations, but
cost-effectiveness claims disseminated by PBMs to managed care
providers are not. The broader question is whether
industry-affiliated PBMs are making claims that the parent
company legally cannot. This situation has led to a public feud
between the pharmaceutical companies that own PBMs and those that
don't. </p>

<p><b>Two-tier marketing system<br>
</b>Stephen Stefano, vice president and general manager of the
health management division of Glaxo Wellcome, Inc., expressed the
frustration of companies that have no PBM affiliates. As he told
the conference, his company represents the &quot;purest&quot;
prototype, since it does not own health maintenance organizations
(HMOs), PBMs, or mail order pharmacies. &quot;In general,
everything we communicate about our products is regulated by the
FDA and every time we communicate about our products we identify
ourselves as Glaxo Wellcome. We strongly believe that all drug
manufacturers should be treated equally with regard to the claims
they communicate about their products. This is true whether the
claims are communicated directly by a drug manufacturer or
indirectly through its subsidiary business, such as a PBM company
or mail order pharmacy. This equal treatment does not require a
change in the law, an extension of FDA's enforcement policies, or
issuance of new guidelines. It simply involves the application of
agency principles, which FDA and other governmental departments
have traditionally invoked.&quot; </p>

<p>Stefano added that the FDA has concentrated solely on
regulating promotion issued by drug manufacturers, and has not
addressed the promotion for these same products when issued by
the subsidiary businesses owned by drug manufacturers. &quot;We
have seen manufacturer-owned PBMs and mail order pharmacies make
cost-effectiveness claims, and superior efficacy and safety
claims about the manufacturers' products, which the manufacturers
themselves would not be allowed to make under current application
of FDA regulation. This puts manufacturers who are committed to
abide by FDA rules, like Glaxo Wellcome, at a competitive
disadvantage. For example, we are aware of manufacturer-owned PBM
companies that issue letters to doctors stating that our product
is less cost-effective or less efficacious than the parent
manufacturer's product. These claims are insupportable and the
manufacturer would not be able to make them directly. This puts a
company like Glaxo Wellcome in a disadvantaged position,&quot;
said Stefano. </p>

<p>&quot;There should be a presumption that a subsidiary owned by
a drug manufacturer is controlled by the manufacturer. This
control should make the manufacturer accountable for the
subsidiary's communications about the manufacturer's products.
This presumption may be overcome only by clear proof that the
subsidiary is run independently from the manufacturer's interest
in promoting its products. We are not asking for more regulation.
Rather we believe that FDA regulations should be applied
evenhandedly to manufacturers and manufacturer-owned pharmacy
management subsidiaries such as PBMs and mail order
business,&quot; he concluded. </p>

<p>Another speaker, Juliet Goodfriend, president of Strategic
Marketing Corporation, Bala Cynwyd, Pa., was surprised when the
FDA did not ask Stefano any questions. &quot;It seems quite
logical to me that he is absolutely right. I don't have evidence
that he is right, but it makes sense given the structure of PBMs
and their ability to interact with physicians and pharmacists. In
this role, they communicate information about drugs and
therapeutic or generic substitutability, which if it were coming
from a drug company would come under the aegis of an FDA review.
It's a very muddled area.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Do PBMs market products?<br>
</b>Medco Containment Services, Inc., the pharmacy benefit
management division of Merck, counters that Medco does not market
pharmaceuticals. It provides pharmacy benefit management services
to its clients, who contract for these services in order to help
them lower their overall healthcare costs and improve the health
of those to whom they provide benefits. &quot;They do not
contract with us so that we can 'market' pharmaceuticals to
them,&quot; Kevin Colgan, a Merck spokesperson, told <i>Medical
Marketing &amp; Media</i> when asked to comment on this issue. </p>

<p>He was echoing the defense of Per Lofberg, President of Medco,
who told the conference, &quot;To retain customers and win new
ones, providers of managed pharmaceutical services do not and
cannot act or communicate on behalf of pharmaceutical
manufacturers or any other provider of healthcare goods or
services. We do not sell pharmaceuticals; we provide our
customers with a service, which is prescription benefits
management. The market for managed pharmaceutical services is
highly competitive and the sophisticated buyers and consultants
who purchase these services work aggressively to ensure that the
providers of such services bring the greatest possible benefits
to plan sponsors. If plan sponsors, or their consultants,
perceive that a managed care provider is not acting in the best
interest of the plan sponsor, they have ample opportunity to
correct the situation by choosing another provider. Both Merck
and Medco are acutely aware of this market dynamic, and we have
taken specific steps to preserve Medco's independence from
Merck.&quot; </p>

<p>Lofberg maintains that Medco does provide formulary management
programs to help clients increase their savings. &quot;In these
programs, we inform physicians that a patient's health plan has
adopted a formulary and that the plan will realize overall
savings if a generic or a particular branded drug is appropriate
and can be prescribed for that patient. In addition to these
programs, we also provide clients and healthcare providers with
information and guidelines relating to prescription drug use. All
drugs on Medco's formularies, including Merck's, continue to be
reviewed by an independent pharmacy and therapeutics committee.
No one from Merck or Medco, or from any other manufacturer,
serves on that P&amp;T committee. Medco operated independently
before its acquisition by Merck, and we continue to operate this
way today.&quot; </p>

<p><b>PBM subsidiaries scrutinized for bias<br>
</b>Elizabeth Dichter, executive vice president of PCS Health
Systems, a subsidiary of Eli Lilly, offered <br>
a similar response, saying that PCS has developed self-regulatory
mechanisms involving communication and education to physicians.
&quot;Significant safeguards and checks and balances already
exist. PCS and its customers agree on the formulary and preferred
drugs used with every single physician and patient. The
pharmacists who intervene on behalf of PCS and the managed care
plans are compensated by the savings that the payers receive. As
an agent of the health plan, PCS discloses information to its
customers, who in turn inform its members and pharmacists about
the drugs deemed most cost-effective and recommended for
use.&quot; </p>

<p>Dichter points out that their customers &quot;already have
tremendous knowledge and expertise about health care and how to
promote improvements in health services delivery. They
aggressively compare the relative effectiveness of various
managed care systems, including PBMs. This competitive
environment is quick to unmask self-serving or lesser value
products and services. Special attention is given to those drugs
that are manufactured by the parent companies of the PBMs. PCS
welcomes this scrutiny. Our processes for developing and
implementing formulary and clinical interventions are peer
reviewed by major academic institutions, consultants, our
customers' medical staffs and P&amp;T committees, and through the
competitive process itself. PCS does not switch drugs on behalf
of any manufacturers.&quot; </p>

<p>To demonstrate PCS's objectivity, Dichter stresses that in an
overwhelming number of cases, &quot;the first drug of choice is a
generic drug, if it is clinically equivalent. In the PCS
preferred drug list, for example, there is no branded Lilly
anti-biotic anywhere on the list.&quot; </p>

<p><b>APhA disagrees<br>
</b>Calvin Knowlton, speaking for the American Pharmaceutical
Association (APhA), contends that some PBMs have engaged in
&quot;switch&quot; programs, which seek to persuade physicians to
switch either to generic or branded products available at a lower
price than alternative products. &quot;These are marketing
programs, not pharmaceutical care. Pharmaceutical care is a
pharmacist working with a patient and that patient's other
caregivers to ensure that an optimal health outcome is achieved.
Managed care organizations, which include PBMs, cannot be
regarded as models of clinical objectivity. Some are committed to
one manufacturer's drug product over another's and many are
ambivalent about spending their limited capitation revenue on
costly new therapies. The fundamental problem is a dearth of
objective comparative information on drug products. The optimal
solution to this problem is to ensure that this fight is
conducted under fair rules governing both sides.&quot; </p>

<p>Knowlton says that APhA has samples of letters sent out by
PBMs that they say are examples of &quot;switching&quot; or
marketing by PBMs to physicians and pharmacists and their
patients. Knowlton and the APhA believe that PBMs under either a
contractual or ownership relationship with a manufacturer should
be subject to the same standards as a manufacturers'
communication to doctors and pharmacists. &quot;Manufacturers'
agents should not be permitted to assert claims that the
manufacturers themselves cannot legally assert,&quot; says
Knowlton. </p>

<p><b>Third-party comments<br>
</b>Since the positions of PBM-owning vs. non-owning companies
are fairly predictable, it's worth examining the comments of
outside observers. </p>

<p>A few weeks after the FDA conference, the General Accounting
Office (GAO) reported that more Merck products have gained entry
to Medco's formulary since Merck acquired Medco Containment
Services, while lower-cost competitors of Merck products have
been dropped from their formulary. In their assessment, Medco's
formulary appeared to favor Merck products when compared to the
formulary of another PBM, SmithKline Beecham's DPS, whose
formulary did not seem to favor parent-company SmithKline Beecham
products. </p>

thinks we have to ask what effect pharmaceutical-owned PBMs are
having on competitiveness in the marketplace. &quot;One of the
hallmarks of a competitive market is that it helps to moderate
prices for the consumer. That isn't necessarily what has happened
in the pharmaceutical marketplace. When the PBMs were growing in
influence in the late 1980's to early 1990s, they were having an
impact and forcing drug companies to compete on price and value.
But when the three largest PBMs were bought out by pharmaceutical
companies, it took pressure off the companies that own those
PBMs. They can be pretty sure that they will get their own share
of the current market. We know that Merck's share of the Medco
business has increased and despite the GAO report's findings,
it's too early to know if SmithKline's ownership of DPS will have
an effect on the DPS formulary. I wouldn't necessarily draw the
conclusion that it hasn't had an effect. At the time of the
study, it was too early to expect an effect.&quot; </p>

<p>Schondelmeyer adds, &quot;We are in the worst possible market
in terms of competition because major players are significantly
disadvantaged for structural reasons that have nothing to do with
the quality of their product or the value that they deliver. When
drug manufacturers market their drugs, they have very specific
limitations on what they can say about their pharmaceutical
product. The 'old' model of drug company operates under specific
FDA-defined limitations on marketing and promotion, while
pharmacy-benefit management firms are able to make
representations about drugs to physicians, employer groups, and
patients that are not limited by FDA marketing and advertising
criteria. PBMs can not only discuss other companies' products
beyond FDA labeling; they can talk about their own products
beyond labeling. In effect, a PBM gives a drug company a way to
circumvent part of the FDA supervision of their marketing.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;What is clear,&quot; Schondelmeyer concludes, &quot;is
that we have a marketplace where pharmaceutical companies have
very different positions because some own PBMs, and some don't. A
PBM determines the choice of products on their formulary and make
representations to physicians about which products should be used
in specific situations, so it gets down to semantics as to what
you want to call promoting. You can technically argue that it is
not advertising, because they do not advertise the product, but
their business is influencing the choice of drugs and that in my
view is one form of promotion. I'm not saying that is right or
wrong, the major point is that it creates a marketplace with two
different positions. One group is prohibited from doing things
that another group, through their PBM arm, can now do.
Legislation may be required to either loosen FDA requirements on
drug companies to match that of PBMs, or to tighten them and hold
PBMs to the same promotional standards as drug companies. Or the
standard for both can be changed to something in between. The
government must determine what the level of marketing standard
will be. Since we have a law right now that allows this two-tier
system, I don't think voluntary industry standards will work. The
most critical thing is to get a common standard, wherever it is.
That would be a better, fairer, more competitive marketplace than
what we have right now.&quot; </p>

<p>For its part, the FDA is reviewing the information presented
at the hearing (or was at press time). An FDA spokesperson told <i>MM&amp;M</i>
that a ruling on whether to regulate pharmacoeconomic claims by
PBMs has a high priority, but couldn't or wouldn't offer insight
on what that decision is likely to be. That leaves the contending
parties in this industry feud wondering whether new regulations
will be enacted or not, and if so who will have to bite the
bullet. The one thing both parties have in common is that they
have high stakes in the outcome. <br>

<H3 align="center"><CENTER>Executive summary: </CENTER></H3>
<P>
Acquiring older drugs from larger companies was the avenue Roberts
took to earn profits needed to develop and market their own products.
They will continue on this path, although worthwhile &quot;revivable&quot;
drugs will be getting scarce. </P>
<HR>
<P>
<I><B>Just as understory vegetation thrives in the shelter of
giant sequoias, so niche marketers coexist happily with - and
even benefit from - multinational mega-companies. In this, the
third and last of our series examining niche strategies, Medical
Marketing &amp; Media interviews Robert Loy, vice president and
chief operating officer of Roberts Pharmaceutical</B>.</P></I>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>To start us off, give us a snapshot
of your company.</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy: </B></I>Roberts was started over 10 years ago and it
was built by reviving old, mature products. We have a salesforce
of about 200. We are marketing a substantial number of products,
with two awaiting approval by the FDA. These two will be the first
on our roster to have been developed by our own R &amp; D. Up
to now, all the products we have marketed were mature products
we took over from other companies. Their overall growth from the
baseline when we started marketing them has averaged 25 percent.
To achieve those results, we use all the classic promotion techniques
- personal selling, journal advertising, direct mail, convention
displays, grand rounds, speaker programs - you name it. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I> <I>Reading your product listing in Physicians'
Desk Reference is an exercise in nostalgia: Cheracol, Eminase,
Colace, Pro-Banthine, Salutensin, Tigan, to name just a few &#133;
a rollcall of golden oldies that we thought had disappeared.</I>
</P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy:</B></I><B> </B>Well, they're back and thriving, and
they produced the funds to get us going and to support our own
research. Roberts was started as a clinical research organization
by Dr. Robert Vukovich, our chairman, using his own money, mortgaging
his house and selling his sailboat. As he began to pick up products
that were no longer being marketed, he was able to generate the
revenues that enabled him to form an organization, build a salesforce,
initiate clinical trials, and extend operations to Canada and
the United Kingdom. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>All with products everyone else
had given up on. Did Dr. Vukovich have experience in the pharmaceutical
industry?</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy:</B></I><B> </B>He had run what was then Squibb's clinical
research for many years, and then went to Revlon Healthcare. But
he was definitely a scientist, not a marketer. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>You were at Squibb, too?</P></I>
<P>
<I><B>Loy: </B></I>I spent about 27 years with Squibb and joined
Roberts a little over three years ago. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>Some of your fellow niche marketers
whom we've interviewed for this series indicated that today's
market creates special opportunities for companies like yours.
Do you agree?</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy:</B></I><B> </B>Definitely. One of the major reasons
is mergers. We picked up many products from Bristol-Myers Squibb
after their merger, as well as from other giant pharmaceutical
companies. What happens is that once they examine the total product
line after they merge, they find that some products do not fit
their strategic plan. Another reason is that big as they are,
their salesforce can only handle so much, so that as new products
emerge from their own pipeline, they can't market them, and so
they find it advantageous to divest them. I even know of several
cases where companies had actually licensed a product in, but
then their strategic plan changed and we were able to pick up
some of those products, in a sense as the sublicensee. </P>
<P>
A good example of the way it works is Noroxin, our most recent
product acquisition. Noroxin is a broad-spectrum antibacterial
agent that we picked up from Merck. Noroxin sales had been falling,
so Merck had stopped promoting it. That is often the pattern with
big companies: they give up on a product and stop promotion, but
don't divest themselves of it for a year or two, so they can continue
to milk it. A giant like Merck simply doesn't find it worth its
while to bother with small products. They have products with far
more potential to put their resources behind. But as sales keep
declining, they eventually are willing to hand such products over
to a company like ours, and in the first nine months after we
acquired it we were able to reverse its decline. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>How do you find out about such
opportunities?</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy:</B></I><B> </B>Often it is because Dr. Vukovich and
I, as well as many of our top executives, have all spent many
years in the industry and know a lot of people. Also, Roberts
has gained a reputation for being able to revive mature products,
and larger companies know that. Over the years, we have done business
with about 30 of the largest companies, including not only BMS
and Merck, but also American Home Products, Bayer, Procter &amp;
Gamble, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, SmithKline Beecham, and Ortho.
That wasn't true in the beginning, of course. We got our start
because of Dr. Vukovich's connections. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>And your company was one of
the first to develop this strategy. What are your criteria for
judging whether a product is viable for revival?</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy: </B></I>To answer the first part of your question,
yes, Roberts and what was then Marion were the pioneers. </P>
<P>
As for our criteria, there are several factors that go into our
pursuing a product. First of all, our long-term objective is to
develop and market products of our own research: picking up mature
products is really just a means to an end. So the first criterion
is that we attempt to find products that match the six or so therapeutic
areas in our R&amp;D pipeline. That way our representatives are
calling on and getting to know doctors who will be key to our
success when we launch our own products. </P>
<P>
Second, we look for what you might call &quot;evergreen products&quot;
- those that scientifically make as much sense now as when they
were new. They can't be products that have been surpassed by newer
agents, but what we find is that often the improvements of the
newer products over the older ones might, on a yardstick, measure
about an eighth of an inch. </P>
<P>
Third, we look at the history of these products and from our own
marketing and sales experience try to determine whether they are
likely to respond to promotion. While we do some testing, we mostly
rely on the expertise of our marketing and sales departments.
They have very heavy experience and know lots of people, and while
we're not always right, I'd say that 90 percent of the products
we've picked up have been winners. </P>
<P>
And, finally, we prefer niche products, those that are used primarily
by specialists, and the smaller the specialty the better. With
a salesforce our size it would be difficult to promote a product
to a broad audience such as, say, all internists. However, over
the years we have gone through phases, and we have licensed some
higher volume products such as Noroxin, which are used not only
by specialists but also by GPs and FPs. In such cases we call
not only on the specialists - urologists in the case of Noroxin
- but also on high-prescribing primary care physicians. The same
principle applies to our cardiovascular products: we stick pretty
well to cardiologists. We simply can't call on all internists.
</P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>Marketing rights can be won
by licensing arrangements or outright acquisition. What method
do you use?</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy: </B></I>Whatever it takes. We really don't have a preference.
If you buy a product, of course, you get to keep the profits.
But if you make an arrangement whereby you split the profits or
pay a license fee, it has the advantage that you don't have to
put up a lot of money up front. </P>
<P>
No two situations are ever exactly alike, and that is also true
of how you promote a product. For example, if you take over a
product that still has significant sales and isn't declining too
fast, you may want to make a quick decision to acquire it and
then sit back and figure out how to improve the strategy. But
if a product isn't being promoted at all, you may want to take
your time before you start negotiations and figure out whether
there's a novel approach to marketing this drug &#133; whether
there is something special you can do to bring it back to life.
</P>
<P>
A good example would be Nitrodisc, a nitroglycerine patch. All
the competitors were claiming how wonderfully thin and little
their patches are, while Nitrodisc is fairly large and thick and
was losing market share. So with everyone else promoting small,
thin and transparent, we decided to promote the fact that ours
is thicker, bigger and not transparent, and therefore excellent
for people with poor eyesight, people with arthritis and the elderly
- anyone who might have problems handling something so tiny and
hard to see. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM:M:</B></I><B> </B><I>That's a tactic that's been called
taking a lemon and making it into lemonade.</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy:</B></I><B> </B>We have also taken prescription products
that had been promoted solely to physicians and begun to promote
them strictly through pharmacists. We did this first with Norethin,
our norethindrone and mestranol contraceptive tablets. We developed
a program called Pharmacounsel which helps pharmacists to explain
our products to patients, and which we have since then used for
several other of our branded generics. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>How do you price your generics?</I>
</P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy:</B></I><B> </B>Reasonably. That is to say, at a slight
premium, but still low enough to be competitive. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>Let me ask a devil's advocate
question. Since you are so successful with reviving products that
are generally considered dead or dying, why do you still pursue
the introduction of products you are developing yourself? Isn't
that much riskier and more expensive?</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy:</B></I><B> </B>Remember that the whole objective of
taking on old products was to make enough profit to build the
infrastructure we needed to market our own products. Also, when
Dr. Vukovich started out he was able to pick up at very good terms
some products of other people's research that were ready for clinical
trials but they didn't want to pursue. In other words, we were
not taking the risk of the initial research; we were taking compounds
that were already something of a known quantity and investing
in the Phase I through III development. </P>
<P>
Two of these products are with FDA right now awaiting final approval.
One <BR>
is for hypotension, that is for low blood pressure; the other
for the production of platelets. There is no approved drug for
either of these indications. We hope to get one or both of these
on the market by the time this article appears. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>Having a market all to yourself
is the nicest niche of all &#133; Let's conclude with a general
question: as the large companies get ever larger, do you see your
type of niche marketing as a growing field?</I> </P>
<P>
<I><B>Loy</B></I><B>: </B>Well, there is only a certain number
of products that are worthwhile trying to revive, so there's room
for only so many. I don't think we have reached the saturation
point yet, but we may be getting close. </P>
<P>
There are other limiting factors as well. You have to be of a
certain size yourself to be of interest to large companies. If
you have only 25 or 30 reps, unless you specialize in a really
small niche, who would want to entrust you with their product?
Also, look at the risk when you get started. In some cases we
have taken on drugs that were declining at a rate of 20 percent
a year. If you can reverse that trend, that's great. Even if you
can't stop it altogether and reduce the decline to five percent
a year, you might still be able to make a profit. But it doesn't
always work. As I mentioned, we have about a 90 percent success
rate, which is fine for us but can be fatal if you're just starting
up. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>For the future, then, you see
yourself continuing to look for mature products you can jump-start
into new life, while also pushing your own R&amp;D.</P></I> 
<P>
<I><B>Loy:</B></I><B> </B>Right. With one footnote. Once one of
our own products is approved, we may find that our own plate is
getting kind of full, and we may want to bump something we're
now promoting. </P>
<P>
<I><B>MM&amp;M:</B></I><B> </B><I>Which would open up an opportunity
for someone else to follow your pattern - sort of a food chain
in reverse. Thank you so much for the insight you've given us
into a highly specialized - and successful - type of niche marketing.

<h1 align="center">DEMYSTIFYING MANAGED CARE MARKET RESEARCH </h1>

<h3 align="center"><i>by Connie Perla<br>
</i></h3>

<hr>

<h3 align="center">Executive summary:</h3>

<p><i>Market research is able to supply sophisticated information
affecting brand marketing in a managed care environment.It serves
several important needs: understanding the dynamics of brand
performance, assessing the impact of managed care on the
marketplace, and evaluating the effectiveness of brand or
portfolio promotion.</i> </p>

<hr>

<p>By the late 1980s, managed care was largely the responsibility
of the sales group. This segment was ignored by market research.
In fact, in many companies, there was no one in market research
assigned this responsibility ó market research focused on
physicians and their decision process. Data sources that were
initially developed on managed care were tactical in nature.
These sources focused on profiling managed care organizations
(MCOs), such as identifying names of medical and pharmacy
directors, providing enrollment information, and determining the
type of health maintenance organization (HMO). This information
assisted managed care sales representatives in their targeting. </p>

<p>All that changed in the 1990s as pharmaceutical companies
witnessed the tremendous growth in HMO enrollment and the
influence of these organizations on drug utilization. Pharmacy
Benefit Management companies (PBMs) became more powerful,
oftentimes not only impacting the pharmacy benefits provided by
an MCO, but also affecting drug utilization on the indemnity
portion of the market. Initially, pharmaceutical companies relied
heavily on consultants to gain an understanding of the dynamics
of this market. Market research did not have the internal
expertise in this area. </p>

<p>As managed care continued to increase, market research
received more and more requests for information. As a result,
positions responsible for managed care market research were
created. There was also a proliferation of data sources which
helped to legitimize the market researcher's role in this area.
Among the most important pieces of information requested is the
source of a brand's or company's business, and whether it is in
cash, third party, or Medicaid. Market research analysts have
been very resourceful in combining these pieces of information
with internal data and other sources (non-retail data) to gain an
overall picture of the sources of a brand's business. As market
research becomes more sophisticated in this area, we have been
able to overlay such information as to whether an HMO or PBM
controls the pharmaceutical benefit and its impact on the sales
of a brand. </p>

<p>The availability of this kind of information has produced
several important results: brand managers can determine what
portion of their brand's business is under the influence of
managed care and government; we now have the ability to track the
growth/decline of a brand in different segments; and the
broadening of the definition of managed care to encompass any
customer which impacts the utilization of pharmaceuticals. (In
addition to HMO/PPOs, &quot;managed care&quot; may also include
PBMs, government, employers, providers of long term care, and
federal and non-federal hospitals.) </p>

<p>These factors have resulted in an increased need for market
research in understanding the various customer segments beyond
the physician. Several types of market research needs have
emerged:<br>
1. Understanding the dynamics of brand performance in managed
care.<br>
2. Assessing the impact of managed care on the pharmaceutical
marketplace.<br>
3. Evaluating the effectiveness of various strategies for a brand
or a portfolio of products in managed care. </p>

<p><b>Understanding performance dynamics<br>
</b>As with the physician segment of the marketplace, a global
picture of the various influences of managed care on a brand's
performance must be developed. As discussed earlier, a
&quot;customer mix&quot; analysis for the brand should be
reviewed. Trends should be identified as to whether the brand is
losing or gaining share in each segment as well as the overall
importance of each segment to the brand's business. Level and
types of promotion to pharmacy directors of your product vs. the
competition should be tracked. The percent of HMOs where your
product is on formulary and/or preferred status vs. the
competition should be reviewed. Linking detailing efforts of your
product vs. competitors to doctors with varying levels of HMO
affiliation should be determined. </p>

<p>As with &quot;traditional&quot; market research, the analyst
must use secondary resources to understand what is happening with
your brand and therapeutic category in the managed care
marketplace. Based on analysis of secondary data, primary
research maybe needed to determine the reasons for a brand's
performance within a segment, and how to position and price a
product to gain acceptance by MCOs. Market research may also be
called upon to evaluate value-added programs and other tactics to
MCOs. </p>

<p>Market researchers will for the most part have to rely on
qualitative research for answers. Because of the small sample
size of MCOs, analysts must move away from the comfort of relying
on large quantitative studies as are done with the physician
audience. There are only about 650 MCOs, with 150 of them
accounting for 80 percent of total membership. Additionally,
there are only 15 PBMs. Decisions will generally have to be made
based on a sample of 20 to 30 interviews. For these reasons,
selecting the &quot;right&quot; organizations to talk to is of
utmost importance. Parameters to consider in the sample design
include:<br>
1. Membership.<br>
2. MCO Type: staff model, IPA, network, group, mixed models.<br>
3. Level of formulary control.<br>
4. Target audience (i.e., medical director, pharmacy director, or
other personnel)<br>
5. Future marketplace &quot;winners.&quot;<br>
The number of lives covered by an MCO is obviously important,
especially as more consolidation occurs. However, covered lives
should not be the only criterion. Even more important is the
level of formulary control or the ability to drive market share.
Initially, many companies have looked at model type as a measure
for formulary control with staff model exerting the greatest
control and IPAs with looser controls. Oftentimes, this is not
the case anymore. With POS technology, many IPAs have been able
to exert tight controls of their formularies. Within an MCO,
there may be different offerings, ranging from no control for
certain members to very high control for other members. This
depends on the requirements of the customer (i.e., the employer,
the government). </p>

<p>Generally, the pattern of drug utilization (i.e., brand
preference, use of generics vs. brand) in low control MCO will
behave for the most part like the fee-for-service segment. There
are currently tools which help in understanding the level of
formulary control. Pharmacy directors can also be queried on the
types of controls placed on member physicians (i.e., capitation
arrangement, withholds, drug utilization reviews, mandatory
generic substitution). The tougher part is determining the
percent of the members in an MCO under tight formulary control.
During the interview, the researcher must assess the number of
plans in the MCO and the controls on drug utilization placed on
each. The controls a pharmacy director is talking about may refer
to only one plan with the other plans differing widely. </p>

<p>The selection of the target audience in a managed care
organization is important. The target for the interview is
frequently the pharmacy director because he or she is critical in
deciding whether to add or delete a drug from the formulary.
Sometimes, interviewing the medical director is of value
especially in the evaluation of different treatment options for a
given diagnosis. It is important to note that the roles of
players in the distribution and reimbursement channels are
continually evolving. For example, some chain pharmacies are
implementing their own formularies and are beginning to act like
PBMs. It is critical for the market researcher to understand the
interaction of the distribution and reimbursement channels and
how the interplay will impact the drug that the patient
ultimately receives. </p>

<p>Future &quot;winners&quot; in the marketplace may be another
criterion for sample selection. These MCOs may be emerging
leaders in the marketplace, perhaps because of the level of
integration or being on the leading edge of disease management or
technology. Talking to these organizations may help form
predictions as to what might happen several years down the road. </p>

<p>As with physician interviews, screeners and secondary sources
should be utilized to identify the pharmacy/medical directors you
want to interview. During the beginning of the interview, again
similar to physician interviews, basic background information
should be obtained to help understand the perspective of the
interviewee. Background information could include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>level of MCO penetration in area (level of competition). </li>
    <li>ability to control pharmaceutical benefit (may need to
        refer to a specific plan within the MCO). </li>
    <li>therapeutic areas where cost controls are focused. </li>
    <li>patient demographics(Medicare and Medicaid population). </li>
    <li>level of integration(separate budgets for each
        department?). </li>
    <li>strategies utilization for controlling drug costs. </li>
</ul>

<p>Face-to-face interviews are difficult with pharmacy/medical
directors. Most will have to be done by phone and, if necessary,
material can be faxed or sent express mail to the interviewee. We
have moved away from convention research with physicians because
of the industry's micromarketing efforts. However, convention
research may be a cost-effective way of conducting research with
pharmacy/medical directors at major meetings. </p>

<p><b>Assessing the impact<br>
</b>With the healthcare environment continuing to change at a
rapid pace, market research is often asked questions such as: <br>
1. Types of changes that are occurring (i.e., consolidation,
vertical integration, movement of Medicaid/Medicare population
into managed care). <br>
2. Projection of the rate of growth of various managed care
segments and their future influence on pharmaceutical
utilization. <br>
3. Identification of emerging trends such as disease management
and capitation. </p>

<p>As with monitoring future competitors in a market, addressing
some of these global issues require literature searches,
attendance of semi-nars/ conventions, feedback from national
account managers, and government affairs representatives.
Projecting the rate of change of certain trends such as
capitation on physicians services, the rate of evolution of
integrated healthcare systems, and the scope of disease
management programs may require varying approaches. Consultants
are putting out syndicated studies on these subject matters.
Another avenue is initiating your own benchmarking studies on
these subjects, and track over time changes in customer
perceptions of your position vs. competitors. </p>

<p>Certain areas of the country are much more advanced in their
evolution of managed care. Areas such as California and Minnesota
can be studied to identify trends and to predict the growth of
managed care in other parts of the country. Enrollment trends,
types of controls placed on physicians prescribing, use of
generics, and the pace of vertical and horizontal integration can
be analyzed. These trends and their rate of evolution in these
areas can be used to predict the rate of managed care penetration
in other parts of the country. </p>

<p><b>Evaluation of promotion<br>
</b>It has become routine to evaluate the effectiveness of
various promotional programs to physicians using physician level
data to set up a control versus a test group and assess a brand's
Rx share changes in each group. Unfortunately, such a tool is not
available for evaluating promotional effectiveness to managed
care organizations. A market researcher will have to rely on an
array of sources to indirectly gauge the effectiveness of
value-added programs, contracts, and special pricing to a managed
care organization. </p>

<p>Evaluation of these programs is difficult because
increases/decreases in drug utilization is impacted at several
different points: pharmacy directors, medical directors, and
member physicians of MCOs. Additionally, formulary status,
preferred status, ability to drive share, uniqueness of a brand,
competitive promotional activities, and contracting will impact
the utilization of your brand. </p>

<p>Promotion to pharmacy directors should be tracked for your
brand vs. the competitor's. The frequency of promotion as well as
a company's rating on various attributes such as value-added
services and contracting can be assessed. Changes in market share
for a brand in the managed care environment should be tracked,
prior to and after the implementation of a promotion program. The
prescriptions for all the member physicians in an MCO can be
aggregated and changes in this group's market share can be
assessed or physicians can be segmented by different levels of
utilization. Interviews can be conducted with these physicians to
understand reasons for increased utilization versus no change or
a decline in utilization of your brand. </p>

<p>Assessing the impact of a promotional program to managed care
and its member physicians is not as clear cut as with physicians.
Unlike the physician audience, immediate changes in market share
are often not apparent. However, by looking at these parameters,
general conclusions can be drawn as to whether promotion is
impacting utilization of a brand. Opportunities to partner with a
few MCOs on specific programs and utilizing an MCO internal
database to track the impact of a program should also be
explored. </p>

<p>It is more difficult to assess the value of
non-product-specific value-added programs which may not move
market share for a product but on the other hand enhance
relationship of managed care representatives with key personnel
in a managed care organization. Measuring these programs may be
linked to customers' overall perceptions of the company versus
competitors. These perceptions can be tracked with syndicated
studies or ad hoc research. Feedback from managed care
representatives can also provide input on the value of these
programs. </p>

<p>In conclusion, managed care market research is not all that
different from the traditional research we've been conducting
with physicians. It requires an understanding of some new audits
and new ways of using existing audits to help us understand what
is happening. Hypotheses are then developed to explain why.
Primary research is initiated with customers to prove or disprove
these hypotheses. Unlike the physician segment, however, market
researchers will have to rely on qualitative research for the
answers and management will have to be comfortable making
decisions with results from small sample sizes. </p>

<p>The managed care market researcher must have a thorough
understanding of the needs of this new customers base (i.e.,
pharmacy and medical directors) and possess strong analytical
skills to draw conclusions from secondary sources and qualitative
research. The market researcher must rely on bits and pieces from
a wide array of sources along with qualitative research to
develop an overall picture of the market. </p>

Allegra Introduction<br>

<p><i>Waging a comeback in the antihistamine market, Hoechst
Marion Roussel has armed its new, non-sedating brand with high
impact medical and consumer campaigns to challenge Claritin and
Zyrtec.</i> </p>

<hr>

<p>As Hoechst Marion Roussel introduces its new antihistamine,
Allegra, this Fall, it faces the formidable task of recapturing a
market it once overwhelmingly dominated. The company launched
Seldane, a breakthrough product as the first non-sedating
antihistamine, in 1985 and saw it skyrocket past the standard
products of the day. Seldane also greatly expanded the market
based on patient and physician appreciation for a drug for
allergies with markedly less drowsiness. For seven years,
Seldane, with sales peaking at over $500,000,000, was the Rx
allergy market in the U.S. as the older antihistamines
(Schering's CTM and Parke-Davis' Benadryl, for example) went OTC.
J&amp;J's Hismanal, the second non-sedating brand, achieved sales
in excess of $200,000,000 in 1992, but never challenged Seldane's
leadership. </p>

<p>Then, in 1993, Schering re-entered the U.S. market with
Claritin. The year previously, it had become known that Seldane,
at high doses, could cause cardiotoxicity and arrhythmias. The
problem was that Seldane could build up in the body - if there
was hepatic disease or if the patient also was taking certain
other drugs, notably erythromycin or ketoconazole. Precautionary
letters went out to physicians. Considerable lay publicity
ensued. Seldane's labeling was changed to include a &quot;black
box&quot;warning for this extremely rare, but nevertheless,
dangerous side effect. </p>

<p>Schering, while stressing Claritin's once-a-day dosage, also
raised the safety issue in its promotion, exploiting Seldane's
vulnerability, and began a rapid erosion of Seldane's position
until, in 1995, Claritin had become the market leader. Adding to
the pressure on Seldane was the arrival on the market of Zyrtec
from Pfizer - a skilled Rx marketer. With Claritin on an upward
curve, and with an aggressive Zyrtec on the scene, HMR recognized
that the marketing messages on Allegra needed supercharging
elements if the product was going to be able to take on such
strong competition. </p>

<p>Allegra (fexofenadine HCl) is the principal active metabolite
of Seldane (terfenadine). Accordingly, Allegra goes into the
bloodstream already pharmacologically active and does not depend
on the liver to break it down into a therapeutic agent. Such
scientific information could well have become the basis for
Allegra's launch, explaining its safety relevant to Seldane, but
the Allegra marketing team felt this approach would emphasize
past problems to Allegra's detriment. What was needed was a new
look and, together with the product's advertising agency, Medicus
Communications, that new look became central in developing the
introductory campaign - professional and consumer (DTC). </p>

<p>Richard Norman, creative director at Medicus and also a
principal writer on Allegra, put it this way. &quot;We needed a
change of venue for Allegra. Not only so we wouldn't be seen
solely as 'Son of Seldane,' but also to do the product justice.
It is a new product and it has a lot going for it. But it's also
the fifth non-sedating or low-sedating antihistamine. Getting the
audience's attention and <i>involvement</i> is crucial.î </p>

<p>The marketing team looked at recent advertising for
antihistamines to physicians and saw an opportunity. &quot;It's
mostly conventional allergy icons - smiling patients, pills,
flowers, fields, allergens, clear skies for clear breathing,
sunrises for day-long effects,&quot;says Norman. &quot;We decided
we could work against this background to create a strong Allegra
brand identity. Allegra is a brand with a mind of its own.&quot; </p>

<p>And what is that brand identity - the product's personality?
Lorraine Pastore, executive vice president, management director,
defines it as, &quot;A 'spirit of freedom' &#133; an
unrestricted, positive, expansiveness &#133; very different from
our competition. Look at the Allegra logo, for example, with its
curved, swirling 'e,' running through the brand name. That's the
spirit! We've even used that shape as a signature element.î </p>

<p>Three creative approaches expressing the &quot;spirit of
freedom&quot;personality were tested. A collage layout using
allergy symbolism (flowers and pollen) with 19th Century
engravings of medical anatomy and Victorian figures scored best.
Jan Creidenberg, product manager (who along with Diane Parks,
director, respiratory marketing, and Susan Martin, product
manager, is supervising Allegra's launch at Hoechst Marion
Roussel) feels a strength of the collage campaign is its
attention-getting impact. &quot;It's provocative,&quot;he says.
&quot;We want it that way so that you can't turn the page without
looking at it. It will stop M.D.s. Research shows that.&quot;Jeff
Turner, creative group supervisor concedes that the Monty Python
look is somewhat &quot;irreverent&quot;but he says, &quot;That's
okay. It gets attention, but it's not offensive. It has a 'nice'
irreverence because it is there to amuse.&quot;He feels the style
&quot;interjects life&quot;into the product category and test
results, he says, would indicate physicians appreciate this
change of pace. The intricate collage graphics appear to involve
the reader. Verbatims turned up surprising positive overtones
which M.D.s found in the art. </p>

<p><b>Melding the message<br>
</b>The collage style also has a practical role to play in the
campaign. Pastore likes it because it allows for a display of the
&quot;constellation of benefits&quot;of Allegra. &quot;In the
research,&quot;she says, &quot;we found that M.D.s had different
ideas as to what features were important in antihistamines. No
one or two things stood out. The diversity of preferences led us
to a collage presentation to cover: speed of action, power,
efficacy, safety (all aspects), convenience of dosage, no 'black
box,' etc. We wanted a spread of benefits and we wanted a free
spirit and we fused the elements in this playful, collage look.î
</p>

<p>Antihistamines are a non-serious product category in which
humor has been used successfully in the past. Nevertheless, there
were concerns with the style even when the ads tested well.
Research had been done largely outside the urban cities of the
East Coast, so it was decided to set the Allegra &quot;spirit of
freedom&quot;campaign the ultimate hurdle - ad testing in New
York City. Researchers usually shun New York M.D.s as atypical of
national attitudes and as self-anointed ad critics impossible to
please. To the marketing team's delight, the New York results
confirmed the high scores from the rest of the country. </p>

<p>The consumer advertising for Allegra, which began in print in
August , takes an entirely different creative direction from the
professional promotion. The unifying element, Pastore explains,
is the brand's &quot;spirit of freedom&quot;personality. While
the M.D. is presented with &quot;prescribing freedom,&quot;the
consumer is offered stimulating personal experience unimpaired by
allergy, thanks to Allegra. </p>

<p>The print ad shows a young woman speeding over a broad field
of wheat on a wind surfer as if the field were the surface of a
lake. She is headed toward a radiant range of mountains on the
horizon. Commenting on the paradoxical windsurfing/ wheat field
visual, Jerry Weinstein, creative director at Medicus
Consumer/DMB&amp;B, points out the power of the
&quot;unexpected&quot;in drawing the reader to the ad and then
the ad's illustration delivering an appealing message to allergy
patients. Allergy sufferers, he says, are familiar with
non-sedating antihistamines so the message - to move them to seek
out a new Rx drug like Allegra - must go beyond a factual
presentation to patients' inner motivations - the desire for
freedom from the restrictions allergies put upon them. </p>

<p><b>&quot;Exhilarating Freedomî<br>
</b>Creidenberg of HMR elaborates on this idea. &quot;We've done
a lot of in-depth research with the consumer on this,&quot;he
says. &quot;We think we've captured allergy sufferers' deepest
needs - wanting to be free of the limitations of allergy. We
think we've expressed the consumers' spirit of yearning for the
freedom to enjoy life to the fullest. It's in the consumer ads
with real impact - first with the windsurfer and later with other
examples of exhilarating freedom.î </p>

<p>The ad is headlined, &quot;Ahhh! Allegra!&quot;The
&quot;Ahhh&quot;has a respiratory connotation for the idea of
relief from congestion and then free breathing. A lead-in line
is, &quot;This allergy season, go far ahhhfield,&quot;with the
triple &quot;h's&quot;for eyecatching re-emphasis on the
&quot;Ahhh!î </p>

<p>The campaign will also be on television this fall. Weinstein
describes the upcoming TV spot with real satisfaction. Using
computer graphics, the surfer will do more than glide over the
wheat field, executing flips and twists in the air. The
acrobatics are not simply to attract and entertain the viewer.
Weinstein says, &quot;We wanted the right body language in the
surfer. It's freedom with ability and confidence.î </p>

<p>Since execution is crucial to achieve believable realism in
the wind surfer footage, HMR/Medicus went to Industrial Light
&amp; Magic in California, the company which produced the
&quot;Star Wars&quot;scenes which revolutionized Hollywood's
special effects industry. Complicating matters was the fact that
FDA approval of Allegra's advertising was only received in late
July, which made time short for TV commercials (particularly
computer-generated spots) for fall airing. Cheryl Mervine and
Jack Bloom, members of the Medicus team, have logged many
transcontinental miles and many weeks on the West Coast since
then. </p>

<p>Television advertising is important to Allegra since this
medium has become a competitive locale for non-sedating
antihistamines. Seldane was one of the earliest pharmaceutical
products to use DTC advertising and established TV as a
communications channel for Rx antihistamines. Claritin, following
Seldane's example, has been a heavy spender in TV. Assisting
Claritin's rise has been Seldane's &quot;black box&quot;status.
FDA regulations prevented the brand from appearing on TV.
&quot;We had to compete with one hand tied behind our
back,&quot;says Creidenberg, &quot;We couldn't do reminder ads
when that was just what was needed for an established product
against a newcomer.&quot;Now, HMR, with Allegra, appears poised
to re-establish a level playing field in TV. </p>

<p><b>Stepping Up to the Challenge<br>
</b>Very often when a company has lost the leadership in a
product category and then attempts to reclaim the market with a
second generation product, the pressure to succeed overwhelms the
creative process. The new product is so important to client and
agency that the creative juices are congealed by caution and
lowest common denominator research. What results is a dispirited
launch of conventional imagery and play-it-safe headlines and
copy. </p>

<p>HMR and Medicus appear to have escaped this trap. If anything,
Allegra's introduction is 180° removed from a conservative
approach. The marketing team appears to have used concept and
advertising research not to try to guarantee success, but to find
new, workable creative directions. Also, the team has worked hard
to heighten every aspect of both professional and consumer
advertising with creative flair. For example, the name of the
product reflects the desired product personality and links
appropriately to allergy medication. The logo with its swirling
&quot;e&quot;and its typeface express the brand's spirit. Use is
made of the Seldane heritage, but the theme is not overdone. In
the consumer message the &quot;Ahhh!&quot;is properly
alliterative with Allegra and serves as a positive exclamation --
once again consistent with the tone of the marketing effort. </p>

<p>The collage campaign and the windsurfer consumer advertising
put something new into the creative stream drawing on the
creative abilities of writers, art directors, researchers, and
production specialists to give the product an idea edge vs.
competition. How Allegra will fare in the market will depend on
how HMR manages the launch and what Schering and Pfizer do in
marketing their brands. It will also depend on unknown
developments. Whoever expected Seldane, which was considered safe
enough for an OTC switch, to encounter cardiac side effects?
Regardless of the outcome, Allegra is entering the market
propelled by an uncompromising creative impulse. </p>

<p>The six-page Allegra introductory ad will appear in a range of
medical journals including <i>JAMA, Diversion, Medical Economics,
Postgraduate Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine, American
Family Physician, Cortland Forum, Family Practice News,</i> and
allergy and internist publications. The consumer print ad is
running in newspapers nationally including <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>New
York Times,</i> the <i>Washington Post,</i> and weekly and
monthly magazines. TV will appear in October. </p>

<p>The marketing team at Medicus Communications and Medicus
Consumer/ DMB&amp;B on the Allegra introduction is headed up by
Lorraine Pastore, executive vice president and group account
director and consists of professional promotion: William
Werbaneth, account supervision; Richard Norman, creative
director; Jeff Turner, creative group supervisor; Peter Perrin
and David Newton, copywriters along with Norman, and Tom Galati,
art direction, particularly on the logo. Consumer advertising:
Jerry Weinstein, creative director; Cheryl Mervine, copywriter;
and Jack Bloom, art director.<br>

began</h1>

<h3 align="center"><i>by William Castagnoli<br>

<hr>

<h3 align="center">Executive summary:</h3>

<p><i>In this first of a two-part series, three giants of medical
advertising talk about their early days in the industry, and how
each started the organization that bears their name.<br>
</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Robert Becker, Frank Corbett, and John Kallir are three of the
best known pioneers of medical advertising. Each gave his name to
an agency that continues today. Over the years, hundreds of
copywriters, art directors, account people, media and production
staff spent time within their walls. And, hundreds of company
executives, ad managers, and product managers visited their
offices and worked with them on countless pharmaceutical
campaigns. Becker, Corbett, KPR and others &#151; McAdams,
Frohlich, Sudler &amp; Hennessey &#151; became landmarks on the
medical advertising map, providing the marketing communications
for the pharmaceuticals which have contributed so much to medical
progress in the past 40 years. </p>

<p>In late September, <i>Medical Marketing &amp; Media</i>
invited these three advertising pioneers to share with our
readers their recollections about the formative days of our
industry. In this first installment of a two-part article they
reflect on how they got started in the industry, and how their
agencies got started. In a subsequent issue they will discuss
other pioneers and major events and factors in the development of
the industry. The roundtable was moderated by <i>MM&amp;M's</i>
contributing editor, William G. Castagnoli. Also attending was
Warren Ross, the publication's editor and one of the founding
partners of Kallir, Philips, Ross. <br>
<i>Castagnoli:</i> John, tell us what led you to medical
advertising. <br>
<i>Kallir</i>: I thought at one time that I was going to be a
chemist. I had an interest not in dirty stuff like blood and pus
and medical things, but &quot;pure&quot;things like math and
physical chemistry. However, the Army put me in the Medical Corps
and trained me as a lab technician and I worked in a hospital for
several years running a clinical lab. </p>

<p>When I got out of the Army in 1946, I needed a job. I found
that even though I had not been interested in medicine, I had
picked up a lot of medical lore and I got a job at Squibb &#133;
around '48 to '49. It was very nice, but they didn't pay much - I
think my salary was $2500 a year. I left to become a copywriter
at Klemtner. I hardly knew what ad agencies were, and I had no
idea that there were <i>medical </i>agencies. But I had a friend
in a big consumer agency who told me stories about advertising,
so I went to a headhunter on 42nd Street in New York City, and
they sent me to Klemtner, a small agency in Newark. Brad Potter
interviewed me and asked: &quot;Why do you think you would like
to work here?&quot;And I said, &quot;I think it would be
interesting because you people are in on the beginning of
research. You see things that are coming down the pike at an
early stage.&quot;Which I would still say to people now.<br>
<i>Castagnoli: </i>What were some of the accounts?<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>Klemtner was probably the only agency started by a
CPA. Paul Klemtner was an accountant. His clients were small
companies for whom he had handled bookkeeping; then he said,
&quot;You know, you probably also need some promotion and I can
do that, too.&quot;That's really how Klemtner got started. The
clients were the Central Pharmacal Company of Indiana, B. F.
Ascher in Kansas City and Kremers Urban &#133; small Midwestern
companies. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Then you moved to McAdams?<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>McAdams was the magnet, a glamorous place
some-where in New York. Arthur Sackler, who was the moving force
at McAdams, had already hired two people away from Klemtner, Leo
Schlesinger whom I hadn't known at Klemtner, and Don Clark, a
fellow copywriter who eventually spent most of his career at
Sudler &amp; Hennessey. Don and I had become friends and when he
went to McAdams he started to tell me that marvelous things were
happening there. </p>

<p>One of the things that he told me was: &quot;We're going to
put together a 12-page supplement for Pfizer, like a house organ,
and it will be bound every week into the pages of <i>JAMA</i>.&quot;My
loyalty was to Paul Klemtner, so I went to him and told him about
this revolutionary idea that was being planned. And Paul, the
accountant, looked at me over his wire-rimmed glasses and said,
&quot;John, do you know how much that would cost?&quot; </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>What were your years at McAdams?<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>I started in 1950 and stayed ten years. I began as
a copywriter on Pfizer. Dr. DeForest Ely, who later became the
agency's president, interviewed me and asked what I would like to
work on. I said &quot;Upjohn,&quot;and he said,
&quot;Okay,&quot;but when I started to work, it was on Pfizer
like everybody else. </p>

<p>After working on Pfizer for several years, I was given a small
account &#151; Warner Chilcott &#151; that I later discovered was
considered a kiss of death. Nobody lasted there longer than six
months. I lasted quite a number of years. I didn't realize it
then, in fact I thought I was going to be fired at any moment,
but I really did very good work on that account. Their main
product was Peritrate for angina pectoris, and in Elmer Bobst's
autobiography, he talks about how Peritrate advertising &#151; my
advertising &#151; made the brand. I also worked on infant
formulas for Ross Laboratories. My big opportunity came when we
got Roche. My last two years at McAdams were mostly spent on
Roche, doing both creative and account work. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Then you left and founded your own agency.
What year was that?<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>October of 1961. There was one last attempt to
hold me. I met with Arthur Sackler on Columbus Day, but it was
too late. I made the announcement that if anybody wanted to give
me work, I'd be available. But the actual beginning of Kallir,
Philips, Ross was January 1962, when Warren and I moved into our
first office on Madison Avenue and 40th Street. Jerry Philips
joined us later that year. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Then your agency grew and grew. At one
time, you were the largest domestic medical agency.<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>Yes, we did well. It was a nice, slow, steady
growth, and we had good clients. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Who were some of your principal clients? I
know your clients stuck to you like Velcro.<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>The first company to give me a chance was Squibb.
I made a presentation at Squibb on Mysteclin and Naturetin, a
diuretic. And the agency was me. There was nobody else. I
remember the boardroom at Squibb with Fred Stock, a very nice man
who had been at Pfizer and now was a big man at Squibb. David
Epstein, my part-time art director, and I were sitting at one end
of this very long table and all the other people at the other
end. </p>

<p>The next day, they called and said they would like a copy of
the presentation. I had been so nervous that I had packed up
everything. They thought they would like to take another look at
what we had said! Then they called in December of 1961 and I
celebrated at the Pharmaceutical Advertising Club Christmas
party. Then came Alcon and some Roche work, placing their <i>PDR</i>
listings, which in those days were commissionable. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Among your other big accounts were Johnson
&amp; Johnson and Upjohn.<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>J&amp;J's McNeil Labs was our third account, not
counting Roche. Upjohn came later, as did Ortho, Merck, and quite
a few other prestige accounts. Eventually we added a medical
education division and opened two offices in Europe. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>And then you were acquired by &#133;<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>Well, you know, the only way you can get anything
out of a privately-held advertising company is to sell it. So we
started to talk to big consumer agencies in 1982, but the only
two we ever seriously considered &#151; because of their creative
standards &#151; were Ogilvy &amp; Mather and Doyle Dane
Bernbach, and DDB eventually acquired us. </p>

<p>What we didn't know was that Bill Bernbach, the agency's
driving force, was dying of leukemia. I never met him, and after
that Doyle Dane did not do well and became part of Omnicom in a
three-way merger. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>So how many years were you in the business
before you retired?<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>From 1947 to 1993. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>What is the best campaign you ever did?<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>Personally? The Librium launch at McAdams. The
best KPR campaign? Warren's work on Tylenol, which was the
biggest success story not only for the agency but probably in all
of medical advertising. Tylenol started as a pediatric product.
McNeil sampled with little fire engine boxes which they gave to
pediatricians as the &quot;fever reliever.&quot;They gave us no
budget to speak of and said, &quot;If you fail, that's okay
because nobody can sell Tylenol.&quot;We repositioned it as an
alternative to aspirin, and even before the launch of consumer
advertising it became the number one non-prescription analgesic
brand in dollar volume. </p>

<p>Then &#151; and one doesn't follow from the other
automatically &#151; what Warren did for Tylenol with Codeine was
just as remarkable. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Thank you, John. Frank, why don't you tell
us about your career.<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>A career is an evolutionary process and an
apprenticeship must be served. A well rounded agency executive
must have been exposed to many disciplines. Very often where you
start you don't end. It was the depression. I was working in a
pharmacy. The only way I could manage a college education was to
go to pharmacy school. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>This was in New York.<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>Yes, Columbia College of Pharmacy. The annual
tuition was $350. At graduation time I owed $500, a year and a
half tuition. No money no diploma. It wasn't easy raising $500.
You could buy a new car for that. I wanted to get out of retail
pharmacy. I went into detailing for Upjohn. It was a magnificent
opportunity and execellent training &#133; and paid $175 a month.
I had to buy my own car, my own insurance, but still had only
$2.50 per day expenses. After about two years I decided I wanted
some direct selling experience, so I went to work selling the
Rexall line to drugstores. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Frank, let me interrupt for a second,
because you are looked upon as a Chicago figure, but you began in
New York City. Did you go through New York City public schools?<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>I went to St. Gregory's parochial school on 90th
Street, then to George Washington High School in Manhattan, and
then to Columbia. Anyway, I became very bored with selling to
retail outlets. It was relatively easy after calling on doctors
and trying to get them to try products, so I visited Ray
Hetterick, who had been with Upjohn, and had meanwhile taken a
job as director of marketing at William R. Warner Company, and he
said, &quot;Come to work for us.&quot;I went back to detailing,
and was assigned to Manhattan. </p>

<p>There was a wartime shortage of people to which I attribute my
rapid success. I became a district manager in six months. A year
later someone must have read a business journal about market
research and decided they needed a market research department.
And I was anointed. They put me in an office, gave me a secretary
and instantly I was head of market research and product
development. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>I neglected to ask you to give us some
dates. <br>
<i>Corbett: </i>I can do that. In 1938, I graduated from pharmacy
school. I worked for Upjohn from 1941 to 1943, then a short
period with Rexall, and went to work for Warner in 1944.
Incidentally, Gustav Pfeiffer, who owned the William R. Warner
Company, was one of the world's richest men. He liked to take new
employees to lunch, and he gave me a leather wallet for stamps
and a pocket secretary with a silver pencil and a little pad
&#151; plus a lecture on celibacy. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Why did he do that?<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>I dared not ask, but he did. There was another
chap at lunch, also a new hire. Mr. Pfeiffer looked rather
ancient though he wasn't as old as he looked. He said to this
fellow, &quot;How old do you think I am?&quot;&#151; he was very
proud of the fact that he was still active &#151; and the guy
said 75. Then he asked me. I said 62! </p>

<p>I started going to NYU at night to learn something about
market research. It wasn't too long afterwards, in 1946, that
Elmer Bobst got control of Warner and he cut a swath through the
place. Heads were lopped off left and right. We had what we
called &quot;Black Fridays.&quot;We'd have a nice lunch and
figure out who was going to be working at 5 o'clock. He let
Hetterick go. </p>

<p>I'll say this for Bobst. He was more generous than most
companies at that time when they fired people. He gave them three
months' severance, and a good reference. But anyway, Ray
Hetterick was looking for a job and he met with the Lambert
company, the Listerine people. They had purchased a drug company
in Glendale, California, called Harrower Laboratories. It was
cheap and they got what they paid for, so they decided to hire
some new people. They hired Ray as director of marketing, and Ray
invited me to come out to work with him. </p>

<p>I dilly-dallied, asking for more money, but Ray was after me,
so finally I went to California and worked out there until August
1950. It was a great experience. Unfortunately, the business did
not grow as planned, there were cutbacks, and I had to take over
the advertising responsibilities. A Mr. Williams took over as
president of the Lambert Company and decided Harrower offices
should be moved back East. That's how, in 1950 I came back to New
Jersey. Lambert executives had been located in Rockefeller
Center, but they were also moved to the Listerine plant in Jersey
City. What a come-down! </p>

<p>Harrower had virtually no research and after a short period I
said to Hetterick, &quot;You know, Ray, I see no future here and
I'm going to look for another job.&quot;I had gotten to know Lee
Klemmer, who sold space for <i>Modern Medicine </i>and did a lot
of recruiting in the pharmaceutical industry. </p>

<p>I went to see Lee and he said, &quot;Hey, there's a new agency
out in Chicago. They don't do much business, about a million
dollars a year, but they're looking for an account man.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>What was the agency called?<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>It was Jordan, Sieber at that time, and I
interviewed with Charlie Jordan and he offered me a job in
Chicago. One of the beautiful things about agency work is the
freedom: you're not bound by the tight constraints of large
corporations &#133; by the bureaucratic layers. Clients encourage
you to think innovatively and to voice your opinions. </p>

<p>I stayed at the agency almost ten years, to 1961. They were
very nice people. We shared the money. They made me an almost
equal partner in about 1956. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>They put your name on the door?<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>Yes, and I got 25 percent. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>You must have been a pretty good account
executive! Who were some of your clients?<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>They included Armour Laboratories, Pitman-Moore,
Lakeside, Westwood Pharmaceuticals, and Baxter. </p>

<p>Then the agency decided to open a New York office and Charlie
Jordan moved there to run it. Unfortunately, every dollar we made
in Chicago went down the drain in New York City. Plus the fact
that I ended up working Saturdays and even Sundays for about half
a day. One little anecdote about why I left. I bought a new car,
a Jaguar, and coming back from the office on a Sunday afternoon I
drove it into the parking garage of my apartment building, gave
the key to the attendant &#151; and he drove it right into a
pillar. I went upstairs, poured a drink of Scotch and said,
&quot;That's it. That's it!&quot; </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>That was the crucial moment?<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>It sounds silly, but it's true - I told Jordan I
wanted to get out. He was very bright &#133; a good salesman
&#133; but he didn't care much for details. Paul Sieber was a
good artist but not a strong commercial artist, and a very kind,
gentle, man. </p>

<p>I told them I wanted out in some equitable fashion. I won't go
through all the details, but it got very sticky. I had a contract
and couldn't go into business for a year but I was glad to take a
year off. It's a big mistake to do that in one's career, but I
was willing to do it. I was tired. </p>

<p>But that's not the way it turned out. One of my clients was
Westwood. I had done all their marketing and Dolores, my wife,
had done all the creative. So they went to Jordan and said, if
Frank doesn't do our marketing and Dolores doesn't do our
creative, we're leaving. Already, I started getting busy. Then
Ray Hetterick asked if I could be a consultant to him <br>
because he had only a small staff at Lakeside. It turned out to
be a very, very busy year. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>You founded your own agency &#133;<br>
<i>Corbett: </i>Frank J. Corbett Inc. My wife and I started the
business. She was a partner. With false modesty I'd say it was an
instant success. The agency took off. Baxter, Lakeside, Westwood,
Eaton Laboratories were among our first clients eventually joined
by Lilly, Upjohn, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Winthrop. Today, we
have twenty clients. Westwood is an interesting story, initially
their sales were $200,000, today hundreds of millions. A client
for 35 years. A record. BBDO pioneered the entry of consumer
agencies into health care by acquiring us in 1972. I had a
five-year contract and when it was up, I said, I'm not going to
renew. I wanted to be free for once in my life, but I've stayed
on with the company. Now I do not have a heavy workload, but I'm
not retired. For instance, I recently visited Alcon in Fort
Worth. John, wasn't Alcon a client of yours and Warren's? </p>

<p><i>Ross: </i>It was indeed. Almost the day I left McAdams, he
called to ask whether I could work on his account. At that point
John and I were negotiating, so I suggested the three of us have
dinner together. That was the pivotal event.<br>
<i>Kallir: </i>He claims that he founded KPR. </p>

<p><i>Ross: </i>He says that every time he asked a question, John
and I would turn to each other and come up with an answer, right
there, on all the issues we hadn't resolved.<br>
<i>Castagnoli: </i>Bob, tell us about your career. </p>

<p><i>Becker: </i>I started in 1941. I had just gotten a degree
in marketing at NYU. I think I was probably the first person in
this business with a degree in marketing. And I was offered a job
at Plough Inc. down in Memphis. Jobs were hard to come by in
those days. I was interviewed twice by the advertising manager
and once by Abe Plough. He wanted to see me himself before he
hired a kid who didn't know anything about anything. He asked,
&quot;Why do you want this job?&quot;It was clear that it
wouldn't do to say, &quot;I'd take any damn job that comes
along.&quot;I said, &quot;I read somewhere that the best job for
a person is the job that brings out the best in that person, and
from what I've heard about this job, it would bring out the best
in me.&quot;He said, &quot;That's terrific. Who said that?&quot;I
didn't have the nerve to tell him that I had just made it up!
Finally he said, &quot;Tell the advertising manager I said all
right, and to pay you $25 a week.&quot;I thought that was a
fortune. In Memphis in those years they said you could live like
a prince on $25 a week. Of course, you couldn't eat, but one
can't have everything. </p>

<p>I liked Abe Plough very much. I remember him as an
extraordinary man. In fact, I've never known his like in my
entire career. </p>

<p>Anyhow, I went to Plough as a copywriter and I did all kinds
of stuff. At first they weren't entrusting too much to me, but
little by little, I would volunteer ideas. The biggest part of
their promotion was calendars on which they'd imprint the
drugstore's name. </p>

<p>One day they asked me to write the weather forecast for each
day of the year. They had a meteorologist make some predictions,
but these calendars were distributed all over the country, so
what am I going to say? Fair? It wasn't going to be fair the same
day in all parts of the country. So I just took a guess. I said,
fair, partly cloudy, hot, rain, and people used to look at those
calendars and say, &quot;It's going to rain today.&quot; </p>

<p>Then I suggested something that would slightly change the
calendar: each day say what important event had happened that
day. That caused a revolution. We've never done that. You're
asking us to change our biggest budget item? But they did it and
it worked out real well. None of which really had anything to do
with copywriting. I was kind of an apprentice. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>How long were you with Plough?<br>
<i>Becker: </i>Until the war, in 1941. After military service, I
came to New York to work for Murray Breese, at that time the
largest pharmaceutical advertising agency. He had been the editor
of <i>Drug Topics,</i> and he had the CIBA, Schering,
Parke-Davis, Bristol Labs, and Bristol-Myers accounts. Because I
had worked for Plough, Murray Breese considered me an experienced
drug copywriter! I really wasn't that thrilled with being
pigeonholed; I wanted to write for Ford Motors, you know,
glamorous stuff. I'd go out and apply for jobs and they'd say,
&quot;You're a pharmaceutical guy.&quot;Never could break out of
that.Then I got more interested in pharmaceuticals and decided to
make the most of it. So while I was working with Murray Breese,
in my spare time I went to pharmacy school, starting out at
Rutgers College of Pharmacy and finishing at Long Island
University. Now I had a degree in marketing and a degree in
pharmacy. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>That must have taken a long time.<br>
<i>Becker: </i>It was hard, but I was young and ambitious, and
I've never really regretted it. I continued to work free-lance
for Murray Breese and also for Bob Rodman who had worked with me
at Breese and by that time had his own agency. </p>

<p>When I got the pharmacy degree, I went to work for Squibb. I
was there for quite a number of years, first as a copywriter and
later as a combined copywriter/ product manager &#151; maybe the
only one in captivity. I left Squibb for a while to work for a
division of a company that doesn't exist any more, then Squibb
asked me to come back as advertising manager, a position I held
for some years. </p>

<p>At that point I was full of ideas. For example, Squibb brought
out Mycostatin, the first antifungal agent. It was a really good
drug but doctors said they didn't know what it was for &#133;
that they really didn't have any use for it. </p>

<p>I met with some lab people and said, &quot;How do you
determine the presence of a monilial infection?&quot; They said,
&quot;Nickerson's media. You swab the tissue, put it in a little
vial, and in a couple of days, if it turns color, you know you're
dealing with a monilial infection.&quot; </p>

<p>I arranged to buy a zillion of those vials. It took a lot of
doing to get Squibb to buy someone else's product, but we gave
them out to as many doctors as we could. It was a great promotion
because, suddenly, doctors were seeing monilial infections. I was
full of things I wanted to do, but often it's hard to get
approvals in a big company. </p>

<p>I went to Squibb's sales manager, Willard McHargue, who valued
me as a creative person and said, &quot;I could do Squibb more
good on the outside if I started my own advertising agency. Let
me go out there and work for Squibb.&quot; He thought that was a
wonderful idea. Most of my experience, of course, had been on the
manufacturing side of the business; I had the feeling I needed to
know more about the agency side. So I decided I would supplement
my abilities on the creative end with someone who knew more about
the workings of an agency. I talked to Dean Burdick, who was at
that time the executive vice president of William Douglas
McAdams. I told him what I had in mind and was he interested? He
just jumped at it. He wasn't happy at McAdams. He said, &quot;I'd
like to bring in a friend of mine from the Midwest, Don
Fitzsimmons, who will bring us a lot of Chicago business.&quot; I
said okay. So we started what was originally called Burdick,
Becker, and Fitzsimmons with Squibb as our first account. </p>

<p>Don left shortly to do his own thing and Burdick, after four
years, said to me that he wanted to do <i>his </i>own thing. We
were equal partners and he didn't like that. We split up the
accounts, Burdick went his way and I went mine. </p>

<p>When it came to splitting up the accounts, we each took the
ones we were closest to. The one that I was closest to and very
excited about was Merck. They were relatively new in the
pharmaceutical business, having been a chemical company, but you
had to be blind not to see that Merck was going someplace. </p>

<p>I practically moved in with them, and we became by far the
largest of their three agencies. They were coming out with such
drugs as cortisone, Diuril and Indocin &#151; drugs that reshaped
medicine, drugs that affected everybody's lives. As a result, you
could walk into the doctor's office or send a mailing with the
Merck name on it, and you'd get attention. </p>

<p>Merck was the bulk of our agency's business. Some of our other
accounts included Sandoz, Lilly, Mead Johnson, Bristol, Upjohn,
Syntex, Lederle, Dorsey, Roerig, Knoll, Berlex, Hoechst, Carter
Wallace, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Ortho, SmithKline &amp; French,
and a great many others. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>What year did you retire?<br>
<i>Becker: </i>Last year &#151; 1995.</p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>Refresh my memory. The Becker agency is now
part of a European holding company.<i><br>
Becker: </i>We sold the company in 1987 to a British firm called
Aegis. Aegis then sold to a French company &#133; Euro RSCG. I
stayed on as president for a few years, then as chairman, then
the last few years as a consultant. But the company goes on.
Sander Flaum runs it now and he has built it to a bigger company
than I ever did. </p>

<p><i>Castagnoli: </i>That's all very interesting &#133; how
accidents shape careers &#151; a dented Jaguar, a calendar for
Abe Plough, a dinner with Ed Schollmaier. Thank you all for
sharing these fascinating histories. <br>

for three percent, or almost half, of the increase. Volume, which
contributed two percent, was the secondary driver, while price
increases accounted for one percent of market growth. As shown in
<a href="exhib1b.htm">Exhibit 1B</a>, in the non-retail segment,
the clinic channel continued to show the greatest increase at an
impressive 18 percent ($2.1 billion) followed by the long term
care segment at 16.5 percent ($1.2 billion). </p>

<p><a name="Exhibit3"></a>There were slight differences in rank
between the top 20 sales volume products in the first half of
1996 compared to 1995. <a href="exhib3.htm">Exhibit 3</a> lists
the top 20 products at midyear 1996 based on dollar sales, with
their rank at midyear 1995 shown for comparison. The most
significant shifts occurred at Merck's Zocor, moving from 19th
place at midyear 1995 to seventh place in 1996. Zocor's sales
increased from $230 million in the first half of 1995 to $441
million during the first half of 1996. Pfizer's Norvasc, which
was not among the top 20 products in the first half of 1995,
moved to 13th place with sales of $333 million. Two new entries
to the top 20, SmithKline Beecham's Paxil and Schering's
Claritin, moved into 19th and 20th places, respectively. They
replaced Capoten and Proventil. </p>

<p><a name="Exhibit4"></a>As shown in <a href="exhib4.htm">Exhibit
4</a>, on the prescription front, Premarin continues to enjoy the
spotlight as the top ranking product. Most of the significant
changes in the list of leading products occurred in positions six
through 20. SmithKline Beecham's Amoxil, ranked second at midyear
in 1995, saw scripts decline 48% and dropped to 13th place.
Similarly, Schering's Proventil fell to 18th place in the first
half of 1996 from ninth during the same period in 1995.
Proventil's total prescriptions dispensed fell by 31 percent.
Neither Astra-Merck's Prilosec nor Pfizer's Norvasc were in the
top 20 in 1995, however, in 1996 they rank 15th and 16th,
respectively, through six months. </p>

<p><a name="Exhibit5"><b>The Leading Therapeutic Classes</b></a><b><br>
</b>A review of the 20 leading therapeutic classes in terms of
sales volume in <a href="exhib5a.htm">Exhibit 5A</a> shows
virtually no changes from 1995 to 1996. There were some slight
shifts in rank, with the most significant being cholesterol
reducers, moving up from seventh place in 1995 to fourth in 1996.
This was due largely to the strong performance of Merck's Zocor. <a
href="exhib5b.htm">Exhibit 5B</a> lists the top classes based on
total prescriptions. The leading classes remained virtually
unchanged with only minor shifts in rank from 1995 to 1996.
Calcium channel blockers continue to rank as the number one
therapy class despite a one percent decrease in total Rxs
dispensed. </p>

<p><a name="Exhibit6"><b>New Products</b></a><b><br>
</b>As summarized in <a href="exhib6.htm">Exhibit 6</a>, there
were a number of new chemical entities launched during the first
six months of 1996, four within high growth, high interest
markets: Zyrtec, Norvir, Crixivan and Redux. Zyrtec, Pfizer's
antihistamine for relief of seasonal and perennial allergies, was
launched in January and generated $55.8 million in sales in just
six months. Two HIV-protease inhibitors, Norvir and Crixivan,
were also launched during the first half of 1996. Norvir,
Abbott's product in this market, was launched in March and
generated over $19.6 million in sales in four months. Crixivan,
Merck's HIV-protease inhibitor, was launched in May with
distribution limited to mail order (these sales are not covered
in IMS' Retail Perspective database). Finally, Redux, touted as
the new miracle drug for anti-obesity from Wyeth, was launched in
May. In only two months this drug has generated over $15.7
million in sales. </p>

<p><a name="Exhibit7"><b>Rx to OTC Switches</b></a><font size="1"><sup><b>3<br>
</b></sup></font><a href="exhib7.htm">Exhibit 7</a> details sales
of the four products that switched from Rx to OTC status during
the first half of 1996: Femstat, Monistat 3, Nicorette and
Rogaine. Procter and Gamble launched Femstat 3 as an
over-the-counter in April, generating sales of over $4.3 million
in four months and outperforming its Rx version, Roche's Femstat.
Monistat 3 was launched by Ortho ACP in May and was also well on
it way to out-selling Monistat 3 (Rx). Both Nicorette (OTC) and
Rogaine (OTC) stole significant sales volume from their Rx
counterparts. Nicorette (OTC), sold in the smoking deterrent
market, was launched over-the-counter in April by SKB CP with
sales exceeding $40.8 million in three months. These sales more
than double those for the Rx version, Nicorette. The final
product, Rogaine, indicated for the treatment of hair loss in
women and baldness in men, was launched over-the-counter by
Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Consumer in April. In three months sales
totaled more than $33.7 million, indicating that Rogaine (OTC) is
off to a fast start. </p>

<p><a name="Exhibit8"><b>Retail Method of Payment</b></a><b><br>
</b>Third party reimbursement continued to command the retail
method of payment arena, as illustrated in <a href="exhib8.htm">Exhibit
8</a>. In fact, over 53 percent of all prescriptions are covered
by third party managed care. The ratio of cash to third party has
nearly reversed since 1990 when third party was 26 percent and
cash 63 percent. In the second quarter of 1996, third party was
55 percent and cash was 34 percent. Medicaid has changed little
from its 11 percent share in 1990 to 11.5 percent in 1996.<br>

<h1 align="center">FDA hearings air what the <a name="#top">Internet
can show </a></h1>

<h3 align="center"><i>by Milton Liebman<br>
</i></h3>

<hr>

<p>Cyberspace was brought down to earth at a well-planned FDA
public hearing on promotion of regulated products on the
Internet. Five groups of 20 public and industry representatives
took turns during the two-day meeting. </p>

<p>Each group faced a panel of about eight FDA staff members.
With a moderator between them, and an overflow audience of more
than 300 logged on, the panelists discussed topics posed by the
FDA in response to questions received from drug and device
companies. </p>

<p>Topics included on-the-Internet information on approved and
investigational drugs, use of brief summary or labeling,
disclosure statements, sponsorship of chat rooms and news groups,
and international issues. The FDA has been gathering information
since late 1995 &quot;to facilitate the development of guidance
to the industry on&nbsp;the promotion of regulated
products,&quot; according to the agency statement in the <i>Federal
Register</i> (Sept. 16, Vol. 61, No. 180). </p>

<p>&quot;We have not put one word on paper yet,&quot; said FDA's
Minnie Baylor-Henry, director of the Division of Drug
Marketing,&nbsp;Advertising and Communications.&nbsp;&quot;We
wanted to hear what people had to say.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We would like to concentrate on the appropriate way to
apply current statutes,&quot; said the program chair, William B.
Schultz, FDA deputy commissioner for policy. For the most part,
panelists said that guidance, rather than new regulations, was
needed. The Internet is a new medium, but existing regulation for
print media could be applied. The pharmaceutical industry is not
taking advantage of the new medium, because of a lack of guidance
and resulting concern over liability. </p>

<p><strong>In-the-pipeline drugs on the net?</strong><br>
Wayne Pines, former FDA staffer and now of APCO Associates,
moderated the first group discussion. Information on
investigational drugs should be allowed on the Internet,
according to most of the panelists, following the existing
regulations for distribution of such published reports.
&quot;When a physician requests information from a company, it is
all right to distribute a reprint,&quot; said Pam Weagraff,
regulatory affairs executive with Hewlett Packard. Others pointed
out that the act of searching for information &#151; or clicking
on a page &#151; is a form of &quot;affirmative action.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Freedom of access</strong><br>
&quot;Restricting access is not a good approach,&quot; said
Robert Whitaker of Center Watch, a web site. Other panelists,
from consumer advocate Sidney Wolfe to Rittenhouse
Communication's Louis Castelli agreed. &quot;What does it mean to
be a publisher?&quot; asked Slack's Mario Cavallini. &quot;Be a
responsible source for credible information. Have quality
controls.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Restricting access is not likely or possible,&quot;
agreed Robert Temple, M.D., director of the Office of Drug
Evaluation. &quot;Do you need a uniform standard for all
information, since any one can access it?&quot; Sidney Wolfe was
quick to say &quot;yes, that's why we need regulations.&quot; Pam
Weagraff pointed out that &quot;a home page offers the same
information and has to pass the same review as any print material
that is presented to the public or the profession.&quot; And
attorney David Vance of Glaxo Wellcome said, &quot;People who are
suffering from a certain disease want to get all the information
they can.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Differentiating ads from edit</strong><br>
Louis Morris, branch chief for Marketing Practices and
Communications, asked how to identify advertising on the
Internet. &quot;In journals, when I see ads I know they are ads.
On the Internet, ads can be anywhere. What needs to be disclosed?
What kinds of disclosures would be helpful?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It is the context,&quot; panel members responded. Wendy
Borow of Com-Med Interactive said that &quot;the company home
page should look like its coming from the company - with
identification.&quot; </p>

<p>Disclosure statements were also suggested to clarify editorial
content, such as &quot;the following information is designed for
a physician audience.&quot; Other examples of differentiating
content: approved use vs. investigational use, and &quot;in
clinical development,&quot; for drug information. Material for
investors should be so labeled, said one panelist. You can
satisfy the needs of different audiences by directing the
information. &quot;We can't protect the idiot,&quot; said Glaxo's
Vance. &quot;I hope we don't go down to the lowest common
denominator.&quot; </p>

<p>Sydney Wolfe said, &quot; I disagree that current regulations
are adequate. The Internet is mainly directed to consumers.&quot;
On the other hand, Vance stressed that &quot;current regulations
are more than adequate. The only difference is speed of access.
Treatment INDs are already on the Internet.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Private sponsorship of public chats</strong><br>
A panel discussing FDA concerns over drug company sponsorship of
chat rooms and news groups on the Internet was led by Linda
Golodner, president of the National Consumers League. Larry
Liberti of Pharmaceutical Information Associates, said: &quot;We
are involved with on-line moderated e-mail groups. Some groups
are moderated, some are not. Some are supported &#133; but the
sponsors have no contact with us or involvement with the group.
We pay honoraria to moderators, and have been doing this for two
years.&quot; </p>

<p>Mark Boulding of the law firm Fox, Bennett, and Turner:
&quot;There are a lot of people who want to receive these grants.
It is possible to find a third party organization who will be
truly independent.&quot; Some of those mentioned were national
disease-related voluntary organizations as well as independent
program companies. Sara Stein of the Stanford Department of
Psychiatry, who is involved in Internet programing, raised the
key question: &quot;What is the ultimate goal for sponsorship of
a chat room? Open discussion of a disease process or an
'infomercial' about a drug?&quot; </p>

<p>Chat rooms are an &quot;easy and effective method of getting
feedback,&quot; said a speaker from the audience. Other opinions:
if the drug company has a monitor for a chat group, it assumes a
legal responsibility; anyone can participate in an open chat
group without proved identification, including representatives
from competing companies. </p>

<p>&quot;We are taking a very cautious, slow approach,&quot; said
John Walsh from Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, reflecting the opinion
of much of the drug industry. &quot;This is a new technology,
don't over-regulate it. Just give us some guidance so we can
start to see the benefit but not incur the liability,&quot; he
continued. &quot;Liability is an issue bigger than any
other.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Views on disclosure</strong><br>
Dan McKillen, head of Sound Side Consulting, moderated the panel
dealing with disclosure. What's right for the Internet? The
general opinion is that there is no &quot;length constraint&quot;
on the Internet, so that full disclosure is possible &#151; and
safer. </p>

<p>Toni Guarino of the Drinker, Biddle, &amp; Reath law firm
agreed that &quot;there is no financial burden&quot; in posting
labeling. &quot;But what about the viewer? The labeling approach
may not be effective and the effectiveness of communications is a
subject of regulatory concern.&quot; Michael Altmann of Medical
Forum pointed out that there are many different audiences. He
suggested different information for professional and consumer
audiences. </p>

<p>&quot;Current fair balance regulations for print are good for
the Internet,&quot; said Thomas Merchant, SmithKline Beecham.
Another point of agreement, expressed by Michael Altmann:
&quot;The consumer will let us know where they want it. If it
isn't, they won't come back to the site.&quot; </p>

<p><strong>Website linkage within the law</strong><br>
What parameters should be considered for hypertext links from the
ADF website to other websites that contain product information,
without violating the law? The discussion about linkage was
moderated by George Lundberg, M.D., editor-in-chief, American
Medical Association. &quot;Why do we want to prevent distribution
of off-label information for a subset of the population when it
is now available in every public library?&quot; said Allen Douma,
medical director of the America On Line's Health Response Ability
channel. &quot;<i>JAMA</i> is on the Internet, and <i>JAMA</i>
can be accessed by the general public, with off-label uses of
drugs in articles.&quot; But, he added, &quot;You must monitor
where you link. You do the best you can, but this is not to be
regulated.&quot; </p>

<p>Edward Fotsch, Net Source Communications: &quot;FDA guidelines
should be applied to the sponsor's site, not to the linked
site.&quot; And others agreed. &quot; Linking to another
scientific or consumer site should not be an FDA issue.&quot;
Craig Douglas, creative director of Frontier Media Group:
&quot;The linking to quality sites is a service that
pharmaceutical companies provide. It is incumbant on sponsors to
make certain that links are quality. People come to the site for
the links.&quot; Sara Stein wants to see &quot;links clearly
identified that you are going to an independent site.&quot; She
also said that links that are paid for should be clearly
identified. </p>

<p><strong>It's the World Wide Web</strong><br>
The final panel discussed international issues and heard
presentations from representatives from France, Brazil, Australia
and the United Kingdom on their rules governing Internet
communications. Of general interest: for the most part,
direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs is not
allowed in foreign countries. Of particular interest: The
information put on the Internet must meet the regulatory
requirements of the country in which the sponsoring company and
its server is located, and not those of the rest of the world. </p>

<p>&quot;There is no way to nationalize the Internet, to
determine who will have access, and to make sure that the
information is appropriate,&quot; said Robert Klepinski of
Medtronic. &quot;We can label and disclaim, but I don't see how
we can keep information off of the net.&quot; &quot;The location
of the server is an irrelevant issue. Access is world wide. The
most important aspect of the information is accuracy and
integrity,&quot; commented Mike Miller of Eli Lilly. </p>

<p>Written comments to the FDA on advertising and promotion of
medical products on the Internet should be received by December
16 (Docket No. 96N-0309). Transcripts are due to be available two
weeks from the close of the two-day public hearing from the
Freedom of Information Office/FDA, Rockville, Md.&nbsp; <br>

<h1 align="center">New president opens windows at <a name="#top">PhRMA</a></h1>

<h3 align="center"><i>by Warren R. Ross<br>
</i></h3>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>Executive summary:</b> </p>

<p><i>In his first public presentation, Alan Holmer, the new
president of PhRMA, chose to speak to the Healthcare Marketing
&amp; Communications Council, signaling a renewed interest in the
concerns and input of the healthcare marketing community.</i> </p>

<hr>

<p>&quot;Sounds hopeful.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;A breath of fresh air.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Comes across like he means it.&quot; </p>

<p>These were some of the comments overheard at the McGraw Hill
building in New York City last September 18 when Alan F. Holmer,
the new president of PhRMA, finished speaking to the Healthcare
Marketing Communications Council. </p>

<p>As encouraging as what he said, in the opinion of many of his
listeners, was the fact that Holmer had chosen the HMC Council
for his first public presentation since taking office two months
before. </p>

<p>&quot;It's great to know that he thinks of marketing
communications as a high PhRMA priority,&quot; was the way one
agency CEO put it. </p>

<p>One reason why his listeners responded so hopefully to
Holmer's talk is that PhRMA &#151; the Pharmaceutical Research
and Manufacturers of America, not so long ago known as PMA (the
Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association) &#151; has not always
seemed to assign such a high priority to the concerns of
healthcare marketers. In fact, in 1991 a group of healthcare
organizations whose members work in healthcare advertising,
promotion, education and publishing founded the Coalition for
Healthcare Communications precisely to make sure their concerns
were properly represented in Congress and at the Food and Drug
Administration. </p>

<p>&quot;We always considered PhRMA an ally,&quot; Coalition
executive director Jack Angel explains, &quot;but we couldn't
always be sure that they would give communications issues as much
emphasis as we would like. After all, they had many other
problems to contend with.&quot; </p>

<p><b>Cultivating allies<br>
</b>In his speech, Holmer made a special point of his intention
of reaching out to other organizations that can help PhRMA
disseminate its message, citing his HMCC appearance as one
example. He cited physician and pharmacy groups as other
important constituencies he wants to cultivate, and in an
exclusive follow-up interview with <i>MM&amp;M</i> mentioned that
in his first two months in office he had already met with the
executive vice president of the American Medical Association,
John Seward, MD, and hopes that this was just the first of many
meetings. </p>

<p>By coincidence, both PhRMA and AMA are going through a
strategic planning process. &quot;Once that's completed,&quot;
Holmer said, &quot;we'll want to sit down and make sure that to
the extent possible the goals and objectives of the two
organizations are consistent.&quot; </p>

<p>Similarly, he has met with both John Gans, the head of the
American Pharmaceutical Association, and Calvin Anthony, who
heads up the National Association of Retail Druggists. </p>

<p>Holmer considers this type of outreach to be one of his
highest priorities. &quot;I want to develop close contacts with
our allies,&quot; he explains, &quot;but I also want to make sure
that I have an open and cordial relationship with those who might
oppose us on certain issues.&quot; </p>

<p>As a strong believer in personal relationships, he also has
started making the rounds of PhRMA member companies. &quot;I've
already had a chance to visit Glaxo, Procter &amp; Gamble,
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Searle, Lilly, SmithKline Beecham, and
Bristol-Myers Squibb. It's all part of my effort to learn about
the business and build relationships with people in our member
companies - and not only the top executives who come to our
meetings, but with the scientists, the regulatory affairs people,
and just about everybody else.&quot; </p>

<p>Including marketing people?<br>
Definitely, he replies. Not only that, but soon he expects to
spend a day in the field with a sales representative. </p>

<p>And will he also visit some healthcare advertising agencies?
While seeing how products are sold in the doctor's office is an
important perspective, so is talking to the people who walk the
tightrope of telling the product message in the most effective
way within the constraints of FDA regulations. </p>

<p>Holmer admits it is not something he has thought of but, yes,
now that it has been mentioned he will gladly add them to his
list. </p>

<p><b>Other priorities<br>
</b>Speaking of FDA, Holmer mentioned in his HMCC talk that the
user fee act is going to expire on September 30, 1997, and that
when Congress debates renewal legislation there may be an
opportunity to enact some of the reforms that failed to get
passed in 1996. Just what objectives does PhRMA have in mind? </p>

<p>Apparently Holmer's preference for amicable relations extends
to FDA as well. As he puts it: &quot;We want to make sure that we
have positive, constructive discussions with the FDA, so we
prefer to talk to them directly and not appear to be negotiating
with them through the press.&quot; PhRMA will, therefore, not
make its objectives public until after these meetings have taken
place. </p>

<p>He is equally circumspect in discussing the PhRMA advertising
program. He told the HMCC audience that the 1996 consumer ad
campaign cost $23 million, which includes both the media expenses
and the production of million of brochures &#151; some bound into
such publications as <i>Reader's Digest</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>
&#151; that give advice on the treatment and prevention of
disease, as well as describing the industry's search for ever
more effective pharmaceuticals. But next year's budget, he says,
is still being worked on by the communications committee, after
which it has to be approved first by the executive committee and
then the full board. But he does voice his personal commitment to
the program. </p>

<p>&quot;I am personally very pleased with it and its
effectiveness,&quot; he adds. &quot;As I travel around the
country and also on Capitol Hill I hear wonderful comments about
its quality.&quot; </p>

<p>This endorsement jibes with what he calls his top priority as
he takes on the task of chief executive of PhRMA: &quot;I want to
make sure that I communicate to key policy makers and the public
the commitment and value of this industry to patients.&quot; </p>

<p>While rejecting as unfair the suggestion that PhRMA may in the
past have been too focused on inside-the-Beltway issues, perhaps
even too inward looking, he says with some emphasis that
communications and the dissemination of information will be
&quot;front and center&quot; of his personal agenda. And that
applies not only to spreading the word about the industry's role
in research, but also to &quot;the industry's ability to
disseminate information about its products, so that consumers and
doctors and everyone who is involved in the process of getting
drugs from the manufacturer to the patient will be well
informed.&quot; To stress the importance he assigns to
communications issues, he mentions that he has just left a
meeting of the public policy section to hammer out policies
relating to industry's use of the Internet. </p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he reiterates, &quot;I don't think those
[promotion and communications] issues are on the back burner at
all. They are front and center in the PhRMA agenda.&quot; </p>

<p><b>The critical role of Congress<br>
</b>Which leads him to another of his top priorities: improving
PhRMA's and the pharmaceutical industry's standing with Congress,
so as to achieve the association's legislative objectives in
1997. He refers to his recent appointment of Barry Caldwell,
until recently Senator Arlen Specter's chief of staff, as the
organization's new vice president for Federal affairs. </p>

<p>&quot;Barry is very highly regarded by people who have worked
with him, both on and off Capitol Hill,&quot; Holmer says.
&quot;I think that's a very useful start for our legislative
efforts. In addition, I'll be spending a lot of time in the next
three months expanding my personal relationships with members of
Congress and their staff. I've already met with Senators Hatch,
Kennedy, Lott and Dashle, as well as Speaker Gingrich and Ways
and Means Committee chairman Archer. I see that as a tremendously
important part of my job.&quot; </p>

<p>At this point Holmer mentioned a consistent theme throughout
our discussion, one that he also brought up in reference to his
communications objectives: the need for a central focus and
direction for both his personal and the organizational efforts. </p>

<p>Foreseeing a &quot;proactive, high impact, advocacy and
policy-making process,&quot; he stresses that the essential
prerequisite for success is centrality of focus. &quot;You can
have a great Federal operation and a great State operation; a
great communications office; a great office to reach out to
allies &#151; but unless you know with clarity where it is you
want to go, you're never going to get there.&quot; </p>

<p>Which led the MM&amp;M interviewer to ask a possibly
embarrassing question. Given the diversification of PhRMA member
companies into different kinds of businesses and the growing role
of multinational companies with their multiple international
interests, was it perhaps naive to expect everyone to pull
together and settle on a single focus? Could they agree, for
instance, on whether ownership of a PBM (pharmacy benefit
company) by a PhRMA member was a good thing or a bad thing? </p>

<p>If perhaps it is naive to expect industry unity, it is
certainly (and deliberately) naive to expect the president of
PhRMA to answer such a question. But answer he did. </p>

<p>&quot;I'm still a rookie. I've been on the job just two
months. But from what I've seen so far, there is a remarkable
degree of unanimity &#151; no, unanimity is the wrong word &#151;
consistency among PhRMA members on the direction they want PhRMA
to go.&quot; </p>

<p>Then, quickly shifting to more comfortable ground, he
explained how he expected policy consistency to be achieved,
noting his appointment of Judith H. Bello as PhRMA's executive
vice president for policy and strategic affairs. This is a new
position he created as part of his revamping of the executive
staff. &quot;Judy is not only an outstanding lawyer &#151; she is
a superb thinker, writer, strategist, advocate, and
manager,&quot; he went on. &quot;Her work habits and productivity
are legendary and she knows how to put the ball across the goal
line. These qualities, coupled with her broad experience in and
out of government,&quot; &#151; in addition to practicing law she
has worked in the Commerce and State departments, and with Holmer
at the Office of the US Trade Representative &#151; &quot;and her
spectacular people skills, make her a perfect addition to the new
dynamic team we are building at PhRMA.&quot; </p>

<p>In an attempt to flatten the organizational structure, he
explained, only two divisions &#151; policy, planning, and member
relations, plus research and information services &#151; will
report to Bello, while all the others will report directly to
Holmer. Then, returning to his theme of focus, he added:
&quot;But she will also be involved in the operations of all the
other divisions to make sure that our efforts are fully
coordinated. The people in our State division need to know what's
happening internationally, and vice versa. We want to make sure
that all our efforts are thoroughly coordinated, and that will be
an important part of Judy's job.&quot; </p>

<p>When Karen Williams, who now heads the National Pharmaceutical
Council, left PhRMA, the policy office she directed was divided
into the two divisions that &#151; while remaining separate units
&#151; will now be brought back together under Bello's direction.
&quot;Judy will provide energy and direction for our
policy-making operation,&quot; he said, summing up her functions,
&quot;and she will also serve as my surrogate when I'm out of the
office.&quot; </p>

<p><b>First-year goals<br>
</b>To sum up, we asked Alan Holmer what he hopes to achieve in
his first year in office. Beginning by giving his predecessor,
Gerald Mossinghoff, credit for his many accomplishments, Holmer
mentioned that one of his primary goals &#151; making sure that
PhRMA will be more focused on advocacy and communications &#151;
is a process begun under Mossinghoff. Then he referred back to
his first two appointments, in the areas of congressional
relations and policy and strategic planning, as indications of
where his primary concerns lie. Other goals he listed (and in
some case reiterated) included: <br>
<i>Renewal of the user fee act.<br>
FDA reform.<br>
International harmonization of the new drug approval process</i>
&#151; which he sees as a key to getting prescription drugs to
market faster not only in other countries but here at home as
well. </p>

<p>&quot;We have to make sure that in every market we can get
safe drugs to patients more quickly.&quot; </p>

<p><i>Adequate international property protection. </i>Finally<i>,
to the extent possible, to make sure that prescription drugs can
be sold in a free market environment both in the US and around
the world.</i> </p>

<p>Since he mentioned FDA reform, we asked whether he agreed with
the FDA critics who maintain that speeding up the new drug
approval process called for a radical change in the agency's
powers by privatizing NDA reviews. Characteristically, he didn't
flinch or take refuge in PhRMA policy statements, but offered a
forthright personal opinion. &quot;If the FDA were to want to
augment its resources by utilizing outside experts, it ought to
have that option,&quot; he replied. &quot;But FDA should be in
control of whether or not they did that...should be in control of
who would be selected... and should be in control of whether they
accepted or rejected the recommendations of the private entity.
In short, the use of outside reviewers should be at the FDA's
discretion at the start, in the middle, and at the end.&quot; </p>

<p>Most interviews end with mutual thank-yous and
&quot;decompression&quot; chit chat, but Holmer in these closing
minutes came up with one final &#151; and revealing &#151;
surprise. What was his primary impression after two months in
office, he was asked. Was the job even tougher than he expected? </p>

<p>No, it was pretty much what he had anticipated. &quot;It's
been a lot of fun.&quot; </p>

<p>Being president of PhRMA is fun? It was not the answer we
think many of his predecessors would have given. It reminded us
that he had not balked when asked initially what changes in
policy, tactics, and organization he thought necessary,
implicitly accepting the premise that change was indeed called
for. His willingness to answer even tough questions - and his
closing reference to fun - may well be signs that the windows are
opening at the PhRMA offices, and that the winds of change are
blowing through. <br>

<p><b>Meet Alan Holmer</b> <br>
At the time he was picked by the PhRMA board to head the
organization, attorney Alan Homer, at 46, was no stranger to the
association, having served as its outside trade counsel for the
previous six years. At the time he was head of international
trade practice in the Washington office of Sidley &amp; Austin. </p>

<p>He had served as deputy US Trade Representative in the Reagan
administration; part of that job was giving frequent testimony
before congressional committees. His responsibilities also
included representing his office before the cabinet-level
economic policy council and serving as liaison with governors and
State legislators in the White House. </p>

<p>Holmer learned the congressional ropes as a staff aid to
Senator Bob Packwood during the 1970s. </p>

<p>As he told his HMC Council audience, as the father of two
children with cystic fibrosis, he has a deep personal stake in
the discovery and availability of new drugs.<br>

<h1 align="center">GET SET FOR THE NEXT <a name="#top">PHASE OF
ANTIBIOTIC</a> COMPETITION </h1>

<h3 align="center"><i>By Warren R. Ross<br>
</i></h3>

<hr>

<h3 align="center">Executive summary:</h3>

<p><i>A number of pharmaceutical manufacturers are working hard
on antiinfective research to meet the serious challenge of
resistant pathogens. What may prove more resistant is making a
profit on any new drug - widespread use risks bacterial
resistance; limited use restricts investment return. The ideal: a
wide-spectrum, bacterially invincible agent.<br>
</i></p>

<hr>

<p><i>The 'superbug' scourge that's coming your way.&quot;</i> </p>

<p>That's a headline you'd expect to see in a supermarket tabloid
or, perhaps, on an ad for a sci-fi movie. In fact, it recently
appeared in the dignified pages of <i>Postgraduate Medicine</i>.
As the executive summary explained: &quot;&#133; pathogens
resistant to vancomycin are wreaking havoc in medical centers
throughout the nation.&quot; </p>

<p>Sharing this alarm is the World Health Organization, which in
its 1996 annual report says: &quot;We are standing on the brink
of a global crisis in infectious diseases. No country is safe
from them. No country can any longer afford to ignore their
threat.&quot; Added WHO Director-General Hiroshi Nakajima:
&quot;The optimism of a relatively few years ago that many of
these [infectious] diseases could be brought under control has
led to a fatal complacency. This complacency is now costing
millions of lives.&quot; In the U.S. alone, drug-resistant
infections caused some 10,000 deaths in 1993, prompting the White
House to adopt a policy, initiated by the National Science and
Technology Council (NSCT), called <i>Infectious Disease - A
Global Health Threat.</i> </p>

<p><b>A tale of two races<br>
</b>The NSCT report acknowledges the indispensable role of the
pharmaceutical industry in developing successive generations of
antiinfective agents &#133; a story of leapfrog move and
countermove, pitting industry scientists against the pathogens.
It started only a few months after the introduction of penicillin
in the 1940s with reports that some staphylococcus infections
were no longer responding to the universally hailed &quot;wonder
drug,&quot; and it turned out that some strains of S. <i>aureus</i>
had developed the ability to produce penicillinase, an enzyme
that destroys penicillin. </p>

<p>After an initial scare, everyone relaxed as industry
scientists developed semisynthetic penicillins which protected
the beta-lactam rings of the drugs &#151; the part of penicillin
that is attacked by penicillinase. In summarizing what happened
next, it is hard not to become anthropomorphic and to describe
the bacteria as &quot;outthinking&quot; the scientists. For
instance, a history prepared by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, one of
the current leaders in research seeking to overcome antibiotic
resistance, talks of S. <i>aureus</i> as &quot;not to be
outdone&quot; and &quot;fighting back.&quot; Even so sober a
scientist as Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg writes in a <i>JAMA</i>
editorial: &quot;But many microbes have learned their own tricks
of jamming or coming in under the radar scan&quot; of the immune
system, and concludes: &quot;Pitted against microbial genes, we
have mainly our wits.&quot; </p>

<p>Which is a chastening thought since, at the moment, the bugs
are ahead. More than 95 percent of S. <i>aureus</i> strains are
now resistant not only to all the commercially available
penicillins, but to the cephalosporins as well. Nor are
staphylococci the only survivors; streptococci have proved
equally adaptable. </p>

<p><b>The resurgence of R&amp;D<br>
</b>Thus, for the past half century, the ability of pathogens to
mutate and adapt has presented manufacturers with both challenge
and opportunity. The challenge, of course, was to stay a step
ahead of the bugs and bring to market new antibiotics that were
still effective. The opportunity was exactly the same: the
commercial rewards for the successive launches of the
cephalosporins, the tetracyclines, the macrolides, and
aminoglycoside/trimethoprim combinations. Today some 160
antibiotics are sold in the United States &#151; but some
bacterial strains have evolved resistance to every one of them.
The industry's mistake, in retrospect, was that it followed what
pharmaceutical stock analyst Viren Mehta calls a
&quot;boilerplate mind-set,&quot; focusing on modest improvements
instead of seeking new technologies. An even more basic problem
was that the intensity of the competition began to diminish the
profit potential of new agents, driving down prices and cutting
an admittedly huge pie into ever smaller slices, so that
antibiotic research took a back seat to more lucrative fields,
such as cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. What we
experienced, says Dr. Lederberg in his editorial, was a
&quot;market failure marring the industry's spectacular
history&quot; of antibiotic innovation. As Pharmacia &amp;
Upjohn's Charles Ford has acknowledged: &quot;People have been
wondering where we've been.&quot; </p>

<p>As a result, says Fred Tenover of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, &quot;For some infections, we are very
close to the end of the road. The worst-case scenario is almost
here. We are very, very close to having bacteria resistant to
every significant antibiotic ever developed.&quot; </p>

<p>Very close, but not quite there. The saving grace is that one
antibiotic &#151; vancomycin &#151; has proved remarkably
resistant to resistance. Discovered in 1956 and sold under such
brand names as Lymphomed, Vancocin, and Vancoled, it was
initially used sparingly because of nephrotoxocity, but this is
changing as other antiinfective agents are becoming increasingly
less useful. And therein lies the danger. Vancomycin-resistant
enterococcus organisms have already emerged; if the
vancomycin-resistant gene were to migrate to such more common and
more virulent bacteria as S. <i>aureus,</i> Dr. Renover's
doomsday scenario might well come true &#151; unless industry's
renewed interest in antiinfective research bears results first. </p>

<p><b>RP-R in the lead<br>
</b>Fortunately, Rhône-Poulenc Rorer, SmithKline Beecham,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Pfizer, Ortho-McNeil, Wyeth-Ayerst, Eli
Lilly, and Abbott among others, not to mention a generous
assortment of biotech companies, are working hard to do just
that. They are racing not only to &quot;out think&quot; the bugs,
but to beat each other to the market with a new generation of
antiinfective agents with mechanisms of action sufficiently novel
to avoid the problem of bacterial resistance. </p>

<p>Currently in the lead is Rhône-Poulenc Rorer with Synercid
(quinupristin/dalfopristin), the first of a distinct class of
antibiotics known as streptogramins. It is one of only two
new-generation agents now in Phase III, and the only systemic.
The other is Magainin's MSI-78, a topical agent for diabetic foot
ulcers. </p>

<p>&quot;Early clinical experience with Synercid is very
encouraging, especially for physicians who must treat deadly
infections that defy every other available antibiotic,&quot;
according to Robert C. Moellering, Jr., M.D., a leading
infectious disease specialist. As evidence, Dr. Moellering, who
is chief of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital
in&nbsp;Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, cites a
study of 115 patients with various types of vancomycin-resistant
infections, plus such complicating conditions as
immunosuppression and prior surgery. &quot;Evaluable patients
treated with Synercid for more than five days showed a favorable
response rate of 67 percent,&quot; according to this study. In
addition, Synercid was reported to be the only agent effective in
10 out of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by
methicillin-resistant staph. </p>

<p>RP-R reports that Synercid is already saving lives &#151; that
to date 690 patients with severe Gram-positive infections who
could not be treated with standard therapies have received the
drug through an FDA-approved emergency use protocol. But there is
a downside to such compassionate use. As Dr. Moellerig points
out, &quot;Because emergency-use programs are not controlled
clinical trials, it is difficult to fully evaluate and measure
the 'Synercid effect.'&quot; Nonetheless, &quot;results from
several international multicenter clinical trials nearing
completion will help clarify Synercid's role in treating severe
infections.&quot; In sum, he is convinced it works, but that it's
not a panacea. </p>

<p>So far, only parenteral Synercid is in Phase III, but Phase II
studies of an oral version are nearing completion. It is the
company's hope that a new drug application for the injectable
will be ready for submission by this December, and that the FDA
will give it a fast-track review so that it may be ready for
launch as early as the third quarter of 1997. </p>

<p>Reflecting RP-R's confidence in this ambitious schedule, it
has already begun a pre-marketing educational program to provide
the medical community with Syncercid information. For instance,
RP-R helped to underwrite a session of the National Managed
Health Care Congress held in Newport, R.I., this summer, at which
Philippe Prokocimer, M.D., the company's group director for
clinical research of antiinfectives, gave a presentation on
&quot;Therapeutic Advances in Infectious Disease.&quot; </p>

<p>An obvious question raised by doctors who are briefed on
Synercid is: what makes the experts think that the infectious
organisms won't outwit this product, too? In reply, Professor
Carlo Cocito, of the University of Louvain in Belgium, points out
that the Synercid combination of two types of streptogramins is
not only 100 times more powerful than either agent alone, but
greatly reduces the potential for resistance, since bacteria
would have to develop defenses against not one agent but two.
Furthermore, while most antibiotics transiently inhibit protein
synthesis, permitting the emergence of mutants, the streptogramin
combination is bactericidal. </p>

<p>Is this optimism justified? We were unable to reach a
spokesperson for the bugs. </p>

<p><b>Other contenders<br>
</b>&quot;At least now there's hope,&quot; says Pabhvathi
Fernandes, head of Bristol-Myers Squibb's drug screening program.
&quot;Things have come quite a ways from where they were two or
three years ago, when there was very little in the
pipeline.&quot; Outside observers agree. Says Alexander Tomasz,
head of the microbiology laboratory at Rockefeller University in
New York, &quot;The pharmaceutical industry is waking up.&quot;
And to quote a <i>Business Week</i> headline: &quot;A race to
squash the superbugs: Drugmaker's finally go after the lethal new
microbes.&quot; Now that they no longer think of infectious
diseases as yesterday's problem and that research priority should
be given to chronic diseases, pharmaceutical manufacturers are
pursuing a variety of approaches. </p>

<p>In the editorial opinion of <i>Science</i>, a highly respected
and unbiased observer, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn's new compounds,
the oxazolidinones, are &quot;among the most auspicious of the
new contenders.&quot; Discovered but abandoned in the 1980s
because of animal toxicity, these compounds have chemical
structures so different from previous antibiotics that &quot;the
hope is that because bacteria haven't yet come across this type
of antibiotic, drug resistance won't come ready-made,&quot;
Stuart Levy of Tufts University School of Medicine explains. The
challenge for P&amp;U researchers has been to synthesize variants
of the original drugs that retain their therapeutic activity but
not their toxicity. The good news from Kalamazoo is that the
latest data show that two compounds seem to fit the bill. </p>

<p>&quot;If clinical trials confirm the potential of these
compounds,&quot; Ronald Jones, M.D., professor of pathology at
the University of Iowa College of Medicine, told his colleagues
at the 1995 ICAAC meeting &#151; the annual gathering of
infectious disease specialists and investigators &#151;
&quot;physicians will have important new weapons to use against a
broad range of community- and hospital-acquired infections &#151;
including infections that have become resistant to many or all of
the antibiotics now available.&quot; </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Hoechst Marion Roussel is investigating the
ketolides; Abbott is searching for &quot;son of Biaxin&quot;
compounds; Schering-Plough is concentrating on broad-spectrum
antifungals; and other, equally intensive efforts are being
undertaken at Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glaxo Wellcome, Ortho-McNeil,
SmithKline Beecham, Eli Lilly, and others. </p>

<p><b>Therapeutic alliances<br>
</b>Pfizer, a pioneer in antibiotic research since the
introduction of penicillin, is one of several companies betting
heavily on biotechnology with a two-pronged effort: both
ambitious in-house programs and collaboration with start-up
biotech companies. Earlier this year, Pfizer announced that it
had entered into a major partnership with Microcide
Pharmaceuticals of Mountain View, California. Acknowledging that
the incremental improvements through chemical modification of
existing antiobiotic classes no longer suffices, George M. Milne,
Ph.D., president of Pfizer Central Research says: &quot;We are
committed to the discovery and understanding of novel genes
essential to bacterial survival as the route to new critically
needed antibacterial drugs.&quot; </p>

<p>Microcide president Jim Rurka also expresses confidence that
their joint efforts will result in major new classes of
antibacterial drugs: &quot;We believe this collection [of skills]
will provide a powerful and renewable resource for drug
discovery, and a significant competitive advantage in the
antibiotic marketplace.&quot; </p>

<p>Microcide was founded specifically to focus on antibiotic
discovery and development technology. Its strategy is to use
novel screening targets and multiple gene targets in one screen,
and thus to gain biologically relevant information on hits and
leads more quickly and inexpensively than is possible with
traditional techniques. Its success in this pursuit is
demonstrated by the fact that in addition to Pfizer, Ortho-McNeil
and Daiichi have signed up for multiyear partnerships. </p>

<p>It's an expensive search for all concerned. Pfizer alone is
reported to be paying $6 million up-front, plus $4.2 million per
year for five years, with potential payments at various research
milestones that could total up to $32.5 million more. In return,
Pfizer will obtain marketing rights to Microcide products that
crack the genomes that enable bacteria to survive antibiotic
attacks. </p>

<p>And just as Microcide has other partners, so Pfizer has made
similar arrangements with Myco Pharmaceuticals and Cubist
Pharmaceuticals. Similarly, Abbott has formed an alliance with
Magainin, while Ortho-McNeil, in addition to its Microcide deal,
has also teamed up with Magainin among others. Obviously,
polygamy &#151; or at least multiple engagements - are in
fashion, and the incentive is clear. An analyst at UBS Securities
has estimated that the first Magainin product alone could achieve
$200 million in sales, and Pfizer has estimated the market
created by bacterial resistance at $23 billion worldwide. </p>

<p><b>Some go it alone</b> <br>
Meanwhile, other biotech companies are plugging away on their
own. Kenneth Kelley, president of Intrabiotics, reports that his
company is concentrating on the protegrins, &quot;a new
generation of antimicrobials that will define a new class.&quot;
The Xoma Corporation, meanwhile, is studying BPI, a peptide that
can enhance the effectiveness of conventional antibi-otics, while
Intrabiotics is searching for peptides with intrinsic
antibacterial activity, and Ribogene is targeting mechanisms in
the protein synthesis process. </p>

<p>The reason why there is so much enthusiasm for biotech
research isn't hard to find. As Scott Rocklage, Cubist's chief
executive officer, recently told a New York Times reporter:
&quot;The problem with slight tuning of the old drugs is they
still attack the same molecular targets; the bugs know how to
deal with that. We're saying, let's work outside those molecular
targets altogether, and find areas where the bugs haven't
developed resistance yet, but which are essential to the function
of the cell. There are plenty of these out there, but it takes a
lot of molecular biology to find them.&quot; </p>

<p>Which explains why a lot of molecular biologists are hot on
the trail &#151; backed by the money of both hopeful
entrepreneurs and of old-line, deep-pocket drug companies.
Whoever the winner of the race turns out to be, we can take
comfort in the fact that all of us who might one day fall victim
to an antibiotic-resistant infection or to one of the exotic,
hitherto unknown infections that are constantly making headlines,
will also be winners. </p>

<p><b>Stumbling blocks to profits<br>
</b>But while scientific success seems fairly certain if only
because of the intensity of the competition, commercial success
is more problematic. This is the dilemma: the broader the
spectrum of any new agent, the greater the commercial potential,
which is another way of saying that the more widely it will be
used. But the wider the use, the greater the risk of emerging
bacterial resistance, hence of clinical obsolescence. Good
science &#151; and possibly good marketing &#151; therefore seem
to dictate that the new antibiotics be used sparingly for limited
indications, but that will make it harder to win back the R&amp;D
investment. A widely accepted estimate of the sales potential of
an agent that successfully treats multi-drug resistant infections
is $1 billion-plus, while the potential of a drug effective
against only a single organism or held in reserve for resistant
infections might total no more than $60 to 100 million. Which is
nice for a start-up company, but less attractive for a
pharmaceutical giant, especially if it has to split the take with
a biotech partner. </p>

<p>How likely is such sales limitation? When FDA recently
approved HMR's Rifadin, the package insert said: &quot;Rifampin
should not be used indiscriminately &#133; so that [its]
usefulness &#133; in the treatment of asymptomatic meningococcal
carriers is preserved.&quot; And members of FDA's Anti-Infective
Drugs Advisory Committee at their July 25 meeting, while urging
the agency to consider accelerated review for new agents, also
cautioned against their overuse. At the same meeting, Alexander
Rakowsky, M.D., an FDA medical officer, gave a clue to the
agency's thinking by asking the panel: &quot;How should
advertising be restricted so as to delay the development of
resistance?&quot; When Pfizer researcher Scott Hopkins, M.D.
argued against restrictive labeling, FDA's David Feigal, M.D.
asked: &quot;Is it &#133; your contention that companies'
promotional activities have no influence on the practice of
medicine?&quot; So while everyone is looking to the drug industry
to save us from resistant pathogens, the industry may also be
setting itself up for another public relations debacle, being
criticized for its &quot;greed&quot; not only in pricing these
agents adequately to recoup the R&amp;D investment, but also for
encouraging overprescribing. </p>

<p>Unless, of course, someone comes up with the panacea: an agent
with a wide spectrum that proves invincible to all bacterial
strategies for developing resistance. That will be the occasion
for everyone - scientists, marketers, investors, public health
officials, and especially doctors and patients - to break out the
champagne. Meanwhile, a conditional toast to industry scientists
and management for rising to the challenge. </p>

<h3 align="center">Executive Summary: </h3>

<p align="center"><i>The winners in this year's competition were
culled from a record number of entries from more than 30
countries from around the world.<br>
</i></p>

<hr>

<p><font size="5"><strong>N</strong></font>ineteen-ninety-six was
the third year for The Global Awards competition, honoring the
best in healthcare communications worldwide. Reflecting a growing
worldwide interest in healthcare advertising, a record number of
entries were received from 31 countries around the world. In
keeping with, and building on, the international theme of The
Globals, preliminary judging sessions were organized by The New
York Festivals in seven international locations and accomplished
by panels consisting of senior healthcare marketing professionals
in Australia, Canada, England, Germany, Italy, Spain and the
United States.<p>
Globals are awarded in three umbrella categories: communication,
craftsmanship, and social commitment. Within each of these three
groupings are two sub categories, healthcare products and
services targeted to the healthcare professional, and those
targeted to the consumer. A cornucopia of print, promotion, video
and educational film as well as packaging, direct mail pieces and
many other media were entered in the near 90 different
categories.</p>

<p>Of the more than 1,000 entries submitted, 245 finalists were
selected from which four Grand Global or &quot;best of show&quot;
trophies and 24 Global Award &quot;best of category&quot;
trophies emerged. The Grand Globals were selected from the
highest scoring entries by a group of board members and their
designees, who convened in New York City on September 10, 1996.
In addition to chairman Lester Barnett, Executive Vice President/
Executive Creative Director of FCB Healthcare, the distinguished
judges included: William Castagnoli, Contributing Editor, Medical
Marketing &amp; Media (formerly with Medicus); Steve Frederick,
Senior Vice President, Creative Director, Girgenti, Hughes,
Butler &amp; McDowell; Myrtle Johnson, Creative Director,
CIBA-GEIGY; Stephen King, Chief Creative Officer, Blackwell
Healthcare Worldwide; Joe Paumi, Executive Vice
President/Creative Director, Sudler &amp; Hennessey (NY); Martin
Ross, Executive Vice President, Dugan/Farley Communications; and
Stephen Weinstein, Senior Vice President/Creative Director, Bates
Healthcom. Gerald Goldberg, President of The New York Festivals,
sponsor of The Globals, adjudicated.</p>

<p>Two Grand Globals were awarded in the Best Communication
category. The Grand Global for Best Communication to the
Healthcare Professional went to Antwerpes &amp; Partner GmbH of
Koeln, Germany, for &quot;Nimotop.&quot; This passionate print
campaign features three spreads which re-affirm man's basic right
to fulfill himself to his highest potential and that age need not
be a factor in deterring these processes. The message to doctors
to protect and improve their patients' mental efficiency with
Nimotop is reinforced by eliciting the stark realities of senile
dementia through the use of poignant, black and white
photography.</p>

<p>Taking top honors for the second time with a Grand Global for
Best Communication to the Consumer is Cossette
Communications-Marketing of Montreal for their three-part radio
series entitled &quot;Mrs. White/Cindy/Little Red Mini
Skirt.&quot; The 60-second spots humorously inject modern day
health problems such as hay fever and common cold symptoms on
characters from famous children's fairy tales (such as the Seven
Dwarfs/Sneezy and Cinderella) who have been re-adapted to today's
world. These true-to-life radio fables cleverly promote Claritin,
a hay fever relief product by Schering Canada, through the
parallel use of the happy ending. Cossette Communications also
received a Grand Global in 1994 for a multimedia entry also for
Schering's Claritin.</p>

<p>In the Craftsmanship category, The Grand Global was awarded to
Medicus Intercon Canada of Toronto in Best Art Direction for its
&quot;Tales of Contraception&quot; brochure, a fascinating
photographic collection which chronicles the evolution of
contraceptive devices produced for Ortho Pharmaceutical Canada.
This brilliant paper museum showcasing the various ancient and
contemporary means to control conception also took a Global for
Best Photography.</p>

<p>In the Social Commitment category with nearly a perfect score,
Bates Benjamin of Oslo, Norway takes the Grand Global for its
moving and graphically demonstrative public service television
commercial warning consumers of the dangers of second hand smoke,
produced for the Ministry of Health. In the 30-second spot, two
single diners are seated juxtaposed in a restaurant, content and
obviously delighted with their meals until one fellow
&quot;lights up a cigarette.&quot; As the offender puffs away
generating smoke throughout the restaurant, the non-smoker
watches with dismay, forced to inhale the second-hand smoke,
until he unexpectedly discovers he is exhaling the smoke as well.</p>

<p>In addition to the four Grand Globals, 24 Globals were
awarded. Aside from Medicus Intercon Canada, McCann Erickson
Manchester (U.K.) was also a multiple winner with two Globals
both in the Communication Category: 1) &quot;Heaven Can
Wait,&quot; a print ad for Zocor, a cholesterol reducer by Merck
Sharp &amp; Dohme, Hoddesdon; and 2) for
&quot;Fascinating/Priority Delivery Mailing/Preservex Detail
Aid,&quot; a mixed media campaign for Preservex Arthritis
treatment by Bristol Myers Squibb. Of the 28 Grand Global and
Global Awards awarded to the highest scoring submissions in each
of the competition's main categories, the United States received
the largest number with 12 Globals followed by the United Kingdom
with six, Canada with four, Germany with three, and Norway,
Sweden and Austria with one apiece.</p>

with complete creative credits follows on the next pages. A list
of Finalists is also included (see pages 86-94, 1996 Global Award
Finalists.) </p>

<p>While only three years old, the quality and quantity of
response to the 1996 Globals Award competition reflect a high
worldwide standard of performance in healthcare communication.</p>

<H4>About the AMP</H4>

AMP publications provide a continuous communication link that keeps<BR>
physicians informed about all aspects of medicine and practice while providing<BR>
marketers with the most cost-effective and flexible promotional vehicle.<BR>
We are dedicated to helping publishers better serve readers and advertisers.<P>

The members of AMP share a commitment to editorial integrity, professional<BR>
sales standards and the promotional value of medical advertising. 

<H4>Advertising Award Winner</H4>

Aviva Belsky, <I>Diversion, </I>was named Advertising Sales Representative<BR>
of the Year at the 4th annual Award luncheon, April 23rd. A panel of<BR>
industry judges determined this year's winner from ballots mailed to media<BR>
decision makers. Whenever outstanding professionals in any field are honored,<BR>
the standards for excellence in that field are raised. The ultimate winner is the<BR>
entire advertising community. Keynote speaker at the event was Carrie<BR>
Smith-Cox, Vice President, Women's Health, of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories.


<H4>New journal advertising research study begins </H4>

There are many studies (both published and proprietary) which support journal<BR>
advertising's impact on physician prescribing. A new study — now in the field —<BR>
will measure how physicians respond with their personal time and dollars.<BR>
The Association of Healthcare Media Directors (AHMD) and AMP are testing a<BR>
<I>pro bono</I> campaign for Doctors of the World. Cline Davis & Mann created<BR>
a four-color spread ad, which Beta Research pre-tested. The media schedule<BR>
was designed by AHMD with the same reach and frequency objectives<BR>
as a new pharmaceutical campaign. The ad space (valued at $1.4 million)<BR>
was donated by publishers. The results of the study will be presented at<BR>
the September 19th meeting.

<b>Summary:</b> GTFH's proprietary approach to market conditioning accelerates product acceptance and uptake. This market conditioning approach for the Rx-to-OTC switch of Pepcid AC enabled product to achieve unprecedented sales in a category that expanded by over 40% in 6 months. Pepcid AC dominates physician and pharmacist recommendations for OTC H<font size=-2>2</font>s. At key leverage points along the market continuum, GTFH helps clients gain "data advantage" by packaging the scientific evidence with economic measures of clinical effectiveness; maximize reach and impact of messages to the opinion leaders who are key to product success; build alliances with powerful patient and consumer advocacy coalitions; demonstrate value/maximize patient compliance for managed care/ reimbursement audiences; and address constituent demands and political agendas of government representatives.<P>

You have new customers and new objectives (and<br>
maybe even new corporate ownership). Ad pages<br>
are down; profits are up. So who needs advertising?<br>
A brand identity won't help in a managed formulary.<br>
Or will it?<br><br>

Think about it. If you don't create an identity<br>
for your product, you make it more generic. And<br>
even though managed care companies like to<br>
negotiate with generics, they love brands. Why?<br>
Because brands are important to their most<br>
important constituents: the patients and doctors<br>
in their networks.<br><br>

As out of fashion as it seems, you still what<br>
only great advertising can deliver: a brand identity.<br>
If your agency has stopped talking to you about it,<br>
maybe you ought to talk to us.<br><br>

Call Ron Pantello or Maureen Regan.

The New York office reported a 45 percent increase in income from 1993 versus 1996, primarily due to the growth of the existing Tier I client base.

<b>Summary:</b> ENA had its best year ever in 1995. We became agency of record for two new companies (Micro Medical Devices and NuWay Corporation), took on major projects with new clients (First Option and Ortho Biotech), and launched a new product for Roberts. Business grew 47 percent from 1994. ENA is continuing 1995’s momentum into 1996. We’re expanding our multi-language services with Pfizer, tapping the Internet with Micro Medical Devices, reaching out to HMO members with First Option, and gearing up for major direct mail projects with Roberts and the launch of a new consumer hygiene product with NuWay. Thus far in 1996, business is up 10 percent.<P>

<b>Misc: </b> To obtain more information regarding our growing agency and examples of our award-winning work, contact Ned Newland via phone, fax or e-mail. He’ll be happy to discuss your current marketing needs or explore possible strategic alliances with our agency.<p>
